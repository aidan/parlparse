<a name="20919w01.html_para3">Thames Valley Police Fingerprint Bureau has a target that fingerprint evidence should be processed within 14 days. For 2001, the 14 day target started from the point where the request to process the evidence is received by the Fingerprint Bureau. In 2002 the 14-day target starts from the point when the request has been allocated to a fingerprint expert within the Bureau. Thames Valley Police have only compiled statistics on the time taken to process fingerprint evidence for the last two years, their figures are:

 <i>[holding answer 24 July 2002]:</i> Incitement to commit a particular offence, for example of child abuse or of a child pornography offence, whether on a website or otherwise, can be dealt with under existing law. The Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) provides a focal point for reporting material which appears to be illegal. They assess the material and refer any they agree appears illegal to the police for investigation and the Internet Service Provider (ISP) hosting the material, in order that the ISP can close off access to the offending material. Where the material is produced or hosted outside the United Kingdom, arrangements exist for notifying the relevant law enforcement agency and ISP.
<P>

<a name="20919w02.html_para0">The IWF has also recently developed a policy on recommending ISPs to take down newsgroups that regularly contain, or whose names seem to advertise child pornography. We welcome this development and we will continue to monitor the position.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20919w02.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Win Griffiths: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department (1) what the population of the potential client group for each local authority with youth offending teams has been; how many offences have been recorded since the youth offending teams were set up; what the pro rata offence figures are; what the general, referral and drugs order funding was for 2002&#150;03; and what the pro rata funding allocation for each offender was in that year;  [72325]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20919w02.html_wqn2"><B>  </B> 
(2) if he will publish the criteria for the way in which deprivation indices were calculated as part of the formula for funding youth offending teams in England and Wales, indicating differences in calculations made for youth offending teams in <i>(a)</i> England and <i>(b)</i> Wales.  [72334]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20919w02.html_spnew1"><B> Hilary Benn </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 24 July 2002]:</i> The Youth Justice Board's (YJB) funding is for Youth Offending Teams (Yots) not individual offenders. The payments for general, referral order and drugs work in 2002&#150;03 took into account levels of deprivation (covering employment, income, average of ward scores, ward ranks, extent of deprivation and the local concentration of deprivation) the size of the 10&#150;17 population within each Yot area and its geographical size. The deprivation indices were supplied by the Department for Transport, Local Government and the Regions and are used as standard across Government. The formula was approved by the Home Office and the National Assembly for Wales.

<a name="20919w02.html_para2">A copy of the Youth Justice Board's outcome decision document has been placed in the Library. The annexes show the size of the 10&#150;17 population and the individual grants allocations. The YJB's data covers convictions not offences.
<P>

<a name="20919w02.html_para3">For Welsh Yots, the Barnett formula was applied initially to arrive at the overall grant allocation for Wales. Individual allocations were then calculated by applying the YJB's funding formula.

<a name="20919w02.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Win Griffiths: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will meet representatives of the Welsh Assembly Government, local authorities with youth offending teams in England and Wales, and the relevant, police, probation and health service bodies, to develop common criteria for assessing <i>(a)</i> funding needs and <i>(b)</i> the contribution of each partner to the work of the youth offending teams.  [72335]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20919w02.html_spnew2"><B> Hilary Benn </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 24 July 2002]:</i> The Youth Justice Board issue grants to Youth Offending Teams on the basis of a common funding formula. They first consult Youth Offending Teams (Yots), their statutory partners (including Local Authority Chief Executives) the Home Office and the National Assembly for Wales. But they recognise that the contributions of local statutory partners vary, and plan to put proposals to Ministers on how best to tackle this. There are no plans for such a meeting at present.

 <i>[holding answer 24 July 2002]:</i> The Youth Justice Board for England and Wales (YJB) is responsible for commissioning and purchasing juvenile offender secure accommodation from the Prison Service, private sector secure training centres (STC) and local authority secure children's homes, and for setting and monitoring standards.
<P>

<a name="20919w03.html_para0">This year 32 additional places have been opened at Rainsbrook Secure Training Centre and 32 more are due to open at Medway. The STC contracts require trainee personal medical records to be kept to support medical care and investigations, to inform contractors' annual reports and to facilitate any reports needed by courts. The STCs use information technology to maintain these records.

 Centrally the Home Office does not collect or collate statistics on mobile phone robberies or thefts. Individual police forces do not all routinely collect such figures either, however some do for their own purposes.
<P>

<a name="20919w03.html_para1">Home Office Research Study 235, deposited in the Library, dealt with mobile phone theft and robbery. Information was collected from six police forces on the number of thefts and robberies involving mobile phones for the period 1998&#150;99 to 2000&#150;01. Five of these forces are participating in the street crime initiative covering the 10 forces where the robbery problem is most acute. The proportion of robberies involving the theft of a mobile phone in these force areas is set out in the table.

 The final key performance indicator (KPI) results achieved by each prison are given in the table, a copy of which has been placed in the Library. The cost per uncrowded prison place KPI is formulated at overall Prison Service level. The costs in the table are establishment costs only, which exclude Headquarters overheads and the figures are not therefore comparable with the Prison Service cost per place KPI. Costs for private prisons include an element of capital repayment and are not comparable with the public sector. Staff in private prisons are excluded from the Prison Service staff sickness KPI.

 I regret that the information requested is not available. We aim to decide 70 per cent. of all new general immigration applications on initial consideration within three weeks. At present such applications are taking on average around four weeks to decide but we are working to reduce this to three weeks as soon as possible. Applications that cannot be decided on initial consideration are allocated to a case management unit for further consideration. Some of these applications are, at present, taking up to 12 months to consider due to the large number of cases currently in the system. It is not possible to identify applications from addresses in Beckenham without scrutiny of individual case files at disproportionate cost.

<a name="20919w04.html_para2">A Code of Practice sets out the obligations of all those involved. The recruitment of workers is the responsibility of the operators. Operators must ensure that farmers provide suitable accommodation and access to recreational activities, such as the opportunity to learn English. Operators are also responsible for ensuring that farmers adhere to minimum pay regulations set out by the Agricultural Wages Board. The Board cannot set a minimum rate that is below the National Minimum Wage. Operators may withdraw workers mid-season and exclude farmers from the scheme if they do not provide suitable pay and accommodation.

"Don't Discount Crime", a new user-friendly crime reduction guide for retailers became available in May 2002. This is being circulated among their members by retail trade organisations (including the British Retail Consortium), who were actively involved in deciding its content and design.

 No study has been undertaken to look specifically at the link between alcohol and drug related violent crime against retail staff. However, we are aware from the British Retail Consortium (BRC) ninth annual survey published this year of their concerns about the level of crime affecting retailers and the concerns they have that this is being driven by theft by drug and alcohol abusers. We are carrying out a commercial crime victimisation study of retail and manufacturing sectors later this year (the first for ten years). This will give a firm basis for identifying the main crime problems affecting business and give valuable indicators of the best ways to tackle these issues.

 On 19 July 2000, the Home Secretary announced that the Government had provided &#163;500 million to meet the costs of the new police radio system, "Airwave" (formerly Public Safety Radio Communications System, PSRCS).




<P>
<P><I>19 Sept 2002 : Column 21W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="20919w06.html_para0">Over the three years of the settlement, &#163;191 million of capital funding has been made available for forces to spend on costs associated with Airwave installation and preparation, for example the refitting of control rooms and vehicles. A further &#163;141 million in revenue funding has also been allocated for "one-off" preparation costs.
<P>

<a name="20919w06.html_para1">The Airwave programme consists of a phased national roll-out, determined by the forces and the main contractor in consultation with the Police Information Technology Organisation (PITO). The timetable for fund allocation is linked to this roll-out timetable. The capital allocation is released in advance, at an appropriate time, so that forces are ready for their roll-out date.
<P>

<a name="20919w06.html_para2">The service will replace existing radio systems with modern digital technology by 2005 in England and Wales extending to Scottish forces in 2006.
<P>

<a name="20919w06.html_para3">On 7 May, the Government announced that they would manage, support and fully fund a new national competition for the procurement of a national radiocommunications system for the fire service in England and Wales.

 The numbers of recorded crimes of assault on a constable for 2000&#150;01 and the percentage of these in each police force area, are given in the table.
<P>

<a name="20919w06.html_para4">Certain forces (including West Midlands) have moved to a more rigorous crime recording practice before or during 2000&#150;01, in which a larger proportion of crimes reported to them are recorded. This may be a factor, along with the relative sizes of each force, in explaining why some forces' figures are larger than others.

 Prior to the Trade and Industry Committee report on Mobile Phone Masts the Home Office had asked the National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB) to assess the health and safety aspects of the TETRA technology used by Airwave. The NRPB report concluded that it is unlikely that the unique features of TETRA pose a hazard to health. The Home Office has nonetheless set up a comprehensive research programme to ensure that any residual health and safety concerns that have been received by forces and users are addressed. This includes consultation with epidemiologists and with experts in occupational health.

&#151; It is estimated that 40&#150;50 per cent. of Disclosures are being issued within the three-week service standard for telephone applications (target 90 per cent. for Enhanced Disclosures). About 50 per cent. of both telephone and postal applications are being issued within five weeks.<P>

The Criminal Records Bureau reviews its service standards regularly and accepts that it is currently not meeting these service standards. The Criminal Records Bureau is not yet meeting service standards. To address this, it has introduced a performance improvement plan including: revised procedures, recruitment of additional staff, improved management arrangements and extending working hours; a data entry backlog had been outsourced to Hays Plc's Chennai (India) data processing centre. Special procedures have been introduced for the most urgent cases.<P>

The overall detection rates are not the best indicator of police performance because detection rates can be affected by a number of factors, including changes in the mix of crime types in a force area. Variations across the country remain worrying, however, and the Police Standards Unit is working with forces to address this.<P>

Numbers of detections rose across England and Wales by 2 per cent. in 2001&#150;02. There were rises in numbers of detections in all crime types except for fraud and forgery&#151;for example, numbers of detections for: burglary rose by 6 per cent.; robbery by 19 per cent. and violent crime by 3 per cent. Once the increase in numbers of crimes due to changes in police recording are taken into account, the detection rate in England and Wales appears stable. Detection rates in 11 forces improved, while a further eight forces showed no change in their detection rates.<P>

 During the review of the sentencing framework ("Making Punishments Work"&#151;July 2002), the team looked overseas to see how other jurisdictions had handled or dealt with the issues involved in sentencing reform. Of particular interest to the review, in contemplating possible changes to the framework in England and Wales, were those jurisdictions, which had examples of flexible sentences including differing forms of intermittent custody. An analysis of the review's findings is contained in Appendix 4 to the report.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20919w07.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 It is for the Secretary of State to determine the pay of police officers of all ranks in England and Wales. In doing so, he is required to take into account any recommendation made by the Police Negotiating Board (PNB), the statutory negotiating body, 



<P>
<P><I>19 Sept 2002 : Column 27W</I><P>
on which all the main police organisations are represented, including the Police Federation, which represents the interests of chief inspectors.
<P>

<a name="20919w07.html_para3">There is a national salary scale for chief inspectors. Currently, there are five points on the chief inspectors' scale, ranging from &#163;39,153 to &#163;42,309 outside London, and from &#163;40,761 to &#163;43,911 in London. Where individual chief inspectors are placed on that scale depends on a number of factors, including when they attained the rank of chief inspector, the length of time they have spent as chief inspectors and the length of time they spent in the rank of inspector.
<P>

<a name="20919w07.html_para4">Under a PNB Agreement reached on 9 May, and approved by the Secretary of State, changes to the pay scale of chief inspectors will be implemented from 1 April 2003. With effect from that date, there will be only three salary points for chief inspectors, one for chief inspectors who were in post on 31 August 1994, and two for all other chief inspectors. Chief inspectors who were in post on 31 August 1994 will receive &#163;42,711 outside London and &#163;44,313 in London. All other chief inspectors will start on &#163;40,362 (&#163;41,973 in London), the first point of the scale, and then progress to &#163;41,973 (&#163;42,780 in London). Once they have completed a year at the top of their scale, chief inspectors will be eligible for the new competence-related payment of &#163;1,002 a year.
<P>

<a name="20919w07.html_para5">Chief inspectors perform a range of duties and responsibilities, and while many of the activities are common, there will be different responsibilities for operational and detective officers. All officers in the rank of chief inspector are required to exhibit leadership and management qualities and to take on responsibility for community safety and local crime initiatives, which includes developing local crime and disorder strategies. Operations chief inspectors would be responsible for developing, implementing and monitoring local crime and disorder plans, for formulating contingency plans for major incidents, and for managing public order and major incidents. Detective Chief Inspectors would primarily be responsible for managing and advising on criminal investigations.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20919w08.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 All deaths in police custody are subject to a full police investigation. Where such a death occurs the police are required to refer the investigation to the Police Complaints Authority (PCA) for supervision. It is the responsibility of the PCA supervising member to approve the appointment of the Senior Investigating Officer (SIO), either from the force where the death occurred or from another force, and to agree the terms of reference for the SIO covering the parameters of the investigation. The PCA recently published their supervision manual which sets out the Authority's approach to supervision and the standards its supervising members will apply.
<P>

<a name="20919w08.html_para1">Under the Police Reform Bill the PCA will be replaced by a completely new body called the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC). The IPCC will be at the heart of a new police complaints system, the key objective of which will be to increase public confidence and trust in the way in which complaints against the police are dealt with. In order to achieve this the IPCC, which will be wholly independent of the police and which will have its own investigating teams, will be able to choose to investigate complaints itself. There will also be improved access to the complaints system for complainants, and significantly greater disclosure of information to complainants.
<P>

 Approximately 400 hectares of opium poppies are being grown in the United Kingdom, mostly in Hampshire, to provide some of the raw material required for the manufacture of medicines such as codeine and morphine.

<P>

<a name="20919w08.html_para3">This is the first time opium poppies have been grown commercially in this country for medicinal purposes, although smaller amounts have been grown traditionally for culinary use of the seeds and for dried flower arranging.

<a name="20919w08.html_para4">Cultivation of the opium poppy is not subject to the licensing requirements of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 but details are furnished to the International Narcotics Control Board under the estimating and statistical provisions of the United Nations Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, 1961. The process is being monitored by the Home Office Drugs Branch which has arranged for police to be informed of the growing sites.

 <i>[holding answer 10 July 2002]:</i> The comprehensive spending review undertaken in 1997&#150;98 produced 31 targets for the Home Office over the period April 1998&#150;March 2001.

 The National Refugee Integration Forum, which consists of representatives from Government departments, local authorities, the voluntary sector and refugees themselves, oversees the development of the overall integration strategy for refugees across the United Kingdom (UK). Access to employment is a key to enabling refugees to achieve their full potential in the UK. The Forum has established an Employment sub group to look specifically at the barriers to work that refugees face, and how these barriers can be removed.

 There is no single system for issuing passports to people who are British citizens under the British Overseas Territories Act 2002. Those who are resident in the United Kingdom may apply to the usual Passport Office for their region. Those resident in territories where British passport issuing facilities are available locally or through a convenient British diplomatic post may apply in the territory. As a temporary measure until alternative arrangements are in place, applications in other territories are being sent to the Liverpool passport office for processing. Figures are available only for those applications dealt with at Liverpool and are given in the table. Applications from UK residents are being dealt with at the same speed as other first applications: 2 weeks for the standard service, 1 week for the fast track service at United Kingdom Passport Service counters. The total turnaround times for applications from overseas territories dealt with in Liverpool depend mainly on transport links between the territory and the UK; the Liverpool office handles the application within the 2 week standard service.

<a name="20919w09.html_spnew7"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B>

<P>
<P>
<a name="20919w09.html_spnew8"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 It is not possible to say how many fraudulently issued United Kingdom passports there are in existence or in circulation. The UK Passport Service does not routinely collate comprehensive information on the number of passports which have been identified as having been issued on the basis of fraudulent applications. Also, the Passport Service is not always informed when such passports come to light.

<P>

<a name="20919w09.html_para6">The Passport Service does measure detected fraud and has recently identified some 800 fraudulently obtained passports through its automated check on the death records of under 18 year olds in England and Wales.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20919w09.html_spnew10"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 The UK Passport Service's plans for a passport card are based on it not being a replacement for the passport book. Individuals will be issued with both documents.
<P>

<a name="20919w09.html_para7">The card is planned primarily as a convenient travel document for United Kingdom citizens to use in Europe. In addition an extension of its use, via bilateral agreements, to countries not requiring UK citizens to hold a visa will be pursued. Discussions between officials from the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand have indicated a secure passport card would be acceptable, but no formal approach has been made to gain acceptance from these countries.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20919w09.html_spnew11"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 Standards for machine readable travel documents have been established by International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO). This United Nations body publishes specifications in Document 9303 in three separate parts. Part 1 covers passports, Part 2 visas and Part 3 cards.
<P>

<a name="20919w09.html_para9">These standards have wide international acceptance. Part 1 of the document includes card forms of the passport within its scope but refers to Part 3 for the technical specifications that should apply. A United Kingdom passport card will comply with the specifications in Part 3.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20919w09.html_spnew12"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 No. A requirement for countersignatories to be British or Irish passport holders was introduced at the same time as the definition of acceptable countersignatories was broadened. Applications may now be countersigned by any professional persons or persons of standing in the community, but they must hold a current United Kingdom or Irish passport. This gives applicants the widest choice of countersignatories at the same time as improving security by allowing a 100 per cent. check on the identity of countersignatories from the UK Passport Service records or by arrangement with the Irish authorities.

In guidance for umbrella bodies, the Bureau has urged that any charges made for providing the service should be kept to a minimum. Organisations wishing to use an umbrella body are advised to enquire about, and to compare, any such charges.
<P>

<a name="20919w10.html_para1">We have been determined that all those wishing to access the Criminal Records Bureau's (CRB's) service should have ready means of access. Up to 16 July, a total of 917 umbrella bodies had been registered by the Criminal Records Bureau. Of those, 442 have agreed to act as "open" umbrella bodies to provide this service for bodies outside their own circle or sector), of which 65 are voluntary bodies. Voluntary organisations needing to find an umbrella body should access the CRB's website www.disclosure.gov.uk which has an umbrella body search facility, or contact the CRB direct on 0870 90 90 811. Organisations are continuing to apply for registration, and the number of umbrella bodies will increase. We are actively exploring means of developing the network further.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what assistance and advice his Department provides to charities having difficulty obtaining public liability insurance after 11 September 2001.  [72015]<P>

<P>
<a name="20919w10.html_spnew1"><B> Beverley Hughes </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 24 July 2002]:</i> I am aware of the problems being experienced by charities, especially those in the voluntary and community sector, as a result of the volatility in the insurance market since 11 September 2001. It is deeply worrying that small groups of volunteers who are making a real contribution to their communities are being faced with such difficulty.
<P>

<a name="20919w10.html_para2">The Active Community Unit in the Home Office is advising charities in the voluntary and community sector to contact, in the first instance, two organisations who have been successful in negotiating public liability insurance for their membership. Additionally, the Active Community Unit is holding discussions with interested parties from the voluntary and community sector, other interested government departments, the Charity Finance Directors' Group and the insurance industry, to see what more can be done. An exploratory meeting to focus on this issue took place on Wednesday 24 July.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what action is being taken to <i>(a)</i> monitor and <i>(b)</i> arrest and convict those involved in (i) distributing anti-semitic material and (ii) anti-semitic activity against people and property; and if he will make a statement. [73006]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20919w10.html_spnew2"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 The police and Jewish bodies continue to work closely to safeguard Jewish people and property. The Government are in close touch with the Community Security Trust of the British Board of Deputies, which provides up-to-date details of anti-Semitic activity in the United Kingdom, such as assaults and criminal damage. Home Office officials have also met leading representatives of the Union of Jewish Students (UJS) in order to discuss the recent increase in anti-Semitic activity within University campuses.
<P>

<a name="20919w10.html_para3">The Government are fully committed to tackling anti-Semitism and racism generally wherever it occurs. Under Part III of the Public Order Act 1986 it is an offence to use threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour with intent or likelihood to stir up racial hatred. The offence covers inflammatory comments made in public or in the media as well as the distribution of printed material. The Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 increased the maximum penalty for incitement to racial hatred from two to seven years' imprisonment. Additionally, the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 introduced nine new racially aggravated offences, including assault and criminal damage, for which the maximum penalties available to the courts are substantially increased if it can be shown that there was evidence of racial hostility to the offences.
<P>

<a name="20919w10.html_para4">The investigation of possible breaches of these laws is an operational matter for the police and the Crown Prosecution Service. We would therefore urge anyone who believes these laws to have been breached to report the matter to the police.

 Public funds are not normally used to pay for entertainment of civil servants in the Department. Staff Christmas parties in 2001 funded by staff themselves have not been included in this answer. We have identified a small number of events, held in December 2001, to recognise the contribution of staff and extend hospitality to non-civil servants who contributed to the delivery of the Department's objectives during the course of the year, which were part funded by the Department and its operational agencies. The total cost of these was &#163;7,645 attended by 1163 people. We have not trawled the 136 prisons or all Immigration and Nationality Directorate units and to do so could only be done at a disproportionate cost.

<a name="20919w12.html_para0">The Home Office has recently made the use of recycled paper for photocopiers, printers and facsimile equipment compulsory.

The reason that there were four transfers in July 2001 is that this closely followed the movement of policy areas between Departments after the General Election. Questions are only transferred out of the Department 



when it is more appropriate for another Department to respond and when that Department has agreed to accept the question.<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what the rate of violent crime was in each Government office region at the latest date for which figures are available.  [68899]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20919w12.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The table gives figures for rates of violent crime from the British Crime Survey (BCS), for the English regions and Wales based on BCS interviews in the financial year 2001&#150;02. The BCS figures for violence per 10,000 adults relate to violence (wounding, common assault, robbery and snatch theft) experienced by the members of the public sampled in the survey.
<P>

<a name="20919w12.html_para4">The BCS violence estimate for the number of violent incidents increased by two per cent. compared to 2000, but this is not statistically significant. Comparison of results reported to the BCS in 2001&#150;02 with those for earlier years show a 17 per cent. decline in BCS violence since 1999, a 22 per cent. decline since 1997 and a 33 per cent. decline since 1995, all of these decreases being statistically significant.
<P>

<a name="20919w12.html_para5">The following figures have been extracted from Table 6.06 of the Home Office Statistical Bulletin "Crime in England and Wales 2001&#150;02", which is available in the library. A fuller explanation of the differences between the collection of recorded crime and BCS figures is given in Chapter 2 of this publication.
<P>

<a name="20919w12.html_para6">The BCS and police recorded crime figures for violence are not directly comparable. Numbers of police recorded violent crimes per 10,000 population relate to all the recordable offences in the violence against the person, sexual offences and robbery offence groups. There is also a less than complete correlation between the recorded crime and BCS figures owing to the different methods of collection, methodology and coverage (for example, the BCS only relates to victims over the age of 16, and residents), with different rates of reporting of crimes to the police also being a factor.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make a statement on the Government's methodology for recording crime statistics; and when this methodology was last changed.  [71013]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20919w13.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 Police practice on recorded crime statistics has for many years been governed by Home Office Counting Rules. These rules have covered the counting and classification of crimes for statistical purposes, although the policy on whether to record crimes that have been reported has in the past varied from force to force.
<P>

<a name="20919w13.html_para0">The Home Office Counting Rules for Recorded Crime were last revised with effect from 1 April 2002, principally to take account of the introduction of the National Crime Recording Standard which was produced by the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) in consultation with the Home Office. The Standard aims to promote greater consistency between police forces in recording reports of crime and to take a more victim orientated approach to crime recording.
<P>

<a name="20919w13.html_para1">The latest change to the Rules is anticipated to impact mainly on the violence against the person, theft and handling and criminal damage offence groups, although all offence groups are potentially affected and the impact of the changes will vary between the different police forces.
<P>

<a name="20919w13.html_para2">The recorded crime statistics cover all indictable and triable-either-way offences, together with a few summary offences closely related to more serious ones.
<P>

<a name="20919w13.html_para3">A copy of the Home Office Counting Rules is available on the website at http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/ counting/index.html.

<P>

<a name="20919w13.html_para4">As a condition of funding, each scheme is required to undertake an independent evaluation of its effectiveness as a tool to assist the police and reduce crime and the fear of crime. These evaluations will cover implementation, impact and cost effectiveness.
<P>

<a name="20919w13.html_para5">In addition, to help ensure maximum impact and sustainability of CCTV, a &#163;1.5 million Home Office funded national evaluation programme is being carried out by the Scarman Centre, University of Leicester, on 17 approved CCTV Initiative schemes.

 <i>[holding answer 22 July 2002]:</i> During the current financial year there has been a significant increase in the number of specialist caseworkers considering the applications under The Regularisation Scheme For Overstayers. The new staff are initially dealing with grants (which are easier to process) until they receive further training in September. It is expected that the output of the established staff will continue to increase with experience, and that the new staff will quickly come up to speed. Processes have been streamlined, best practice shared, and a pragmatic and sympathetic approach is being taken to any compassionate factors encountered. Processes and resources will be kept under constant review, and caseworkers are encouraged to make any suggestions for improvements in working practices that might further speed up decision making.

 <i>[holding answer 23 July 2002]:</i> All countries which are signatories of the 1951 United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees recognise the travel document issued to refugees under Article 28 of the Convention. We are not aware of any particular difficulties encountered by refugees resident in the United Kingdom when using this travel document.
<P>

<a name="20919w13.html_para8">The Certificate of Identity (CID) is a travel document issued to foreign nationals who are resident here but unable to obtain a passport from their national authorities. It is issued on a discretionary basis, not under an international convention. Non-recognition of the document by a number of European Union Member States who are members of the Schengen Group, notably France, Germany, Greece and Spain, means that CID holders who want to travel abroad for short visits, or other temporary purposes, are often unable to do so. It is a matter for individual countries whether the CID is recognised as a travel document.

 There are no current plans to introduce such targets.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what assessment he has made of the effectiveness of crime prevention partnerships in reducing crime in the Buckingham constituency.  [22628]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20919w14.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The Crime and Disorder Act 1998 requires the responsible authorities&#151;police and local authorities&#151;for each area jointly to conduct an audit of all crime and disorder and in the light of that and following local consultation, to formulate and implement a crime and disorder reduction strategy. In so doing, they must involve other local agencies, and the local community. The Act also requires the responsible authorities to keep the strategy under review to monitor its effectiveness.
<P>

<a name="20919w14.html_para0">The Buckingham constituency falls within the Aylesbury Vale Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnership (CDRP). The Partnership has conducted an audit of crime and disorder in their area to inform their strategy for crime and disorder reduction for Aylesbury Vale for the period April 2002 to April 2005. This strategy was published in April 2002.
<P>

<a name="20919w14.html_para1">Latest recorded crime figures published in July 2002 for the 12-month period to March 2002 are set out in the table, along with comparisons for the previous two years. British Crime Survey (BCS) figures are not available at CDRP or Basic Command Unit (BCU) level, but figures for 2001&#150;02 do show significant national reductions in the key categories of crime over the two years since the last BCS with a large enough sample size to demonstrate trends (1999): burglary fell by 23 per cent.; vehicle thefts fell by 14 per cent.; common assaults fell by 28 per cent.; vandalism fell by six per cent.; and overall crime fell by 14 per cent. The BCS also demonstrates that the chances of being a victim of crime remain stable at their lowest level for nearly twenty years. In the South East region, the BCS shows that burglary and vehicle crime levels are well below the national average, although the same cannot be said for violent crime.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will establish a process to ensure that <i>(a)</i> criminal justice agencies, <i>(b)</i> social services departments and <i>(c)</i> others can learn the lessons from those cases where a victim of domestic violence has subsequently been murdered by her abuser.  [18646]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20919w14.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 There are a number of processes already in place to ensure all relevant agencies learn from cases where domestic violence culminates in murder, and measures are currently underway to try and minimise the likelihood of such a tragic event.
<P>

<a name="20919w14.html_para2">In the event of a victim of domestic violence being murdered by her abuser, where the local police had prior contact or knowledge of the abuse, an internal police review should routinely be undertaken to consider the force's processes and identify failings. Such a review will report to the Chief Officer and will contain recommendations as to what processes are required to ensure that such a crime is not allowed to happen.
<P>

<a name="20919w14.html_para3">Tragically, children can also be the victims of murder following domestic violence. Chapter 8 of the Government's "Working Together to Safeguard Children" child protection guidance details the process by which Area Child Protection Committees can institute a serious case review into cases where a child dies and abuse or neglect are known or suspected to be a factor in the death. During such reviews, the agencies involved&#151;the Police, Social Services, Education and Health Services&#151;prepare reports of their involvement with the case. The final report then considers whether there are any lessons to be learned from the tragedy about the ways in which agencies work together to safeguard children, and the involvement between the family and relevant professionals.
<P>

<a name="20919w14.html_para4">The Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) are also currently piloting domestic violence murder reviews in cases that do not necessarily involve children, based on the same model as that just set out. Such reviews involve the key agencies and ensure an appropriate forum exists to take forward any recommendations that may prevent further homicides. The Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) is awaiting the results of the MPS pilots before requiring all forces to follow similar procedures.
<P>

<a name="20919w14.html_para5">Further, the Solicitor General has asked the Crown Prosecution Service to carry out multi-agency domestic violence murder reviews in a number of recent cases. These reviews, and those conducted by the MPS seek to predict the risk factors where domestic violence is occurring and improve risk management.

 The Government has no plans to collect separate statistics on anti-Semitic attacks. These cases will be included in the total figures for racist incidents and in the statistics on racially or religiously aggravated crimes. The "Code of Practice on Reporting and Recording Racist Incidents&#151;In response to recommendation 15 of the Stephen Lawrence Inquiry Report", lists the minimum data content for recording racist incidents by the police and other agencies. This data content includes the religion of the victim and the type of incident. The Government also receives statistics from other sources including reports of anti-Semitic incidents from the Jewish community itself.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20919w15.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Denham </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 21 May 2002]:</i> Crime overall has fallen in recent years and the chances of becoming a victim of crime are at their lowest for 20 years. However, by contrast street crime&#151;i.e. robberies, snatch thefts&#151;has shown a sharp increase, particularly over the last year.
<P>

<a name="20919w15.html_para1">Tackling street crime is now a top priority for the government, which announced a programme of action on 17 March 2002.
<P>

<a name="20919w15.html_para2">The government recognises that street crime has social and economic causes that cannot be tackled by the police and criminal justice agencies alone. That is why this strategy brings together all agencies, all departments, and all systems that impact on young people at risk from crime, at risk of offending, and offenders themselves and to work together to more effectively tackle street crime.
<P>

<a name="20919w15.html_para3">The work aims to reverse the upward trend before looking to bring about sustainable reductions in the long-term.

<P>

<a name="20919w15.html_para5">We need to tackle the roots of the problem by getting to children before they become involved in crime. This means tackling truancy, young people excluded from school should not be left to roam the streets. And from September we are providing for all permanently excluded pupils to have access to full-time education. We are also supporting the placement of up to 100 police officers in schools most affected by crime.

<P>
<a name="20919w15.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The Home Office does not centrally collect or collate statistics on the number of mobile phone thefts and individual police forces do not routinely collect such figures either, although some do for their own purposes. We cannot therefore estimate the proportion of street robberies that involved mobile phone theft in the last 12 months.
<P>

<a name="20919w15.html_para9">However, a Home Office Report on "Mobile Phone Theft" published in January 2002 estimated that in 2000&#150;01 mobile phones were stolen in 28 per cent. of all robberies.
<P>

<a name="20919w15.html_para10">The Government has made significant progress in working with the mobile phone industry and the police to tackle mobile phone theft. From the end of September, network operators will be able to bar stolen handsets across all networks by reference to the unique International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) number. To complement this measure, the Government has passed the Mobile Telephones (Re-programming) Bill which creates new criminal offences of unauthorised re-programming of the IMEI number and possessing, supplying or offering to supply equipment for that purpose. We are continuing to press the industry to put in place a long-term strategy to enhance the security of 3G devices.

for the change in crime levels in Avon and Somerset over the past 12 months; and if he will make a statement. [56537]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20919w15.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Denham </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 21 May 2002]:</i> The most recently published recorded crime figures show that in the 12 months to March 2002, overall crime levels in Avon and Somerset rose by 20 per cent. Although drug offences fell by 7 per cent. during this period, Avon and Somerset saw rises in the other major categories of crime. The most significant increase was a 77 per cent. rise in robbery. This is why the Government launched the Street Crime Initiative in April of this year, which covers the 10 Police Force areas with the worst robbery problem&#151;including Avon and Somerset. The initiative builds new measures on top of plans which were already in progress to ensure co-ordinated action across all parts of Government to bring street robbers to swift and effective justice.
<P>

<a name="20919w15.html_para11">The National Crime Recording Standard (NCRS), which was introduced in Avon and Somerset and several other forces in April 2001, and in all forces in April 2002, has contributed to changing levels of recorded crime. Across England and Wales, the NCRS, along with other changes to police recording practices, has had the effect of increasing recorded crime statistics by at least five per cent. this year, which suggest that crime levels have only increased by two per cent. In Avon and Somerset it has caused an uplift of 10 per cent. It is expected to have an even more marked effect on next year's crime statistics (an estimated uplift of 15&#150;20 per cent.).
<P>

<a name="20919w15.html_para12">The new standard aims to promote greater consistency between police forces in the recording of crime. Every police force must record all incidents, whether reported by victims, witnesses or third parties, and whether crime-related or not. This will result in the registration of an incident report by the police. Following the initial registration, an incident will be recorded as a crime (notifiable offence) if the circumstances as reported amount to a crime defined by law, and if there is no credible evidence to the contrary. As a result, incidents which previously may not have been recorded, are being included in subsequent crime statistics. The effect has been most marked nationally in relation to violence against the person where a five per cent. fall has been turned into an eight per cent. rise by the effects of greater levels of recording by the police.

with the Sixth and Seventh Principles of the Data Protection Act. The Sixth Principle stipulates that personal data shall be processed in accordance with the rights of data subjects under the Act.

<P>

<a name="20919w16.html_para19">Paragraph 2.9 of the consultation paper assesses the disadvantages of a non-compulsory, non-universal entitlement card scheme. Such a voluntary scheme could not guarantee complete coverage of the population, service providers would need to support different ways of checking the entitlement of the people they served. Benefits for a scheme would therefore be lower than for a scheme where everyone was required to have a card. Those people most likely to benefit from a simple, straightforward means of asserting their rights and entitlements may well be amongst the least likely to apply for a voluntary one. Unless all of society were to hold one, the protections a card scheme could afford to the broader community would be reduced or eliminated.
<P>

<a name="20919w16.html_para20">The costs of a full cost- benefit analysis of an entitlement card scheme, and of a proper risk assessment of the challenges of the procurement and roll-out cannot be determined until a decision is taken on what type of scheme, if any, the Government intend to proceed with.

Most offenders are already known to the police, who have their own biometric databases of fingerprints and DNA which are more sophisticated than anything envisaged for an entitlement card scheme. It may also cause public unease and a lack of confidence in an entitlement card scheme if the police were to have routine access. However, there may be cases in very closely prescribed circumstances, such as in matters of national security, or the prevention or detection of very serious crimes, where the police might have access to the information. Specific views on this issue are sought in the consultation paper, point 15 (iii).

 Arrest data are only available centrally for all drug offences as a whole, not for individual types of offences, so it is not possible to provide the level of detail requested. The figures given in the table relate to persons referred to courts in the West Somerset Division by the police for unlawful possession of drugs, and also to those found guilty of such offences.

 In the last six months, calls answered by the Immigration and Nationality Enquiry Bureau have increased by a third resulting in an average in excess of 21,000 calls a week. This has been attributed to the introduction of new staff (brought in via a regular recruitment programme) and to the new computerised telephone system, which is helping to manage the queues more effectively by giving the answers to commonly asked questions whilst callers are queuing.

 The Government is determined to tackle child pornography whether on or off line and the criminal law applies equally to both.
<P>

<a name="20919w17.html_para4">In January 2001 we raised the maximum penalties for taking, making, distributing or showing indecent photographs or pseudo-photographs of children to 10 years imprisonment (from three years), and the maximum penalty for simple possession of such material to five years (from six months). Also in 2001 we made the importation of indecent or obscene material a serious arrestable offence to allow Customs and Excise officers and the police greater powers in investigating child pornography offences.
<P>

<a name="20919w17.html_para5">In response to concerns about the availability of child pornography on the Internet, a hotline for reporting this and other potentially illegal material was established by the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) an industry funded organisation, in December 1996. Since its inception over 40,000 items of child pornography have been removed by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) in response to the notice and take down procedure. The IWF also sends details to the police, or, since the majority of child pornography originates outside the United Kingdom, to the enforcement agency of the country concerned, via the National Criminal Intelligence Service (NCIS). In February 2002, the IWF extended its policy, recommending to ISPs that they do not carry newsgroups which have been identified as regularly hosting child pornography or those with names that appear to advertise child pornography.

Among the important steps we have taken are the measures in the Police Reform Act 2002 to: improve the effectiveness of Anti-Social Behaviour Orders (ASBOs); create community support officers and to stop nuisance use of motor vehicles. The majority of Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships now have anti-social behaviour co-ordinators in place to ensure effective local delivery of reduction in anti-social behaviour.

 <i>[holding answer 21 June 2002]:</i> There is no central record of monitoring of ethnic or religious groups taking place in Great Britain. The key source of population data for monitoring ethnicity is the Census. Census 1991 data is the latest available and Census 2001 data should become available from the Office for National Statistics for the United Kingdom in 2003.
<P>

<a name="20919w18.html_para2">The ethnicity question in the 2001 Census is based on a "self-classification" coding system. Individuals can identify themselves against the existing 16 ethnic Census categories, and if none of these capture the individual's ethnicity, additional space is provided where they can identify their ethnicity. As such, the Census captures the full breadth of ethnic groups.
<P>

<a name="20919w18.html_para3">For each ethnic group, the Census can provide information on demographic profile, household structure and type of accommodation, health, educational achievement and employment.
<P>

<a name="20919w18.html_para4">In relation to the new Race Relations (Amendment) 2000 Act, the Specific Duty requires, among other things, that public bodies carry out ethnic monitoring.

 Ecstasy can, and does kill unpredictably. There is no such thing as a safe dose and Ecstasy does not need to be contaminated with any other drug to kill.

<a name="20919w19.html_para0">Seized ecstasy tablets (MDMA) are tested for the presence of other illegal drugs by the Forensic Science Service (FSS). The analytical methods employed by the FSS to test ecstasy tablets identify a range of other controlled substances, such as other ecstasy type drugs; opiates such as heroin and codeine; cocaine; amphetamines and methylamphetamine; diazepam; cannabis and methadone. The test will identify material down to a concentration of one per cent. or less.

<a name="20919w19.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Bob Ainsworth: </B> 
 The Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001 provides the police with new powers to confiscate alcohol from persons who are drinking in areas that have been designated by the relevant local authority under section 13 of the Act. The Act also amended existing powers to confiscate alcohol from under-age drinkers in public places. In both instances it is now clear that the police can confiscate alcohol in containers that have been opened, but not alcohol in sealed containers.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what estimate he has made of <i>(a)</i> the number of (i) crimes and (ii) violent crimes committed per annum in the UK to finance the purchase of illegal drugs and <i>(b)</i> the total value of the goods and money stolen per annum in the UK to finance the purchase of illegal drugs.  [72655]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20919w19.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Bob Ainsworth: </B> 
 Recorded crime figures include statistics on drugs offences and on acquisitive crimes, such as burglary, but do not record whether the latter are related to an offender's drug habits. Levels of drug-related crime cannot be measured directly as no routine statistical data are collected on whether an offence may have been committed as a result of drug taking. However, the NEW-ADAM (New English and Welsh Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring) research published between 1998 and 2001 sheds some light on the links between drugs and acquisitive crime. The research is insufficiently advanced, however, to reveal the precise links between drugs and violent crime. Neither are we able to supply an estimate of the total value of the goods and money stolen per annum in the United Kingdom to finance the purchase of illegal drugs.
<P>

<a name="20919w19.html_para3">NEW-ADAM research by Bennett reported in Home Office Research Study 205, "Drugs and Crime: The Results of the Second Developmental Stage of the NEW-ADAM Programme" and in Research Findings 148 and 183 has shown that the mean number of property crimes committed by those using heroin and cocaine/crack was around 200 in the last 12 months compared to 52 for those using neither heroin nor crack/cocaine. Over forty per cent. of arrestees thought that their drug use and crime were connected, and when asked about this connection, more than two-thirds said that this was due to the need for money to buy drugs. Those who tested positive for three or more drugs reported on average three times the 



<P>
<P><I>19 Sept 2002 : Column 76W</I><P>
number of offences and eight times the illegal income, as those who did not test positive. They also reported twice as many arrests in the last twelve months.
<P>

<a name="20919w19.html_para4">Findings reported in "Arrest Referral: Emerging Findings from the National Monitoring and Evaluation Programme" (Home Office: Sondhi, O'Shea, Williams, 2002) were used to estimate that the total spend on illegal drugs by those seen by Arrest Referral workers as around &#163;550 million (or around &#163;11,000 for an individual), although not all of this figure will be directly attributable to crime. The NEW-ADAM research has also found that in the year 1999&#150;2000, on average arrestees reported generating just over &#163;5,000 in illegal income, the most common source of which was property crime.

 The table shows the total number and amount (&#163;) of fines ordered to be paid following conviction for speeding offences within England and Wales separately for 2000. As the majority of such offences are dealt with by the issue of a fixed penalty, the table also shows the total amount of fixed penalties ordered to be paid. Not all fines and fixed penalties will have been paid. Information for 2001 will be available in the Autumn.

<a name="20919w19.html_para5">The total police time in England spent on traffic is eight per cent.

 Operation Landmark was an international police operation led by the National Crime Squad to combat paedophile activity on the Internet, focusing on open source data in newsgroups hosted by a British-based Internet Service Provider in November 2001.

<P>

<a name="20919w19.html_para7">By prioritising the email accounts of the most active individuals in the newsgroups, 130 targets were identified around the world. The National Crime Squad produced evidential packs on the targets and briefed officers from the relevant national and domestic police forces. Detailed investigations were then launched against each target; in the United Kingdom each of the ten targets were arrested and subsequently charged and their computer equipment seized. Eleven child victims have been identified as a result of the operation so far. The operation involved the National Crime Squad, Interpol, nine United Kingdom police forces and 12 other international police forces.

<a name="20919w19.html_para9">I regret that information on the destination of asylum seekers removed or departing voluntarily from the United Kingdom is not recorded centrally and could be obtained only by examining individual case files at disproportionate cost. Therefore it is not possible to determine how many of these persons were returned or departed voluntarily to Afghanistan. However, it has until recently been our policy to not normally enforce returns to Afghanistan, so the majority of those recorded above will have been returned to another (third) country rather than to Afghanistan.

 The Home Office only has records relating to the outstanding debts on capital raised for Probation Service investment, dating from the period before 1990. The Home Office pays local authorities a grant in respect of the principal and interest on this capital financing debt. A table of the local authority debts, as at 1 April 2001, is provided in the table. Between 1990 and 2001, capital debt was financed by the local authority capital financing standard spending assessment (SSA). Since April 2001 however, local authorities are no longer responsible for Probation Service capital investment.

 The Government's objective is that all those who work with children and young people should be supported and trained appropriately. There is already substantial investment in training for professionals in the public sector who work with children and young people but we are always looking at how we can do more. For example, we are currently developing proposals aimed at bringing consistency to the training and development of all school support staff, which will be the subject of consultation during the Autumn term; we are also introducing a 3-year degree level qualification in social work in England from September 2003 to replace the current 2-year Diploma courses.

 In relation to the public sector, the Government has committed all Civil Service departments and agencies to undertake an equal pay review and have in place action plans to close any equal pay gaps, by April 2003. Departments and agencies are at various stages of reviewing their pay systems. In relation to the private sector, we do not have this information and it would involve disproportionate cost to provide it. However the Kingsmill Report included examples of financial sector organisations which have carried out employment and pay reviews or are committed to doing so. The Equal Opportunities Commission is also supporting organisations in conducting Equal Pay reviews and is planning to monitor progress by employers.

 <i>[holding answer 10 June 2002]:</i> Her Majesty's Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate (HM CPSI), which undertakes regular inspections of all CPS Areas and a study by the Joint Standing Committee on Good Practice, (which incorporates membership from both HM CPSI and the CPS) along with the complaints statistics that are compiled on a quarterly basis and are included in the CPS Annual Report reveal the following weaknesses in the CPS complaint's procedure:

<P>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>
<BR>
(i) There is a wide variation in the quality of complaints processing. Although all CPS Areas maintain a register of complaints received from the public, some Areas record them alphabetically whilst others record them chronologically. There are occasions when it is difficult to identify what has happened to a complaint and whether follow up action has been taken.
<BR>
(ii) The annual target for 2001&#150;02, was to increase to 93 per cent. the proportion of replies to complaints which are made within 10 days. This target was not met. Timely replies were made in 81.9 per cent. of cases compared with 95.3 per cent. in 2000&#150;01.

<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="20919w20.html_para6">The main recommendations suggested include the use of a standard framework for logging complaints and that there should be periodic reviews of complaints by senior management to assess the timeliness and quality of responses to complaints and to analyse any developing trends with a view to identifying aspects of performance and processes which may need improvement or revision.

 All correspondence (including complaints) received in the Legal Secretariat to the Law Officers is recorded in a mail index by name. It is then assigned to a file according to the subject matter and source. The Law Officers consider what action is required on case-by-case basis depending on the nature of the complaint.
<P>

<a name="20919w20.html_para10">All CPS Areas maintain a register of complaints received from the public. They have a discretion to record them alphabetically or chronologically according to when the complaint was received. Area inspections by HM Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate routinely include scrutiny of the complaints register, as well as the timeliness and quality of responses to complaints. This aspect of the scrutiny by HMCPSI is undertaken with the assistance of lay inspectors.
<P>

<a name="20919w20.html_para11">Although not mandatory, the Crown Prosecution Service encourages managers to periodically review and analyse complaints received with a view to identifying aspects of performance and processes which may need improvement or revision. The Joint Standing Committee on Good Practice (which incorporates membership from both HMCPSI and the CPS) has recently concluded a study of the processes within the CPS for handling complaints. Its proposed guidance was approved by the CPS Board in June. Considerable emphasis is placed on the scope for continuous improvement which is achievable through proper analyses of, and response to complaints.

<P>

<a name="20919w20.html_para13">The CPS is not holding any inquiries on these measures, but Areas are having discussions with their partner agencies in the Criminal Justice System to ensure both the effective implementation of the special measures and that appropriate action is taken where a witness is vulnerable or intimidated.

 <i>[holding answer 12 June 2002]:</i> CPS training is provided and assessed both nationally and locally. Assessment of the impact of training programmes is undertaken at a number of levels in the CPS.

 <i>[holding answer 12 June 2002]:</i> The role of the CPS is to prosecute cases firmly, fairly and effectively, when there is sufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction and when it is in the public interest to do so. The Code for Crown Prosecutors, which is issued under section 10 of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985, is of fundamental importance to each CPS Prosecutor. It provides guidance on the general principles to be applied in every case irrespective of geography.
<P>

To ask the Solicitor-General what assessment she has made of how the most qualified lawyers in the CPS have spent their time since the production of Sir Iain Glidewell's report in June 1998. [59463]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20919w20.html_spmin9"><B>The Solicitor-General</B> 
 <i>[holding answer 12 June 2002]:</i> The Crown Prosecution Service does not record in detail the individual tasks on which individual lawyers are deployed. Following the recommendations in Sir Iain Glidewell's Report the Crown Prosecution Service has been putting in place operational structures that enable its lawyers to spend more time advising the police and preparing the more serious prosecutions, by establishing co-located Criminal Justice Units and Trial Units for Crown Court work. In addition, the government proposes to implement the recommendation of Sir Robin Auld that the CPS should take over responsibility from the police for determining the charge from the outset of the case, which the CPS and police are currently piloting. These structural changes are enabling more early legal advice before charge, and more focus on casework preparation in more serious cases to ensure that prosecutions are built on secure ground.
<P>

<a name="20919w20.html_para22">By the end of March 2002, lawyers in 31 CPS Areas had been assigned to Crown Court work in 54 discrete Trial Units; and 42 co-located Criminal Justice Units had been established in 20 Areas. As at the end of June 2002 some 394 lawyers had qualified as Higher Courts Advocates, with the right to conduct cases in the Crown Court.
<P>

<a name="20919w20.html_para23">To help facilitate this shift in gravity, by the end of June 2002 some 178 members of the CPS who are not lawyers had been approved to work as Designated Caseworkers, trained to review and present a defined 



<P>
<P><I>19 Sept 2002 : Column 86W</I><P>
range of the most straightforward cases in the Magistrates' Courts, freeing up lawyer time for more serious cases. In addition, also reflecting Sir Iain Glidewell's Report, the CPS now employs an Area Business Manager in each Area, and a growing number of Unit Business Managers in Areas with Trial Units, enabling lawyer managers, including Chief Crown Prosecutors, to delegate some of their administrative responsibilities and devote more of their time to casework. There remains a cadre of Special Casework lawyers, and the lawyers in the Casework Directorate continue to advise on and conduct cases ranging from terrorism to extradition, to serious fraud.
<P>

<a name="20919w20.html_para24">More Crown Prosecutors are benefiting from greater exposure to Crown Court proceedings and their skills, experience and expertise in dealing with the more serious cases are being developed.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20919w20.html_spmin10"><B>The Solicitor-General</B>

<P>

<a name="20919w20.html_para25">In 2000&#150;01 the percentage of files received within the time guidelines ranged from 50&#150;99 per cent.; and number which contained sufficient evidence to proceed or were fully satisfactory ranged from 74&#150;98 per cent.
<P>

<a name="20919w20.html_para26">In 2001&#150;02 those same figures ranged from 47&#150;100 per cent. and 33&#150;98 per cent. respectively.

To ask the Solicitor-General what her estimate is of the proportion of CPS cases resulting in a non-jury acquittal in the Crown Court which are attributable to failures in the review process in each year since 1997; and if she will make a statement.  [69215] <P>

 <i>[holding answer 11 July 2002]:</i> In 1999 the Crown Prosecution Service introduced an adverse outcomes analysis system. This provides CPS Areas with a consistent framework within which responsibility may be allocated for the failure of cases through a process of self-assessment, including an indication of the number of non-jury acquittals attributable to failings in the CPS review. The following table shows these outcomes as a proportion of all cases completed in the Crown Court during the three years for which figures are available:

<P>

These figures suggest that failings in the CPS review account for a small and diminishing proportion of non-jury acquittals.<P>

However, the findings in the HMCPSI Annual Report for 2001&#150;02 suggest that the level of foreseeable adverse outcomes is higher. Figures published in the Report show that 33.57 per cent. of adverse outcomes were foreseeable, and that 19.02 per cent. should have been the subject of some remedial action or dropping the case sooner. These figures relate to a different reporting period, smaller sample and by reference to a different test than those gathered by the CPS. The disparity is greatly exaggerated in presentation by the fact that CPS use a percentage of their total caseload, while the HMCPSI look at only a sample and calculate as a proportion of the adverse cases. Nonetheless, this disparity is a cause for concern.<P>





<P>

The Service is conscious that its self-assessment procedures require the support of more sensitive information. The CPS and the police have begun to develop a joint case outcomes analysis which will build on existing procedures and will focus on avoidable case failures. Under this system it is intended that the reasons for non-jury acquittals will be jointly analysed to identify trends and individual and more general training needs, as part of a wider strategy for the identification of good practice. The process will be supported by more sophisticated management information generated through the forthcoming Compass Case Management system, which is scheduled to be rolled out across all CPS Areas between April and December 2003.<P>

 <i>[holding answer 11 July 2002]:</i> The analysis of adverse outcomes, described in my response to the hon.

The following table shows these outcomes as a proportion of all cases completed in the magistrates' courts during the three years for which figures are available:

only a very small part of the overall caseload of the Service. However, there was a small increase in the level of these outcomes during 2001&#150;2002, from 0.008 per cent. of the overall caseload, or 8 per 100,000, to 0.011 per cent., or 11 per 100,000. While this trend is not considered significant, it does show that there is no room for complacency. The arrangements for improved information on case outcomes described in my response to the Hon Member's related question will provide CPS managers, at a local and national level, with a better analysis of the reasons for case failures, and will strengthen their ability to identify and resolve any areas of concern.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20919w20.html_spmin13"><B>The Solicitor-General</B> 
 <i>[holding answer 24 July 2002]:</i> An assessment of the adequacy of the resources available to the Crown Prosecution Service was made for the purposes of the 2002 Spending Review, the outcome of which was announced on 15 July.
The White Paper, Justice For All, set out a far-reaching program of change for the criminal justice system and for the Crown Prosecution Service. This programme will improve CPS efficiency and ability to proceed with cases for trial including:
closer working with the police and increasing the number of Criminal Justice Units collocated with the police and the number of Trial Units as envisaged in the Glidewell report on the CPS;
providing earlier and better advice to the police on charging and giving the CPS the responsibility to determine the charge in all but the most routine cases. Early indications from 6 pilot Areas show that giving the CPS the responsibility to determine the charge will lead to significant improvements in performance;
changes to trial procedures to improve efficiency and effectiveness; and
the development of the CPS's IT system, Compass, which is an essential part of a more joined up approach to information technology across the criminal justice system.

<P>
<a name="20919w21.html_spmin7"><B>The Solicitor-General</B> 
 <i>[holding answer 24 July 2002]</i>: It is extremely difficult to give precise figures. Before 1993, prosecutions were recorded by the name of the defendant and not by the defendant's occupation.
<P>

<a name="20919w21.html_para2">In 1993 a new case-tracking system was introduced by the CPS which allowed prosecutions for manslaughter arising from gross medical negligence to be recorded. But these figures do not distinguish between doctors and other medical staff.
<P>

<a name="20919w21.html_para3">Bearing in mind these caveats, the CPS has estimated that since 1994 twelve doctors have been prosecuted for "medical" manslaughter. Of those, eight were acquitted of all charges and four were convicted of at least one count on the indictment.
<P>

<a name="20919w21.html_para4">There are no central records of the cost of prosecuting particular categories of case.
<P>

<a name="20919w21.html_para5">The principles applied by Crown prosecutors when deciding whether the prosecution of a doctor, or of any other person, is justified are set out in the Code for Crown Prosecutors. The prosecutor must be satisfied that the evidence is sufficient to provide a realistic prospect of a conviction. If there is sufficient evidence the prosecutor goes on to consider whether a prosecution is needed in the public interest. Because manslaughter is such a serious offence, if the evidence is sufficient to justify proceedings a prosecution would normally follow. Cases involving allegations of "medical" manslaughter are considered by the Casework Directorate at CPS headquarters rather than by the CPS Area in which the death occurred.

To ask the Solicitor-General what proportion of <i>(a)</i> paper and <i>(b)</i> other goods purchased by her Department was recycled paper in each year since 1997; what the annual total cost of these purchases was; what plans there are to increase these proportions; and if she will make a statement.  [65768]<P>

<P>
<a name="20919w22.html_spmin4"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 In relation to the Departments for which the Attorney General is responsible, the information available is as follows:
<P>

<a name="20919w22.html_para11">The Crown Prosecution Service has a policy of purchasing recycled paper wherever possible. The paper provided under the Department's central contract for office use is 100 per cent. recycled&#151;approximate cost &#163;500,000. Of the products supplied under the central contract for supply of other paper-based products, in 2001&#150;02 82 per cent. by volume (approximate cost &#163;80,000) contained an element of recycled content (ranging from 35 per cent. to 100 per cent. pre- and post-consumer waste).
<P>

<a name="20919w22.html_para12">The Department does not hold information on recycled paper usage back to 1997.
<P>

<a name="20919w22.html_para13">The Treasury Solicitor's Department is able to reply only in general terms, as records have not been, and are not, kept in such a way as to provide this information.
<P>

<a name="20919w22.html_para14">Since 2000, 100 per cent. of white paper purchased has been from recycled stock. The Agency budgeted &#163;100,000 for paper in each of the last two financial years and although the spend on white paper cannot be separately identified, it does make up the bulk of the figure.
<P>

<a name="20919w22.html_para15">Other recycled products bought are not on record, though contracts specify that suppliers should have regard to environmental factors when providing goods to the agency. There are at present no specific plans to increase the proportion of recycled goods procured but the Agency is always ready to consider means of "greening" its operations when it can do so in an efficient and cost-effective way.
<P>

<a name="20919w22.html_para16">The Legal Secretariat to the Law Officers, is small and paper usage is comparatively low. Although recycled paper has been used in the past, purchases must be made on a best value for money basis. Until recently, the cost and quality of recycled paper did not provide this compared to virgin paper from sustainable resources. However, recycled paper appears to have improved in both quality and price and the Department has recently recommenced the purchase of recycled paper.
<P>

<a name="20919w22.html_para17">The Serious Fraud Office does not currently purchase recycled paper but will consider the matter again in the light of improvements in price and quality.

 As independent organisations it is for further education (FE) colleges to agree the pay and the terms and conditions of their staff within the context of the overall resources available to them. We are aware of the differences between salaries in general further education colleges and schools and this issue is being considered as part of the current Spending Review.

<a name="20919w23.html_para0">We are investing more than &#163;311 million in the Teaching Pay Initiative (TPI) over the period 2001&#150;04. TPI is separate to any general pay increase a lecturer may receive. It is designed to help modernise further education (FE) pay arrangements and to recruit, reward and retain lecturers as part of the drive to improve teaching and learning. Research on the first year of TPI implementation indicates that there is a significant move to teachers being better prepared for the task of teaching students; extra pay has been found to support the recruitment of teachers in skill shortage areas and to address casualisation; and there has been a direct positive impact on teacher morale.

We shall provide more details on these proposals later in the year. There is no reason why successful grammar schools should not be involved in forms of federation and partnership consistent with their grammar school status, where that is appropriate to local needs and circumstances. But in doing this we will remain true to our principle of no extension of selection by ability.

<a name="20919w24.html_para0">There is no requirement for LEAs to inform the Department whether Music Standards Fund has been used to increase access to and take up of music lessons for pupils from low-income families. It is for LEAs and individual schools to decide whether to operate a charging policy for instrumental music lessons provided outside of the National Curriculum, and we do not currently hold data on this.

<a name="20919w24.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Sheerman: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills whether she plans to make sport in schools part of the everyday curriculum.  [71932]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20919w24.html_spnew6"><B> Stephen Twigg: </B> 
 Physical Education (PE) remains a compulsory subject within the National Curriculum at all Key Stages. Our Public Service Agreement target, announced on 15 July, is that by 2006 we will have enhanced the take-up of PE and sporting opportunities by 5 to 16 year olds by increasing the percentage of pupils in schools who spend a minimum of two hours each week on high quality PE and school sport within and beyond the curriculum to 75 per cent.
<P>

<a name="20919w24.html_para1">It is for individual schools and their governing bodies to decide how they utilise their timetable to cover the National Curriculum and there is no reason why schools cannot choose to provide PE and sport every day, if this best meets the learning needs of the pupils.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what the level of capital investment is for 2003&#150;04 to 2005&#150;06 following the comprehensive spending review for <i>(a)</i> new or substantially refurbished primary schools, <i>(b)</i> new or substantially refurbished secondary schools, <i>(c)</i> further education and <i>(d)</i> higher education.  [71859]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20919w24.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 Capital investment in education and skills will rise from &#163;1 billion a year in 1997&#150;98 to &#163;7 billion a year by 2005&#150;06, of which &#163;1.2 billion will be through the private finance initiative. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State will announce her decisions about how that capital is to be used later in the year when she has considered priorities in the round.

introduce a star rating system to award <i>(a)</i> local education authorities, <i>(b)</i> schools and <i>(c)</i> colleges who are putting into practice good systems to support inclusion of SEN children; what plans her Department has to name (i) local education authorities, (ii) schools and (iii) colleges who are failing or rejecting SEN children and adults; and if she will make a statement.  [72028]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20919w24.html_spnew8"><B> Stephen Twigg: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend has no such plans. However, her Department does take a close interest in local education authority, school and college systems to support inclusion, particularly through OFSTED inspection and post-inspection action planning. The Department is also considering how effective practice on inclusion might best be reflected in performance indicators used in the Comprehensive Performance Assessment of local authorities.

 It is too early to evaluate fully the impact of smaller class sizes policy on educational achievement. However, there is evidence, some of which pre-dates the smaller class size policy, that smaller class sizes have a beneficial effect on pupil progress, particularly in maths and literacy, in Reception children. I am exploring how schools might make better use of all their resources&#151;teachers, support staff and ICT through the Transforming School Workforce pathfinder project. The Department has commissioned a pilot survey to examine the feasibility of collecting the detailed school resourcing information needed to evaluate the impact of resource mix on performance.

<a name="20919w28.html_spnew2"><B> Stephen Twigg: </B> 
 Figures on the number of children excluded from school by type of special educational need are not collected centrally. Guidance from the Department makes clear that, other than in the most exceptional circumstances, schools should avoid permanently excluding pupils with statements of special educational needs. The guidance also requires head teachers to say, when reporting exclusions to Discipline Committees and local education authorities, whether the pupil has special educational needs, either with or without a statement. The most recent figures show that the rate of permanent

exclusions for children with statements of special educational needs as compared with other pupils is declining&#151;three times as high in 2000&#150;01 as compared with six times as high the previous year.
<P>

<a name="20919w28.html_para0">On 22 July the Department published guidance from its Autism Working Group on autistic spectrum disorders. This provides guidance to schools, local education authorities and others on the nature of the disorders and pointers to good practice. It will raise awareness of autistic spectrum disorders further and help teachers and local education authorities to fulfil their statutory duties to meet children's special educational needs, whether the children are in mainstream or special schools.

<P>
<a name="20919w28.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 In June last year, the Department published guidance "<i>Promoting Children's Mental Health within Early Years and School Settings</i>". The guidance is designed to help teachers and others, working alongside mental health professionals, to promote children's mental health and to intervene effectively with those experiencing problems. A four page summary is also available.
<P>

<a name="20919w28.html_para1">The National Healthy School Standard (NHSS), which was launched in October 1999, has as one of its specific themes "Emotional Health and Well being", which includes awareness of mental health issues. The development of emotional health and well being is covered in the National Curriculum as part of the Personal, Social and Health Education (PSHE) framework. PSHE enables pupils to develop their self-esteem, confidence and well being. It also helps pupils to appreciate the effect of their actions on their own lives and the lives of others, and to understand the limits and codes of personal and social behaviour.
<P>

<a name="20919w28.html_para2">In addition the Department has been working with its partners to develop a long-term strategy on behaviour improvement. A key measure being piloted is the establishment of Behaviour and Education Support Teams. Their role is to provide an effective early intervention model of supportive services to children and young people who are experiencing emotional, behavioural and mental health problems, and their families. These multi-agency Teams will link with Social Services and Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS).
<P>

<a name="20919w28.html_para3">The Department are working closely with the Department of Health on the National Service Framework (NSF) for children. One of the modules will be setting standards for Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS). Officials in my Department are represented on the CAMHS module.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills how many children from families of asylum seekers are in Nottingham schools; what additional funding has gone to schools in Nottingham to address the needs of the children of asylum seekers; how much specialist language teaching the Government have funded for each child from an asylum-seeking family in Nottingham; and what funding packages the Government have made available in Nottingham to meet the education and training needs of asylum seekers.

 There were over 400 children from families of asylum seekers in Nottingham schools in May 2002 but numbers fluctuate greatly throughout the school year.
<P>

<a name="20919w28.html_para5">Nottingham schools receive funding for these children in the same way that they do for all other children on school rolls, through the Education Standard Spending Assessment. Both LEAs are eligible for funding through the Ethnic Minority Achievement Grant (EMAG). The total allocations for EMAG for 2002&#150;03 are &#163;1,974,000 for Nottingham City and &#163;278,000 for Nottinghamshire. In addition, Nottingham has received a total of &#163;148,500 from this Department's grant to support the children of asylum seekers in schools in the Home Office dispersal areas.

<a name="20919w28.html_para6">In Nottingham, the EMAG supports 100 specialist teachers who provide English language support to children, including those from asylum seeking families.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills if she will commission independent research to establish the gap in the level of funding per pupil between school sixth forms and colleges of further education.  [73645]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20919w28.html_spnew8"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 Given the different ways in which schools and colleges are funded and the very much broader remit of colleges, comparisons on the funding of school sixth forms and colleges of further education are far from straight forward. My Department is currently considering the best basis for making sound comparisons and we do not believe that external research is necessary. The Government remains firmly committed to bring up the level of funding of colleges towards that of school sixth forms. However, as we have repeatedly made clear, this will take time and must be done as resources allow.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what action is being taken to ensure that the national child care strategy is able to offer affordable places to all children whose parents wish it in neighbourhood renewal areas; and if she will make a statement.  [73543]<P>

<P>
<a name="20919w29.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 Childcare plays a critical role in sustaining and strengthening communities and in helping parents out of poverty through work.
<P>

<a name="20919w29.html_para0">Affordability of childcare can be a major barrier for many parents, particularly women and lone parents wishing to take up employment, education and training. The Childcare Tax Credit helps parents to take up the provision made available through the National Childcare Strategy by giving financial assistance to low and middle income working parents to pay for childcare. Some 158,000 families have already benefited from this help.

<a name="20919w29.html_para1">The Neighbourhood Nurseries Initiative, part of the National Childcare Strategy, was launched in 2001. Over &#163;203 million has been made available to create 45,000 high quality childcare places in the most disadvantaged areas in England. All Neighbourhood Renewal areas are in the target areas for Neighbourhood Nurseries.
<P>

<a name="20919w29.html_para2">Following the conclusions of the Inter Departmental Review of Childcare, the Chancellor announced on 15 July a &#163;1.5 billion combined budget for childcare, early years education and Sure Start by 2005&#150;06. The extra funding will support the expansion of childcare places across England, with particular emphasis on disadvantaged areas through the setting up of children's centres integrating good quality childcare with early years education, family support and health services. Our longer term aim is to establish a children's centre in every one of the 20 per cent. most disadvantaged areas.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20919w29.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Wray: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills if she will make a statement on the work of the Children and Young People's Unit; and what work it has done since November 2001 relating to combating child abuse.  [72912]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20919w29.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The Children and Young People's Unit works to ensure the coherence of Government policies that affect all children and young people who are under 19, and particularly those who are most vulnerable. In November 2001, it launched a consultation exercise to develop an over-arching strategy for all policies and services for children and young people in England. The framework for the strategy includes looking to secure the objective that children should live in a safe and secure community, where they are protected from abuse. The Unit is now considering the responses to the consultation in preparing a final strategy for publication later this year.
<P>

<a name="20919w29.html_para5">In its work within Government, the Unit works closely with the Department of Health and other Departments on matters relating to child abuse.
<P>
<P>
<a name="20919w29.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Hunter: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills if she will take measures to oblige school governing bodies to give children who are the victims of alleged grossly inappropriately sexual behaviour and indecent assault and their parents the opportunity to give their account of such incidents. [73492]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20919w29.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Stephen Twigg: </B> 
 Schools must have formal procedures for dealing with any complaints about the curriculum and special educational needs, and we recommend as a matter of good practice that governing bodies should also have procedures to ensure that other complaints are dealt with properly.
<P>

<a name="20919w29.html_para6">In dealing with complaints and in making provision for complaints procedures, the governing body should ensure that the person complaining is given fair treatment and in particular, a chance to state their case. Decisions and reasons for them should be given in writing and the person complaining should be informed at the same time of any rights of appeal they have if they wish to take the matter further. We already give guidance to governing bodies and schools about their role in helping to protect children from abuse, and about dealing with allegations of abuse against members of staff. This is contained in Circular 10/95 <i>"Protecting Children from Abuse: The Role of the Education Service"</i>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20919w29.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Hunter: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills if she will issue guidelines to school governing bodies and local education authorities clarifying at what point grossly inappropriately sexual behaviour becomes indecent assault.  [73493]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20919w29.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Stephen Twigg: </B> 
 A decision as to at what point grossly inappropriately sexual behaviour becomes indecent assault is a matter for the police and the Crown Prosecution Service and not for the education service. Those agencies must decide whether, in any particular case, alleged behaviour is within the scope of the offences as defined in the Sexual Offences Act 1956.




<P>
<P><I>19 Sept 2002 : Column 128W</I><P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="20919w29.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Hunter: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills if she will instruct school governing bodies to which allegations of grossly inappropriately sexual behaviour or indecent assault have been reported to give due consideration to any ongoing police or Child Protection Unit investigations.  [73494]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20919w29.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Stephen Twigg: </B> 
 My Department's Circular 10/95 "<i>Protecting Children from Abuse: The Role of the Education Service</i>" already advises that schools should refer any allegations of abuse to the police or child protection agencies. Schools should liaise with those agencies in accordance with the procedures laid down by their local Area Child Protection Committee (ACPC).
<P>

<a name="20919w29.html_para7">In the case of allegations of abuse against a member of staff, the Circular also advises that a police or social services investigation will take priority over an internal investigation by the school. An internal investigation running alongside a police or child protection agency enquiry is not likely to be good practice and should be held in abeyance pending the outcome of the external investigation. Due consideration can then be given to any allegations and to any disciplinary action by the school or governing body.
<P>
<P>
<a name="20919w29.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Hunter: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills if she will take measures to ensure that school governors receive instruction on the handling of allegations of grossly inappropriately sexual behaviour and indecent assault.  [73495]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20919w29.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Stephen Twigg: </B> 
 My Department has already issued advice to Local Education Authorities and schools about dealing with allegations of abuse in Circular 10/95. "<i>Protecting Children from Abuse: The Role of the Education Service</i>". The Circular advises that schools and colleges should have procedures that are in accordance with the child protection procedures established by the Area Child Protection Committee and, where appropriate, by the local education authority, including procedures to be followed if a member of staff is accused of abuse.
<P>

<a name="20919w29.html_para8">This guidance is under review following the introduction of a new statutory duty regarding child protection in the Education Act 2002. The new duty will require governing bodies of schools or Further Education institutions and LEAs to have arrangements for ensuring that their functions are carried out with a view to safeguarding and promoting the welfare of children and to have regard guidance by the Secretary of State (or the National Assembly for Wales) in making such arrangements. We are planning to consult on this guidance in the autumn, and we hope that all those with an interest, including teachers, governors and LEAs, will contribute to that consultation.
<P>
<P>
<a name="20919w29.html_wqn10"><B> Mr. Hunter: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills if she will amend Circular 10/99 to provide greater protection for child-victims.  [73496]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20919w29.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Stephen Twigg: </B> 
 My Department's guidance about child protection is contained in Circular 10/95 <i>"Protecting Children from Abuse: The Role of the Education Service"</i>. This is under review and we will be consulting about new guidance in the autumn. We will take full account of any representations we receive about this issue.

 My Department's main Area-Based Initiative is Space for Sport and Arts. Space for Sport and Arts was launched in October 2000. Bids were invited from Local Education Authorities for funding for capital projects aimed to improve primary school arts and sports facilities for dual school and community use. All the funding for successful projects had been committed by March 2002.

<P>
<a name="20919w32.html_spnew0"><B> Nigel Griffiths: </B> 
 The export of arms from the UK is controlled under the Import, Export and Customs Powers (Defence) Act 1939. EU arms embargoes are controlled by means of regulations made under the Treaty establishing the European Communities and are directly applicable to all Member States. Licensing, enforcement and penalties for breach of the regulations are provided for in national legislation made under the European Communities Act 1972. United Nations (UN) arms embargoes are implemented in the UK under the UN Act 1946 and the Import, Export and Customs Power (Defence) Act 1939.
<P>

<a name="20919w32.html_para0">In addition, the Export Control Bill contains new powers allowing controls to be imposed on trading of arms between overseas countries.

 <i>[holding answer 2 July 2002]:</i> The Department of Trade and Industry's Export Control Organisation (ECO) was processing 1,584 applications for individual export licences as of 1 July 2002, of which 312 Standard Individual Export Licence (SIEL) applications and 84 Open Individual Export Licence (OIEL) applications had been outstanding for more than three months; of those, 51 SIEL and 42 OIEL applications had been outstanding for more than 6 months; and, of those, 19 SIEL and 13 OIEL applications had been outstanding for more than one year.
<P>

<a name="20919w32.html_para4">As a result of its programme of continuous improvement the ECO has, in partnership with other Government Departments, substantially reduced the time taken to process all applications, and in particular the most complicated and sensitive cases. The number of SIEL applications taking more than 6 months to finalise is less than a third of the figure at the same time last year.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what investigations are being carried out by the ECGD following the judgment of Judge Cullinan in Lesotho, on British companies that received ECGD support; and whether they have referred this case to the relevant external investigatory body.

 We are aware that there has been a guilty verdict delivered against Masupha Sole, the former Chief Executive of the Lesotho Highlands Development Authority. However, the consortia involved in the Lesotho Highlands Water Project have not been convicted of corruption.
<P>

<a name="20919w33.html_para0">ECGD is currently seeking information from the companies who were supported by ECGD and who were members of the consortia concerned, and continues to closely monitor developments in relation to Court action in Lesotho.

On 28 September 2000, ECGD strengthened its own anti corruption measures&#151;pre-empting the OECD Export Credit Group's Action Statement on Bribery and Officially Supported Export Credits and reflecting the OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials.

The cost of interest rate support has been estimated on the proportion of ECGD credit business constituted by defence related business.

<P>

<a name="20919w33.html_para4">Figures for claims indicate the year of payment rather than the year of underwriting. The majority of these claims have been subject to internationally brokered rescheduling agreements and it is expected that these claims will be recovered in full over time.
<P>

<a name="20919w33.html_para5">The calculation of the premium amount for defence business in 1999&#150;2000 has fallen slightly (from &#163;27 million to &#163;25.4 million) since ECGD was first asked to provide this figure. This is due to a combination of improved systems for reporting on business by industrial sector and movements in sterling&#150;US dollar exchange rates.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if she will make a statement on the impact of GATS on trade and industry.  [66868]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20919w34.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Hewitt </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 4 July 2002]:</i> The purpose of the GATS is to promote economic growth through the expansion of trade in services. Quantifying the benefits of services liberalisation is difficult, but the available estimates suggest positive benefits for both developed and developing countries in particular.
<P>

<a name="20919w34.html_para0">For the United Kingdom, liberalisation of services markets should be of particular benefit. The UK is the second largest exporter of services in the world and fourth 



<P>
<P><I>19 Sept 2002 : Column 147W</I><P>
largest importer. In 2001 exports of services amounted to &#163;77 billion and imports were worth &#163;65 billion. Services account for nearly 70 per cent. of our GDP.
<P>

<a name="20919w34.html_para1">We believe that liberalisation of services underpinned by effective domestic regulatory frameworks can bring benefits to developing countries. Recent studies point to the economic efficiency and welfare gains that liberalisation can bring. The World Bank estimate that services liberalisation could boost the income of developing countries by nearly $900 billion. This is nearly five times the gain the bank estimate that they would obtain from liberalisation in goods. Liberalisation of infrastructure services such as financial, telecommunications and transport services can help developing countries by fostering the efficiency and growth of other sectors of their economies.
<P>

<a name="20919w34.html_para2">Under the GATS countries can decide in which sectors and to what extent they wish to liberalise or privatise and when they think it would be beneficial for them to do so. 



<P>
<P><I>19 Sept 2002 : Column 148W</I><P>
The EC has made clear in its liberalisation requests that it is not seeking the dismantling of public services nor the privatisation of state owned companies.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what action the Government have taken to attract business to <i>(a)</i> Somerset and <i>(b)</i> Taunton since 1997. [73259]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20919w34.html_spnew4"><B> Alan Johnson: </B> 
 In 1998 the Government launched the Regional Development Agencies and in 1999 the South West Regional Development Agency (SW RDA) was established. Prior to that the West of England Development Agency had responsibility for attracting inward investment to Somerset and Taunton.
<P>

<a name="20919w34.html_para3">Since the inception of the RDA the Agency's Inward Investment team, working closely with the Somerset Local Strategic Partnership, has secured a number of successes bringing inward investors into Somerset.

 Both HMG and the Commission are in frequent dialogue with the US Government at all levels about the US Farm Bill (the "Farm Security and Rural Investment Act 2002"). We have made clear to the US Government our considerable disappointment with the Farm Bill, especially in the context of the Doha Development Agenda, which committed all WTO members to substantial reductions in trade-distorting support.

The US believe the Farm Bill is compatible with their World Trade Organisation Commitments and have stressed their intention to remain fully engaged in the Doha negotiations. We will continue to strongly encourage them to do so.

<a name="20919w34.html_spnew7"><B> Stephen Timms: </B> 
 At the end of June 2002, over 600 lines had been unbundled. It is difficult to forecast how many unbundled local loops there will be by a given date as this is dependent on operators' own commercial rollout plans. Past attempts to forecast volumes of unbundled loops have proved unreliable for a number of reasons, not least the prevailing market conditions and the decision by operators to target the business rather than residential market.

 Final decisions have not yet been taken on the precise nature of the arrangements which will be introduced to implement the End-of-Life Vehicles Directive in the period from 2007. Those arrangements will need to deal properly with the totality of the vehicle waste stream in accordance with the terms of the Directive.

<P>
<P>

 My right hon. Friend the Minister for the Environment intends to publish for consultation later in the year draft regulations relating to Article 6 of the Directive. These will set out a regime for operators to acquire the necessary permits to carry out treatment of end-of-life vehicles, and will transpose the requirements of Annex I of the Directive into national law.

<a name="20919w35.html_para5">In time, only facilities permitted under this regime will be able to treat end-of-life vehicles and issue the "Certificates of Destruction" required by the Directive.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if she will make a statement on the location ban clause in the European Commission's proposal for motor vehicle block exemption for motor vehicle distribution. [71363]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20919w35.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 The European Commission adopted a new cars block exemption regulation on 17 July. The regulation will come into force on 1 October this year, but with a transitional period of one year for all provisions except that on the location clause ban. The introduction of this provision has been delayed until 1 October 2005.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if she will make a statement on progress with the European Commission's proposals for a new motor vehicle block exemption for motor vehicle distribution. [71362]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20919w35.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 The European Commission agreed a new block exemption for the sale of new cars and car servicing on Wednesday, 17 July. The new block exemption will replace the existing one, which is due to expire on 30 September this year, but will be subject to transitional arrangements.
<P>

<a name="20919w35.html_para6">The Government has welcomed this improvement on the current regime. The reform should mean more choice and fairer prices for consumers, and greater competition and innovation in both the retail and after-sales sectors. The new block exemption is also good for business, with dealers being freer to determine how they run their businesses.
<P>

<a name="20919w35.html_para7">While we very much welcome the changes on new car sales and on car servicing and repair, the delay in the introduction of the freedom for dealers to open in new locations, which will not come into effect until 2005, is disappointing. We would have liked this to happen sooner, as we made clear to the Commission. Nevertheless, we welcome the fact that it will happen automatically in 2005, without a further review.
<P>
<P>
<a name="20919w35.html_wqn10"><B> Miss McIntosh: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry for what reason an explanatory memorandum on the new block exemption in relation to motor vehicle distribution was not produced before it was adopted by the Commission.  [71655]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20919w35.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 The motor vehicle block exemption is a European Commission regulation, not a Council of Ministers regulation. The Scrutiny Committees do not routinely scrutinise Commission measures, so documents relating to proposals for Commission legislation are not automatically deposited, and Departments are not expected to produce explanatory memoranda in every case. In this particular case, the Chairman of the House of Commons European Scrutiny Select Committee requested an explanatory memorandum on 3 July, and this was submitted to the Committee on 10 July.

 The Periodical Publisher's Association wrote to me on 19 July. Changes to the charging system for postage are a commercial matter for Consignia within the regulatory framework laid down in the Postal Services Act 2001. I understand that the Association is in discussion with the company on this issue.

<a name="20919w37.html_para6">Consignia undertook the consultation with customers and trade associations about the introduction of a new pricing system which takes into account the size of an item and I understand that the company is now assessing the responses to the consultation. If the company does wish to proceed, it will make a submission to the Postal Services Commission and the postal consumer body, Postwatch. The Commission will have to approve any proposals and will follow their own consultation process before agreeing to any major changes in the way mail is priced.

In 1999&#150;2000, UK universities identified one spinout for every &#163;8.6 million of research expenditure, compared with one spinout for every &#163;13.9 million in Canadian Universities in 1999, and one spinout for every &#163;53.1 million in the US. The Survey also covered employment, turnover and equity value of spinouts established by universities but responses were incomplete and raised concerns about the burden associated with collecting this data. A modified second survey currently underway seeks a build on data previously collected to provide a more systematic overview of exploitation performance across the higher education sector.

 The Inland Revenue enforces the national minimum wage on behalf of the Department of Trade and Industry.
<P>

<a name="20919w39.html_para6">Under the National Minimum Wage Act 1998, Inland Revenue compliance officers can issue penalty notices where businesses have failed to comply with an enforcement notice in respect of the minimum wage. Penalty notices impose a financial penalty equal to twice the hourly amount of the main minimum wage rate per worker, for each day of non-payment of the minimum wage from the date that the enforcement notice was issued. Each time the main minimum wage rate is increased, the level of penalties is therefore also increased. There is no upper limit on the penalty that can be imposed on an employer.
<P>

<a name="20919w39.html_para7">In the year ended 31 March 2002, sixty-five Penalty Notices were issued for a total of &#163;95,804, giving an average penalty of &#163;1,973.90. No separate information is held on the number of minimum wage cases where employees were found to be working beyond their contracted hours.

<a name="20919w40.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 The Government take the issue of sexual harassment very seriously. In employment law it is well established that sexual harassment constitutes a form of detriment under the Sex Discrimination Act.
<P>

<a name="20919w40.html_para0">Reporting instances of sexual harassment can be channelled through managers, personnel officers or trade union representatives. Many employers also appoint sexual harassment counsellors who are specially trained to deal with complaints.
<P>

<a name="20919w40.html_para1">The Government have published leaflets for employers and employees on how to avoid, how to report, and how to deal with sexual harassment. Guidance for women and men on how to report and deal with instances of sexual harassment is also available from the Equal Opportunities Commission, and the Equal Opportunities Commission can help individuals bring a complaint.

 The Equal Pay Act 1970 makes it unlawful for an employer to pay a woman less than a man for the same job, a job rated as equivalent or a job of equal value. The Act applies equally to men and women. A booklet about the Act is available from the Government.
<P>

<a name="20919w40.html_para2">The Equal Opportunities Commission's (EOC) Code of Practice on Equal Pay provides practical guidance and recommends good practice to employers. It is a statutory Code, and can be referred to in Tribunal evidence.

 The Equal Pay Act 1970 imposes an obligation to pay men and women equally for the same work, work rated as equivalent and work of equal value. While employers are not legally required to have an equal pay policy, we encourage voluntary pay reviews through, for example, the Castle Awards and the Fair Pay Champions.

The EOC also has the power to provide financial or other assistance to applicants bringing a case under the Equal Pay Act and to seek preliminary findings as to whether there may have been an infringement of the Act, and apply for an injunction to restrain persistent discrimination.

The Scottish Executive is regularly consulted on, and is fully involved in discussions, at official and Ministerial level, on the formulation of EU policy which touch on matters which fall within the responsibilities of the Scottish Executive.

 The Committee for the harmonisation of the main provisions concerning export credit insurance for transactions with medium and long-term cover is a comitology committee covering the work of the European Council Working Group on Export Credits.
<P>

<a name="20919w40.html_para15">Comitology procedures only exist for a very limited number of issues, the committee meets on an ad hoc basis and the committee has had no reason to meet in the past twelve months. We are unable to anticipate if or when it might be required to meet in future.

 The Advisory Committee on Standardisation in the field of Information Technology (SOGITS) has not met for over two years and there are no issues under consideration at present. Discussions are taking place to reactivate this Committee. The UK is normally represented by an official from the Department of Trade and Industry.

 Provision for such a Standing Committee is contained in Article 7.2 of the Pressure Equipment Directive 97/23/EC but this has not yet been put into effect and so the Committee has never met.

 The EU Advisory Committee on Common Rules for Exports of Products last met on 8 May 2001. No date has been set for its next meeting and I believe it is unlikely to do so again in the foreseeable future.

[64923]<P>

<P>
<a name="20919w40.html_spnew24"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 It was intended that a Committee for Protection Against the Effects of the Extraterritorial Application of Legislation Adopted by a Third Country and Actions Based Thereon or Resulting therefrom (anti-boycott) would be established in Brussels to assist EU companies affected by extraterritorial jurisdiction by third countries, and in particular those affected by the extraterritorial aspects of the US trade sanctions against Cuba, Iran and Libya.
<P>

<a name="20919w40.html_para22">Thus far, the Committee has not been convened. UK companies are obliged to inform HMG and the European Commission of any extraterritorial action taken against them, but whilst it is clear who would be responsible for representing the UK at any meeting of the Committee, in these times of improved electronic communication, it has not been necessary in practice for it to meet.
<P>

<a name="20919w40.html_para23">In addition, as part of the 1997 Understanding between the EU and the US, the US undertook to exempt European individuals and companies from the extraterritorial aspects of US legislation drastically reducing the number of cases occurring, thus further reducing the need for the Committee to meet.

 The typical payback period for photovoltaic installations is 50&#150;100 years.

These are taken from The Greenhouse Gas Protocol website (www.ghgprotocol.org) and are the 1999 average values for power plants in "Economies In Transition". These are the markets where ECGD most commonly provide guarantees.<P>

 The Department of Trade and Industry has not received any representations on this specific issue.

<P>
<a name="20919w45.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 The Office for Civil Nuclear Security (OCNS) regularly review the potential threats posed to MOX shipments. They are satisfied that the thorough precautions that have been taken to prevent the theft or sabotage of this shipment are adequate.

They will also act as trailblazers for the new Design Quality Indicator, which has been developed by CABE and the Construction Industry Council with DTI funding. This will help to ensure that the sponsored projects will be examples of best practice in public sector procurement, design and delivery.

 <i>[holding answer 16 May 2002]:</i> There are no statutory law enforcement agencies and prosecuting authorities within the responsibility of my Department; prosecutions are brought by the Department itself. The Department's basic procedure for dealing with complaints is that, if someone has a complaint, they should initially go back to their original contact in the Department; if the complainant is not satisfied with the response, they are invited to contact the official's line manager; if the problem still cannot be resolved, the matter is referred to the Head of the Management Unit for review. This procedure does not affect the complainant's right to approach, via an MP, the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration or myself.

 I have been asked to reply. The Government is committed to ensuring that regulations are fair and effective.

<a name="20919w47.html_para2">Credit unions have an important role to play in tackling financial exclusion and enhancing opportunity, through the provision of core financial services.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20919w47.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="20919w47.html_para4">For target-holders, the UK Emissions Trading Scheme places the responsibility for emissions created by the generation of power with the end user of that power. This provides a strong incentive for energy users to increase their efficiency and to reduce emissions at the point of use. Therefore, if generators were also covered there would be a risk of double counting, where the generators could count emissions reductions made by down-stream users. Therefore, nuclear energy generation is not included in the UK Emissions Trading Scheme.

<a name="20919w47.html_para5">The UK Strategy for Radioactive Discharges 2001&#150;20 will be published very shortly.

<P>

<a name="20919w47.html_para6">Radioactive discharges from Sellafield have decreased dramatically over the past 25 years, to around 1 per cent. of their peak levels in the 1970s. The Strategy will show that further substantial reductions will be made in the period to 2020. The Environment Agency has carried out a full review of discharge authorisations at Sellafield and are expected to announce their draft decision soon. It will then be for me as Secretary of State for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the Secretary of State for Health to decide whether we wish to exercise our statutory powers before any changes are put into effect. The Secretary of State for Health and I expect to announce shortly whether we wish to exercise our statutory powers in relation to the Agency's proposed decision on discharges of technetium-99 from Sellafield.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20919w47.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 The estimated cost of decommissioning depends on the strategy adopted by the operator and agreed with the relevant nuclear regulators.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20919w47.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 With regard to liability of the UK nuclear industry in the event of a nuclear accident, the UK is a Contracting party to the Paris and Brussels Conventions on Third Party Liability in the Field of Nuclear Energy. One of the underlying principles of the Paris Convention is that all liability arising from a nuclear accident is channelled to the operator of the nuclear installation on a no fault basis. Present UK legislation requires operators to cover their liability by insurance, (the Nuclear Installations Act 1965) and operator's liability is currently limited to a maximum &#163;140 million per accident.
<P>

<a name="20919w47.html_para7">Liability amounts are reviewed by the UK along with our international partners and the Paris and Brussels Conventions are currently in the process of revision with a view to substantially increase the operator's liability to &#163;430 million per accident.

 A range of statutory consents may be required depending on the particular circumstances. These may include: planning permission, listed building consent, conservation area consent and building regulations approval. Other consents may also be required. For example, if the proposed development would obstruct a public path, it may require an order to divert or close it.
<P>

<a name="20919w49.html_para6">The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995 sets out categories of permitted development, where an application for planning permission would not be required. This includes the building of a house extension in certain defined circumstances. The Department's booklet "Planning, A Guide for Householders" provides advice to home owners on the need for planning permission. (This is available on our website at www.planning.odpm.gov.uk/

 Local authorities, including police authorities, within Durham and Surrey budgeted to receive &#163;920 and &#163;630 government grant per head in 2002&#150;03, respectively. Government grant here consists of revenue support grant, non-domestic rates, specific grants inside aggregate external finance and police grant. These figures do not include capital grants or grants paid to the Housing Revenue Account.
<P>

<a name="20919w49.html_para8">Budgeted revenue expenditure, financed from the grants referred to above, council taxes and reserves, was &#163;1,246 per head in Durham and &#163;1,052 per head in Surrey. For each area, almost all of the locally raised expenditure was budgeted to come from council taxes: &#163;315 per head in Durham and &#163;413 per head in Surrey.
<P>

<a name="20919w49.html_para9">The figures quoted above for Durham include grants receivable in Darlington, which is now a unitary authority.

<a name="20919w50.html_para1">Officials from the Homelessness Directorate have discussed with the authority how this number can be reduced and have encouraged Castle Point to put in a bid for a share of the &#163;10 million available to local authorities to support their homelessness strategy. These resources will be additional to Castle Point's share of the &#163;8 million the Government has already allocated through Revenue Support Grant to implement the Homelessness Act. Castle Point will also receive a share of &#163;10 million which is about to be allocated to local authorities to assist in the implementation of the Priority Need Order.

<P>
<a name="20919w50.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="20919w50.html_para7">Risks to worker health from formaldehyde are already addressed by the Control of Substances Hazardous to Health Regulations 1999 (COSHH). The Health and Safety Commission has approved Maximum Exposure Limits (MELs) for formaldehyde at 2 ppm (parts per million by volume) as an 8-hour time-weighted average, and 2 ppm as a short-term limit with a 15-minute reference period. Under COSHH, exposure by inhalation to a substance with a maximum exposure limit must be reduced as far as is reasonably practicable, and in any case below the MEL.
<P>

<a name="20919w50.html_para8">In its documentation summarising the criteria for setting MELs, the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) states that formaldehyde has a threshold of detection by smell at around 0.8 ppm. An earlier HSE Toxicity Review notes that the threshold for odour detection varies among individuals, with values in the range 0.05&#150;1 ppm having been reported; it is expected that all would detect the odour at the latter value. HSE has issued no further advice relating odour to concentration; it does not normally seek to offer advice on odour problems.
<P>

<a name="20919w50.html_para9">Industrial formaldehyde emissions to the wider environment are currently regulated by local authorities or, where larger industrial processes are concerned, by the Environment Agency, under the provisions of the 



<P>
<P><I>19 Sept 2002 : Column 217W</I><P>
Environment Protection Act 1990. Each industrial process requires an authorisation from the regulator. Where formaldehyde emissions are likely to cause environmental harm, each authorisation will contain conditions designed to limit its release. The regulator may at any time vary those conditions if it considers that necessary.
<P>

<a name="20919w50.html_para10">The regulatory system established by the 1990 Act is gradually being replaced&#151;from now to mid-2007&#151;by that set out in the Pollution Prevention and Control (England and Wales) Regulations 2000. Each industrial installation will require a permit, which must contain conditions relating to formaldehyde emissions if these are likely to be significant to human health or human senses, or to impair or interfere with amenities and other legitimate uses of the environment.

 Departments are required to comply with the Government's general policy on insurance, which is set out in Government Accounting, Chapter 30, para. 30.2.5, which notes that government does not need to purchase insurance to protect the viability of its business, and should consider insurance only were the value of claims met would exceed the cost of insurance premiums. Commercial insurance of a building is acceptable in cases where (a) insurance is a condition of a lease (b) the lessor will not except a Government indemnity (c) incurring the total cost of the accommodation in question, including the cost of the insurance, is more cost-effective than other accommodation options [Government Accounting, para. 30.2.11a].
<P>

<a name="20919w51.html_para7">The NIO occupies approximately 40 different properties, which are a mixture of commercially and publicly owned. In terms of building insurance, only a handful of premises pay for their own insurance costs directly (at a total value of less than &#163;10,000). The rest either pay for insurance as part of a quarterly service charge (or it is inclusive with their rental) or claim indemnity as described above.
<P>

<a name="20919w51.html_para8">Of these buildings which pay their own insurance, premiums have increased over the last year, however it is not possible to say how much of this years increase is directly related to September 11.

<a name="20919w52.html_para1">The Government has accepted that recommendation which will be taken forward by the Lord Chief Justice building on existing arrangements that enable the CPS to be represented at some sentencing appeals in the Court of Appeal.

There is a right of appeal against the decision on the level of assessment of disablement and since 9 April 2001 a right of appeal against the decision on the commencement date of the pension.
<P>

<a name="20919w52.html_para3">If an appeal is successful the pension will normally be paid from the date of the claim or date of the application for review, whichever led to the appeal.

 The Anti-terrorism (Financial and other Measures) (Overseas Territories) Order 2002 was laid before Parliament on 26 July and came into force on 1 August. The text of the Order has been sent to the Territories to which it extends (Anguilla, Falkland Islands, Montserrat, St Helena and Dependencies, Turks and Caicos Islands and the British Virgin Islands) and has been posted on the Stationery Office website. Copies have been sent also to Bermuda, Gibraltar and the Cayman Islands where the text will be used as a model for their own domestic legislation. Legislation is unlikely to be introduced in Bermuda before the House of Assembly rises for the summer. In Gibraltar drafting of local legislation is underway. Draft legislation for the Cayman Islands is being finalised.

Practical and effective co-operation between Europe's intelligence and law-enforcement agencies to combat terrorism has also continued to improve. The Seville European Council in June committed the EU to continue to maintain the closest possible coordination with the United States and other partners in the fight against terrorism, and to contribute further to international efforts against terrorism. Through its political dialogue with third countries, the EU is encouraging others to take the necessary legislative and operational actions to combat terrorism. Where appropriate, the EU is seeking to deliver assistance in counter-terrorist disciplines, through existing programmes.

At the request of the Attorney General of Jersey, the Director of the Serious Fraud Office exercised her powers under section 2 of the Criminal Justice Act 1987 to obtain information in connection with criminal investigations that he was conducting concerning the affairs of the Yaheeb Trusts and the Havana Trust and their associated entities in Jersey. No other UK agencies conducted investigations. The Attorney General's criminal investigations are now concluded.

 Neither the Secretary of State nor the Mayor have, or will have, any powers to place the infrastructure companies into administration. Decisions on such matters are, and will remain, for the Courts.

There is usually a period of 1&#150;8 weeks between the date of actual installation and receipt of the invoice from installers.<P>

The Scheme Managers provide monthly performance reports covering delivery against targets, customer care and heating capacity. There have been delays in the installation of measures under the scheme, but my Department is working closely with the Scheme Managers to address these problems.<P>

Some applicants to the scheme have experienced delays due to the national shortage of gas heating engineers. To help address this problem my Department has funded training courses to provide additional qualified engineers to work under the scheme.<P>





<P>

In addition, over 290,000 households receive assistance in 2001&#150;02 against an original target of 228,000. This will also have impacted upon timelines, although it is not possible to quantify the affect at this time.<P>

We will carry out a review of Warm Front during this financial year to look at how effective its delivery has been, the issues faced, solutions found, examples of best practice and future priorities.<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="20919w57.html_spnew6"><B> Margaret Beckett: </B> 
 The report by the Food Standards Agency's Core Stakeholder Group is fully consistent with existing Government policy in this respect. The development of methods and tests that can distinguish between scrapie and sheep is a key focus for research.
<P>

<a name="20919w57.html_para10">Indeed, DEFRA has long recognised the need for a rapid test which can reliably distinguish a "BSE-like" strain of TSE agent from the strains known to represent traditional scrapie. For example, there are two different technologies being studied at the Veterinary Laboratories Agency which show some promise in this regard.
<P>

<a name="20919w57.html_para11">A modified version of the Western Blot is now being used (in addition to standard Histopathology and Immunohistochemistry) for statutory testing of all clinical scrapie suspects in GB and for retrospective testing of archived case material. So far, there have been no results which would suggest a "BSE-like" strain.
<P>

<a name="20919w57.html_para12">Work on differential testing is not limited to the UK. DEFRA also monitors and collaborates on research developments throughout the world.

 <i>[holding answer 25 June 2001]:</i> I regret that this reply has been overlooked. The Standing Veterinary Committee (SVC) first received a report from the European Commission of an unconfirmed foot and mouth outbreak in KwaZulu-Natal on 19&#150;20 September 2000. On 3&#150;4 October 2000 the Commission informed the SVC of two confirmed outbreaks and tabled background information of the action taken by the South African authorities. On 18 October 2000 the SVC was informed 



<P>
<P><I>19 Sept 2002 : Column 243W</I><P>
of one further outbreak and that a Commission inspection visit to South Africa was expected to take place on 23 October 2000.
<P>

<a name="20919w58.html_para0">On 7&#150;8 November 2000 the European Commission informed the SVC of the outcome of the inspection and indicated that safeguard measures may be necessary. On 17 November 2000 the Commission adopted Decision 2000/739/EC formally stopping imports of fresh meat into the Community from 16 districts in the province of KwaZulu-Natal. On 5 December 2000 the Commission informed the SVC of an outbreak in Swaziland linked to the South African outbreaks. They confirmed that no export certificates could be signed by either country. At the SVC on 20 December 2000 the Commission reported there had been no change in the situation.
<P>

<a name="20919w58.html_para1">As there had been no significant improvement in the situation in South Africa, the Government took a decision to take additional safeguard measures by formally stop imports of meat of FMD susceptible species.

 <i>[holding answer 25 June 2001]:</i> I regret that this reply has been overlooked. Technically there is no difference between a suspension and a ban.
<P>

<a name="20919w58.html_para3">In October 2000 the European Commission advised the Standing Veterinary Committee (SVC) that with effect from 21 September 2000, the South African authorities had stopped the issue of export certificates for fresh meat from 16 districts of the province of KwaZulu-Natal following an outbreak of foot and mouth disease. On 17 November 2000, the Commission adopted a Decision to formally stop the importation of fresh meat of foot and mouth disease susceptible species from the same 16 districts by amending the relevant Community legislation. The districts were as follows: Camperdown, Pietermaritzburg, Lions River, New Hanover, Umvoti, Kranskop, Mapumulo, Ndwedwe, Lower Tugela, Inanda, Pinetown, Durban, (including the metropolitan area of Durban), Chatsworth, Umzali, Umbumbulu and Richmond.

 Under the current EU rules the Total Allowable Catch for each fish stock is apportioned between Member States according to the principle of "relative stability". It is then for individual Member States to decide how the quota should be allocated to their fishing industries. We believe that this arrangement offers significant advantages in terms of flexibility and meeting the different needs of the fishing industries in different Member States. While we would, of course, consider carefully any proposal for a system of individual transferable quotas across the EU, it is not clear that such a system would yield greater benefits than the current arrangements.

 I refer the hon. Member to the letter of 29 July from my right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State. She wrote to all Members with the results of the consultation on radioactive waste management, and announced the next steps of the policy making process.
<P>

<a name="20919w58.html_para14">The consultation on <i>Managing radioactive waste safely,</i> published by the UK Government and the devolved administrations, ran from 12 September 2001 to 12 March 2002 and 330 responses were received. A summary of the responses has been placed in the Library of the House, and those of the devolved administrations. The summary lists other events during the consultation period, including recommendations from two Parliamentary Select Committees and a number of research reports. Copies of individual responses are available in my Department's Library, and in those of the relevant Departments in the devolved administrations.
<P>

<a name="20919w58.html_para15">In her letter, my right hon. Friend said that the Government and the devolved administrations had considered these responses and recommendations and decided the next steps in the policy process. In particular, we propose to press ahead with a review of waste management options. The review will seek the views of interested stakeholders, the public and government departments. We will appoint an independent body to oversee the review process which will make recommendations on the option, or combination of options, for managing radioactive waste which would achieve long-term protection for people and the environment. We will review all options and revise the timetable to a four stage process rather than five as proposed in the original consultation.
<P>

<a name="20919w58.html_para16">The review process must engage with stakeholders and the public. The review will therefore start by setting the framework for debate by establishing broad agreement on the wastes to be considered, the range of management options for each of them, and the criteria against which these options should be assessed. We want to promote a dynamic and extensive process of public engagement. This approach, coupled with regular reports to our Parliaments and Assemblies, will reach far more people and encourage active involvement in decision making, rather than occasional opportunities to react to consultation papers.
<P>

<a name="20919w58.html_para17">The waste from our existing nuclear facilities will arise over the next century or so. So we intend, in assessing management options, to include not only materials currently classified as waste but also to consider the consequences of providing for other materials which may have to be managed as waste during the period, such as some separated plutonium, and uranium, as well as certain quantities of spent nuclear fuel.
<P>

<a name="20919w58.html_para18">We propose that the new body will be in place by the end of the year. Over the summer and autumn, we shall publish more detailed proposals. These will include details of the new body and its terms of reference. They will also address pressing issues such as arrangements for managing waste safely in the short-term and an announcement on waste substitution. We shall report progress on the other issues covered in the consultation, including decommissioning nuclear sites, the powers of the Environment Agencies, managing spent sealed sources of radioactivity, and waste classification.

 <i>[holding answer 4 July 2002]:</i> DEFRA guidance on consultations, and that previously available in the Ministry of Agriculture Fisheries and Food, stresses the importance of including in consultation exercises all relevant interest groups, including consumer and general public interest groups. Included in the list of relevant bodies in the guidance are the Women's National Commission, the Co-operative Women's Guild, the National Federation of Women's Institutes, the National Housewives Association and the Townswomen's Guilds. Other organisations are added to individual consultation exercises according to the subject matter, however no central register of all bodies consulted in a particular period is kept.

 The role of the Committee, which is set out in Article 10 of the Council Directive 82/882/EEC (OJ L 378, 31/12/1982, p. 1), is to give its opinion on any measures proposed by the Commission which are necessary to adapt the Decision's provisions to technical or scientific progress. This Committee has not met for more than 5 years and there are no meetings scheduled. Therefore the most recent meeting predated the establishment of the Scottish Executive in 1999, and potential UK representation has not been addressed. In the event of any meeting being scheduled, officials in this Department would, as a matter of course, liaise with their counterparts in the Scottish Executive.

 <i>[holding answer 10 July 2002]:</i> Following a detailed consideration of all the issues raised during the consultation process, the Government announced on 27 June that it intends to adopt the targeted approach, and designate 55 per cent. of England as Nitrate Vulnerable Zones (NVZs).
<P>

<a name="20919w60.html_para1">The Environment Agency is in the process of assessing the costs and resources required for administering and enforcing the new designations under the Nitrates Directive. Initial indications are that both options cost around &#163;2 million each, excluding costs arising from staff training and resolving boundary disputes. This similarity between costs arises because even if the whole territory had been designated, the Agency would have adopted the same priority based approach to enforcement that it will be using in the newly designated areas.

 Imports of illegally logged timber can only be seized at import by HM Customs and Excise where the timber concerned is covered by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) and can be identified as having been imported in breach of its requirements.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what the deadline is for adoption of the revised European Waste Catalogue and Hazardous Waste List into UK law.  [69747]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20919w61.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The European Waste Catalogue which now incorporates the Hazardous Waste List came into force in January 2002. It will be implemented in the UK as part of the current review of the Special Waste Regulations. Amended Regulations are likely to come into force in the UK during 2003.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20919w61.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 A licence is not required for the transport of hazardous waste although since 1991 and in accordance with the EC Waste Framework Directive, waste carriers must be registered with the Environment Agency.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20919w61.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 Electrical or electronic equipment must contain hazardous components for them to be classified as hazardous under the European Waste Catalogue. Hazardous components may include accumulators and batteries containing lead, nickel/cadmium or mercury; mercury switches, and glass from cathode ray tubes and other activated glass, CFC or HCFC.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what types of waste previously not hazardous waste will be reclassified as hazardous waste; and what assessment she has made of the effect on disposal routes of the reclassification of waste as hazardous.  [71687]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20919w61.html_spnew17"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The European Hazardous Waste List (94/904/EC) has recently been extensively revised, and over 200 additions have been made. It will be transposed into UK law as part of the current review of the UK Special Waste Regulations. The most significant additions include end-of-life vehicles containing hazardous liquids or components, electrical equipment containing CFC/HCFC/HFC (fridges/freezers), and the following items if they contain hazardous substances: electrical equipment, contaminated soils, insulation materials, and bottom ash.
<P>

<a name="20919w61.html_para0">Reclassification of waste as hazardous will restrict its disposal via landfill to those sites classified as landfill sites for hazardous waste by the Environment Agency. Landfill site operators should have submitted site conditioning plans (required by 16 July) detailing what classification they are seeking for their site. It is still too early to assess what hazardous waste capacity will be available after 16 July but the waste management industry have informed us that they do not foresee a shortfall.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20919w62.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 British Waterways have advised that a national review of mooring rates was formally announced in December 2001, following routine consultation meetings and exchanges with national user groups representing boating interests.
<P>

<a name="20919w62.html_para6">A number of national user groups wished to see the previous "matrix score" pricing system retained. Their views were carefully considered, but BW took the view that the matrix did not allow sufficient flexibility for comparison to the private sector and market demand.
<P>

<a name="20919w62.html_para7">All BW moorers were sent details of the increases and the policy underlying them in February. A minimum period of six weeks was allowed for feedback.

 The draft Directive was adopted by the Commission in January 2002 and DEFRA launched a public consultation on the proposals on April 12. Extensive study has been carried out throughout this period to assess the impact of the draft Directive. Through direct consultation with a selection of stakeholders, and using the responses received to the public consultation, DEFRA recently produced an extended partial Regulatory Impact Assessment (COM (02) 17) which considers the potential benefits and costs of the draft Directive.
<P>

<a name="20919w63.html_para7">The assessment indicates that much of the environmental damage that would fall within the scope of the proposed regime is already subject to existing domestic legislation. It does suggest however, that the proposed Directive could have additional positive environmental benefits, by requiring higher standards of remediation and by encouraging operators to take additional precaution. Businesses could face additional costs through, amongst other things, possible financial security requirements, and additional expenditure on precautionary measures. Additional study is being carried out in this area in order to quantify such costs.
<P>

<a name="20919w63.html_para8">In requiring higher standards of remediation, the responsibilities of the Competent Authority, which is designated by the Member State to require operators to take preventative or restorative measures, would be increased. Under the Commission's proposal, the Competent Authority would have a duty to take action to remedy damage if the liable party could not be found. A 



<P>
<P><I>19 Sept 2002 : Column 269W</I><P>
preliminary assessment provided by selected enforcement agencies indicates that the Directive would largely constitute an extension of existing responsibilities although there would be some new duties. Therefore there may be some resource implications.
<P>

<a name="20919w63.html_para9">The Government supports a regime which is equitable, proportionate, clear, insurable, easy to implement, does not damage business competitiveness, and delivers clear environmental benefits. Consequently, assessment of the potential impact of the draft Directive is ongoing to inform the UK position in the negotiations.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will make a statement on the Government's policy towards the draft EU Directive on environmental liability.  [70840]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20919w63.html_spnew10"><B> Margaret Beckett: </B> 
 The purpose of the proposed Directive is to establish a framework for the prevention and remediation of environmental damage in accordance with the principle that the polluter pays. This represents an important and significant development in EC environmental law. The Government has therefore conducted a public consultation on the proposals, and the UK position on the detail of the proposal will be finalised in the light of the comments received.
<P>

<a name="20919w63.html_para10">In broad terms, the Government supports a regime which is equitable, proportionate, clear, insurable, easy to implement, does not damage business competitiveness, and delivers clear environmental benefits.
<P>

<a name="20919w63.html_para11">The partial regulatory impact assessment submitted to Parliament (COM (02) 17), indicates that much of the environmental damage covered by the Directive is already the subject of existing domestic regimes, but the proposals go further in some respects. The Directive would set higher standards of remediation and introduce the concepts of equivalent compensation and interim losses. Further benefits would arise from introducing a regime across the European Community which would harmonise the rules and standards for environmental liability across member states. Provided that the right balance between costs and benefits is achieved, this proposal could therefore play a useful part in safeguarding the environment.

 The extended partial Regulatory Impact Assessment, submitted to Parliament (COM (02) 17) considers the potential gains that would arise from implementation of the draft Directive. It concludes that much of the environmental damage covered within the scope of the proposed Directive is already subject to a number of domestic regimes.
<P>

<a name="20919w64.html_para0">However, the assessment does establish that there could potentially be positive environmental benefits, resulting in particular from the setting of higher standards of remediation that would require more extensive remediative action.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20919w64.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 As stated in its Waste Strategy 2000, the Government considers that recovering value from sewage sludge through spreading on agricultural land is the best practicable environmental option in most circumstances. Agricultural use of sludge brings savings of several million pounds in fertiliser costs and the organic matter improves soil structure, its workability and water holding capacity.

<P>

 The Secretary of State has established a high level inter-departmental Sustainable Procurement Group to look at how sustainable development can be more fully embedded into central-government procurement. One angle is that we are trying to ensure that procurement practitioners comply fully with Government policy and ensure that Government procurement properly supports sustainable development. That would include Government policy on HCFC/HFC free products wherever possible.

 The Government encourages material recovery in all its forms. However in line with the waste hierarchy set out in the Waste Framework Directive and Waste Strategy 2000, the Government particularly wants to see a major increase in the primary recycling and composting of household waste rather than in landfill or incineration. The Government has therefore set local authorities statutory targets for the recycling and composting of household waste that exclude residues from incineration.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20919w65.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 Bottlenose dolphins are protected in the Great Britain under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. Section 9 of the 1981 Act makes it an offence to intentionally kill or injure this species. In England and Wales this protection was strengthened by the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 that introduced a new offence of intentional or reckless disturbance.
<P>

<a name="20919w65.html_para0">The bottlenose dolphin is also listed under Annex II of the Council Directive (92/43/EEC) on the Conservation of Natural Habitats and of Wild Fauna and Flora. This requires the designation of protected areas for bottlenose dolphins. Three such areas have been designated as candidate Special Areas of Conservation (SAC) for their local bottlenose dolphin populations. Cardigan Bay and the Lleyn Peninsula and the Sarnau in Wales and the Moray Firth in Scotland.
<P>

<a name="20919w65.html_para1">As part of the UK's biodiversity strategy, the Government has developed action plans for the conservation of certain species and habitats. Small dolphins, which include bottlenose dolphins, have such a plan. This aims to maintain the dolphins' current range and abundance and, in the longer term, to increase the ranges of small dolphin populations where appropriate. The plan's objectives include minimising the incidental capture of dolphins in fishing nets, reducing acoustic disturbance and improving coastal water quality by reducing pollution. A co-ordinated steering group has been set up to take forward cetacean action plans and comprises representatives from non-government organisations, such as the RSPCA, the government, fishermen and other stakeholders.

<a name="20919w67.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 22 July 2002]:</i> Part I of the Local Government Act 2000 placed a duty on English local authorities to prepare a community strategy. The delivery of improved long term economic, social and environmental quality of life, contributing to the achievement of sustainable development in the UK, lies at the heart of community strategies; indeed community strategies are required, by law, to promote sustainable development. The Government believes community strategies will promote the mainstreaming of sustainable development across local authorities' functions. Where they have effective and holistic Local Agenda 21 strategies, there may be good reasons for local authorities to continue to implement LA21. However, the Government feels that, in the long term, LA21 strategies will effectively be subsumed by community strategies. Whilst there are no requirements placed on local authorities to produce specific community renewable energy or alternative energy strategies, energy use, as an important element of sustainable development, can be considered as part of the community strategy process.

 Through its Industry Forum Adaptation Scheme, the Government is helping to fund work being undertaken by the Red Meat Industry Forum to improve the competitiveness of the red meat industry. Over the three financial years ending in 2005, a contribution of &#163;1.52 million has been committed to match industry funding of &#163;1.7 million on benchmarking, analysis of the supply chain and masterclasses. The Forum is also pursuing other initiatives in its ten point action plan, which was launched in March this year. Work of the Forum is being led by the Meat and Livestock Commission, which as part of its remit undertakes promotional support for the benefit of sheep producers. Many marketing issues, including the export of sheep for slaughter, involve commercial decisions in which the Government only has a limited role. In encouraging change the Government welcomes the work of the Forum and other industry initiatives to build partnership and trust in the supply chain.

 <i>[holding answer 22 July 2002]:</i> In April 2002, the Department launched the 2002 UK Climate Change Scenarios. The Department funded the development of these scenarios to support the UK Climate Impacts Programme, the purpose of which is to help public and private sector organisations assess the impact of climate change on their sectors and plan ways of adapting to its consequences. The new scenarios were produced using a regional climate change model and represent a significant step forward in our understanding of possible consequences of climate change for different parts of the UK. They replace an earlier set of scenarios funded by the Department and published in 1998.

 My scientific advisors on wildlife issues, the Joint Nature Conservation Committee, have advised that there are approximately 1785 invetebrate, two amphibian, two reptile, six bird and one mammal species which are endangered. In 1995 the UK Biodiversity Action Plan was published and more recently a significant number of specific Action Plans have been finalised. These are targeted at the conservation needs of rare species and habitats and are being implemented through broad partnerships of government, statutory conservation agencies and the voluntary sector. The Biodiversity Action Plans encourage positive actions for rare species at a range of scales, from national to local, and by a range of organisations. Monitoring will provide feedback on the efficacy of the implementation of the plans.

 Light is excluded from the statutory nuisance regime of the Environmental Protection Act 1990. During the debate of the associated bill in the House of Lords, floodlighting as a statutory nuisance was rejected on the basis of the low incidence of reported problems, and the perceived looseness of the proposed term "floodlighting". However I recognise that intrusion from security lighting has become a growing problem, and in view of this I will consider what measures may be used to address this issue.
<P>

<a name="20919w68.html_para1">Currently where there is a proposal for which a planning application is required, the local planning authority has the power to control many sorts of lighting installation by imposing planning conditions.

We are also committed to sustainable development in developing countries as witnessed by the increasing proportion of the UK's gross national income devoted to international aid, which will rise to 0.4 per cent. by 2005&#150;06, and through taking forward the important commitments to fair trade, better market access and phasing out of agricultural subsidies and reduction of trade-distorting domestic support as made at Doha.

 Following the Water Summit in 1997, Ofwat has set each water company an annual leakage target to progressively reduce leakage to its economic level by 2003. This is defined as the level at which the costs to make further reductions in leakage are greater than the costs of supplying additional water from its sources. On 25 July, Ofwat published details of company performance against their targets for 2001&#150;02. Of the twenty-one companies set targets, nineteen met them and are now at or on course to reach their Economic Level of Leakage by 2003. Ofwat considers that the two that did not will recover their positions by 2002&#150;03. Thames Water was subject to special measures rather than being set a volumetric target in 2001&#150;02, due to its unsatisfactory performance in managing leakage. The company's performance in this respect continues to be deficient. Ofwat is taking a number of increased measures to ensure that Thames Water brings its leakage under control by 2003&#150;04, including the setting of local leakage targets for 2002&#150;03.

 As part of its voluntary agreement with farmers participating in the randomised badger culling trial, DEFRA has a signed commitment to pay reasonable compensation for damage to crops and property directly caused by operations carried out, and measures taken under the agreement. Claims arising out of damage caused by third parties are considered on a case by case basis and any payment is made on an ex-gratia basis.
<P>

<a name="20919w69.html_para3">In practice the principal target of anti-trial protest has been Departmental property, including traps and vehicles, and field staff. Police support for trial operations is extensive and acts as a deterrent against damage to landowners' property.

 The Department is aware of a number of studies of the populations of mammals and birds in England. The most recent comprehensive estimates of rabbit, hare, fox, otter and mink populations were published by the Joint Nature Conservation Committee in <i>A Review of British Mammals: population estimates and conservation status of British Mammals other than cetaceans (1995).</i>
<P>

<a name="20919w70.html_para0">Estimates indicate that rabbit populations are increasing at around 1&#150;2 per cent. each year. Brown hare populations are probably in continuing decline. Mountain hare populations are thought to be stable but, as expected, very localised. Fox populations appear to be stable in rural areas and increasing in urban areas. The otter is benefiting from reintroductions to the wild and is continuing to spread and increase. American mink numbers may be declining in some areas as a result of the spread of otters.
<P>

<a name="20919w70.html_para1">The British Trust for Ornithology conducts surveys of bird numbers in Britain. A 1988&#150;91 survey estimated 590,000 magpie territories and 160,000 jay territories in Britain. Magpie numbers are estimated to have increased by a mean rate of 4&#150;5 per cent. a year between 1966 and 1986 and to have stabilised thereafter. Jay populations have tended to increase on farmland and to decrease in woodland since the survey and overall, the population remained relatively stable or increased slightly up to 1995.

<P>
<a name="20919w70.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 I have already announced special grant funding of an extra &#163;40 million for local authorities for this year. This is in addition to the &#163;6 million already allocated for the last financial year. Additional help for future years was included in the Spending Review announced on 15 July.
<P>

<a name="20919w70.html_para3">The funding will enable local authorities to make full use of treatment facilities now up and running in the UK. Five "fridge eating" sites have been operating for a number of weeks. Two are due to come on line in August, and a further three later this year.
<P>

<a name="20919w70.html_para4">Under a voluntary, industry-led approach, the UK traditionally recovers value from around 70 per cent. of the tyres disposed of each year, although this dipped in 2000 due to the closure of a major tyre reprocessing facility.

<P>

<a name="20919w70.html_para5">As well as having sufficient tyre reprocessing capacity, it will be important that the framework supporting the tyre landfill ban promotes responsible tyre disposal and recovery.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20919w70.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 Mechanical biological treatment is used to manage the residue remaining after the recyclables have been removed from municipal waste. It employs conventional, proven techniques to remove any remaining recyclables and to stabilise the organic content by composting or anaerobic digestion. This material can then be landfilled or used as a fuel for energy recovery. The process is widely used in Germany and Italy and also in Austria and the Netherlands.
<P>

<a name="20919w70.html_para6">MBT is specifically designed to complement waste management strategies that are focussed on material recovery through recycling and composting by providing a flexible way of dealing with the residue. This type of treatment can assist in reaching the targets for the reduction of biodegradable municipal waste disposed of to landfill as set out in the Landfill Directive.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20919w70.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The Government already has a number of measures in place that will increase the future amount of household waste which is recycled. These measures include setting statutory performance standards for the percentage of waste that local authorities must recycle by 2003&#150;04 and 2005&#150;06, and additional financial support to help local authorities deliver these standards.
<P>

<a name="20919w70.html_para9">The standards we have set for local authorities take account of the performance that the authorities were reporting at the time. As a result, whilst all authorities are required to improve, there are variations in the percentages that authorities must deliver.
<P>

<a name="20919w70.html_para10">Our ambitions on waste disposal extend well beyond 2005&#150;06 and we will seek continuous improvement in our recycling rates. We will consider longer-term recycling standards for individual local authorities in the light of experience and any technological developments. As a part of that consideration, we will take a view on the demands for improvement we place on those who are currently lower and higher performing authorities.
<P>

<a name="20919w70.html_para11">Generally, we consider local authorities are best placed to decide locally how best to meet existing standards, taking account of the nature of the local waste stream and issues such as the type of housing in their area. We have no plans for centrally imposing greater uniformity in the way local authorities collect and dispose of waste.
<P>

<a name="20919w70.html_para12">In November the Secretary of State announced that the Government's Strategy Unit would be carrying out a study on waste strategy. This study is assessing what extra instruments, changes to targets or regulations, and/or additional funding may be required to ensure that the strategy is effectively delivered and that we are able to develop more sustainable waste management. The Strategy Unit are due to report later in the year and we will make final decisions on future resources, and consider other policy measures, when the conclusions of the study are known.

 The Environment Agency is undertaking research into continuous dioxin sampling which includes market and literature searches, laboratory testing, and field trials, comparing "continuous" samplers with discontinuous methods.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20919w70.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B>

It is not possible to provide a meaningful allocation for each authority.

 On 10 July, the European Commission published its proposals for reform of the Common Agricultural Policy. These form a good basis for discussion, and in many ways respond to UK calls that significant reform of the CAP is required. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State set out the UK's initial response to the proposals at the 15 July EU Agriculture Council. As she explained, the Government believes that the general thrust of the proposals of further market reform, decoupling of direct payments from production, and reinforcement of the rural development regulation is the right one. But in a number of key areas we consider that the proposals do not go far enough and do not adequately respond to the challenges ahead. In particular, the Commission's proposals on modulation would simply recycle money within the CAP while we would like to have seen a proposal which reduced subsidies while delivering real budgetary savings.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what recent research her Department has carried out to determine the level of pesticide residues in food within the UK; what checks are carried out on imported foods to determine the level of pesticide residues; and what plans she has to introduce statutory targets to reduce the use of pesticides in food production.  [73202]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20919w71.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Government conducts a wide-ranging annual surveillance programme for pesticide residues in food including imported food. Some 4,000 samples are analysed annually and the programme generates results for over 100,000 pesticide/commodity food combinations. All the results are published on a website: www.pesticides.gov.uk/committees/PRC/prc.htm
<P>

<a name="20919w71.html_para3">The Maximum Residue Levels regulations apply equally to imports. Additionally, the general provisions of the Food Safety Act 1990 apply at all times. The food safety requirements are that food must not have been rendered injurious to health; be unfit; or be so contaminated&#151;whether by extraneous matter or otherwise&#151;that it would be unreasonable to expect it to be sold in that state. These legislative controls are backed up by the monitoring programme described above. Around half of the samples tested are of imported food.

 With support from the Woodland Grant Scheme and Farm Woodland Premium Scheme, private woodland owners in the South West created some 1,300 hectares of woodland last year. This is nearly double the amount planted five years ago. We have also provided extra support in certain parts of the South West through initiatives such as the Community Forest Premium and Challenge Schemes for new native woodland in National Parks and for reversing fragmentation of woodlands. As to the future, we are currently reviewing our grant schemes with a view to achieving, among other things,

<P>
<a name="20919w72.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The current rules already allow animals of all species to move to shows even if there is a standstill in place on their farm of origin, to move from show to show or to return to their farm of origin without triggering a 20-day standstill, provided they are individually identified and kept in approved isolation facilities for 20 days before the first show, between shows and on final return to the farm.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20919w72.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The byelaw to implement a "No Take Zone" around Lundy Island has been proposed by Devon Sea Fisheries Committee (SFC) who are responsible for fisheries management in the area concerned. In proposing the byelaw, the SFC has taken advice from English Nature to comply with the statutory requirement in the case of byelaws proposed on marine environmental grounds. Consultation by the SFC has taken place with local fishing interests and formal public consultation will follow. This will be held in line with the statutory requirements of the Sea Fisheries (Byelaws) Regulations 1985 which require the byelaw to be advertised in publications circulating in the local district and any other publication which the Secretary of State may require.
<P>

<a name="20919w72.html_para1">In confirming the byelaw, this Department will look to ensure that all statutory requirements have been met, any objections received from the publication of the byelaw have been dealt with satisfactorily by the SFC and that the byelaw will not operate in a discriminatory or inequitable way. This Department will also need European Commission approval of the byelaw.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20919w72.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The updated National Appraisal of Assets at Risk of Flooding and Coastal Erosion in England and Wales, distributed in September 2001 by DEFRA, provided a revised comprehensive estimate of risks from flooding and coastal erosion, including a preliminary assessment of the potential change of impact associated with climate change. The risk to coastal communities was included in this assessment.
<P>

<a name="20919w72.html_para2">Management of coastal risk from flooding and coastal erosion is informed through the development of Shoreline Management Plans (SMPs). The earliest of the first round of SMPs is now due for revision. Research by DEFRA to improve understanding of coastal erosion processes around the coastline of England and Wales will be made available soon to coastal authorities to assist development of the second round of SMPs. This includes guidance on the likely impact of sea level rise on coastal processes. This improved understanding will allow an assessment of the likely change of risk to coastal communities as a result of sea level rise to be made during review of the local SMP.
<P>

<a name="20919w72.html_para3">DEFRA manages the UK Climate Impacts Programme (UKCIP) which reported on regional climate change impact earlier this year. Research carried out under UKCIP does not suggest that the sea level rise allowances used in the design of flood and coastal erosion management solutions needs to be changed for the time being.

Environment Agency in identifying the case for investment in flood alleviation measures following the flooding of October 2000; and if she will make a statement.  [73012]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20919w72.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Environment Agency's medium term plans for capital works are produced on an annual basis and in both 2001 and 2002 included proposed improvement works for many conurbations affected by the Autumn 2000 flooding. Works are already in progress at some locations, including Bewdley, Shrewsbury, Malton and Norton, all of which were flooded. The Agency is still investigating the case for other works in areas affected by the 2000 floods. The Department keeps in close touch with the Agency on its plans.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20919w72.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 PSAs are only set for Government Departments. However, in 1999 DEFRA's Flood Management Division developed a series of High Level Targets which require the Environment Agency to report on flood and coastal defence issues on a regular basis. A copy of these Targets was placed in the House Libraries on 23 November 1999.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20919w72.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 There is no set timescale for taking forward work associated with flood alleviation measures as this depends on the severity, duration and complexity of individual flooding events. The Environment Agency routinely investigates all incidents of flooding to determine any lessons learned, and revises its procedures accordingly as well as bringing forward flood alleviation measures if required and justified.

 The Government is committed to minimising the adverse effects of pesticides. This includes the development and promotion of ways in which farmers can limit their pesticide use. In spring 2001 we invited the industry to implement the <i>Voluntary Initiative</i>&#151;a package of measures aimed at reducing the environmental impact of pesticides.

 It is Ministry of Defence policy that all requests for information should be handled in accordance with the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information. Accordingly, there is no specific person to whom such requests need to be addressed. The MOD Internet site gives contact points for some subjects that attract frequent requests for information, an e-mail address for other enquiries and an address for the Ministerial Correspondence Unit. Our Information Leaflet "MOD and Open Government" is currently being revised to update the contact details and other information given there. In the meantime, Appendix 6 to the Lord Chancellor's Monitoring Report for 2001 gives details for the section which has the policy lead in MOD on the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information.

 The Ministry of Defence meets the requirement to report past performance and future spending plans to Parliament by producing two separate documents&#151;the Government's Expenditure Plans (published in the spring), and the Departmental Performance Report (published in the autumn).

<a name="20919w74.html_para1">The costs of printing and publishing these reports are largely borne by The Stationery Office, with whom the contract for producing Command Papers is held. The Stationery Office recoups these costs on a commercial basis through sales of the Reports, including those copies purchased by the MOD for its own use. The MOD also pays for any additional printing or publication costs not covered by the contract with The Stationery Office. Where these costs are readily identifiable they are shown in the following table. The remaining data are not held centrally and could only be provided at disproportionate cost.

Abbey Wood opened in 1995 with the relocation of the then Procurement Executive. Over 500 staff were recruited locally in 1995&#150;96. Now over 5,800 people work at the site; this will rise to over 6,800 in late 2002 with the further co-location of Warship Support Agency staff. In April 1994 there were 294 Full Time Equivalent civilian posts in the Bristol Travel To Work Area, which had increased to 4,039 Full Time Equivalent civilian posts by July 2001 largely as a result of the creation of the Abbey Wood headquarters.

<a name="20919w74.html_para4">The Ministry of Defence does not routinely impose a requirement for a standard level of professional indemnity insurance in contracts with small consultants. Most consultants will take out professional indemnity insurance with a policy value consistent with the risks associated with their business. Unless there are compelling business reasons to the contrary, MOD would not wish to interfere in this decision.




<P>
<P><I>19 Sept 2002 : Column 308W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="20919w74.html_para5">As MOD does not routinely impose a requirement for a standard level of professional indemnity insurance, then the question of exceptions to a standard level does not usually arise. However, MOD would not wish to allow any variations in the levels of professional indemnity insurance which could distort competition or could in any other way be seen as discriminatory. Inevitably, some contracts do carry special risks and, in these cases, it may be beneficial on value for money grounds for the MOD to exclude or limit the contractor's liability. Finally, as with previous Administrations, it is not this Government's practice to provide details of discussions that form part of the process of policy development and analysis.

 No receipts from the profit share arrangements have so far been received for properties released at Colchester. 46 properties passed to Annington at the time of the sale in 1996 did not trigger a profit share payment when sold.

<a name="20919w77.html_para5">More than 12,000 properties have been released to Annington to date. 8,716 properties have subsequently been sold by Annington.

<a name="20919w77.html_para6">The sale to Anningtons of 57,428 properties in England and Wales raised &#163;1.662 billion for the Exchequer. The average price per dwelling was approximately &#163;29,000.

 <i>[holding answer 24 July 2002]:</i> I refer the hon. Member to the answer given on 9 July 2002 <i>Official Report</i>, column 848W) to my hon. Friend the Member for Hull, North (Mr. McNamara). The specific information requested concerning the origin of soldiers suffering injury-related deaths and the precise location of these deaths is not held centrally and could only be provided at disproportionate cost. However, between 1 January 1990 and 23 July 2002 there have been 188 reported deaths of Army personnel due to the discharge of firearms. Again, information on the weapon involved in each case is not held centrally and could only be provided at disproportionate cost.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how many retired disabled officers in receipt of a pension granted on account of medical unfitness attributable to military service have been assessed by the War Pensions Agency as having a 0 per cent. level of disability.  [72852]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20919w77.html_spnew7"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 Attributable disablement pensions may be awarded to officers and other ranks under either the War Pension Scheme (WPS) or the Armed Forces Pension Scheme (AFPS). Under the WPS, War Disablement Pensions or Gratuities would not be awarded in cases where the level of disability is assessed at 0 per cent. Under the AFPS, a Service Attributable Pension would similarly not be paid for conditions where the level of disability is assessed at 0 per cent. Service Invaliding Pensions may be in payment for attributable conditions at 0 per cent. but we could only establish the numbers involved by a review of individual files. The costs of such an exercise would be disproportionate.

The WLI accepted referrals from 17 November 2000 to 31 March 2001. Treatments were undertaken up to 30 June 2001 and only exceptionally beyond that date. The budget for the initiative was &#163;2.5 million.

Because of the number of hospitals participating in the scheme nation-wide and the number of patients treated, invoices submitted covered variable time periods with some information being provided months after treatments. Consequently, neither the invoice values nor payments made relate directly to individual months and it is not possible to provide a breakdown of the number of patients treated and the associated costs on such a basis. The total amount paid to the contractors for the WLI was some &#163;2.2 million.<P>

Further contracts were placed with the same independent sector healthcare providers for the MOD Rapid Treatment Initiative (RTI). Referrals were accepted during a four-week period in January 2002. Most treatments were completed by 31 March 2002 with a number remaining to be undertaken in June and July. The budget for the Initiative was &#163;1.1 million.<P>

The Initiative was open to Service patients requiring simple acute procedures, who were expected to be fit for normal duties within six months of treatment and who had at least 18 months left to serve in the Armed Forces. The total number of referrals into the scheme by Service was:<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="20919w78.html_spnew2"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The Ministry of Defence does not recognise "Gulf War Syndrome" as a medical condition. It accepts that some veterans of the 1990&#150;91 Gulf conflict 



<P>
<P><I>19 Sept 2002 : Column 321W</I><P>
have become ill and that many believe this ill health is unusual and related to their Gulf experience. A large number of multi-system, multi-organ, non-specific, medically unexplained symptoms have been reported by some Gulf veterans as well as recognised medical conditions. The overwhelming consensus of the scientific and medical community is that there is insufficient evidence to enable this ill-health to be characterised as a unique illness, condition or "syndrome". With the exception of certain infectious diseases that are notifiable by statute, primary care doctors in England and Wales do not report centrally illnesses experienced by their patients. Therefore, the MOD is not able to assess the number of Gulf veterans in the Portsmouth, South constituency who have reported illnesses to their doctors. MOD is advised of cancer registrations in England, Wales and Scotland. We have published data on the incidence of cancer-related deaths in Gulf veterans as compared to a comparable group of Service personnel who did not deploy to the Gulf. Gulf veterans who wish to be examined by a physician expert in Gulf veterans' illnesses can be referred by their doctors to the Gulf Veterans' Medical Assessment Programme (GVMAP) which is funded by the MOD. As of 18 July 2002, 16 Gulf veterans had been seen at the GVMAP who were recorded as living in the Portsmouth, South constituency. Of these 12 were assessed as well at the time of their consultation.

 The White Paper on the Strategic Defence Review: A New Chapter, Cm5566, addressed this issue (paragraphs 31&#150;32 and 91). Since the Strategic Defence Review (SDR) was published in 1998 the risk of large scale conflict in Europe has further reduced, and relations with Russia have seen a step change improvement. But we have also routinely deployed our Armed Forces on more operations concurrently than we envisaged in the SDR, though the scale of these deployments has been in some respects smaller than we envisaged at the time of the SDR. That has created the risk of overburdening key enabling units, who are essential for all expeditionary deployments (for example, communicators, engineers and movements personnel).

 Discussions on this broad ranging topic take place routinely both bilaterally and in multilateral fora.

Specifically in the defence manufacturing co-operation field, along with our colleagues in France, Germany, Italy, Spain and Sweden, we signed the Letter of Intent Framework Agreement in July 2000 related to measures to facilitate the restructuring and operation of the European defence industry. This Agreement represents a commitment by the six nations to remove obstacles to industrial restructuring and co-operation.

 The expectation is of six centres being launched, in two tranches of three each, with the Ministry of Defence funding of up to &#163;5 million per cent.re per year. The supplier consortia are also expected to contribute funding. This investment will result in centres of expertise, focused in industry and academia, in technologies of importance to Defence. MOD will ensure that the centres' outputs can be transitioned effectively into equipment programmes for the United Kingdom Armed Forces. Beyond that, the consortia will own the intellectual property and be encouraged to exploit it in wider markets.

It is therefore too early to suggest a particular specification or timetable for the chosen solution's construction, but the capability is expected to enter service later this decade.

 We are monitoring the developments in submarine air independent propulsion technologies. Our Maritime Underwater Future Capability programme is looking into the range of future capabilities required by the United Kingdom for the control and denial of the underwater battlespace into the third and fourth decades of the century. We will be considering a wide range of concepts, including innovative solutions combining unmanned underwater vehicles, ships, airborne and land assets, as well as submarines. Our studies will assess the alternative future power source technologies for submarines and unmanned underwater vehicles, but it is too early to make any decisions.

 Watchkeeper is being acquired to increase the capability of the Armed Forces to undertake Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance tasks. Watchkeeper will principally support land commanders from Battlegroup to Divisional level and will meet a significant proportion of their intelligence and information requirements. The Watchkeeper system will comprise UAVs, sensor packages and associated facilities on the ground to collate, exploit and disseminate the information gathered. The numbers and types of UAVs and the architecture of the overall system are currently being examined in the assessment phase where operational and technical risks are being identified and minimised. We would expect to spend around &#163;860 million acquiring the Watchkeeper system.

 United Kingdom maritime forces normally operate as part of a Task Group, which protects itself against air attack through a series of "layered" defences. Task Groups typically include Type 42 Anti-Air Warfare Destroyers and Type 22 and 23 Frigates equipped with air defence capability. Many other Task Group warships will also include air defence assets for self protection and decoy systems against air and surface launched anti-ship missiles. The Type 42 Destroyers will be replaced by the Type 45 Destroyers, fitted with the highly capable Principle Anti-Air Missile System (PAAMS). The First of Class Type 45 Destroyer is planned to enter service from late 2007. The first upgraded AEW Sea King Flight will go to sea later this year and will provide a marked improvement in capability to detect airborne threats to the Task Group over both sea and land.

<a name="20919w80.html_spnew8"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The United Kingdom military aircraft sector is efficient, innovative and highly competitive, and with these qualities it has very strong potential for success in the future. Given the importance of the industry for the supply of equipment to our Armed Forces, not to mention its role as a significant employer, the Government has of course a close interest in its success. The industry already benefits from a large programme of Ministry of Defence work on projects including JSF, Eurofighter, Nimrod, A400M and Apache. Future programmes such as the Future Strategic Transport Aircraft project are also likely to result in a significant programme of work for UK

<a name="20919w80.html_para5">The Government is committed to investing in defence research and technology in partnership with industry, which is crucial in sustaining a viable and competitive industrial base long-term, while focusing more effectively on areas where we achieve best return and where UK industry can be world class.

 Since February 1999 the Ministry of Defence has conducted research into the feasibility of introducing a ground-to-ground target identification system. As a result we have successfully demonstrated a Battlefield Target Identification Device (BTID): We are now fully engaged with our NATO allies as part of the US-led Advanced Concept Technology Demonstrator programme, which aims to develop a joint coalition concept of operations and to demonstrate interoperability amongst national BTID prototype solutions. A decision on whether to introduce a ground-to-ground target identification system has yet to be made.

 Information on the number of patients waiting over six months and over 12 months for elective admission at National Health Service trusts in England as at 31 May 2002 has been placed in the Library. The trusts are ranked, with the trust with the highest number of six month waits at the top.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what action his Department is taking to improve services for pulmonary rehabilitation for those suffering from chronic respiratory diseases.  [72928]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20919w81.html_spnew9"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 We are aware that provision of pulmonary rehabilitation is a service increasingly offered by local departments of respiratory medicine.

<P>

<a name="20919w81.html_para2">It is a decision for primary care trusts, in partnership with other local stakeholders, to assess the health needs of their populations, including those needing pulmonary rehabilitation, and to commission services to meet those needs.
<P>

<a name="20919w81.html_para3">We have also commissioned the National Institute for Clinical Excellence to prepare clinical guidelines for the National Health Service in England and Wales for the prevention, diagnosis, management and treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. It is expected that the guidelines should be issued around February 2004.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will make a statement on the practice of hospital appointments officers deferring putting patients on waiting lists until a time nearer an available appointment, with particular reference to the case of Mr. William Wood of Solihull.  [73449]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20919w81.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 Patients referred for a first outpatient appointment with a consultant should be placed on the outpatient waiting list from the date the referral was received by the Trust. Inpatients should be placed on the inpatient list from the date a consultant makes a decision to admit.
<P>

<a name="20919w81.html_para4">Unfortunately, Birmingham Heartlands and Solihull National Health Service trust have been unable to identify the individual patient referred to. Mr. Woods may wish to contact the trust, who would be happy to look into his circumstances. Alternatively, if the hon. Member would like to write to me giving further details and Mr. Wood's written consent to investigate, I will instruct my officials to look into the matter further.

 Awareness about this condition has developed relatively recently nevertheless, there are already some specialised National Health Service sleep disorder services being developed.

<P>
<a name="20919w82.html_spnew10"><B> Ms. Blears </B> 
 Where donated sperm, eggs or embryos are used in assisted conception treatment, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority's (HFEA) code of practice and the authority's operating procedures put the utmost importance on the welfare of the child to be conceived. A treating clinic must comply with this requirement when choosing the donor to be used. If it does not do so, the HFEA will consider the appropriate action to take, including placing conditions on, or suspending or revoking, the clinic's licence.

 The importation of donor sperm is subject to special directions issued by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) in each case. The reasons for the importation must be clearly stated, and the use of the sperm must comply with the requirements that the HFEA places on all treatment involving donated gametes.

<P>
<a name="20919w82.html_spnew12"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 Schedule 2 paragraph 4 of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990 prohibits the alteration of the genetic structure of a cell while it forms part of an embryo.

 <i>[holding answer 23 July 2002]:</i> Asthma is a priority area for the Medical Research Council (MRC) and it supports a wide range of research projects looking at asthma ranging from basic research to applied clinical studies. The MRC spend in the area in 2000&#150;01 was approximately &#163;3 million. Under the terms of the Concordat, the Health Departments will be meeting with the MRC later this year. Respiratory disease will be a major item for discussion at this meeting.

 In May 2002, we welcomed the publication of the Government funded national sentinel audit of epilepsy-related death. The audit looked at investigations into epilepsy deaths, care provided prior to death and contact with bereaved families. We have given a commitment to consider in full the recommendations of the audit and to develop an action plan later this year to address the key issues. It will need to take account of and feed into a range of other initiatives including the national service framework for long term conditions (NSF), which will have a focus on neurological conditions such as epilepsy. We expect to meet with the epilepsy voluntary organisations shortly, and will consult with others as appropriate.

<a name="20919w84.html_para3">The Department is also undertaking a range of other initiatives to improve services for the care and management of people with epilepsy. For example, we have:

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>
<BR>
Asked NICE to develop a clinical guideline, due in summer 2004, for the diagnosis, management and treatment of epilepsy to help address widespread variations in clinical practice and contribute to the improvement of services. This will be supported by a technology appraisal, due autumn 2003, of the clinical and cost effectiveness of new anti-epileptic drugs in children and adults, to help promote appropriate uptake and equitable access.
<BR>
Announced that the NSF for long term conditions is expected to develop standards of care for specific neurological conditions, including epilepsy. The NSF is currently planned for publication in 2004 and implementation is expected to start from 2005.
<BR>
Developed the expert patients programme, which aims to provide training in self-management skills for people with long term chronic conditions. The first pilot phase will include people with epilepsy.
<BR>
Provided funding to the Joint Epilepsy Council (JEC) to develop its <i>National Statement of Good Practice for the Treatment and Care of People who have Epilepsy</i>, which was published in May 2002. The statement makes a series of recommendations for good quality epilepsy services. It is intended to facilitate commissioning and will be of use to NHS purchasers, providers and service users.
<BR>
Provided funding to the National Society for Epilepsy for its <i>Living Well</i> Project. The project aims to promote independent living by providing locally based short-term courses for people with epilepsy to develop self-help and self-management techniques.

 In the 2002 budget the Government set a target of recruiting 35,000 nurses, 15,000 doctors and 35,000 scientists and therapists. They will become part of the continuing drive to recruit more health professionals for the National Health Service.
<P>

<a name="20919w84.html_para5">The Department fully supports the need for an increase in the number of neurologists. Recommendations by the medical workforce review team are for the numbers of consultants in neurology to grow by some 50 per cent. by 2010, from 326 in 2001 to 496 in 2010, and some of those consultants may choose to specialise in epilepsy.
<P>

<a name="20919w84.html_para6">There are already about 100 epilepsy specialist nursing posts which have been developed in both hospital and community settings. Primary care trusts will be able to decide about the level of future demand in this area. They are best placed to understand local health needs and commission services to meet them.

 Increasing participation in sport and physical recreation has an important role to play in raising the rates of physical activity and improving public health. The importance of physical activity is recognised in the NHS Plan and national service frameworks. The national service framework (NSF) for coronary heart disease (CHD) requires the National Health Service, working closely with local authorities, to develop local programmes of effective policies on increasing physical activity.
<P>

<a name="20919w85.html_para0">The Health Development Agency has issued guidance to support the preventive aspects of the NSF for CHD. The document contained examples of effective interventions and set out who should be involved in the development of these programmes, including sport and leisure partners. Last year, we also published a national quality assurance framework for exercise referral systems. These schemes rely on close liaison and partnership working between health and leisure professionals.

This is the key to getting the right care, in the right place, at the right time for all patients.

 My right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer's Budget statement on 17 April 2002 announced unprecedented annual average increases for the National Health Service in England of 7.3 per cent. per annum over five years from 2003&#150;04 to 2007&#150;08, on the basis of stage 1 resource budgeting. This is the level of increase recommended by the Wanless report under its "fully engaged" scenario. We are currently considering how best to take forward the other recommendations of the Wanless report.

 We are committed to an ambitious programme of new Diagnosis and Treatment Centres (DTCs). Some are on course to be developed as part of PFI projects, others through the use of public capital. We expect local National Health Service authorities to develop proposals based on sources of funding which offer the best value for money and speed of implementation. The ability to provide public funding for a part of a PFI scheme will depend on the degree of separability (and inter-dependence) of the DTC elements from the rest of the scheme.

 If the usual open tendering processes had been used for the procurement of smallpox vaccine, the complete process is likely to have taken as long as four to five months to complete. Potential suppliers must first submit an expression of interest in response to the 37-day advertisement in the <i>Official Journal</i> of European Communities and must accompany that expression with evidence requested by the contracting organisation. From those who satisfy this first stage, tenders would be invited from some or all, and a period of 40 days is usually allowed for potential bidders to submit bids. There then follows a period during which the tenders are evaluated, terms agreed and a contract is prepared.

<P>
<a name="20919w88.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 There are a variety of programmes on promoting healthy eating and physical activity, and reducing overweight and obesity which are being developed as part of the national service framework for coronary heart disease. This includes local Five-a-Day community initiatives, based in deprived areas, which provide education about the health benefits of fruit and vegetables, as well as improved access and availability. To increase awareness of the importance of diet and exercise among children, we have a healthy schools programme that aims to promote better health for all children and young people through education on a range of issues.

<a name="20919w88.html_para3">The Government also acknowledge the setting up of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Obesity, which will increase political and wider public attention to the issue. There are other organisations and charities such as the British dietetic association, the obesity awareness and solutions trust and weight concern who are raising awareness about the problem of obesity and are supported through the Department's Section 64 Grant Scheme.

 The accident and emergency departments rarely use ICD-10 to record patients.

 It is for individual councils with social services responsibilities and National Health Service bodies to decide, in the light of their priorities, how much to spend on child protection services.

 The Government have revised and widely distributed their child protection guidance <i>Working Together to Safeguard Children.</i> This document sets out how all agencies and professionals should work together to promote children's welfare and protect them from abuse and neglect. It is addressed to those who work in the health and education services, the police, social services, the probation service, and others whose work brings them into contact with children and families. All

those who work with children and families are expected to retain a clear focus on the welfare of the child and be alert to, and know how to respond quickly and decisively to, potential indicators of abuse and neglect. This greater awareness should make it easier for children to be heard when they report abuse and neglect.

the appointment of the first ever Children's Rights Director for England&#151;Roger Morgan&#151;to act as a powerful champion for some of the most vulnerable children in our country, and to monitor and review the effectiveness of the arrangements in relation to dealing with complaints and representations made by, or on behalf of, children about regulated children's services.
<BR>
the Education Act 2002, which places a statutory requirement on Local Education Authorities and the governing bodies of schools and further education institutions to have arrangements to ensure that their functions are exercised with a view to safeguarding and promoting the welfare of children, and to have regard to guidance issued by my right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State when drawing up those arrangements. These new duties will reinforce schools' responsibility to have effective arrangements for identifying and responding to signs of neglect and abuse.
<BR>
the participation of children and young people in day to day decision making as a key principle underpinning the Government's <i>Quality Protects</i> Programme. Objective 8 of the Government's objectives for children's social services says that local authorities should enhance the involvement of young people in the planning and delivery of services, and in decisions which affect their daily lives, including giving children and young people access to independent advocacy services and mechanisms for speeding up the complaints procedure.

<a name="20919w88.html_para8">Area child protection committees are responsible for deciding what child protection information and advice to make available to members of their local community. However, leaflets advising adults what to do when they have concerns about the welfare of a child or that a child may be suffering, or at risk of suffering, abuse or neglect have also been produced on a national basis by a number of voluntary organisations. These include the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children's <i>Handle with Care</i> (about the dangers of shaking babies) and <i>Partners in Protecting Children</i>.

 The Food Standards Agency (FSA) has recently reviewed whether it would be possible to divide the Burry Inlet into zones in order to permit cockles to be gathered in parts of the estuary. Taking expert advice into account, the FSA does not currently consider the Burry Inlet to be suitable for dividing into zones at this time due a number of issues but primarily due to the erratic pattern of the results for the toxin detection on both sides of the Inlet. The FSA is keeping the situation in the Burry Inlet under review and will continue to liase with the local enforcement agencies and industry.

 <i>[holding answer 23 July 2002]:</i> The national computerised call/recall system for cervical screening was introduced in 1988. Women aged 20 to 64 are invited for a free cervical screening test every three to five years. Women over 65 are invited if their previous two tests were not clear or if they have never been screened.
<P>

 <i>[holding answer 23 July 2002]:</i> Three and a half million women aged 20&#150;64 were tested for cervical cancer in 2000&#150;01. 9.7 per cent. of smears were inadequate. Approximately 6.3 per cent. of women were recalled as a result of a previous inadequate smear.

 <i>[holding answer 23 July 2002]:</i> Some individual National Health Service trusts have submitted "cases of need" in relation to the national allocation of 50 additional computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners as outlined in the NHS Cancer Plan. However it is the responsibility of individual cancer networks in partnership with their health authorities to determine the degree of need for their respective populations with regard to access to CT and MRI scanners. There are three cancer networks in the north west, all whom are fully engaged in discussions with the Department and Directorate of Health and Social Care North in assessing the need for CT and MRI scanners.
<P>

<a name="20919w92.html_para3">One of the factors in establishing criteria for the allocation of additional equipment will be the relative provision of CT and MRI services to the population served, together with the efficient use of existing scanners.

<P>
<a name="20919w92.html_spnew6"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 The role of the second opinion appointed doctor (SOAD) is to provide an additional safeguard to patient's rights. The Mental Health Act 1983 under Section 58 provides that certain forms of medical treatment for mental disorder <sup>1</sup>  require either the patient's consent or a second opinion. In the absence of the patient's consent, and if the treatment falls within the provisions of Section 58, the doctor in charge of the patient's treatment will request a second opinion to certify the treatment proposed.
<P>

<a name="20919w92.html_para5">The SOAD must decide whether the patient is in fact refusing the treatment or incapable of making a decision on it and whether the treatment should be given. The SOAD acts as an individual and must come to his or her own independent opinion as to whether or not the treatment is a reasonable one.
<P>

<a name="20919w92.html_para6">In order to form his or her own opinion the SOAD is statutorily obliged to consult with a nurse and another non-nursing/medical professional, both of whom have been professionally concerned with the patient's medical treatment. The SOAD should also interview the patient in private and the doctor in charge of the treatment as well as considering the medical notes and statutory detention documents.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>

 <sup>1</sup> Section 58 relates to the administration of the following forms of treatment in the absence of consent: Electro-Convulsive Therapy at any time; and Medication for mental disorder if three months or more have elapsed since the first administration of medication.

 At present the Commission arranges approximately 9,000 second opinions per year and aims to offer second opinion appointed doctors (SOADs) approximately 50 opinions each per year. This equates to a panel size of 180.
<P>

<a name="20919w92.html_para7">At present there are 156 SOADs, compared to 172 at this time last year. The panel size is expected to increase as a result of a forthcoming recruitment exercise. The Commission is also planning to undertake an exercise to consider its current establishment against the number of second opinions requested from each hospital and unit. This will enable the Commission to "weight" each hospital and recruit accordingly.

 The data collected prior to January 2000 is not considered comparable or reliable. The way in which information was collected regionally varied and often the data was incomplete or inaccurate.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what steps the Government take to promote nursing as a profession.  [72444]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20919w94.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The Government are implementing a range of measures to promote careers in the National Health Service, including nurses. These include increasing pay, encouraging the NHS to become a better employer through the <i>Improving Working Lives and Positively Diverse</i> programmes, increasing training commissions, reducing student attrition, running national and local recruitment and return to practice campaigns, and supporting international recruitment where appropriate. Further information on improving working lives is available at www.doh.gov.uk/iwl.
<P>

<a name="20919w94.html_para3">The NHS Careers service was established in April 1999 by the Department to provide accurate and up-to-date information on careers throughout the NHS and to promote nursing as a profession. It has a website www.nhs.uk/careers through which publications can be ordered.
<P>

<a name="20919w94.html_para4">This year's national recruitment campaign ran from 13 February for six weeks and was aimed primarily at raising the profile and the recruitment, retention and return of nurses. Over 51,000 contacts, primarily interested in nursing careers were received at NHS Careers.

<P>

<a name="20919w94.html_para5">Since 1997, the nursing workforce has grown by 31,520. Between September 1999 and September 2001 there was a net increase in nurses working in the NHS of 20,740&#151;the NHS Plan target has been reached two years early. The number of applicants to nurse training has also increased with 40,908 being received in the academic year 2000&#150;01 as opposed to 18,732 in 1997&#150;98.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what action is being taken by NHS trusts to reduce assaults on nurses.  [61447]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20919w94.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 Significant action has been taken at both national and local levels to tackle the problem of violence as part of the cross-Government National Health Service zero tolerance zone campaign. Many NHS trusts have taken the opportunity to launch local campaigns with a focus on specific areas of concern.
<P>

<a name="20919w94.html_para6">Recent surveys conducted in the NHS indicate that almost all NHS trusts have now published policies for reducing the incidence of violence, and also provide evidence that a wide range of measures are being introduced by employers to tackle this problem. These include the installation or upgrading of hospital CCTV systems, other changes to the physical environment and the provision of safety awareness training to staff. Many trusts have also reviewed the support available to staff when violent incidents do occur.
<P>

<a name="20919w94.html_para7">For the first time ever, new money has been allocated specifically to support the efforts of managers and staff in tackling violence in the NHS. The new funding is expected to be matched by employers, which means that over the three years over &#163;3 million will be invested in new initiatives to protect staff. The money is supporting a range of initiatives from making improvements to risk assessment process to the purchase of personal alarms. In 2001&#150;02, over &#163;791,110 central funding has been invested to support 173 new local measures to protect staff.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will collate statistics on the number of <i>(a)</i> British and <i>(b)</i> foreign nurses practising in the UK who carry HIV. [73444]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20919w94.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 There is currently no requirement on National Health Service employers to offer or require an HIV test prior to employment of nurses, whether recruited from the United Kingdom or abroad. Therefore, information on the number of HIV infected nurses (of any nationality) working in the NHS is currently not collected centrally.
<P>

<a name="20919w94.html_para8">The Department is considering the recommendations of an ad hoc expert group set up to assess the potential health risk posed to patients by health care workers new to the NHS infected with serious communicable diseases, including HIV. Implementation of any resulting change in policy would include consideration of monitoring needs.

<P>
<a name="20919w94.html_wqn6"><B> Tim Loughton: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health, pursuant to his answer of 18 July 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, column 536W, how many of the nurse, midwife and health visitor consultant posts being approved have been taken up by experienced nurses who have returned to the NHS following a substantial period outside the profession.  [72838]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20919w94.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hutton </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 24 July 2002]:</i> The information requested is not collected centrally.
<P>

<a name="20919w94.html_para9">The nature of nurse consultant posts demand a portfolio of career-long learning, experience and formal education, usually up to or beyond masters degree level including research experience and a record of scholarship. Most nurses who have had a substantial period of time outside the profession are unlikely to have the relevant recent experience required for nurse consultant posts.

 <i>[holding answer 23 July 2002]:</i> We are currently working with multi professional groups in prosthetic and orthotic services and looking at ways of enhancing patient care through programmes such as the action on orthopaedics and the work of the prosthetic strategic supply group. We will consider in due course, whether any outcomes of this work can be issued as appropriate guidance to the National Health Service.
<P>

<a name="20919w94.html_para10">We are also working with the Modernisation Agency to improve wheelchair services and to spread best practice across the country. Several national groups, with an interest, have been working on standards for the wheelchair service. As the collaborative work progresses, we will review whether one such standard could be given Departmental endorsement.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what contingency arrangements <i>(a)</i> his Department and <i>(b)</i> the National Care Standards Commission have made to advise care home managers concerning their legal obligations in respect of staff awaiting the results of a criminal record check after 1 August; how many care home staff are awaiting a clearance check by the Criminal Records Bureau; how long they have been waiting; and what action a home failing to comply with staffing regulations because of delays by the Criminal Records Bureau will be required to take.  [71202]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20919w95.html_spnew1"><B> Jacqui Smith </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 22 July 2002]:</i> All the statutory regulations are immediately accessible on the Department's website and the National Care Standards Commission (NCSC) internet website. The Care Homes Regulations were published in December 2001 following extensive consultation and were immediately placed on the Department's website.
<P>

<a name="20919w95.html_para1">The NCSC wrote to all pre-existing care homes on 8 March 2002 with a guide to the application of the Care Standards Act. The guide included general information about legal requirements, including the requirement for care homes to obtain criminal records checks on staff. The guide included addresses for obtaining more information. The guide also included an application form for providers 



<P>
<P><I>19 Sept 2002 : Column 386W</I><P>
to apply for the relevant national standards document. Each set of national standards includes the appropriate regulations at the back.
<P>

<a name="20919w95.html_para2">The NCSC sent a registration pack to all unregistered care homes in February 2002 and sends a registration pack to all new applicants. The pack advises applicants to check the legal requirements before submitting their application to the NCSC.
<P>

<a name="20919w95.html_para3">In addition, the NCSC wrote to all providers in June reminding them of their obligations. This information can be found on the NCSC's website, which also sets out guidance to help providers manage their staff recruitment until the Criminal Records Bureau is fully meeting its targets. The NCSC has also co-operated with the care homes' umbrella organisations, to arrange for publication of this information on their internal sites.

<a name="20919w95.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Burstow: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health what representations he has received in connection with the implementation of standards 21.3 and 22.2 of the National Minimum Standards for Care Homes for Older People; if he will place them in the Library; what assessment he has made of the impact of standards 21.3 and 22.2 of the National Minimum Standards for Care Homes for Older People on the availability of beds in residential care and nursing homes; what estimate he has

made of the impact on the number of care homes of the requirement of complying with the National Minimum Standards for Care Homes for Older People; and what estimate he has made of the average amount that each care home will have to spend in order to comply with the National Minimum Standards for Care Homes for Older People.  [65040]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20919w95.html_spnew2"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 The information requested is not easily available. The Department has received a large number of letter about national standards from care home owners, their representatives and other interested parties. Some of these letters include reference to paragraph 21.3 or paragraph 22.2 or both. Separating out all those letters which mention these paragraphs and placing them in the Library would involve disproportionate cost.
<P>

<a name="20919w95.html_para4">On 23 July my right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State for Health announced his intention to issue for consultation an amended set of physical environment standards. The aim of the amendments is to remove the requirement for care homes which existed before 1 April 2002 to conform to certain physical environment standards, including standards 21.3 and 22.2. For pre-existing care homes these standards would in future be regarded as good practice to which all care homes should aspire.

Childcare co-ordinators may cover one trust, a number of trusts, or the whole local health economy, including the primary care trusts. We expect that by April 2003, all NHS staff will have access to the services of a childcare co-ordinator to offer support and advice to parents working in the NHS.

 <i>[holding answer 22 July 2002]:</i> We have issued National Minimum Standards across the range of children's services. The standards for fostering services, which accounts for two thirds of all children in care, state that the carer should be provided with a written health record for each child placed in their care, and that this should be updated during the period of the placement. In addition, before a placement begins, the carer should be provided with as full a description as possible of the health needs of a child and clear procedures governing consent for the child to receive medical treatment. Where it is an agency placement, the responsible authority should 



<P>

 <i>[holding answer 23 July 2002]:</i> As my right hon.

 <i>[holding answer 17 June 2002]:</i> Passive personal alarm systems and other such technology that detects unusual patterns of domestic activity, wandering and unlit gas are a useful addition to the field of dementia care. Use may reduce or postpone admissions to residential or nursing care and can improve the quality of life for carers.

Section 2 tribunals must be heard within 7 days of the application being received in the office.

Non-restricted cases are listed as speedily as possible but no earlier than 3 weeks after receipt because the Responsible Authority has three weeks under the provisions of the Mental Health Act 1983 in which to provide reports for the Tribunal. Before October 2001, the non-restricted tribunals were required to be listed within 8 weeks of the application being received in the office. Subsequent case law requires the tribunal to be less rigid, and to list speedily taking into account the circumstances of individual cases

<P>
<a name="20919w97.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hutton </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 23 July 2002]:</i> As part of the Department's commitment to improving access to primary care nationally, we have increased the primary care trust primary care access fund by &#163;83.5 million to &#163;168 million, with at least &#163;48 million dedicated in 2002&#150;03 to improving access in primary care and implementing advanced access. Richmond and Twickenham Primary Care Trust has received &#163;150,000 from the primary care access fund.
<P>

<a name="20919w97.html_para8">In 1997 the Kingston and Richmond Health Authority used improvement grants to fund schemes that improved physical access to surgeries and improved communications with surgeries.
<P>

<a name="20919w97.html_para9">From 1998 the new primary care organisations within Richmond and Twickenham began to work with local general practitioners (GPs) to explore new ways of working. Teddington, Twickenham and Hamptons successfully bid to participate in the national primary care collaborative focussing on improved coronary heart disease (CHD) care, improving access to primary care and managing capacity. Funding available for this scheme totalled &#163;149,000 over two years. This has allowed primary care teams to scrutinise the demand on their services and look to manage that demand using a variety of methods including telephone triage/consultations by GPs, nurse triage, changing the skill mix by employing health assistants. A further &#163;110,000 was spent on innovative projects that focused on partnership developments, for example, with the voluntary sector, community pharmacy, to improve access by ensuring that patients were seen by the right professional in the right place.
<P>

<a name="20919w97.html_para10">The programme extends from pilot sites and is being extended to the whole of Richmond. Available resources this year are &#163;150,000 and will be spent on further improving access.
<P>

<a name="20919w97.html_para11">The primary care organisations continued to support the improvements of physical access to surgeries by investment in for example, induction loops, tactile signage, and ramps. In 2001&#150;02 at least &#163;220,000 was invested in this area.

 This Department does not collect information about private patients treated in private hospitals.

 We have agreed as part of the framework for the new consultant contract that there will be contractual provisions governing the relationship between private practice and National Health Service commitments. These provisions will be based on the principle that an NHS consultant's commitment to the NHS must take priority over any work undertaken for other organisations and designed to minimise the potential for actual or perceived conflicts of interest. One of the key principles is that consultants should not allow private practice to disrupt the provision of NHS services or have any adverse impact on NHS performance or delivery of NHS commitments. The detail of the provisions is under discussion, but we have agreed that the areas covered by the new rules will include the transfer of patients between the NHS and private sector, and management of NHS waiting lists.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what criteria he applies when deciding whether NHS hospital trust mergers may proceed.  [67187]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20919100.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 Proposals to merge National Health Service trusts are given careful consideration at all stages to ensure the best interests of patients. Among the criteria considered by my right Hon. Friend, the Secretary of State before agreeing that trust mergers may proceed are:

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>
<BR>
Assurance that patients' interests are fully safeguarded;
<BR>
Assurance that clinical quality will be maintained, or improved, uniformly across the whole area;
<BR>
Evidence derived from the health impact assessment;
<BR>
Outcome of local public consultation;
<BR>
Evidence of support for the merger from within the NHS;
<BR>
Any specific service issues;
<BR>
Implications for staff;
<BR>
Financial considerations.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will make a statement on the process used to grade hospitals on the 19 elements of the patient environment inspection programme, with specific reference to how each element is weighted in the final assessment.  [71861]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20919100.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 Since publication of the NHS Plan, patient environment action teams (PEATs) teams have undertaken four rounds of assessment visits to acute NHS trusts each evaluating performance and progress against 19 separate elements. Scores are combined to produce a 



<P>
<P><I>19 Sept 2002 : Column 406W</I><P>
rating. Each element of the patient environment was scored on a scale of one to four, where one is poor and four is excellent.
<P>

<a name="20919100.html_para0">On the question of weighting; whilst every aspect of the assessment is important, we recognise that patients will see some areas as of greater importance than others. For this reason, in determining the final rating a hospital receives, particular attention is paid to the hospital's performance in areas of ward cleanliness, tidiness and decoration and the condition of ward furniture so that defects in these areas are not masked by good performance in other areas of assessment.
<P>

<a name="20919100.html_para1">The clean hospitals programme has had a clear impact on standards of cleanliness, decoration and supporting services. Hospitals up and down the country have responded magnificently to this, the biggest clean-up campaign in the history of the National Health Service, to the extent that by October last year there were no hospitals in England where cleaning standards were found to be less than acceptable. The latest round of PEAT visits have recently been completed and the results will be available shortly.

 Guidelines on hand hygiene were issued to the National Health Service in January 2000 and trusts are expected to have a policy in place for compliance with hand hygiene which should be audited by the local infection control team. Details of the arrangements in place at each trust are also available to the Commission for Health Improvement as part of its clinical governance review process and to the Audit Commission in their reviews of provider care.

 National Health Service hospital trusts are expected to have a policy in place for the isolation of patients with infectious diseases and are responsible for determining the level of provision of isolation and single rooms. The use of isolation facilities and barrier nursing, like other treatment decisions, will depend on the clinical judgement of the local infection control team and the clinicians involved in treating the affected patients.

 The Department does not collect information on the number of extended hospital stays as a result of adverse events nor figures on their financial cost. However, as reported in <i>An Organisation with a Memory</i>&#151;a report of an expert group on learning from adverse events chaired by the Chief Medical Officer, it is estimated that there may be around 850,000 adverse events each year in the National Health Service which research suggests may lead to three million preventable additional hospital bed days. It is estimated that extended hospital stays as a result of adverse events costs the NHS approximately &#163;2 billion a year.
<P>

<a name="20919100.html_para6">The Government established the National Patient Safety Agency in July 2001 to improve the safety of NHS patient care by promoting a culture of reporting and learning from adverse events, and to manage the national reporting system to support this function.
<P>

<a name="20919100.html_para7">By collecting and analysing data on adverse events the agency will be able to identify trends and patterns of avoidable adverse events, provide feedback to organisations to enable them to change their working practices, help develop models of good practice and systems solutions at national level and support ongoing education and learning.
<P>

<a name="20919100.html_para8">From September 2001 the National Patient Safety Agency ran a pilot in a small sample of trusts designed to test the system for collecting data on adverse incidents and near misses from the NHS.
<P>

<a name="20919100.html_para9">On 18 June 2002, the National Patient Safety Agency held a conference and presented initial findings of the pilot. The results of the data collection are preliminary 



<P>
<P><I>19 Sept 2002 : Column 410W</I><P>
and few conclusions can be drawn from this data at this stage. The agency will publish audited figures when they are available. The agency will be working to implement a national reporting system across the NHS from 2003.
<P>

<a name="20919100.html_para10">This will provide us with a firm evidence base on the scale of the problem and its financial consequences&#151;a baseline allowing us to understand the real extent and nature of adverse events, and act on that knowledge.
<P>

<a name="20919100.html_para11">The Department has set a specific target which requires the NHS by 2005 to reduce by 40 per cent. the number of serious errors in the use of prescribed drugs. The Department will shortly be publishing a report highlighting processes and individual medicines that are commonly involved in medication errors. The report will also identify a range of measures that professionals and NHS organisations can use to systematically drive down the risk of medication errors across the NHS.
<P>

<a name="20919100.html_para12">The Department has broadly welcomed the Audit Commission's report on medicines management in NHS hospitals, <i>A Spoonful of Sugar.</i> Chief pharmacists and their staff play a key part in medicines management and it is helpful to see this role highlighted. The report reinforces the Department's medicines management performance management framework.

 The fifth report (2000&#150;01) on the serious hazards of transfusion (SHOT) was published on 10 April 2002 and again indicated that blood transfusion in the United Kingdom is very safe, and amongst the safest in the world. Although the number of serious events reported, 315, had increased by 7.5 per cent. this must be seen against a total of over three million blood components transfused annually and increased participation in the scheme. Since the previous report, for 1999&#150;2000, participation in SHOT by National Health Service (NHS) trusts has increased from 72 per cent. to 92 per cent. of all hospitals. We will be looking to SHOT and the new national patient safety agency to help us take a more comprehensive approach to improving patient safety in the NHS.
<P>

<a name="20919100.html_para13">We are committed to modernising the NHS and working on systems that are shown to reduce error in clinical practice, are safe, and capable of being used effectively and universally. To this aim, there are pilot projects looking to improve the identification of patients and issue of the correct blood. The results will help to inform future research and developments in this area to improve patient care.
<P>

<a name="20919100.html_para14">In July 2002 new guidance was issued to the NHS on "Better Blood Transfusion&#151;Appropriate Use of Blood" www.doh.gov.uk/publications/coinh.html. This sets out a programme of action for the NHS to; ensure that Better Blood Transfusion is an integral part of NHS care. The guidance includes an objective to improve the safety of the blood transfusion process and calls on the NHS by December 2002, to ensure that policies on patient identification are in place, implemented and monitored throughout the blood transfusion process from prescription, sampling, laboratory testing and issue of blood to collection and administration of blood transfusion.

<a name="20919100.html_para15">In primary care technologies are already in place within general practitioner's (GP's) clinical practice system to help identify the risks involved in prescribing of drugs to patients. PRODIGY is a computer-based decision and learning support system contained within the GP practice system, which offers a series of recommendations in prescribing and organisation of treatment for conditions.
<P>

<a name="20919100.html_para16">In secondary care information for health the strategy for information services in the National Health Service recommended the introduction of electronic records into all acute trusts. Electronic prescribing systems were specifically mentioned as part of those electronic records. It is intended by 2008 that all acute trusts will have electronic prescribing systems, most acute trusts by 2005. The use of these systems will lead to a reduction in errors that can occur.
<P>

<a name="20919100.html_para17">In the pharmacy, "Pharmacy in the Future&#151;Implementing the NHS Plan", emphasised the need to re-engineer hospital pharmacy services to be more efficient, timely and safe and more patient focussed. Use of modern automation technology was seen as one way of facilitating this. This was reinforced in the Audit Commission report "A Spoonful of Sugar". Consideration is currently being given to the commissioning of a national specification for automated dispensary systems for the NHS and earmarking of funding for their introduction.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20919100.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Lammy: </B> 
 Compensation is only paid where there is a liability to do so, and payments are usually made following settlement of clinical negligence claims. According to the National Audit Office Summarised Accounts for the National Health Service (2001) a provision of &#163;4.4 billion was calculated for liabilities relating to all current clinical negligence claims and ones which may arise from incidents which have incurred but not yet been reported. These liabilities will include compensation as well as legal and other costs which are not identified separately in the accounts.

 The information requested can only be provided at a disproportionate cost. This is because the Department's Parliamentary database does not readily provide this information, which could only be obtained therefore by a manual count of the records. The Department has received over 10,000 written questions this Session so far. Even to perform the calculations on a reasonable sample would incur a disproportionate cost. A new database is being developed for the next session that should be able to provide this kind of management information on a routine basis.

<a name="20919101.html_para3">The Department fully recognises the need to ensure that hon. Members receive prompt, timely and helpful replies to their questions. Ministers make every effort to ensure that this important instrument of accountability is given the priority that it needs and deserves. Where there are regrettable delays in answering questions this stems from a proper desire to maintain high standards of accuracy and helpfulness in replies. We will, however, continue to strive to make further progress with the equally important yardstick of timeliness.

 Food insecurity in Nepal is severe and is greatest in the hill and mountain regions. There is growing concern over a possible humanitarian crisis emerging in the mid- and far-west regions of Nepal due to the initial failure of this year's monsoon in these areas.
<P>

<a name="20919102.html_para0">The situation is being made worse by the conflict. The Maoists have looted food intended for development programmes, but more seriously the army has imposed food restrictions in at least 8 districts, preventing traders from going into the hills and severely restricting the food individuals can carry. The harvest is already down in these areas because of the late monsoon, and because men did not return from seasonal work in India to take part in planting. Fear of both Maoists and security forces was the key factor. With little accurate information currently available, DFID will support more intensive monitoring by the World Food Programme.

 There are no proposals for a statement on commodity prices at the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg.
<P>

<a name="20919102.html_para3">The prices of a number of internationally traded commodities have fallen dramatically in recent years.

 During the normal course of WTO business in Geneva, there can be 26&#150;40 meetings per week which some countries must cover with a delegation of 2&#150;3 people, while others have no representation in Geneva and must follow the issues from their capital.

AITIC is a Swiss NGO which has since 1998 been supporting countries with little or no representation in Geneva by drafting briefing notes on difficult issues, offering a neutral forum for discussion, organising workshops and training seminars, running an "early warning system" on key issues, etc. The UK strongly supports this work and has made a commitment of &#163;1m to support the first phase of AITIC's work as an IGO.

 The UNHCR programme in Kenya currently assists a refugee population of over 213,000; 129,000 of whom are Somalis and 70,000 are Sudanese. The cost of the programme was over $25.2 million in 2001 (see table below), and has a budget of $18.1 million in 2002.
<P>

<a name="20919103.html_para0">UNHCR's programme aims to provide international protection and humanitarian assistance to refugees in Kenya while exploring durable solutions to assist refugees, mainly voluntary repatriation to their country of origin.
<P>

<a name="20919103.html_para1">Unfortunately local integration of refugees is extremely limited, due to limited freedom of movement, access to resources, markets and job opportunities. In addition, continued conflict in refugees' countries of origin seriously limits opportunities for repatriation. As a result, UNHCR's main activities, in cooperation with the Government of Kenya (as well as WFP, UNICEF and UNESCO), have been in providing asylum for refugees by guaranteeing their legal protection and physical security; as well as offering income generating activities, refugee employment, education, vocational training and healthcare. UNHCR also offers assistance to refugees who wish to voluntarily repatriate themselves.
<P>

<a name="20919103.html_para2">The hon. Lady's second question asked if the Secretary of State will make a statement on the UNHCR's resettlement policy in East Africa, with specific reference to Kenya. [73277]
<P>

<a name="20919103.html_para3">UNHCR's resettlement policy in East Africa, as elsewhere, is to help refugees with particular refugee needs and concerns over repatriation and local integration, to seek asylum in third countries. DFID has not discussed resettlement with UNHCR, the Kenyan Government or refugees.
<P>

<a name="20919103.html_para4">The hon. Lady's third question asked what links the Secretary of State's Department has with the UNHCR offices in Kenya. [73279]
<P>

<a name="20919103.html_para5">DFID contributed &#163;550,000 in 2000&#150;01 and a similar amount in 2001&#150;02 to UNHCR's programme in Kenya.

<a name="20919103.html_para8">Both DFID and BHC officials in Nairobi are in regular contact with UNHCR Kenya. We continue to monitor closely the refugee situation in the established camps and the border areas of Kenya through regular dialogue with UNHCR officials and other concerned agencies.
<P>

<a name="20919103.html_para9">The hon. Lady's fifth question asked what action the Secretary of State has taken to counter corruption in the Kenyan offices of the UNHCR. [73280]
<P>

<a name="20919103.html_para10">Allegations of corruption in UNHCR's offices in Kenya led to the security section of UNHCR undertaking an investigation in December 1999. The report, issued in June 2000, did not substantiate the allegations but recommended further investigation take place. While UNHCR branch officers in Nairobi were following up the allegations, threats were made against three officers. This led to the Inspector General of UNHCR calling in the UN Office of Investigation and Oversight Services (OIOS) in October 2000 to conduct an investigation.
<P>

<a name="20919103.html_para11">The findings of the OIOS investigation suggested that outside expertise was needed. Hence in December OIOS approached 4 donor governments (including the UK) to provide qualified staff to participate in an international investigation task force. DFID provided (on secondment) the services of a Detective Chief Inspector. The UK cost of this secondment was &#163;13,117. Overseas costs were met by UNHCR.

 DFID is the largest bilateral donor to Rwanda providing &#163;30 million a year. Our programme is set within the framework of a Memorandum of Understanding which includes commitments in areas such as human rights and governance.
<P>

<a name="20919103.html_para13">The human rights situation in Rwanda has improved for the majority of individuals since 1997. The establishment of the Human Rights Commission and the Commission for National Unity and Reconciliation are evidence of the Government of Rwanda's commitment to eliminating human rights abuses and to the reconciliation process. The Government have held successful local level elections in 2001 supported by DFID, but the end of the transitional period brings new challenges as Rwanda moves towards full national elections in 2003. DFID are supporting work to draft a new constitution.
<P>

<a name="20919103.html_para14">We believe that the Government's commitment to end the cycle of ethnic tension, to maintain stability within Rwanda, to eliminate poverty and improve the lives of all Rwandans is genuine and their policies are moving them in the right direction. However, we monitor closely reports of human rights abuses and raise our concerns with GoR accordingly.

 Deforestation is a serious problem in many countries but it affects people in different ways and is not always harmful. It is driven by many factors that vary in nature and scale from place to place. Some of these factors, such as unsustainable timber extraction, are linked to the forest sector while others, such as agricultural and energy policies, lie outside the forest sector.
<P>

<a name="20919105.html_para0">Each country has a particular set of circumstances, in terms both of the direct and underlying causes of deforestation and of the scope for action in addressing them. My Department works with developing countries to address the underlying causes of deforestation in the context of their national forest programmes and wider strategies for sustainable development. We have also supported work by the Intergovernmental Forum on Forest on the underlying causes of deforestation and forest degradation.

 We have been following events in Angola closely.

urgent need to provide relief to the Unita fighters and their families gathered in the Quartering Areas. We are encouraging the UN to engage and the international community and Angolan Government to provide more resources for the relief effort. The UK will continue to play its part in meeting urgent humanitarian needs. DFID also has a small development assistance programme focused on long term poverty reduction for the large numbers of people, forced by the conflict, to migrate into urban areas.

 DFID provides strategic support to the OHCHR through an Institutional Strategic Partnership. The partnership runs from January 2000 to December 2002 and to date we have provided &#163;3.4 million. The objectives of the partnership are to enhance the capacity of OHCHR in order to support the development and management of its field programmes and operations; to mainstream all human rights across the work of the UN system; to integrate economic, social and cultural rights into its work; and to provide human rights information to other implementing agencies. In order to ensure that the OHCHR is able to comply with the mandates given to the OHCHR at the Commission on Human Rights, and that the special procedures of the Commission on Human Rights operate efficiently, DFID includes the servicing of these special procedures in its support to the central capacity of the OHCHR.

<P>
<a name="20919106.html_spnew2"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 The Government are supporting an expanding programme to combat HIV/AIDS in Southern Africa (South Africa, Botswana, Namibia, Lesotho and Swaziland). Part of this involves strengthening South Africa's lead on essential drugs for the South African Development Community, and strengthening the essential drugs programme in South Africa to improve legislation, procurement and pricing for HIV/AIDS and other drugs.
<P>

<a name="20919106.html_para0">We are also taking action at a global level. The Working Group on Access to Medicines, which I chair, is working with the pharmaceutical industry, foundations, developing countries and the World Health Organisation, World Trade Organisation and the European Commission to look at the feasibility of a global differential pricing mechanism for essential medicines. But the Government recognises that affordability is only one of four key factors that influence access to medicines. Others are the need for sustainable financing, the rational selection and use of existing drugs and reliable health and supply systems.
<P>

<a name="20919106.html_para1">On sustainable financing we have pledged $200 million over 5 years to the Global Fund to Fight TB, AIDS and Malaria (GFATM), of which South Africa is already a beneficiary and to which other countries in the region have access. We have also committed over &#163;1 billion since 1997 to strengthening developing countries' health systems, building their capacity both to deliver medicines to the poor and to make effective choices about the selection and use of drugs.

 There are two relevant committees; they cover the EC's PHARE (originally: Poland and Hungary Assistance for the Reconstruction of the Economy) and ISPA (Instrument for Structural Policies for Pre-Accession) programmes. The mandate of the PHARE Committee is to oversee the implementation of Council Regulation EEC Number 3906 of 18 December 1989, which established PHARE, and its subsequent amendments. The ISPA Committee oversees the implementation of Council Regulation EC Number 1267&#150;1999, which established ISPA.

 We published a revised strategy for improving the poor performance of the European Community development programme in August 2001, a copy of which is available in the Library of the House. We welcome the positive steps that have recently been taken, including establishment for the first time of an EC Development Policy with poverty reduction as the central objective. The Commission are also delegating significant new responsibilities to their offices overseas in order to improve communication with developing country partners and cut delays. The Government is working with other member states, the Commission and the European Parliament to try to ensure that these measures begin to have an impact on the ground and allow the European Community to make a much more significant contribution to achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. We are also working to try to reach agreement that a much greater share of EC aid should be allocated to low income countries where it will have the greatest impact on poverty reduction. In 2000, only 38 per cent. of EC aid was spent in low-income countries compared to 70 per cent. in 1990.

 In Afghanistan women have begun to return to work and girls are going back to school. Two women hold office in the Afghan Interim Administration (AIA) and 11 per cent. of seats in the Loya Jirga are guaranteed for women. The UK is working closely with the AIA and the rest of the international community, to ensuring women's full and effective participation in civil, cultural, economic, political and social life throughout Afghanistan. To date this includes an allocation of $1 million to the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM) for a programme to support Afghan women's leadership through awareness raising, capacity building and gender mainstreaming; as well as local level, quick impact recovery projects supporting women. We are also providing support directly to the Ministry for Women.

<a name="20919107.html_spnew9"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 At the Annual Meetings of the World Bank and IMF in Ottawa last November, we raised this concern and asked Bank and Fund staff to revisit the debt sustainability analyses of all commodity dependent low-income countries, including the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC). The IMF and World Bank analysis, published last month, shows that, although the situation varies from country to country, the external debt indicators for most HIPC countries have deteriorated, and a result several HIPC countries now face unsustainable debt burdens. Following UK pressure, the World Bank and IMF Boards have agreed to provide additional relief countries in this situation. This was reconfirmed at the Spring Meetings last month.

 We seek to reduce the poverty of children by working to address the causes of deprivation in their communities. Support for children's rights to protection from violence, exploitation and abusive labour is central to our work towards the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. DFID's plans for tackling child poverty and supporting the rights of children are set out in "Breaking the cycle of child poverty", published earlier this month. A copy will be placed in the Library of the House.

 DFID is, in the next three months, due to commence a major refurbishment of our East Kilbride office. The detailed specifications for these works are currently being established, but the contractors have been instructed as they were for the refurbishment of 1 Palace Street, that all timber and veneers are to be sourced from sustainably managed forests, in accordance with the relevant DEFRA guidelines. My Department will also ensure that appropriate checks are carried out to ensure that these requirements are met, as they were in 1 Palace Street, despite false claims to the contrary.

 DFID has allocated &#163;70 million for Malawi in 2002&#150;03. Of this &#163;25 million is set aside for direct budget support. Budgetary support is currently suspended as the Government of Malawi has failed to carry out a number of agreed economic and financial reform measures crucial to progression in poverty reduction in Malawi. I am currently considering redirecting the first tranche of funds set aside for budgetary support to provide additional fund assistance to Malawi.
