<P>
<a name="00308w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 At any one time two Home Office lawyers had significant involvement in the case. A Treasury Solicitor lawyer had conduct of the case for litigation purposes, and lawyers in the Crown Prosecution Service, the Legal Secretariat to the Law Officers and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office were from time to time significantly involved. Lawyers from other Government Departments have also played a role.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00308w01.html_wqn3"><B> Dr. Ladyman: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make a statement about the outcome of his investigation into allegations made by the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection against Harlan-Hill Crest.  [113893]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00308w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 I have today placed in the Library copies of the Home Office investigative report into allegations which were made available to the Home Office by the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection (BUAV) on 29 June 1999. The BUAV's allegations were 



<P>
<P><I>8 Mar 2000 : Column: 662W</I><P>
based on the evidence of a sympathiser working undercover at the establishment. The establishment is designated under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986.
<P>

<a name="00308w01.html_para1">I received the Chief Inspector's report on 17 December after a thorough investigation into a complex series of allegations. Generally, the establishment was found to be well run and the level of compliance generally good. I did, however, take action against one breach of a condition of certification--that two animal rooms were not identified in documentation as having been checked as required on two dates during the last two years. The Certificate holder received an admonition for this apparent lapse and I sought reassurances from management about staffing levels. These have been given.
<P>

<a name="00308w01.html_para2">Since Christmas 1999, officials have been arranging with the company, its customers and key staff, to lift confidentiality of material in the report whose disclosure would have been contrary to Section 24 of the 1986 Act, as being provided in confidence. A small number of areas remain censored because they represent commercially sensitive or personnel information which cannot be disclosed.
<P>

<a name="00308w01.html_para3">The greater number of blocked-out areas in the report stem from the BUAV not lifting the confidentiality of material stemming from the undercover investigator's videotapes, diary and interview with the Inspectorate in time for publication this week. When we indicated that we would publish the document in this form, BUAV then indicated late yesterday that they might be prepared to lift the confidentiality restrictions on some parts of the report. My officials will contact them again today to ask them to lift their restrictions.
<P>

<a name="00308w01.html_para4">The report was disclosed to the Animal Procedures Committee on 9 February for information. The Committee has not had opportunity to discuss the report, nor are Ministers expressly seeking advice on its content or the action taken since the investigation was completed.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00308w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Paul Clark: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what progress has been made on the production of a code of practice in relation to the civil penalty provisions of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999; and when implementation of those provisions will commence.  [113951]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00308w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 Clandestine entry into the United Kingdom, particularly in road haulage vehicles, has become a major abuse of the immigration control in recent years. The number of clandestine entrants identified is currently running at about 2,000 each month and the Government are determined to take action to tackle this growing problem.
<P>

<a name="00308w01.html_para5">Part II of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 provides for a penalty for each clandestine entrant carried to be levied on the person or persons responsible. It also provides for the detention in certain circumstances of the transporter or vehicle in which the clandestine arrived against payment of the penalty.
<P>

<a name="00308w01.html_para6">The civil penalty is an important measure to enable us to deal effectively with an escalating problem. It will be implemented on 3 April 2000 in relation to clandestine entrants arriving in road vehicles.




<P>
<P><I>8 Mar 2000 : Column: 663W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="00308w01.html_para7">We have consulted widely with a number of representative bodies on a Code of Practice for vehicles to prevent the carriage of clandestine entrants. The draft Code of Practice for Vehicles, which has been amended to take account of comments expressed during the consultation process, was laid before Parliament on 3 March and will come into force on 3 April.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00308w01.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Healey: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make a statement on the effectiveness of police local drugs units in bringing to court hard drugs dealers.  [112259]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00308w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The police have a key role in the Government's anti-drugs strategy working with other enforcement agencies to stifle the availability of illegal drugs on our streets. The drug problem will not be the same in each force area, and it is an operational matter for each Chief Officer of Police to decide the most effective way to tackle drug dealing in his or her force area. It is for the Crown Prosecution Service to decide whether to prosecute those charged with an offence.
<P>

<a name="00308w01.html_para8">Tough targets have been set under the Government's drugs strategy, significantly to reduce access to all drugs among young people, and to reduce access to the drugs which cause the greatest harm--particularly heroin and cocaine--by 25 per cent. by 2005 and by 50 per cent. by 2008. A target for 1999-2000 is to increase by 10 per cent. the number of offenders dealt with for supply offences in respect of Class A drugs.
<P>

<a name="00308w01.html_para9">The latest available statistics show that the number of persons found guilty at court of "dealing" (possession with intent to supply unlawfully and unlawful supply) in heroin, cocaine and crack increased significantly between 1997 and 1998. Detailed information is given in the table.

<a name="00308w02.html_wqn0"><B> Ms Buck: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department (1) what percentage of racially aggravated offences have resulted in acquittals since the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 came into force; and how many defendants this involved, broken down by ethnic group;  [113367]
<P>
<UL>(2) how many charges relating to racially aggravated offences as defined by section 28 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 have been made since the Act came into force; and how many victims were alleged to be affected by the offences broken down by ethnic group.  [113332]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00308w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 Information collected centrally indicates that 10,982 racially aggravated offences were recorded by the police in the period 1 April 1999 to 30 September 1999. No information is collected on the number of charges made for these offences, the number of victims involved or their ethnic group. 745 defendants were prosecuted in magistrates courts for racially aggravated offences in the period October 1998 to 30 June 1999 of which 261 (35 per cent.) had their prosecution terminated early and 31 (4 per cent.) had their charge dismissed. No information is available on the ethnicity of the defendants.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many complaints of racially aggravated offences have been made against police officers since the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 came into force.  [113335]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00308w02.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 Information is not routinely collected centrally on the occupations of people accused of crime. But there were 709 complaints of racial discrimination recorded against the police in 1998-99.
<P>
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many racially aggravated offences (1) charged by the police have been discontinued by the Crown Prosecution Service <i>(a)</i> before and <i>(b)</i> after the case reached a magistrates court; and how many victims, broken down by ethnic group, were alleged to be affected by the offences charged;  [113333]
<P>
<UL>(2) have been added as further offences to other charges preferred against defendants by the Crown Prosecution Service since the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 came into effect; and how many victims were alleged to be affected by the offences charged, broken down by ethnic group.  [113334]

<P>

<a name="00308w02.html_para0">The information sought is not currently available and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost. However, the Crown Prosecution Service has been monitoring the prosecution of racist crime since 1995. The monitoring has been substantially revised in order to capture a wider range of information as a result of the new offences of racially aggravated crimes created by the Crime and Disorder Act 1998. The first full year of the revised scheme ends on 31 March 2000 and the Crown Prosecution Service aims to publish a report in the autumn. At that time the figures sought regarding charges for racially aggravated offences will, it is anticipated, be available. The monitoring scheme is solely offence based and does not record information about victims of racially aggravated crime either by number or ethnic group.

Correspondents have expressed concern about the financial burden the removal of such vehicles places on local authorities, the period of notice authorities must give before removing vehicles, acts of vandalism associated with abandoned vehicles, and the difficulty of tracing the vehicles' owners. They have also suggested a variety of changes to the current system intended to address these concerns.

 Sport England are consulted on planning applications for the development of playing fields but have no role in decisions about whether or not playing fields may be sold. Their role in the referral of planning applications to my Department came into effect on 23 December 1998 under the Town and Country Planning (Playing Fields)(England) Direction 1998. Since then, 18 applications have been referred to the Secretary of State. Of these, one has been called in by him for his own determination and 14 have been left to the local authority to determine. The remainder are under consideration. Of the 14 cases which were left to the local planning authority to determine, all but one involved the development of new or expanded educational or sporting facilities at existing schools or colleges. In each of these cases, the area of land which would be developed was a very minor part of the overall playing field provision.

 None. However, English Nature, the Government's scientific advisers, and the Forestry Commission are working closely together to ensure delivery of obligations under the Habitats Directive and of the Lowland Heathland Habitat Action Plan. In September 1999, English Nature issued guidance to its local teams on how to resolve such issues. The Forestry Commission has similarly drawn up preliminary guidance as to how its staff should consider the potential conflicts when considering felling licences.

 Land in use as allotments and owned by Railtrack, a private company, and Rail Property Ltd. has no special status. Statutory protection of allotment land does not apply to privately owned land or land owned by a public body when that body--such as Rail Property Ltd.--is not a local authority.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what recent steps he has taken to ensure the aircraft flying over London into Heathrow have sufficient fuel on board.  [113039]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00308w04.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 Responsibility for the safety regulation of airlines, including compliance with minimum fuel requirements, lies with the country in which the airline is based. The UK Civil Aviation Authority ensures that UK airlines have effective minimum fuel policies for all flights and checks fuel records when auditing airlines. Regulatory authorities for foreign airlines must ensure that their airlines meet at least the international standards for minimum fuel levels.
<P>

<a name="00308w04.html_para0">We have procedures in place to check that foreign operated aircraft flying to the UK are being maintained and operated in compliance with international standards. These include targeted inspections by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) of aircraft from countries where safety oversight has been questioned. Last summer, following an allegation that one airline had operated into Heathrow airport with low fuel levels on a number of occasions, we targeted a number of inspections on long haul operators from the Far East. We asked the particular operator concerned to provide us with weekly reports of fuel levels of their aircraft on arrival at Heathrow and this has continued as a condition of their operating permit; the reports have been satisfactory. We will investigate fully any reports of problems with other operators.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00308w04.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The Government's action to exempt Good Quality Combined Heat and Power from the Climate Change Levy is the strongest evidence of this Government's commitment to the wider use of CHP. It is also intended to be one of the energy technologies eligible for the proposed Enhanced Capital Allowances scheme under the Climate Change Levy package. The announcement on 6 March that electricity generating plant and machinery in all Good Quality CHP schemes will be de-rated from 1 April 2001, further strengthens Government support for CHP.

<a name="00308w04.html_para1">We are implementing a CHP Quality Assurance programme to enhance the quality of CHP and determine eligibility to a range of benefits, and will shortly consult on a new strategy to achieve our target of at least 10,000 MWe of CHP by 2010.
<P>

<a name="00308w04.html_para2">We continue to work closely with industry to ensure the fullest support for CHP growth. On 17 May I will be launching the CHP Club, an integrated service under the Energy Efficiency Best Practice programme, to help new and potential CHP users exploit the positive environment which this Government have put in place.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions further to his answer of 24 January 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 130W, on rats, if he will commission a more detailed assessment of the conditions of drains and sewers near dwellings and their relationship to rat infestations as part of the 2001 English House Condition Survey.  [113062]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00308w04.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 The 1996 English House Condition Survey (EHCS) included an assessment of observable faults to the drainage system around the dwelling, which surveyors can reasonably be asked to collect as part of a standard house condition survey. Development work is now under way for the 2001 survey and it is highly likely that this will be repeated. However, the EHCS is not an appropriate vehicle for carrying out more detailed investigative work on the overall condition of drains and sewers.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions, further to his answer of 24 January 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 130W, on rats, if cracked or defective drain covers would render a dwelling unfit.  [113061]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00308w04.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 Under the current fitness standard a dwelling can be deemed unfit if it does not have an effective system for the draining of foul, waste and surface water. This tends to be based on an overall assessment of a number of features connected with the drainage system. In relation to the collection and analysis of the English House Condition Survey data, dwellings are not deemed unfit solely because of cracked or defective drain covers.

<a name="00308w04.html_wqn5"><B> Ms Walley: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions, further to his answer of 24 January 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 130W, on rats, if dwellings that are unfit as the result of lack of effective drainage are more likely to have rat infestations than those that are unfit on other counts; and if he will make a statement.  [113060]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00308w04.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 The English House Condition Survey questions related to rodent infestations are analysed in the recent MAFF report "Rodent Infestations in domestic properties in England". Page 11 of the report emphasises that properties with defective drainage systems also tend to be defective in many other aspects. It would not be appropriate to analyse the data to make a distinction between those that are unfit for drainage reasons and those that are unfit for other reasons. This is because the number of dwellings in the sample that are classed as unfit because of problems with drainage is very small, less than 1 per cent. of the total sample.

<P>

<a name="00308w04.html_para3">Implementation of phase 1 could begin in 2001 and further funding would be a matter for the Mayor of London. Contributions to the cost of implementation could also be sought from the Heritage Lottery Fund and private sector sponsorship.

<a name="00308w04.html_para5">The Countryside Agency, the Government's statutory adviser on social and economic development in rural areas, has been conducting research into indicators of rural disadvantage.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00308w05.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 Whether a planning application for an extension of china clay quarrying in Dartmoor comprises an 'exceptional circumstance', as explained in paragraph 4.5 of Planning Policy Guidance Note 7--The Countryside: Environmental Quality and Economic and Social Development, would depend upon the scale, nature and individual circumstances of that proposal.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00308w05.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 Part IV of the Environment Act 1995 requires local authorities to review and assess the current and likely future air quality in their areas. Local authorities are required to consider whether one or more of the national air quality objectives, as prescribed in regulations, are unlikely to be met by the required date. Objectives have been set for a number of air pollutants including nitrogen dioxide. The Secretary of State has issued guidance on how to undertake such reviews and assessments, including on where and when monitoring of air pollutants is needed. I understand that West Dorset district council will consider monitoring the kerbside nitrogen dioxide in Chideock on the A35, in addition to their existing monitoring sites throughout the area.

 Local authorities in England provide estimates of the average time taken to relet their housing stock on their annual Housing Investment Programme (HIP) Operational Information returns. Information reported for lettings during 1998-99 is given in the table. There are variations in the way local authorities maintain lettings records and compile these estimates, and comparisons between authorities should be treated with caution.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00308w06.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Foulkes: </B> 
 The Government have continually emphasised that the purpose of debt relief is to enable countries to make greater progress on reducing poverty and achieving the international development targets. Our submission to the review of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative set out ways in which the impact of debt relief on poverty reduction could be increased, and I welcome the improvements to the HIPC framework that have been agreed internationally and are now being implemented. The revised HIPC initiative both provides deeper and faster debt relief to qualifying countries, and ensures that a poverty reduction strategy is put in place so that all development resources, including those freed up by HIPC debt relief, can be invested effectively in anti-poverty programmes.

<a name="00308w06.html_para6">The differences in the cost of calls between the two groups of country above arise because of the different stages of liberalisation in these countries and the different charges for terminating incoming international traffic (known as accounting rates). The telecoms markets of group (b) countries are completely liberalised compared to the closed markets of the group (a) countries which have big net inflows of traffic from the UK coupled with high accounting rates. Furthermore, there are much higher call volumes between group (b) countries and the UK compared to group (a).
<P>

<a name="00308w06.html_para7">The Government and OFTEL continue to participate in international meetings, particularly through the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) to put pressure on countries with high accounting rates to reduce them.

It was not possible to achieve KT3 due to the legacy of sites in the disposal programme. The actual figure achieved for sites sold during 1998/1999, was 77 per cent.
<BR>
The 1998/1999 Annual Report & Accounts for Defence Estates was published on 2 November 1999, and a copy placed in the library of the House of Commons on 2 November 1999.
<BR>
The Agency's Key Targets for 1998/1999 reflected an organisation in transition. This was a period during which the Agency necessarily committed itself to essential internal restructuring to accommodate the recommendations of the Strategic Defence Review (SDR). It was also necessary for the Agency to improve its focus on the needs of its customers and other stakeholders. The 1999/2000 Key Targets reflected this. Specifically, they addressed the need to establish a corporate management strategy for the estate, the development of a new construction procurement model and to improve the process for the disposal of surplus buildings and land.
<BR>
The published Key Targets for 1999/2000 are:
<BR>
<i>Key Target 1:</i>
<BR>
To demonstrate an improvement of 10% (over the figure for 1998/1999) in the level of customer satisfaction with the services provided by the Agency as measured by the 1999/2000 customer survey.
<BR>
<i>Key Target 2:</i>
<BR>
To achieve net disposal receipts of &#163;235M.
<BR>
<i>Key Target 3:</i>
<BR>
To let three pilot Prime Contracts by 31 March 2000.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I have been asked to reply to your parliamentary question about the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency's (DERA) targets for 1998/99.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>A list of the key targets for 1998/99 and details of which ones were and were not achieved, together with an explanation of the factors affecting the outcome in each case, is given in Annual Report for 1998/99, a copy of which is available in the House of Commons Library.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>You also asked for details of the action taken by the Agency to improve target achievements performance in 1999/00. The targets for 1999/00 were published in Hansard on 27 July 1999. Again, a copy is attached for ease of reference. As you will see, with the exception of target 7, "To establish at least six Defence Diversification Offices across the UK", they are essentially the same 



<P>
</UL></FONT><P><I>8 Mar 2000 : Column: 693W</I><P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>as those for the previous year. The many trading problems caused by continuing declines in some of our core defence business have meant that the first half of 1999/2000 has been extremely challenging. We are, therefore, having to control costs carefully at the traditional technology end of our business in order to optimise our financial performance. Also of vital importance are our non- financial targets because these reflect the scientific achievements on which our reputation and hence future income stream will be based. Last year, we experienced difficulties in setting the baselines for one or two of these, but we have taken managerial steps to ensure that our true achievements are recorded this year. It is, nevertheless, too early to predict the outcome of these measures.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Overall, however, our ability to meet the targets will very much depend on a timely resolution of the debate over the future of DERA and the question of a public-private partnership announced in the Strategic Defence Review in July 1998. Naturally, such strategic uncertainty affects DERA staff and customers alike and, whilst our central direction remains unchanged, we need to establish a firm position from which to address the difficulties of our current trading environment.</FONT></UL>

<P>

<a name="00308w09.html_para1"><i>Letter from M. A. Piper to Mr. Menzies Campbell, dated 6 March 2000:</i>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I am replying to your questions to the Secretary of State for Defence about the Key Targets for the Army Training and Recruiting Agency (ATRA) and the Defence Animal Centre (DAC) for the year 1998/1999, as this matter falls within my area of responsibility as Deputy Chief Executive of the Agency.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>You should be aware that although the DAC was an Agency in its own right in 1998/1999, on 1 April 1999 it became part of the ATRA. For the year 1998/1999 therefore, there were two sets of Key Targets, one for each agency. For 1999/2000 and subsequent 



<P>
</UL></FONT><P><I>8 Mar 2000 : Column: 694W</I><P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>years, the DAC targets are subsumed within those of the ATRA and are not separately identified. Neither Agency has yet published their Annual Report and Accounts for 1998/1999, but expect to shortly.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>ATRA Key Targets 1998/1999:</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Key Target 1:</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>To meet the Adjutant General's requirement for commissioned officers.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Requirement: 642, Achievement: 591</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The continuing shortfall was due to insufficient numbers of potential officers recruited in previous years. The demographic trough continues to have an effect. The Agency has introduced an Officers Marketing Action Plan which aims to improve the level of enquiries and firm applications for commissions.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Potential officers will be targeted in tertiary education as well as the traditional area of secondary education. The Agency has also introduced an improved "nurturing" process to maintain contact with potential officers throughout their education, prior to them joining.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Key Target 2:</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>To meet the Adjutant General's requirements for officers qualified for service in Field Force units following successful Special to Arm training.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Requirement: 632, Achievement: 580</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The shortfall results from the insufficient numbers being recruited in previous years resulting in lower numbers passing through to Special to Arm training. The action being taken to address the shortfall in KT1 will also address this KT.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Key Target 3:</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>To meet the Adjutant General's requirement for professional development training of officers.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Requirement: 7,500, Achievement: 7,114</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Achievement of this target is entirely dependent upon release of officers from the Field Army to undertake such training. Exceptional operational commitments prevented officers being released to take up all the places allocated. More tautly defined training programmes have been introduced which resulted in a considerable improvement in performance over 1997/98, and it is anticipated that this will continue.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Key Target 4:</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>To meet the Adjutant General's requirements for soldiers qualified for service in Field Force units following successful Special to Arm training.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Requirement: 10,140, Achievement: 8,353</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Underachievement in recruiting and higher than anticipated wastage rates in Recruit Training (Phase 1) led to lower numbers entering Special to Arm training and therefore under performance in this KT. The Agency is putting in place mechanisms to improve both the quality of recruits entering the training pipeline and to make the training process more efficient. This is already showing signs of improving performance.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Key Target 5:</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>To meet the Adjutant General's requirement for soldiers' professional development training.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Requirement: 55,500, Achieved: 52,183</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Again, exceptional operational commitments of the Field Army prevented soldiers being released to take up all the places allocated. More tautly defined training programmes have been introduced which resulted in a considerable improvement in performance over 1997/98, and it is anticipated that this will continue.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Key Target 6:</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Achieve efficiency savings. During the year develop an Efficiency Index that measures output and associated costs as a baseline to achieve year on year improvements in efficiency.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Target: &#163;34.7M savings, Achievement: &#163;28M savings</FONT></UL>




<P>
<P><I>8 Mar 2000 : Column: 695W</I><P>

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The shortfall is due primarily to difficulties experienced with accounting for the pay of all Initial Trainees, for which the Agency assumed responsibility during the year. The development of the Efficiency Index has been achieved.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Overall, the Agency continued to operate in a difficult environment, the economy has been buoyant, thus increasing competitive pressure on recruiting in the target age group. The effects of the increased level of operational commitment in the Field Army continued to have an effect, principally by reducing the availability of officers and soldiers for career developments courses. The introduction of more tautly defined training programmes has resulted in an improvement in performance in the current year and this is set to continue.</FONT></UL>

<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>DAC Target not met in 1998/1999:</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Target: MWA--95%, MP--100%, Achievement: MWA--78.9%, MP--100%</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The shortfall in Military Working Animals was caused primarily by a shortage of suitable dogs being available and was compounded by staff shortages. This latter was caused by recruiting deficits in the past and although there have been improvements in this area, operational commitments by the Field Army are still causing problems. A number of initiatives have been introduced to overcome the shortfall in dogs, principally revised procurement procedures and veterinary screening procedures.</FONT></UL>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>No specific reasons for failing to achieve these targets has yet been adduced. It should be noted that in all assessments at KS1, KS2 and KS3 our achievement scores were higher than English LEAs, sometimes significantly so (on average by +5.8%).</FONT></UL>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Key Target 7--The Efficiency Target (reduction in per capita pupil costs, measured on an accruals basis)</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>An unexpected drop in pupil numbers combined with increased financial investment in education, for example extra funding for the Literacy and Numeracy strategies, meant that this target was not met in 1998/99. The use of such a blunt measure of efficiency has now been judged to be unrealistic, given the continuing investment in education spending and teaching salaries. It has therefore been proposed that, for 1999/2000 and beyond, the Agency should develop a means to measure the "value added" by SCE. This will require further developments in baseline assessments and in pupil through-life tracking via Unique Pupil Numbers (UPNs).</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>With regard to the future, our Key Targets for 99/00 have been modified to achieve an improvement each year on the Agency's performance on the previous year. This should reflect a more realistic but nevertheless challenging target in these subjects. My aspiration to improve our performance in 1999/2000 is being addressed by involving schools more closely in the target setting process, a continued commitment to the literacy and numeracy strategies through intensive in service training for teachers, and the greater involvement of the external advisers to Agency's Owner's, namely DfEE, HMI/Ofsted and the Chief Education Officer of Hampshire Local Education Authority to ensure that the targets are realistic.</FONT></UL>

As you will see, we exceeded our financial performance targets by a significant margin and substantially improved our service quality and efficiency. We also improved our UK Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) Index, which is a measure of our underlying forecasting accuracy for the UK, by a significant margin. However, we fell just short of the Global NWP target. Problems with the model's handling of the South Pole region were identified 



<P>
</UL></FONT><P><I>8 Mar 2000 : Column: 700W</I><P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>and rectified, and benefits of a higher resolution model introduced in January 1998 began to feed through towards the end of 1998-99. As a result, the target score was achieved less than 2 months into 1999-2000. Moreover, comparison with the performance for global models run by other Meteorological services shows that, despite the failure to achieve our own challenging performance target, we have maintained our position as a world-class weather forecasting centre.
<BR>
To improve Global NWP performance in 1999-2000, a number of further enhancements to the model have been introduced, and I am pleased to say that we are currently on course to meet both of our NWP targets this year. We are also on track to deliver greater in-year cost efficiency, part of which has been anticipated in agreed prices for 1999/2000 with the remainder to be passed on to our customers through further price reductions in future years. We have cut the planned level of ROCE substantially, in line with our strategy of investment for growth, which will enable us, inter-alia, to improve service quality (especially forecasting accuracy and responsiveness to customer needs) and, largely through increased automation, generate further down-stream efficiency improvements. We are, however, unlikely to meet our target for commercial contribution, although our commercial business remains profitable. We have already introduced changes to our commercial division, including the appointment of a new Managing Director, which we are confidence will increase both revenue and profitability in 2000-01.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I am replying to your Question to the Secretary of State for Defence about the Key Target achievement for 1998-99 for the Army Technical Support Agency (ATSA), as this matter falls within my area of responsibility as Chief Executive of the ATSA.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>As reported in the ATSA Annual Report and Accounts 1998/99, copies of which were laid in the Library of the House on 26 July 1999, ATSA did not achieve one part of one of its 7 Key Targets set for 1998-99. The Key Targets, their achievement, the factors affecting their outcome and the action taken to improve performance for 1999-2000 are detailed at Annex A for your convenience of consideration.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The partial failure to achieve on of the Key Targets is also explained in detail as follows:</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>Key Target 4 Part 2</i>: Despatch 90% of <i>routine</i> technical publications within 24 working days of receipt of the demand.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Although ATSA's cumulative annual achievement for 1998-99 was 85.3% of nearly 70,000 demands, the 90% target was exceeded in 6 of the 12 monthly reporting periods. This was despite an 11% increase in annual cumulative demand due to the operation and roulement of units in the Balkans and further complicated by unforeseen complete reissues of the extensive Challenger 2 Main Battle Tank support publications.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Performance against the Key Targets for 1999-2000 is monitored by the Chief Executive and Executive Management Board of the Agency on a monthly basis. This performance is reported quarterly to the Agency's Owner and annually to Ministers through publication of the Next Steps Report and the Agency's Annual Report and Accounts. Key Target achievement is also considered by the National Audit Office during the annual submission of the Accounts for external audit.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>As at 31 January 2000, the Agency is on target to achieve all of its Key Targets for 1999-2000.</FONT></UL>

<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Definitions, performance and proposed changes for 1999-2000</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Key Target 1: To influence equipment design by obtaining formal tasking from Project Managers/Integrated Logistic Support (ILS) Managers in 80% of appropriate ILS projects.</FONT></UL>




<P>
<P><I>8 Mar 2000 : Column: 702W</I><P>

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Result: Achieved: 104 (80%) of 130 appropriate ILS projects receiving tasking.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Improvement: There is no change to the 80% target for 1999-2000. This list of appropriate projects is reviewed and updated by the Customer every 6 months and thus offers fresh challenge each time this occurs.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Key Target 2: To recommend at least 10% gross cost saving in Advanced Order Spares purchasing for appropriate non-ILS projects without reducing the equipment sustainability or availability.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Result: Exceeded: A saving of &#163;3.763M (63%) was recommended against spares listings valued at &#163;5.96M.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Improvement: Discontinued as a Key Target for 1999-2000 since the proportion of cost savings are determined more by manufacturers' recommendations than factors within ATSA's control. As ILS and off-the-shelf procurement become the normal approach and replace Advanced Order Spares procurement, this area will become progressively less important. Although no longer a Key Target, this process of scrutiny and review is still being conducted.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Key Target 3: To provide a complete and accurate answer to 92% of ad hoc enquiries within 2 working days.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Result: Exceeded: 66,818 (96.8%) of 69,030 ad hoc queries received were answered within the period.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Improvement: The target is increased from 92% to 94% whilst also noting a typical 8% increase in annual demand.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Key Target 4: To despatch new and reprinted technical publications within the period from receipt of demand as follows:</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>For priority demands, 90% within 5 working days</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>For routine demands, 90% within 24 working days</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Result: Part Exceeded and Part Not Achieved: 1,386 (99.4%) of the 1,395 priority demands, and 59,542 (85.3%) of 69,542 routine demands were met within the target periods.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Improvement: The target levels are being maintained in 1999-2000 in recognition of the steady increase in annual cumulative demand over recent years. Resource levels are unchanged. Increased efficiency is continually sought by adjusting batch-processing techniques.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Key Target 5: To complete at least: 90% of Operational projects and 75% of Priority A projects before the agreed target date.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Result: Exceeded: 5 (100%) Operational projects and 91 (89.2%) of 102 Priority A projects were completed by the agreed target date.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Improvement: The target coverage is being extended by the inclusion of an additional target of 60% of Priority B projects; the other targets remain the same. This will increase the measured target scope to 80% of all projects received.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Key Target 6: To satisfy 90% of customers in the handling of technical projects.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Results: Exceeded: 1,331 (98.1%) of 1,357 completed projects received a grading of satisfied (or better) by the customer on closure questionnaires.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Improvement: Target increased to 92% for 1999-2000. In addition, results are validated through sample customer interviews.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Key Target 7: To provide a considered response to 90% of Equipment Failure Reports (or equivalent) submissions within 10 working days of receipt.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Result: Exceeded: 22,684 (91.9%) of 24,684 EFRs received considered responses within the stated period.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Improvement: To be discontinued as a Key Target for 1999-2000. The EFR system is currently under review and major changes are expected. In the meantime the main customer (HQ LAND) has agreed to the introduction of a new, more cost-effective system of consolidated bulletins rather than individual responses.</FONT></UL>

<P>

<a name="00308w12.html_para0"><i>Letter from P. T. W. Leaning to Mr. Menzies Campbell, dated 6 March 2000:</i>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I am replying to your question to the Secretary of State for Defence, about the targets for the Defence Transport and Movements Executive, as this matter falls within my area of responsibility, being the Chief Executive of the Agency which replaced the former DTMX in April 1999.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>It is pleasing to report that DTMX achieved all its Key Targets for 1998-99 and the results of that financial year's performance were included in the Annual Report and Accounts which were laid before Parliament on 27 January this year (Library number 132, pages 10-14). For your ease of reference, I am providing extract details of each of the four Key Targets concerned, at Annex A.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Also included in the DTMX Annual Report and Accounts (page 27) is the background behind the launch of our new Agency, into which DTMX was subsumed. Basically, as part of the Strategic Defence Review it was decided to form one Agency which would be responsible for the provision of surface (road, rail and sea) and air transport and movements support to the Ministry of Defence. The Defence Transport and Movements Agency was, therefore, formed from an amalgamation of DTMX, the Joint Transport and Movements Staff (Northwood) and elements of 38 Gp RAF/Air Movements Executive (London, High Wycombe and Halton).</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>DTMA has been able to use the lessons learnt by its former constituent parts but the way that it operates, and the type of support that it provides, is different to that of its predecessors. With that in mind, it has been set new challenging targets, rather than continue with any of the targets set for its predecessors. Again, I am providing details of the four Key Targets for 1999-2000, at Annex B.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>DTMX Key Targets for 1998-99</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>Key Target 1</i></FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>To exceed 90% of Customers' perceived satisfaction of requirements.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Results: In conjunction with the Defence Analytical Services Agency (DASA), the DTMX Plans Team developed a survey to both map the customer base and subsequently monitor satisfaction levels. The analysis of the survey results has proved useful and encouraging. Of the 371 surveys sent out, 60% were returned. The overall satisfaction rating was 92%. Desk officers have followed up these results with customers and in particular investigated those where DTMX scored less than the prescribed 90%.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>Key Target 2</i></FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>To establish the baseline for the quality of the Unaccompanied Baggage (UB) Service, to enable subsequent measurement of improvements.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Results: Although DTMX had been given until May 1999 to establish a performance baseline, it was decided that with the incorporation of DTMX into DTMA, a set of results would be compiled for the period January-March 1999 for each of the UB business areas, based on the existing, DTMX compiled, survey data.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Outside of DTMX a number of different surveys were already in use by the Divisional and District Headquarters. To avoid 'survey fatigue' it was agreed that DTMX would sponsor a single set of common surveys covering the whole gambit of the 



<P>
</UL></FONT><P><I>8 Mar 2000 : Column: 704W</I><P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Unaccompanied Baggage Service. These surveys were taken into general use at the end of 1998 and will, in the future, provide a much wider data set, allowing the Agency to monitor customer perceptions continuously and thereby improve the service.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>Key Target 3</i></FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>To exceed 90% satisfaction of Customers' requirements.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Results: Given that the majority of the service provided is carried out through agents and contractors, it was acknowledged that a system of negative reporting would allow us to concentrate on supplier failure and would best support customer requirements. High volume activities with few complaints have raised the percentage satisfaction rate, but there are areas that have been highlighted which require attention. Overall 210 complaints were recorded during the period and these are summarised as follows:</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The performance of our suppliers to customers' satisfaction exceeded 99%.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Customers with complaints or problems are required to contact DTMX with the details, these are then confirmed in writing, investigated and if upheld recorded as a supplier failure against the target. In order to improve the capture of complaints data, action is in hand to incorporate a system of complaints logging on CARGONET, the Agency's primary data warehouse and UBMIS which is specifically tailored towards the Unaccompanied Baggage Service.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>Key Target 4</i></FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>To establish unit costs per output data to enable the setting of realistic efficiency targets for subsequent years.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Results: Through the development of the Agency's Activity Based Costing model, it has been possible to identify unit costs down to individual loads. For example it is now possible to identify the average cost of sending 1 tonne of aggregate to the Falkland Islands or of delivering a consignment of ammunition to one of the Ammunition Depots.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Many of the outputs produced or sponsored by the Agency are conducted under call-off contracts which are casted on a schedule of prices.</FONT></UL>

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>Key Target 2</i></FONT></UL>

<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>To establish baseline data for the administrative unit costs by 31 December 1999.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The administrative unit cost is defined as the cost of completing an Agency processed transaction. These costs will be obtained through the use of an Activity Based Costing model, which will need to be developed in year one with a target date of 31 December 1999 set to obtain baseline data. Efficiencies will be measured from this baseline in future years.</FONT></UL>
<P>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I am replying to your question to the Secretary of State for Defence concerning performance against the targets set for the Defence Bills Agency, as this matter falls within my area of responsibility as Chief Executive of the Agency.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The seven targets set for the Defence Bills Agency for 1998/99 are detailed below and performance was set out in the Agency's 1998/99 Annual Report and Accounts, a copy of which was placed in the library of the House on 13 July 1999. The first six were achieved in full but the seventh only attained 95.7% against a target of 100%.</FONT></UL>

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>7. To meet the criteria contracted for in the Service Level Agreement.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Performance against this final target was affected by the need, in order to meet higher priorities, to divert Agency resources from the fifteen lower-level performance indicators which are aggregated into a single target. The most significant of these higher priorities was the need to alter the Agency's business processes to accommodate the Statutory Interest on Commercial Debt (Interest) Act in November 1998. The Agency also diverted resources to assist the Department in its development of resource accounting and to undertake preparatory work on the Agency's extensive computer resources to ensure millennium compliance. In addition the Agency

</UL></FONT><P><I>8 Mar 2000 : Column: 707W</I><P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>assimilated a 6% increase in bill throughput numbers compared to the previous financial year, processing some 3.7 million bills in total.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>To improve performance in 1999/2000 the Agency's targets were redefined following a triennial Prior Options review. This moved the main emphasis of the Agency's targets to the improvement of unit costs which could be independently benchmarked against commercial comparators. There was also a significant tightening of the targets in other areas.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Agency has responded to these changed circumstances by preparing a Corporate Plan which is designed to achieve these new and demanding challenges. The main thrusts of the Plan are:</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(i) greater commitment to E-commerce in both internal and external communications;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(iii) the use of European Quality Foundation Excellence Model benchmarking techniques to ensure that best practice is used throughout the Agency.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The deliberately challenging new targets are not being met fully in this first year of the new Service Level Agreement. However, significant progress towards meeting the overarching outcomes contained in the Service Level Agreement has been achieved during 1999-2000 and measures have been taken to ensure that performance will be improved further during 2000-2001. Whilst some of the key targets are not being met in the current year, bill payments performance is still the highest to date in real terms and puts the Agency in the top 10% of large commercial and public sector enterprises in Europe, as measured in independent benchmarking exercises.</FONT></UL>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I am replying on behalf of the Chief Executive of the Army Personnel Centre (APC), in his absence on business, to your Question to the Secretary of State for Defence about the performance targets for the APC for the year 1998/99, as this matter falls within the responsibility of this agency.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I should explain that a copy of the APC Annual Report and Accounts 1998/99, published in July 1999, was placed in the library of the House of Commons. Annex A to the report provides details of APC performance against Key Ministerial Targets. The APC met its Key Targets for 1998/99 with the exception of Key Target 3 (KT3) - Notice of Posting, which is expressed as the percentage of personnel posted by the APC who were given at least six months' notice of their individual move. The achievement against this target averaged 25% suggesting that the target was unrealistic in the changed conditions since the target was set. With the continuing level of operational commitments and Strategic Defence Review (SDR) implementation which started in early 1999, this target has been reviewed in the light of this experience, and subject to Ministerial approval, may be adjusted in the APC Business Plan for 2000-01.</FONT></UL>

 The Ministry of Defence is providing four RAF Puma helicopters with around 100 support personnel, and the Royal Fleet Auxiliary FORT GEORGE with five RN Sea King helicopters to assist in the flood relief efforts in Mozambique.

Exceptionally, &#163;615,000 of the costs of the Pumas will be offset by the MOD against the costs of the exercise in Norway from which the helicopters have been withdrawn.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I have been asked by the Secretary of State, in view of my responsibilities as Chief Executive of the Defence Vetting Agency, to provide a detailed response to your Named Day Written Question 111743.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The DVA was set 6 Key Targets in 1998-1999, relating to quality, timeliness and efficiency. The performance of the Agency against these is reflected in the Annual Report and Accounts, which is available in the library of the House of Commons. The complete list of Key Targets and their achievement is shown below.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>1. To maintain quality standards to a 95% level through compliance with agreed procedures, and to develop quality improvement targets in the light of a Defence-wide customer survey. Achieved.</FONT></UL>




<P>
<P><I>8 Mar 2000 : Column: 713W</I><P>

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>2. To complete 85% of Security Checks (SC) within 6 weeks. Achieved.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>3. To complete 71% of Counter Terrorist Checks (CTC) within 6 weeks. Achieved.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>4. To complete 85% of Developed Vetting (DV) checks within 6 months. Achieved.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>5. To reduce the 1997/1998 average times for SC, CTC and DV by 5%. SC and CTC achieved. DV not achieved - failed by 6%.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a. As explained in the Annual Report, this was a new target in 1998/1999, and each of the individual performance indicators was to be reviewed in the light of performance achieved. Thus, there was known to be some uncertainty surrounding these targets from the outset.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>b. Each DV case involves at least one face-to-face interview with the vetting subject, and a number of further interviews with their referees. The number of referees interviewed varies from case to case depending on information available. And the time it takes to arrange and complete all the interviews on any particular case is very variable. For reasons that are not altogether clear, it proved more difficult in 1998/1999 than in 1997/1998 to line up Service personnel in the Army and in the RAF for interview. High turbulence may be a factor.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>c. Failure against the target has not caused undue difficulty for the Services. The same target has been set for 1999/2000, and looks like being met.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>6. To maintain the 1997/1998 Unit Cost of Output. Achieved.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In 1999-2000 the agency will be preparing to collocate at York from its existing locations in central London, Portsmouth, Woolwich and Corsham. In view of this, no improvement in performance has been anticipated during the period.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I hope this explains the position. Please let me know if you require further information.</FONT></UL>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>A series of strategies were introduced to improve performance in 1999/2000.

 My right hon. Friends the Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer discuss many issues, both formally and informally. The Government are well aware of the current market conditions in the UK pig sector and of the representations which have been made for the introduction of some form of aid to compensate for the costs of BSE control measures falling on the pig sector. The scope for providing state aid is an issue which my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister has looked at very closely and will continue to do so. As my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister has made clear, any investment by Government must be linked to the long-term strengthening of the industry as part of an agreed overall strategy. To this end, my officials are in close touch with the National Pig Association and others.

 We are not in a position to estimate the direct and opportunity costs to witnesses or their employers of the Inquiry. Serving civil servants have participated in the Inquiry as part of their employment and relevant direct costs--travel and subsistence--are met from local budgets. Reimbursement from public funds of direct costs incurred by witnesses, who are no longer serving officials, in preparing and giving evidence to the Inquiry which have been paid by the Inquiry, MAFF, DH and other sponsoring departments, amounts to about &#163;60,000.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (1) what is his policy on the methods used for slaughtering day-old chicks; and if he will make a statement;  [112638]

<P>
<P>
<a name="00308w17.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The methods permitted for the killing of surplus chicks and embryos in hatchery waste are specified in EU Council Directive 93/119/EC and "the Welfare of Animals (Slaughter and Killing) Regulations 1995". The following methods are permitted in the UK: (a) the use of a mechanical apparatus producing immediate death; (b) exposure to gas mixtures; and (c) dislocation of the neck. The majority of surplus chicks are killed using one of the first two methods listed above, but no figures on the total numbers killed, or the method used, are available centrally.
<P>

<a name="00308w17.html_para0">These methods were approved after careful consideration. The Farm Animal Welfare Council assessed the mechanical destruction method, and recommended its use in preference to 100 per cent. carbon dioxide. There are currently no plans to change the permitted methods for disposing of surplus chicks.
<P>

<a name="00308w17.html_para1">The number of surplus male chicks disposed of annually is largely dependent on the demand for laying hens: being market-led, it is not a matter on which the Government would wish to legislate. However, research is continuing into the possibility of producing single sex eggs to help reduce the number of unwanted chicks.

 Records are not kept centrally detailing the amount of peat (if any) and peat substitutes that are used on the Ministry's gardens. To find this information would be time consuming and expensive because many contractors, subcontractors and suppliers would have to be approached for their records. Having said that, the Ministry does not have a large acreage of gardens; rather, we have smaller areas of landscaping and flower-beds around buildings.
<P>

<a name="00308w18.html_para0">As I said in my answer of 28 February, since 1993, the Ministry has had a policy that environmentally acceptable alternatives should be substituted for peat.

<P>
<a name="00308w18.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 The adoption of Security Council Resolution 1291, providing for the establishment of a substantial UN observer force in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, is an important step forward. It is a clear demonstration of the Security Council's readiness to provide practical support to the Lusaka Agreement. It provides the framework for the UN and the international community to play a significant role in bringing peace to the Great Lakes region.
<P>

<a name="00308w18.html_para3">Britain wants to see results. That is why we want the observer force to deploy quickly so that it can begin its work, which includes drawing up an action plan for the comprehensive disarmament, demobilisation, resettlement and reintegration (DDRR) of all armed groups listed in the Lusaka Agreement. A credible DDRR plan is vital to the success of Lusaka and to lasting peace in the region.
<P>

 At the end of January 2000, it was estimated that around 99 per cent. of customers who qualified under the existing arrangements had received their full entitlement to a Winter Fuel Payment. The remaining 1 per cent. were those customers whose girocheques had been returned, uncollected, from the Post Office or who queried the amount paid.

<a name="00308w19.html_para2">A total of 43,000 customers have queried the level of their entitlement to a Winter Fuel Payment. Each claim was reconsidered in line with the Decision-Making and Appeal rules, resulting in the issue of a "top-up" payment to some customers. Where the original decision was not changed by the reconsideration, an appeal was sent to the Appeals Service. The total number of appeals to date is 255, but information on whether these have been successful or are still outstanding could only be obtained at a disproportionate cost.

1. The information comes from the 'Households Below Average Income' (HBAI) series. The estimates are presented on household income both Before Housing Costs and After Housing Costs in line with HBAI conventions. All the estimates in the table relate to families with an adult in paid work rather than households with an adult in paid work, but exclude households where there is a full-time self-employed adult.<P>

2. The column headed "Total people in couple families" does not include couples without children.<P>

3. The estimates based on the Family Expenditure Survey (FES) are for the United Kingdom. For 1988-89 and subsequent years, two years' data have been combined to improve the robustness of the results. For 1994-95 onwards, estimates are available from the larger Family Resources Survey (FRS) and relate to single financial years. The FRS results are for Great Britain. <P>

 The Millennium Festival in Scotland has been made possible by the Lottery distributing bodies including the Millennium Commission and the New Millennium Experience Company. They have come together to make available a fund of up to &#163;11 million for community groups, large and small, to apply for funding. The variety of events happening in Scotland throughout the Year 2000 is considerable, from the first ever Millennium Commonwealth Youth Games in Edinburgh to a programme entitled "The Rights of Passage" in Dumfries and Galloway celebrating the notable dates in our life. The Unst Millennium Festival will be held during July 2000 and a number of projects are also happening in the Western Isles, Aberdeenshire and in Argyll and Bute--quite literally throughout the whole of Scotland.
<P>

<a name="00308w20.html_para1">Smaller awards are still available (up to &#163;5,000) through the Awards for All scheme called "Awards for All . . . celebrating the Scottish Millennium Festival" up until the end of April 2000 and small community groups are still applying for this money. The New Millennium Experience Company has also established a website www.millenniumscotland.co.uk as part of the UK Festival website (www.festival2000.co.uk) and in the Scottish section alone there are already over 400 events which will happen in the Year 2000--a testimony to the work of the distributors and the New Millennium Experience

 We have indeed maintained the policy of seeking (and welcoming) any bids from efficient not-for-profit operators; but the selection of the next operator is of course a matter for the National Lottery Commission. The Government's objective is to maximise the returns to good causes and remove unnecessary profit margins. These aims will best be achieved through a robust competition. This has taken place and it is now up to the National Lottery Commission to evaluate the bids.

 <i>[holding answer 6 March 2000]:</i> Tewkesbury has received a lower level of Lottery grants than the UK average. The Government wish to see a more equitable distribution of National Lottery funds across the UK. We have introduced a number of changes through the National Lottery Act 1998 and revised Policy Directions to the distributors which have already begun to improve the geographical spread of funding. My Department, jointly with Lottery distributors, has commissioned research aimed at investigating the reasons for the low take up of Lottery grants in certain areas. While the research concentrates particularly on former coalfield areas, we expect that it will also provide a number of valuable lessons about low take up in other areas, such as Tewkesbury. The first phase of this research has been published and copies have been placed in the Libraries of the House; the second phase will be published shortly.

<P>
<a name="00308w21.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Chris Smith: </B> 
 On 21 February 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 1241, I announced that, from 1 April 1999, the fee for a colour television licence would increase from &#163;101 to &#163;104; the black and white licence fee will rise from &#163;33.50 to &#163;34.50. I have today laid before the House the regulations necessary to bring these fees into force.
<P>

<a name="00308w21.html_para1">The regulations also contain provisions in consequence of our proposal to introduce free television licences for people aged 75 or over from 1 November this year. Anyone aged 75 or over who needs to renew their licence between April and October will be able to purchase a short term licence at a reduced rate, based on the number of months covered. Similar provisions are included for people who, after 1 November, need to renew a licence less than 12 months before their 75th birthday.
<P>

<a name="00308w21.html_para2">We have also included in the regulations a provision to remove an anomaly of the existing concessionary licence scheme, for people in residential homes and sheltered accommodation. The effect of this is to include within the scope of the provision retired persons, whether male or female, aged 60 years or more.

As Director of the Office for National Statistics (ONS), I have been asked to reply to your recent parliamentary question on unemployed individuals from ethnic minorities.
<BR>
Latest available non-seasonally adjusted estimates from the Labour Force Survey (LFS) show that in the autumn (September to November) quarter of 1999 the number of ILO unemployed from all ethnic minorities in the UK was 203,000. This compares to 266,000 in the same period in 1997; a reduction of 23,000.

<BR>
People interviewed in the LFS are asked to classify their own ethnic origin. The figures given represent people who did not classify themselves as being of White origin.
<BR>
The measure of unemployment derived from the LFS is defined on a consistent and internationally recognised basis set out by the International Labour Organisation (ILO). It counts as unemployed people who are a) without a paid job, b) available to start work within the next two weeks and c) have either looked for work in the last four weeks or are waiting to start a job already obtained.

 There are no plans to provide paediatric intensive care facilities at the Royal Bolton Hospital as it would not be appropriate for paediatric intensive care to take place in a District General Hospital setting which would not have either the required skills or bed numbers.
<P>

<a name="00308w22.html_para3">Any perceived need to increase the number of paediatric intensive care beds in the Greater Manchester area will be examined by the North West Specialist Group in consultation with the Paediatric Intensive Care Commissioning Group and the relevant lead health authority. In the event of a subsequent review then the following areas would be examined as part of that process; number of admissions, number of refusals, average length of stay and occupancy rates in relation to the facilities currently available and level of dependency of the child.

 It is not possible to attribute any individual cases of childhood cancer to electric fields. The United Kingdom Childhood Cancer Study, published in December 1999 found no evidence to link childhood cancer with exposure to magnetic fields from the electricity supply. Their report on electric fields is expected later this year. In 1992, the National Radiological Protection Board's Advisory Group on Non-ionising Radiation examined in detail the evidence for an association between the incidence of childhood cancer and exposure to electromagnetic fields. They concluded that there was no clear evidence of an adverse health effect at the levels of electromagnetic field to which the public is normally exposed. A further review which will consider electric and magnetic fields independently, will be published later this year.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00308w24.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The information requested is not available centrally. The General Medical Council is not able to provide this information as not all convictions are reported to them, for example minor driving offences. However, doctors working in the National Health Service are exempt from the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 and when applying for National Health Service posts are expected to declare all previous or pending prosecutions or convictions, including those considered "spent" under the Act.
<P>

<a name="00308w24.html_para0">We are taking action to strengthen existing recruitment and selection procedures. In guidance to be issued shortly, NHS employers will be required to include on the application form a declaration by the applicant of any disciplinary or other action taken against them or anticipated by the police, or by any overseas licensing or regulatory body.
<P>

<a name="00308w24.html_para1">Changes to the regulations governing general practice will require doctors working in general practice, including doctors who work as locums or assistants, to make similar declarations.
<P>

<a name="00308w24.html_para2">Once the General Medical Council has been made aware of a conviction, normally by the police, the case is considered through the conduct procedures, which may result in sanctions that affect the doctor's registration.

 The information requested is not collected centrally. Influenza activity in England is monitored through the Royal College of General Practitioners sentinel surveillance scheme, which records the number of first visits to participating general practitioners of patients with influenza-like illness. This allows calculation of a rate for those cases of influenza presenting in general practice at any given point during the year and allows comparisons with other years. It is not possible to estimate a total figure for cases of influenza each winter from these data. The information is not collected by health authority area.

 We are in the interpandemic period ('phase zero' of the pandemic plan) and were throughout the winter period.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00308w25.html_spnew3"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 A record 8.6 million doses of vaccine were available prior to the winter flu season, of which 7.8 million doses have been distributed to meet orders. Data for flu immunisation uptake among the risk groups is derived from the General Practice Research Database by the Public Health Laboratory Service. Recent changes to the database mean it is not yet possible to provide uptake rates for last year. We expect data to be available within the next few months. In the past, vaccine uptake has not been nearly as high as the Department would like and the Chief Medical Officer has already announced that he will be looking at ways of improving uptake in the future.
<P>

<a name="00308w25.html_para0">National Health Service trusts were advised that they could include immunising healthcare staff as part of their winter planning last year.

<P>
<a name="00308w25.html_spnew6"><B> Yvette Cooper </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 22 February 2000]:</i> Quarterly coverage data from the Public Health Laboratory Service's COVER programme shows uptake of measles, mumps and rubella vaccine at age 24 months at September 1999 as 88 per cent. for the United Kingdom. Uptake in the London region was 80 per cent.
<P>

<a name="00308w25.html_para2">The level of uptake of the vaccine recommended to avoid outbreaks of mumps, measles and rubella is 95 per cent.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00308w25.html_spnew7"><B> Yvette Cooper </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 22 February 2000]:</i> Large measles outbreaks can occur only when the proportion of children susceptible to measles exceeds target levels. These target levels vary by age and have been defined in the World Health Organisation strategy for measles elimination in Europe. The proportion of children susceptible to measles in the United Kingdom can be estimated from vaccine coverage data and from seroprevalence studies which estimate the number of people without protective levels of antibodies to measles.
<P>

<a name="00308w25.html_para3">The Public Health Laboratory Service routinely uses both sources of data to help to predict the likely emergence of measles outbreaks. If the current levels of vaccine coverage are maintained, large measles outbreaks in schools are not likely to occur until after 2001. Smaller outbreaks among communities with lower than average coverage may occur sooner. The Department of Health is aware of two such outbreaks in communities with low immunisation coverage. These began at the end of 1997 and at the end of 1999 and are described in the Communicable Disease Report of 28 January 2000, copies of which have been placed in the Library.

 The National Health Service Centre for Reviews and Dissemination at the University of York is expected to provide their report to Ministers in the spring. It is intended that this report will be published shortly thereafter.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00308w26.html_spnew2"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food/Department of Health Joint Food Safety and Standards Group (JFSSG) has recently completed a survey of fluoride in the 1997 Total Diet Study, a national survey representative of the main types and proportions of foods making up the typical United Kingdom diet. This will show the amount of fluoride in the diet as a whole and in specific food groups including milk and beverages including soft drinks. The results are currently being processed and will be published in full. In addition a test of urinary fluoride is planned for inclusion in the forthcoming National Diet and Nutrition Survey.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will make it a requirement that the NHS should provide for women who have had a radical hysterectomy following cervical cancer, the opportunity to have eggs frozen with a view to surrogate birth at a later stage. [112062]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00308w26.html_spnew3"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 It is the responsibility of clinicians who are providing radical treatments to patients which might affect their fertility, to discuss with them the possibility of storing eggs, embryos or sperm if they feel this is appropriate.
<P>

<a name="00308w26.html_para0">Whether these stored gametes should then be made available for a possible surrogate birth is a matter for those individuals in consultation with their clinicians. We would of course recommend that health authorities seek legal advice before considering funding a surrogacy arrangement on the National Health Service.

[111870]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00308w26.html_spnew4"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 Adoption of the National Health Service mark is being undertaken as items come up for replacement in the normal course of business. As a result, no NHS organisation has been required to undertake any additional work and no additional costs to NHS organisations are envisaged. New NHS organisations

<P>

<a name="00308w26.html_para1">No deadline has been set for NHS organisations to apply the NHS mark universally. Health Authorities have been asked to adopt the existing NHS mark on stationery by January 2001, and NHS trusts by April 2001.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00308w26.html_spnew5"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 An Osteoporosis Strategy was launched in June 1998 by the then Minister for Public Health, my right hon. Friend the Member for Dulwich and West Norwood (Ms Jowell) at the Sixth Bath Conference on Osteoporosis and Bone Mineral Measurement. The Strategy consisted of a Quick Reference Primary Care Guide on prevention and treatment, a laminated desk top guide, and a local health action sheet. Central to the Strategy was the Royal College of Physicians evidence-based Clinical Guidelines on the treatment and prevention of osteoporosis. This has provided a firm basis for health authorities to develop their own strategies.

<a name="00308w26.html_para4">The United Kingdom has an excellent record of tuberculosis control and notifications have reached the relatively low levels of around 6,500 cases a year from nearly 50,000 in 1950.

<P>
<a name="00308w29.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Wilkinson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will make a statement about the future of cleft lip and palate surgery and treatment at Mount Vernon Hospital, Northwood, Middlesex.  [113463]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00308w29.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Denham </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 7 March 2000]:</i> I understand that following advice from an inter-regional group chaired by Professor John Murray, the National Health Service Executive, London Regional Office and its Regional Specialist Commissioning Group (RSCG) take the view that cleft lip and palate surgery cannot be sustained at Mount Vernon Hospital.
<P>

<a name="00308w29.html_para0">At its meeting of 6 March the RSCG recommended that centres should be designated at Great Ormond Street Hospital in partnership with St. Andrew's Centre Broomfield and Guy's and St. Thomas Hospitals, in partnership with Queen Victoria Hospital, East Grinstead. If these proposals are accepted by the health authorities, following consultation, their implementation will require Mount Vernon services to transfer to another site.
<P>

<a name="00308w29.html_para1">My position as a Minister prevents me from commenting further on these proposals at this stage.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health (1) where in London and the south-east of England he has decided that specialist cleft lip and palate surgical facilities will be located;  [113464]
<P>
<UL>(2) which specialist cleft lip and palate surgical and treatment units will be closed in London and south-east England during the next five years.  [113594]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00308w29.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The National Health Service is presently undertaking a review of cleft lip and palate services following the report of the Clinical Standards Advisory Group published in 1998, copies of which are available in the Library. Decisions on the designation of specialist cleft centres in London and south-east regions are expected shortly.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what plans he has to close Harefield Hospital; and if he will make a statement.  [113572]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00308w29.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The proposals made by the West London Partnership Forum (WLPF) relating to specialist services in West London are not about closure. They are about improving care for patients of the future. The WLPF wishes to do this by bringing together world leading teams from both hospitals in the best possible environment for patients, clinical services and research. There will be full public consultation on the options for specialist services in west London, starting in the summer 2000. My position as Minister prevents me from commenting further on the proposals at this stage.

<a name="00308w29.html_spnew5"><B> Jane Kennedy: </B> 
 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="00308w29.html_para2">We do not have information about how many residence orders are extant; however in 1998, the latest year for which figures are published, 30,398 residence orders were made.
<P>

<a name="00308w29.html_para3">Residence orders and adoption orders are not necessarily or usually alternative disposals in the same case. Residence orders are often made in cases in which no question of adoption or any form of state intervention arises, for example to determine which parent a child will live with following the breakdown of a marriage. The Government have no plans to increase the number of residence orders; it is for the courts to determine whether the making of a residence order is in the best interests of the child in any particular case.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00308w29.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Flight: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer for what reason the Inland Revenue designated Indonesia as not being a suitable market in which to invest directly. [112312]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00308w29.html_spnew6"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 The Inland Revenue has a discretionary power to recognise overseas stock exchanges for the general purposes of the Taxes Acts.
<P>

<a name="00308w29.html_para4">Government policy is to consider recognition on application by a foreign exchange. So it does not follow from the fact that an exchange is not recognised that it is considered by the Inland Revenue as unsuitable for investors.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what factors are taken into account by the Inland Revenue in determining whether an overseas stock market should qualify as eligible for inclusion in personal portfolio bonds.  [112313]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00308w29.html_spnew7"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 The test of whether shares and securities are listed on a recognised exchange is widely used to characterise tax provisions and to determine eligibility for tax reliefs. The test is therefore not related specifically to any one particular provision, like personal portfolio bonds.

[111573]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00308w29.html_spnew8"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 This Government have introduced a range of measures designed to make work pay and to increase support for families with children, including the 10p starting rate of tax, the National Minimum Wage and Working Families Tax Credit. The cut in the basic rate is another of those measures. Families with children will on average be &#163;740 per year better off as a result of measures in the last two budgets.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Labour Force Survey (LFS) is the ONS's major source of labour market data on individuals. It can provide information on the earnings of employees and the number and proportion of employees earning below &#163;60. However, LFS estimates on earnings are only available from winter (December to February) 1992/3. Estimates for the autumn (September to November) quarters of 1993, 1997 and 1999 are given in the table below. The figures are for Great Britain and are not seasonally adjusted.</FONT></UL>

The LFS has no information available on the number of households containing an earner who earns less than &#163;60 per week.
<BR>
Estimates from the Family Resources Survey for the period 1997-98 covering Great Britain show that the ratio between the number of households, where at least one earner earns less than &#163;60 a week, and the number of individuals earning less than &#163;60 a week is 96 per cent.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what is the maximum amount of <i>(a)</i> national insurance and <i>(b)</i> personal taxation that an individual will pay under the changes caused by the introduction of IR35.  [112989]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00308w31.html_spnew2"><B> Dawn Primarolo </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 3 March 2000]:</i> The amount of personal tax and National Insurance Contributions that a personal service company will have to pay following the introduction of IR35 will depend on individual circumstances. It is not possible to provide estimates of the maximum amounts payable.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00308w31.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Ottaway: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what is the expected net revenue gain from the introduction of IR35; and what assumptions the Government have made as to the number of business closures and the extent of business migration overseas for the purposes of calculating this figure.  [112763]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00308w31.html_spnew3"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 Estimates of the revenue which will arise from the proposed measure to stop avoidance of tax and National Insurance Contributions using personal service companies were included in the Financial Statement and Budget Report published on Budget Day in March 1999. Information on the assumptions used was included in the Regulatory Impact Assessment on the Welfare Reform and Pensions Bill which was published in October 1999.

<a name="00308w31.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Ottaway: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer how many contractors operating through personal service companies have moved overseas <i>(a)</i> in each year since 1992 and <i>(b)</i> in the last year for which figures are available; and what is his Department's estimate for each of the next three years.

<a name="00308w31.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Ottaway: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will estimate, broken down by industrial sectors, the extra taxation that the introduction of IR35 will place on contractors operating through personal service companies <i>(a)</i> next year, <i>(b)</i> in 2001-02 and <i>(c)</i> in 2002-03, assuming current levels of tax rates.  [112765]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00308w31.html_spnew5"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 I regret that it is not possible to provide a breakdown of the tax liability arising from the introduction of IR35 by industrial sector which prevents avoidance of tax and NICs. However, a breakdown of the 50,000 personal service companies that are estimated to be affected by this measure by broad industry group is provided in the Regulatory Impact Assessment on the Welfare Reform and Pensions Bill published in October 1999.

 All sectors of industry will benefit from the changes we propose. IR35 will prevent avoidance of NIC and right level of tax, allowing us to target support on the real entrepreneurs.

<a name="00308w31.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Matthew Taylor: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer, pursuant to his answers of 19 January 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 516W, on Government debt over the 1975 to 1999 period, what the estimated interest cost of the difference between nominal and gross debt values is; what measures have been undertaken to ensure this will not occur again; and which officials responsible for the debt funding decisions have been disciplined in connection with this matter.  [113468]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00308w31.html_spnew8"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 The answer of 19 January 2000, <i>Official Report,</i> column 516W, on Government debt gave figures for central Government gross debt at <i>(a)</i> nominal and <i>(b)</i> market prices. These are two different valuations of the same debt and so the interest on them would always be the same. The reason for this is that the market values the debt, some of which may have been issued when market conditions for interest rates were different, to reflect current yields. Thus actual interest divided by debt at market valuation is in line with current rates of interest, whereas actual interest divided by nominal debt reflects the mix of historic market conditions when the debt was issued.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what his policy is on the principle of independent taxation of husband and wife.  [113580]<P>
<P>
<P>

 The Chancellor stated his commitment to the principle of independent taxation of husbands and wives when he gave evidence to the Treasury Committee in March 1999.
