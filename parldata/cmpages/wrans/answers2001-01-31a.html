To ask the Secretary of State for Defence (1) if a cost-benefit analysis under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 was conducted for the recent chemically evoked seizure experiments conducted on guinea pigs; and if he will make a statement;  [147181]
<P>

<P>
<a name="10131w01.html_spnew1"><B> Dr. Moonie </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 25 January 2001]:</i> Under the terms of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 all proposals for licences to undertake work involving animals have a requirement to have determined the cost-benefit analysis of the research.
<P>

<a name="10131w01.html_para13">This type of analysis is undertaken as part of the formal ethical review procedure required by the Home Office. It assesses all proposals in detail, prior to submission to the Home Office, to determine whether the benefits likely to result from the project outweigh the cost in suffering to

<P><I>31 Jan 2001 : Column: 184W</I><P>
the animals to be used. This assessment includes the appropriateness of the animal use and the measures to be taken to minimise suffering. It thus demonstrates that as much as possible has been done to replace the procedures with alternatives not using living animals, to reduce numbers of animals used in particular studies; and, to refine the procedures to minimise pain, suffering, distress or lasting harm, a process known in animal welfare circles as the 3Rs.
<P>

<a name="10131w01.html_para14">The chemically evoked seizure research involving guinea-pigs was conducted under a project licence that had been through this rigorous review process. The research was required to provide UK Service Personnel with the best possible medical countermeasures against nerve agent poisoning. To do this it is essential to understand the actions of nerve agents and test possible therapeutic drugs. This research has provided a better understanding of nerve agent-induced seizures, and suggested approaches to their prevention or reversal by the use of anticonvulsant drugs. In addition, the methods developed during this research led to a significant advance, in that many parameters were able to be assessed within the same animal, reducing the number of animals required.

<P>
<a name="10131w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Hancock: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence (1), pursuant to his answer of 21 December 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 249W, on Type 45 destroyers, if the DFM contract resolves conflicts between <i>(a)</i> the prime contractor's incentives to deliver the first batch at a price below the maximum price, <i>(b)</i> the additional cost of employing two yards to design and assemble the first three ships and <i>(c)</i> an unsolicited proposal from BAE Systems Marine for sole sourcing of the assembly of the Type 45 ships; and if he will make a statement;  [147531]

<UL>(2) pursuant to his answer of 21 December 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 248W, on the Type 45 destroyer, what incentives there are in the DFM contract for BAE Systems Electronics to deliver below the maximum price; and if he will make a statement.  [147528]<P></UL>

 This is a matter for the Chief Executive of the Defence Procurement Agency. I have asked the Chief Executive to write to the hon. Member.

<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I am replying to your questions to the Secretary of State for Defence about the Type 45 Destroyer Demonstration and First of Class Manufacture (DFM) contract. This matter falls to me to answer within my area of responsibility as Chief of Defence Procurement and Chief Executive of the Defence Procurement Agency.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The DFM contract has a successive target arrangement which incentivises the Prime Contractor to deliver below the maximum price by increasing the profit he can earn as his costs decrease. This contract does not envisage an alternative procurement strategy or the unsolicited bid. The pricing of this contract matches the existing procurement strategy, in which there is an integrated project design team composed of personnel from Vosper Thornycroft and BAE Systems Marine, with work on the first three ships distributed among the two companies. Although it could be argued that there is some additional cost for the first three ships inherent in this strategy,

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>we believe this to be easily outweighed by the benefits of subsequent competition for which it provides. Any alternative procurement strategy would have to be judged against these broader criteria, not just the price of the DFM contract. Any change to the procurement strategy would need to be approved by the Ministry of Defence and would require the contract to be re-negotiated.</FONT></UL>

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how many armed forces personnel deployed to Sierra Leone have been diagnosed with malaria or admitted to hospital for investigation since May 2000; what percentage of deployed forces this represents; what his Department's estimate was, previous to deployment, of the percentage effectiveness of protection against malaria the preferred anti-malaria treatment afforded; what percentage of forces deployed to Sierra Leone were administered with anti-malarial treatment before deployment; and if he will make a statement.  [147595]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10131w02.html_spnew0"><B> Dr. Moonie </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 29 January 2001]:</i> As of 25 January, there have been 112 confirmed cases of malaria and three suspected cases among Service personnel who have served in Sierra Leone. These figures include personnel who have been referred to hospital for investigation. They represent 1.5 per cent. of deployed forces; 97 per cent. of personnel deployed to Sierra Leone were issued with anti-malarial tablets prior to deployment. It is not normal practice in the field of travel medicine to quote the percentage efficacy of different anti-malarial prophylactic drugs, since the degree of protection can be subject to a wide range of factors; for example, the geographical location, the season, the activities undertaken by the individuals concerned and other types of protection or environmental controls used. Mefloquine is the preferred drug for Sierra Leone as it is more effective than chloroquine and proguanil, and Sierra Leone is a chloroquine-resistant area.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10131w02.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 My hon. Friend appears to be referring to the amendments to Article 133 concerning the common commercial policy. This article extends qualified majority voting in principle to the negotiation and conclusion of agreements relating to trade in services and the commercial aspects of intellectual property. However, unanimity will be retained for certain specified matters (i.e. where unanimity is required for the adoption of equivalent internal EU rules, or where the Community has not exercised related internal rule-making powers).
<P>

<a name="10131w02.html_para3">On certain other matters where competence will continue to be shared between the Community and member states (i.e. trade in cultural, audio-visual, educational, social and human health services) decisions will continue to be reached by consensus. There will be no change to the current arrangements for transport.
<P>

<a name="10131w02.html_para4">The article also makes clear that member states will still be able to negotiate agreements in international organisations, in so far as such agreements respect Community law and other relevant international agreements.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what criteria his Department uses for determining need for motorway service areas.  [147419]<P>

<P>
<a name="10131w04.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 Proposals for new motorway service areas (MSAs) are subject to the normal operation of the land use planning system. It is therefore for local planning authorities--or the inquiry Inspector in the event of an appeal--rather than my Department to weigh the need for a proposed MSA. Guidance to planners on how to assess that need is contained in Circular Roads 1-94 and a policy statement which the then Under-Secretary of State, my hon. Friend the Member for Hampstead and Highgate (Ms Jackson), made to the House on 31 July 1998, <i>Official Report,</i> column 611W. Copies of both documents are available from the Library.

 The statement to the House by the then Under-Secretary of State, my hon. Friend the Member for Hampstead and Highgate (Ms Jackson), on 31 July 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, column 611W, described the Government's policy on the spacing of motorway service areas (MSAs). It explained that this policy was likely to mean that there would be either one or two MSAs on the western side of the M25. The policy did not, and does not, necessarily require an MSA on the south-western sector. Proposals will therefore be considered on their individual planning merits and there is no presumption that either a site within this sector, or any other currently proposed M25 MSA, must be successful.

<P>

<a name="10131w04.html_para0">The CML have been involved from the outset in the Home Buying and Selling Advisory Group, which assists the Government in developing its proposals.

 The Rough Sleepers Unit was established in April 1999 and has a three-year programme expenditure budget up to 31 March 2002 of just over &#163;198 million. This includes a number of funding streams previously administered by other Government Departments, most notably the Department of Health and the Department of Social Security. Almost &#163;73 million of the available funding is capital expenditure administered on the Unit's behalf by the Housing Corporation to provide a range of temporary and permanent accommodation for rough sleepers. The remainder meets the on-going costs of a range of accommodation and support services throughout England to help rough sleepers move away from the streets and to rebuild their lives. The Unit has the ability to use its three-year budget in a flexible manner. Therefore it would not be appropriate to give an annual budget figure.

<a name="10131w04.html_para3">Over the same three-year period, the Rough Sleepers Unit has an administration budget of &#163;3.641 million.

<P>
<a name="10131w05.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Burgon: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions when he expects to announce his conclusions from the review of the Air Quality Strategy objective for particles.  [148393]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10131w05.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The Air Quality Strategy for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland was published on 19 January 2000 following an extensive review of the original Strategy. This sets air quality objectives for eight air pollutants that have the potential for significant health effects. These objectives are to be achieved between 2003 and 2008.
<P>

<a name="10131w05.html_para3">The new Strategy replaces the original objective for particles with new objectives derived from the EU Stage 1 limit values for 2005. This was considered to be the only realistic option in view of the latest information that showed that the original objective would not be achievable in the short term, even with the most ambitious emission reduction measures. The Strategy explains that the new objectives for particles are seen as a staging post and not a final outcome. It goes on to say that the Government are concerned to set their sights beyond the immediate need to comply with the EU limit values, and that work has been set in hand which will enable the prospects for strengthening these objectives to be assessed before the next general review of the Strategy.
<P>

<a name="10131w05.html_para4">This work is nearing completion. The most significant area of work is likely to be advice from the Department of Health's Committee on the Medical Effects of Air Pollution (COMEAP) on the chronic effects of air pollution. To date, the health implications of particle air pollution have tended to focus on the acute, short-term effects. COMEAP's 1998 report suggested that the deaths of over 8,000 vulnerable people may be brought forward and over 10,000 hospital admissions and re-admissions may be associated with short-term air pollution each year. Evidence is now beginning to emerge which suggests that the long-term chronic effects of particle air pollution may 



<P>
<P><I>31 Jan 2001 : Column: 199W</I><P>
be considerably more significant. COMEAP has been asked by the Department of Health to consider the evidence and the Committee is expected to report shortly.
<P>

<a name="10131w05.html_para5">Advice from COMEAP may, if relevant, be used to support a quantification of the benefits to health from reducing concentrations of particles. These health benefits, along with the information that we already have on the acute health effects of particle pollution, can be considered alongside the latest information on the measures to reduce particle concentrations. A comprehensive study of the costs of emission reduction measures is in hand, as is further modelling work, that will show the impact that recently announced policy measures are likely to have on concentrations of particles over the next few years.
<P>

<a name="10131w05.html_para6">I now intend the review of the objectives for particles to commence in March, to allow time for these various pieces of work to be completed. I expect to be in a position to consult on proposals for a new objective for particles by the end of June.
<P>

<a name="10131w05.html_para7">It is not intended to propose a change to the existing objective for particles. It is important that local authorities have a period of stability as they take forward the local air quality management process. Any new objective will be for the longer term.
<P>

<a name="10131w05.html_para8">In the meantime, the trend in urban air quality is continuing to improve. I announced earlier this month that in 2000 in urban areas there were 17 days of moderate or higher air pollution on average per site, the lowest figure recorded since the series began in 1993. Days of moderate or higher air pollution caused by particles have fallen steeply since 1993.

the Government's target is to halve this by March 2002. Substantial progress has already been made--the national average fell to an estimated 94 days by October 2000.

 <i>[holding answer 29 January 2001]:</i> Available information, taken from the Home Office Court Proceedings Database, showing the number of offenders aged under 18 years sentenced and the sentences imposed in (i) the magistrates court, (ii) the youth court and (iii) the Crown court are given in the tables for the period 1995 to 1999 (the most recent year for which data are available).
<P>

<a name="10131w06.html_para0">The custodial and non-custodial disposals available to the youth court, and the number of occasions each type of disposal has been used over the past five years by the youth court are also listed in the tables. A number of new orders became available for juveniles in 2000. A new custodial order, the Detention and Training Order was introduced on 1 April 2000 and replaces the secure training order (for 12 to 14-year-olds) and detention in a Young Offender Institution (for 15 to 17-year-olds). New non-custodial disposals, the reparation order and the action plan order, were introduced in June 2000.

 The report "Speaking up for Justice", published in June 1998, recommended that good practice guidelines for the use of professional witnesses in criminal cases should be developed by the Local Government Association in conjunction with the Association of Chief Police Officers. We hope to be in a position to issue such guidelines shortly.

 At least 150 anti-social behaviour orders have been made since the provision came into force on 1 April 1999. Since the minimum duration of an order is two years, and we are not aware of any orders being discharged, we understand that all of these remain in force.
<P>

<a name="10131w07.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 Joint working is one of the Government's core principles for delivering efficient and modern public services. The communications systems of each of the emergency services need to be able to meet the particular operational requirements of that service. But the systems also need to support effective interworking between the services. My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary has therefore asked representatives of the police, fire and emergency ambulance services to put proposals by Easter 2001 to him and to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Health on how collaboration between those services in communications and in other areas can be encouraged and improved.

 No. The Bailiwicks of Jersey and Guernsey are separate jurisdictions, with their own legislatures, legal systems and judiciaries. Each has its own Lieutenant Governor, who is the personal representative of Her Majesty The Queen. It would not be appropriate to have a single Lieutenant Governor for the two Bailiwicks.

They are given by financial year so as to include the most up to date figures available. Those for the period since March 2000 are being collated and should be available in May. I regret that these self-harm figures are not available for female prisoners by age.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what research he has <i>(a)</i> commissioned and <i>(b)</i> evaluated into deaths and incidents of self-harm in women's prisons.  [147470]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10131w07.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 There is a wide range of research studies covering many aspects of self-harm and suicidal behaviour in women's prisons. The Prison Service is planning a new research and evaluation strategy for self-inflicted deaths and self-harm in custody and will take into account the learning from these and other studies.




<P>
<P><I>31 Jan 2001 : Column: 206W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="10131w07.html_para2">Previous projects include research into the institutional factors of self-harm at Bullwood Hall prison; the management and recording of suicidal behaviour at Styal prison; and the management of self-harm, characteristics of those who self-harm, and evaluation of intervention effectiveness at Holloway prison. Current projects include a study of women life sentence prisoners and suicidal behaviour at Highpoint prison. All generic studies of self-inflicted deaths include women prisoners.

factors underlying the recent increase in the number of women sentenced to imprisonment.  [147457]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10131w07.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The number of women prisoners increased by 100 per cent. from 1993 to 1998, compared with a 45 per cent. increase in the number of men. The increase is due to more women going through the courts, and more women getting custodial sentences and for longer periods. In 1999, 70,800 women were proceeded against for indictable offences compared with 68,500 in 1998. Since 1997 the custody rate for women has increased by just over a quarter compared with a 9 per cent. increase for men. In the last five years, 50 per cent. of the rise is due to more women being convicted of drugs offences.

<a name="10131w07.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 In March 2000, 40 of the 130 girls sentenced and remanded to custody were held outside the Prison Service. Following the Government's changes to the sentencing, remand and placement arrangements last year this total has increased to 60. We aim to increase it further but as the total of girls in custody is rising we cannot set a date for removing 15 and 16-year-olds completely from Prison Service accommodation.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10131w07.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 22 January 2001]:</i> The only information collected centrally about force recruitment by intake is that required for the purposes of monitoring the Crime Fighting Fund (CFF) and calculating CFF grant. Forces are not asked for details of all planned and actual recruits, only for the number of appointments on probation. For CFF purposes any officer appointed on transfer from the Royal Ulster Constabulary is also counted in this category. The figures provided by forces are the source of the information given in this answer.
<P>

<a name="10131w07.html_para4">Individual force plans for particular recruitment intakes have changed frequently according to the success of the force in attracting and processing applications. The table sets out the actual recruitment, month by month, reported by each force for the period 1 April to 15 December 2000. This was the cut-off date for the most recent payment of CFF grant. The table shows separately the number of officers deemed to be CFF recruits and other appointments on probation. The number of recruits deemed to be CFF officers is calculated as a proportion of the force's projected total appointments on probation. If the total of these appointments for the year varies from a force's projections, the number of recruits deemed to be CFF officers may also change.
<P>

<a name="10131w07.html_para5">In view of the frequent changes to force plans for the number of recruits on each intake, it is difficult to offer a meaningful force by force projection for each intake for the remainder of 2000-01. However, returns from forces suggest that by 31 March 2000 a total of 7,250 appointments on probation will have been made in the financial year 2000-01. Of these 2,750 will be deemed to be CFF recruits.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10131w08.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Russell Brown: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will make a statement about progress on implementing the recommendations made by KPMG in December 1999 on the adequacy of the risk management systems and processes of the Export Credits Guarantee Department.  [148480]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10131w08.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 The Government, in their response to the Trade and Industry Committee's report on the future of ECGD, noted that it intended to commission a follow-up, independent report to assess progress in addressing the recommendations made by KPMG in 1999 [Cm 4792]. I announced the Terms of Reference for this follow-up review to the House on 30 November 2000. KPMG have been re-engaged for this review which is to be undertaken in two stages. The first stage is now complete and I have placed a copy of KPMG's report in the Library of the House. KPMG's conclusions were as follows:
<P>

<a name="10131w08.html_para0"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"A significant volume of work has been undertaken in addressing the recommendations set out in the original KPMG report. Most of the recommendations have been addressed, although there are still some areas outstanding. However, in most cases, the implementation of the proposals made to address the recommendations is still in course.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="10131w08.html_para1"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>As a result, the majority of steps taken to address the recommendations could only be reviewed through studying the so called Product Papers relating to each area of the Action Plan, and the practical effectiveness could not be reviewed. Many of the findings of this report have, therefore, stated a requirement for further review in Phase 2 of the review. In many cases, it will be necessary for ECGD to revise the processes proposed by the Action Plan Products to fit the PMS3 framework and this is likely to involve a considerable volume of work.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="10131w08.html_para2"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Therefore, as regards Section 5 of the original KPMG report, we believe that there is a need for ECGD to formally monitor the implementation of the Product Papers and their associated recommendations, in order to maintain the momentum required to ensure full implementation in advance of Phase 2 of the review.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="10131w08.html_para3"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>As regards Section 4 of the original report and progress towards capitalisation, there was found to be a high degree of commitment within ECGD to the development of the PMS3 framework. There has been considerable progress in the high level design of the constituent elements of a capitalisation framework comparable to best practice in the commercial sector. However, in most cases, the detailed design of the various elements is still in course and was not therefore ready for review.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="10131w08.html_para4"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The high level review of the elements in place revealed that significant progress has been made towards the development of the PMS3 framework, but that there is also a great deal more work to be completed for ECGD to successfully meet the April 2001 implementation date. This is particularly the case regarding 



<P>
</UL></FONT><P><I>31 Jan 2001 : Column: 212W</I><P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the development of the operational framework within which PMS3 will work. It is recommended that fulfilment of the criteria set out in Annex B of this report should be reviewed in Phase 2 to more fully assess the potential effectiveness of the PMS3 framework.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="10131w08.html_para5"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Overall, therefore, whilst we believe that significant progress has been made in addressing the recommendations, it is clear that there is still a considerable amount of implementation work to be completed before the operating environment will be appropriate for the delegation of full operational autonomy to ECGD and the adoption of the purely strategic relationship proposed in Product E4 of the Action Plan".

<P>
<a name="10131w08.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Andrew Smith: </B> 
 The extent to which unemployment affects Government revenues and spending depends on a number of assumptions, in particular the extent to which unemployment reflects permanent changes in output growth. Treasury research on this is included in "Fiscal policy: public finances and the cycle" (March 1999). As a result of falling levels of unemployment, social security expenditure to the unemployed is forecast to be &#163;4 billion lower, in real terms, in 2000-01 than in 1996-97. DSS ready reckoners estimate that an increase of 100,000 in claimant unemployed would lead to an increase in expenditure of around &#163;500-&#163;550 million a year. Public revenue and spending effects of unemployment in different employment sectors are not available.

when the firm closed to new business that the Equitable Life was not insolvent. In the case of insolvent insurance firms, the relevant compensation scheme is that provided for under the Policyholders Protection Act 1975.

 The prices paid by the National Health Service for the main medicines prescribed and available generically fell by around 30 per cent. overall in 2000, with most of the falls occurring in anticipation of and in response to the introduction of our maximum price scheme for generics in July 2000. This represents an estimated saving to the National Health Service in 2000 of some &#163;170-&#163;180 million compared to prices in January 2000.

These are that food, not only for retail sale but throughout the food chain, must not have been rendered injurious to health, be unfit, or be so contaminated that it would be unreasonable to expect it to be eaten.

<a name="10131w10.html_para1">In order to qualify as an orthopaedic surgeon, a doctor would have to complete a medical degree, one year of general clinical training, a minimum of two years as a senior house officer and six years as a specialist registrar.
<P>

<a name="10131w10.html_para2">The costs to the National Health Service and Higher Education Funding Council in England of a five year undergraduate medical course plus a year of general clinical training are in the region of &#163;160,000 to &#163;200,000. The health service makes a significant investment in postgraduate medical education. Doctors in postgraduate training follow an apprenticeship model where their training is inextricably bound up with the service they provide. Even within specialties the length and type of training will vary according to the particular career path an individual chooses and their rate of progress. For these reasons it is not possible to put a meaningful figure to the cost of training individuals to completion of specialist training.

 There are different patterns of MRSA incidence throughout the country. Expert opinion is that it is not desirable or practical to screen all patients for MRSA but this is a matter for local determination. Mandatory surveillance of blood stream infections, including those caused by MRSA, is to be introduced from April 2001. This will enable National Health Service trusts more effectively to target interventions at patients most at risk.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. For 1996 and the first half of 1997 data have been amalgamated to the approximate boundaries of the new Regional Office areas. This allows for comparison with subsequent years.<P>

2. An incident is three or more patients infected or colonised by the same strain of MRSA in the same month from the same hospital.<P>

3. The criteria for submission of isolates of MRSA (and other isolates of staphylococcus aureus) to the PHLS for specialist tests have been revised twice since 1996 (in January 1998 and in January 2000).<P>

4. These revised criteria have led to a fall in the number of incidents of MRSA that were reported to the PHLS and cannot be used as a reliable estimate of the total number of cases of MRSA. <P>

 <i>[holding answer 22 January 2001]:</i> I have asked my officials to consult the UK agriculture industry on the impact of the introduction of the new EU-wide feed controls, including the ban on fishmeal. A consultation paper including a draft Regulatory Impact Assessment has been sent to representative organisations for comments by 2 February. It is also available on the MAFF website http://www.maff.gov.uk and in the Libraries of the House.

 <i>[holding answer 18 January 2001]:</i> By September 2004, there will be a free early education place in Somerset for every three-year-old whose parents want one.
<P>

<a name="10131w13.html_para0">To move towards this achievement, the Government have allocated to Somerset funding for 1,704, 2,262 and 2,786 places for the three financial years to 2004 (allocations for the last two years are indicative). The LEA is already funding further places in the maintained sector.
<P>

<a name="10131w13.html_para1">Our experience tells us that some parents do not take up places as soon as their children are three and do not always want a full-time place. Building that knowledge into our assumptions, over the three financial years

in question there will be free places for 47 per cent., 60 per cent. and 70 per cent. of three-year-olds in Somerset. These figures are averages based on the number of places available for the year as a whole. Local education authorities have been asked to increase places on a term by term basis to build up to universal provision, therefore the figures in the spring term are likely to be higher than the annual average.
<P>

<a name="10131w13.html_para2">In 1997, about 8.5 per cent. of Somerset's three-year- olds had places in local education authority maintained nurseries.
<P>

<a name="10131w13.html_para3">Since September 1998, all four-year-olds have been able to access a free, part time, early education place.

<a name="10131w13.html_para23">The working age employment rate in Slough UA in autumn 2000 was 77.8 per cent., above the UK rate of 74.7 per cent. The rate in autumn 1997 was 78.9 per cent., in autumn 1998 was 71.4 per cent., and in autumn 1999 was 77.7 per cent. As can be seen, these data are volatile and our best interpretation of the trend in the employment rate for Slough since 1997 is that it has been broadly flat.
<P>

<a name="10131w13.html_para24">The claimant unemployment rate has fallen from 3.2 per cent. in December 1997 to 2.1 per cent. in December 2000 in the constituency of Slough.

These figures are based on education Standard Spending Assessments combined with central Government grant. They demonstrate a trend showing gradual convergence between overall primary and secondary funding. It is, of course, for each local education authority ultimately to decide the balance between primary and secondary funding for its schools.
<P>

Under the last Government, funding per pupil fell by &#163;60 in real terms between 1994-95 and 1997-98. There will be further increases in funding following the year 2000 spending review: a further &#163;370 per pupil over the three year period, taking the total increase to nearly &#163;700 between 1997-98 and 2003-04.

<P>
<P>

 All working parents, subject to their income, are eligible to receive Working Families Tax Credit (WFTC). The Childcare Tax Credit (CTC) element of WFTC can meet up to 70 per cent. of eligible child care costs.
<P>

<a name="10131w14.html_para5">WFTC helps with the cost of overnight care where it is done by a child care provider who is registered under the Children Act. But we recognise that some parents, with certain working hours or particular needs, have little option except to employ child care providers who fall outside the eligible arrangements. We are looking at the scope to extend access to the CTC for these groups and what quality assurance arrangements would be appropriate.

 The Employment Service provides a range of services which support people with acquired brain injury. It provides a network of Disability Employment Advisers, who, in addition to providing advice about job opportunities, act as the gateway to specialist programmes aimed at securing a return to work. One of these is Work Preparation, for which the Employment Service contracts with local providers who deliver flexible programmes tailored to the needs of each individual. Other measures which can be used to help people with acquired brain injury are the Access to Work Programme and the Job Introduction Scheme.

This money remains available to be spent by Iraq under future phases of the "oil for food" programme. There is no relationship between this money and reparations under the UN Compensation Fund. However, it is worth noting that as a measure to give further support to the Iraqi people, the UN Compensation Commission agreed to reduce from 30 per cent. to 25 per cent. the proportion of revenue dedicated to the UN Compensation Fund under Phase IX of the "oil for food" programme, so releasing more money for food, medicines and other humanitarian relief.

<a name="10131w17.html_para5"><i>Open debate on conflict prevention</i>
<P>

<a name="10131w17.html_para6">In open debate, the Council agreed that the EU possessed appropriate resources and instruments to play a major role in conflict prevention, but needed to manage them more coherently and systematically.
<P>

<a name="10131w17.html_para7"><i>Orientation debate on strengthening the EU's external action</i>

<a name="10131w17.html_para8">The Council held its first ever debate on the priorities and quality of the EU's external actions, including external assistance.
<P>

<a name="10131w17.html_para9">The Council expressed broad support for Commission reforms covering both the process and the implementation of external assistance, and hoped that they would continue. The Council also agreed on the need for greater coherence, focus, flexibility and consistency in the use of external relations instruments. The Presidency concluded that Council views were converging on priorities for external action, namely: neighbouring countries (including the accession countries), poverty reduction, conflict prevention, and co-operation with major international actors. In addition, external actions needed to be responsive to both new expenditure pressures and to long-term priorities. These conclusions, together with the discussion itself and the Presidency paper on external action reforms would provide general guidance for the Commission in preparing the 2002 budget. (The Council remitted to COREPER further work on common strategies and other suggestions which arose during the debate, including the Foreign Secretary's proposal that the GAC hold a follow-up debate later in the year in connection with the draft budget).

The GAC urged the authorities in Serbia and Montenegro to agree on a new constitutional arrangement, within a federal framework. The GAC also called for the speedy release of Kosovo Albanian and other prisoners held without charge or on political grounds.

[147370]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10131w18.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 During the last 12 months the UN has continued to direct 66 per cent. of "oil for food" revenue to the UN's humanitarian programme in Iraq, 30 per cent. to the UN Compensation Fund and 4 per cent. to UN administration of the programme. However, for the current phase of "oil for food" (December 2000-June 2001) the UN has agreed to reduce the UN Compensation Fund share to 25 per cent. and increase the humanitarian programme share to 71 per cent. as a gesture to the Iraqi people.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what steps are being taken to combat the smuggling of embargoed goods to and from Iraq; and what role Turkey plays in this process.  [147025]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10131w18.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Wilson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 30 January 2001]:</i> The UN sanctions regime continues to be largely effective in controlling the flow of embargoed goods into and out of Iraq and denying the Iraqi regime of funds outside UN control. However we remain concerned about breaches of sanctions, in particular the smuggling of Iraqi oil through the Gulf and across Iraq's land borders, which has the effect of depriving the Iraqi people of humanitarian aid under the UN "oil for food" programme.
<P>

<a name="10131w18.html_para3">Where we have firm evidence that embargoed goods are being smuggled, we press Governments, including that of Turkey, both bilaterally and through the UN Sanctions Committee to take action against the smugglers. We also continue to play an active role in the Multinational Interception Force, which through its regular patrolling, helps to deter smuggling through the Gulf.

In his reply of 24 January, Mr. Arlacchi assured me that he had invited a management audit of the UNDCP by the UN Office of Internal Oversight Services in New York, and that UK funds had been properly managed. In response to requests from donor countries, Mr. Arlacchi has also produced a paper on management reform which we and other donors are studying.
