 DWP lead the Government's response to some of the biggest issues facing the country-welfare and pension reform-and are a key player in tackling child poverty<sup>(1)</sup>. As the biggest delivery department in the UK, DWP makes a difference to millions of people every day, helping them to lead safer, fairer and more rewarding lives that are free from poverty. We want to give people more choice and control over their lives and are committed to providing greater choice and personalised support to everyone who needs it so they have the opportunity to get into and remain in work. We believe that work works. Even in economically challenging times we know that work works for the most vulnerable and the disadvantaged.</p>

Since January 1998, the number of people unemployed in Great Grimsby has increased by 8 per cent. to 4,704, but the number unemployed for more than one year has decreased by 37 per cent. to 745. From August 1997 to August 2009 the number of lone parents claiming income support in Great Grimsby has decreased by 15 per cent. to 1,950.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_377"><a name="100310w0002.htm_para2"><a name="10031076000162">Our new deals have helped lone parents, the young unemployed, the long-term unemployed, disabled people, the over 50s and partners of unemployed people to move from benefit into work. Since their inception over 2.2 million people in Great Britain have found work with the support of the new deal, and 6,820 have been helped in Great Grimsby.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_379"><a name="100310w0002.htm_para4"><a name="10031076000164">We introduced a target to halve child poverty by 2010-11 on the way to eradicating it by 2020. Poverty is measured using a headline indicator of the proportion of children in households with an income below 60 per cent. of contemporary household median income before housing costs. This is in line with international best practice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_383"><a name="100310w0002.htm_para8"><a name="10031076000168">This year we will be spending over £13 billion more on pensioners than if we had continued with the policies that were in place in 1997. Around half of that money will go to the poorest third of pensioners.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_384"><a name="100310w0002.htm_para9"><a name="10031076000169">In 1997 the poorest pensioners, who received income support, lived on £69 a week (£98 in today's prices). Today pension credit, which was introduced in 2003, means no pensioner needs to live on less than £130 a week, £198.45 for couples. As of August 2009 6,670 pensioners in Great Grimsby are benefiting from pension credit.</p>

cent. of contemporary median household income after housing costs) fell from 32 per cent. to 18 per cent. since 1997<sup>(2)</sup>.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_387"><a name="100310w0002.htm_para12"><a name="10031076000172">Pensioners in the UK also benefit from a range of additional support such as the winter fuel payment which this winter is worth £250 for households with someone aged between 60 to 79 and £400 for households with someone aged 80 or over. These payments provide vital reassurance to older people that they can afford to turn up their heating during cold weather. Prior to winter 1997-98 less than £60 million per year was spent helping pensioners meet their fuel bills-we now spend around £2.7 billion on winter fuel payments alone. In winter 2008-09 (the last winter for which information is available) 16,720 people aged 60 and over benefited from winter fuel payments in Great Grimsby.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_388"><a name="100310w0002.htm_para13"><a name="10031076000173">We have also taken steps to strengthen and protect the private pensions system to ensure people can continue to have confidence to save for their future through the establishment of the Pensions Protection Fund, the financial assistance scheme and a more powerful and proactive pensions regulator.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_389"><a name="100310w0002.htm_para14"><a name="10031076000174">The protection system ensures that, unlike in 1997, people aren't left without a pension even in the event that their employer becomes insolvent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_391"><a name="100310w0002.htm_para16"><a name="10031076000176">We have also taken forward a radical package of pension reforms in the Pensions Acts of 2007 and 2008 which will deliver a fairer and more generous state pension and extend the opportunity of workplace pension saving to millions, many for the first time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_392"><a name="100310w0002.htm_para17"><a name="10031076000177">The state pension reforms begin to come into effect from 2010 and will mean around three quarters of women reaching state pension age in 2010 are expected to qualify for a full basic state pension compared to half without reform.</p>

Disabled people in Great Grimsby will have benefited from these improvements. The Welfare Reform Act 2009 contains powers to increase choice and control for disabled adults, including disabled parents who are entitled to state support, enabling them to choose how certain state support is used to meet their individual needs. This will be trailblazed in eight local authority sites from late 2010. Older and less well off carers have gained extra help through the provisions within the National Carers Strategy.</p>

The change in this forecast is due to savings achieved by the FCO through negotiations in international forums, in particular at the UN in June 2009, as well as exchange rate movements since March 2009.

 The Highways Agency does not purchase salt directly. This is the responsibility of its contracted service providers, as part of their routine requirement to deliver the winter service to keep the strategic network safe and open during severe winter weather. Consequently the Highways Agency does not keep records on where its service providers have purchased salt and cannot therefore confirm if any overseas salt has been purchased during the last 12 years. Notwithstanding this, as a result of the national salt shortages experienced over the last two winters, the Highways Agency has helped facilitate the importation of overseas salt to its service providers. In 2008-09 season, the Highways Agency helped to import approximately 58,000 tonnes of salt from overseas sources, with a further 127,000 tonnes imported in the 2009-10 winter season.</p>

<i> [holding answer 5 March 2010]:</i> Between 1 January 2001 and 31 December 2008 there were 28 Army personnel and 15 RAF personnel medically discharged from service with a principal condition of 'mental and behavioural disorder due to the use of alcohol'. There were no naval service personnel medically discharged with this principal condition during this period. Statistical data in respect of medical discharges for 2009 are currently being compiled.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_495"><a name="100310w0007.htm_para19"><a name="10031081000035">With regard to administrative discharge, this information could only be provided at disproportionate cost.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_496"><a name="100310w0007.htm_para20"><a name="10031081000036">All three services run robust programmes designed to raise awareness and promote the message of sensible drinking. These programmes address all serving personnel; there are also additional measures in place to assist commanding officers in countering the potential danger to their people. The sale of alcohol and individual consumption limits are regulated particularly, but not only, when personnel are serving operationally. These controls are supported by disciplinary measures where necessary. Individuals identified as being at risk receive counselling and welfare support. This can include attendance on preventative early intervention programmes designed to alert them to the harm that alcohol can cause to themselves and others. More serious cases are treated through specialist medical and psychological treatment and rehabilitation, including where appropriate as inpatients.</p>

Bonuses reward and provide incentives for in-year delivery of key results. Over the three years of SR 04 the Home Office met all its PSA objectives.</p>

 Mandarin language skills are becoming increasingly important for the future of our economy and we wish to encourage schools to offer the language where possible. Languages will become compulsory for 7 to 11-year-olds from September 2011. The choice of which languages to teach is for schools to make. We are funding the development of the primary schools workforce to prepare for compulsory language learning, including beginning in 2010/11 a primary initial teacher training programme with a Mandarin specialism.</p>

Since 2008 we have widened the range of languages secondary schools can offer by lifting the requirement that schools must teach first a working language of the European Union. Research shows that 16 per cent. of secondary schools are now offering Mandarin Chinese either within or outside curriculum time, up from 9 per cent in 2007.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_585"><a name="100310w0016.htm_para12"><a name="10031086001423">Languages have not been compulsory for 14 to 16-year-olds since 2004. Since then, languages have been an entitlement subject and schools must offer the opportunity to learn a language to all pupils who wish to do so. While the overall numbers of entries by pupils for a GCSE in a language have declined, the number of pupils in England entered for a GCSE in Mandarin has increased by some 70 per cent. from 1,444 in 2002 to 2,448 in 2009.</p>

 It is the responsibility of local authorities to secure a place for every child of statutory school age in their area who needs one. The Department provides capital to support this duty. From 2008-09 to 2010-11, over £1.2 billion of capital funding has been allocated nationally through the Basic Need programme to local authorities for providing additional places. Basic Need funding is partly allocated on forecasts of growth in pupil numbers provided by each authority. Where providing additional places is a local priority, authorities can also use funding from other sources, including receipts, planning gains and other major schools capital programmes. In total, from 2008-09 until 2010-11, Hertfordshire has been allocated over £90 million of schools capital which could be used to provide additional places where there is need.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_616"><a name="100310w0019.htm_para4"><a name="10031086001584">Guidance on the use of simple cautions is clear that they should not be used for serious offences. In the vast majority of serious sexual offences a caution would not be appropriate and a prosecution would be in the public interest. The decision to caution an offender for an indictable-only offence such as rape will always be taken by the Crown Prosecution Service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_617"><a name="100310w0019.htm_para5"><a name="10031086001585">There will, however, always be exceptional cases in which it would not be in the interest of the victim or the public to prosecute, and in these circumstances administering a caution is considered to be preferable to taking no further action, and ensures that the offender is put on the sexual offenders' register and can be monitored. In some sexual offences cases, for example, it may be decided that the age, welfare or mental well-being of the victim or offender argues against putting them through a trial. In addition, children below the age of 13 cannot consent to sexual relations in law, and so such cases may be classified as rape even where the offence otherwise has the characteristics of a consenting sexual relationship.</p>

 The Enterprise Finance Guarantee (EFG) is a facility for additional lending to viable SMEs who sit on the margins of commercial lending decisions due to lack of security or track record. It enables loan facilities of between £1,000 and £1 million, to SMEs with a turnover of up to £25 million. EFG may be used to enable new terms loans, refinancing of existing term loans, overdraft conversion, guarantees on invoice facilities, and guarantees on new or increased overdraft borrowing. Businesses are advised to approach one or more of the 44 approved EFG lenders, which includes the main UK high street banks to discuss their lending needs. However, all decisions on individual lending are at the discretion of the lender. Further details on EFG are on the BIS website:</p>
