Requests for the release of information must be approved by the NDNAD Strategy Board. The Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 lays down that DNA samples and the profiles derived from them can only be used for the purposes of prevention and detection of crime, the investigation of an offence, the conduct of a prosecution or, since April 2005, for the purposes of identifying a deceased person.

<p><a name="stpa_483"><a name="81111w0010.htm_para2"><a name="08111166000019">Rent restructuring is intended to make rent setting fair and transparent, it aims to keep rents affordable, well below those in the private sector, and at similar levels for similar properties.</p>

<i> [holding answer 10 November 2008]:</i> The estimated annual capitation costs for an infantry battalion ranges between &#163;19 million and &#163;22 million depending on the battalion's role.

 The Government funded Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) is working on this issue. WRAP has started a project to measure the volume of glass going into the hospitality sector and the volume being recovered. This project will also identify examples of best practice that can be used to promote glass recycling in the sector. Data on glass being recovered have been estimated from a number of sources, but the early results suggest that less than 20 per cent. of the glass entering the sector is recovered for any form of recycling. The next phase of this project will be to develop a voluntary agreement which asks the sector to commit to glass recycling. This will include discussions with glass processors to ensure that the increased glass tonnage can be diverted back into bottle recycling.</p>

 The Environment Agency are developing an end-of-waste protocol for the production of processed fuel oil from waste lubricating oils, and have recently consulted on the possible terms of this protocol. The Agency's draft makes it clear that, where the proposed criteria are met, the resulting processed fuel oil will normally be regarded as having been fully recovered and to have ceased to be waste. It is anticipated that a post-consultation draft of the protocol will be submitted to the European Commission in January 2009 for notification as a technical regulation in accordance with the Technical Standards Directive (98/34/EC).</p>

 The Strategic Review of Packaging Policy was initiated as a response to the Prime Ministers Strategy Unit &#145;Food Matters&#146; report published in July 2008.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_538"><a name="81111w0014.htm_para5"><a name="08111174000148">Since July, DEFRA and the Department for Business Enterprise and Regulatory Reform have been working together in collaboration with the Devolved Administrations to develop a strategy for packaging.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_539"><a name="81111w0014.htm_para6"><a name="08111174000149">The strategy will aim to set out how packaging policy will play its part in the climate change and resource efficiency agenda over the next decade and beyond, and how it will address consumer concerns about packaging. The strategy will be a policy statement describing where packaging policy should contribute to the set out in the 2007 Waste Strategy for England and be gradually phased in over a number of years, starting in delivery ambitions implementation will early 2009.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_540"><a name="81111w0014.htm_para7"><a name="08111174000150">Despite the short timescales, the Government have consulted a wide range of stakeholders during the formation of this strategy. These key stakeholders included the Advisory Committee on Packaging (ACP) which has representatives from compliance schemes, waste management companies, brands and manufacturers; the Packaging Recycling Action Group (PRAG), which has representatives from trade organisations, retailers, local government and manufacturers; the Waste Action Forum, Improvement and Efficiency South East, the Local Government Association, the Waste and Resources Action Programme, Friends of the Earth, the Sustainable Development Commission and the Green Alliance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_541"><a name="81111w0014.htm_para8"><a name="08111174000151">Additionally, DEFRA held a successful stakeholder event on 17 October. The event tested emerging thinking on the current direction of the packaging strategy and gathered a rang of stakeholder opinions. Around 50 organisations were represented at the event, including Material Organisations, Alupro, Corus, the British Plastics Federation, packaging designers and manufacturers including Deputy Speaker Smith Packaging and Sealed Air and packaging industry trade organisations including INCPEN and the Packaging Federation.</p>

<i> [holding answer 3 November 2008]:</i><i> </i>Officials met with representatives of the applicant group in May 2007 to discuss the outstanding points relating to the product specification for the Colchester Native Oyster. Following that meeting, some further information relating to the geographical area and other aspects of the application was sought from the applicant group. Unfortunately, despite regular reminders from officials (most recently in early October 2008), that information has not been forthcoming. This means that it has not been possible to complete our assessment of the validity of the application for protected geographical indication status for the Colchester Native Oyster. We will continue to pursue this with the applicant group.</p>

 The Government have placed victims and witnesses at the heart of the criminal justice system and given support services to them a high priority.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_579"><a name="81111w0018.htm_para13"><a name="08111181000513">Since 2004 the Government have introduced the Code of Practice for Victims of Crime which gives victims legal rights to support and information about their case. They have also supported the development of Victim Support into a strong national organisation able to help more victims more quickly. Victim Support is an independent charity and is the main provider of services to victims and witnesses across England and Wales. Over recent years funding has increased from &#163;11.7 million to &#163;30 million. Victim Support has recently introduced an improved business process, with an additional &#163;12.6 million from Government, so that victims can be contacted quickly, have their needs assessed and, if needed, be offered a wider range of practical services than was previously available.</p>

The Poppy project supports adult women who have been trafficked into the UK for sexual exploitation and this includes provision for temporarily accommodating victims.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_581"><a name="81111w0018.htm_para15"><a name="08111181000515">The Office for Criminal Justice Reform (OCJR) has provided &#163;5.6 million since 2007 for independent domestic violence advisers (IDVAs) who provide a service to victims who are at high risk of harm. The money provides IDVAs to support victims as their cases progress through specialist domestic violence courts. The &#163;5.6 million follows &#163;2 million of Home Office funding in 2006-07.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_582"><a name="81111w0018.htm_para16"><a name="08111181000516">The recently published Youth Crime Action Plan will be improving support services to young victims of crime. The plan has been developed jointly between the OCJR, Ministry of Justice, the Department for Children Schools and Families and the Home Office. The action plan will deliver results on youth justice, youth crime prevention and cross cutting themes on victimisation.</p>

Should an individual withdraw their candidature, their actions would not affect anyone else who may then stand in their place. Each individual candidate can spend up to the spending limit&#151;that is to say the spending limit is personal to the individual and is not transferable between candidates.

 The models used to calculate the current prison population projections are described in Appendix C of the Ministry of Justice publication, &#147;Prison Population Projections 2008-2015&#148;, published on the Ministry of Justice website in September 2008. There are four elements to the modelling. In the short term (and the first two years) most segments of the population are modelled by a combination of stock-and-flow modelling and the use of the X12-ARIMA method developed by the USA Census Bureau. The X12-ARIMA method is available at:</p>

 Since the introduction of the new general practitioner (GP) contract in 2004, GP practices in the UK have been able to increase their income by increasing the range and quality of services they provide for their patients, for example by extending their surgery opening times. This is reflected in the average pay of a general practitioner partner.

 The numbers qualifying for Healthy Start fluctuate according to the numbers of pregnant women and young children in families getting the qualifying benefits and tax credits. We estimate that approximately 473,000 families qualified for support from the scheme when it was launched across the UK on 28 November 2006.

Those proposals affect all sectors of the pharmaceutical industry and include a general increase in fees for the traditional herbal sector of around 4 per cent. The consultation letter, including an impact assessment of the proposals, was published on 15 October 2008 and all sectors of the pharmaceutical industry have been alerted and invited to comment. The consultation exercise closes on 7 January 2009 and the MHRA would particularly welcome comments from smaller and medium sized companies.

 The Government are committed to reducing substance misuse related harm among young people, including harm arising from the misuse of drugs, alcohol and volatile substances.

All formalised treatment plans will have been reviewed and agreed with local areas by March 2009 and then published on the NTA&#146;s website in June 2009. In addition, all areas&#146; treatment systems for young people are reviewed by the NTA, along with the regional Government office and other partners, on a six monthly basis. The results of this review will be reported back to my Department in March 2009. This work is part of the NTA&#146;s core role as detailed in their business plan and is therefore funded by NTA.</p>

The intelligence activity is driven by national hubs of expertise together with target and selection teams, which link into operational teams, resulting in detection activity across the whole of the UK.

 Data on the scale and scope of higher education delivered by further education colleges are collected annually. There has always been considerable diversity between further education colleges as regards the delivery of higher education. The best offer a distinctive form of excellence when they offer high quality convenient access to higher education for potential students who might not otherwise participate in higher education. Some colleges already do this; some are capable of becoming excellent; but some may decide that their strengths lie outside the delivery of higher education. We want to foster a sustainable system in which institutions take informed decisions about what they should and should not attempt to deliver in the light of the challenges we have identified through the debate we have launched on the long-term future of higher education.</p>

 This Government are committed to maintaining the UK's world class university system and have already taken significant and recent steps to sustain the excellence of the UK research base and improve the exploitation of knowledge. The decline in public investment in science during the 1980s and early 1990s has been reversed. Since 1997, the ring-fenced science budget has more than doubled and by the end of the spending review period research funding from the Department for Innovation Universities and Skills will reach almost &#163;6 billion per annum. The Government have addressed the backlog of underinvestment in research infrastructure through a combination of capital funding and a move towards funding the full economic cost of research.</p>

1. This information is generated by the disability living allowance/attendance allowance computer system for management purposes. It is not a National Statistic. Management information records and counts events. This means that the number of claims refused is not directly comparable to the number of claims received because a decision to refuse or accept a claim is not necessarily made in the same time period.<br>
2. Figures are rounded to the nearest 10.<br>
3. Claims received: It is not possible for a claimant to make concurrent multiple claims. A customer can make more than one claim in a year. However, a new claim cannot be made until a decision on the previous claim has been made.<br>
4. All decisions will include decisions made on claims that were made in the previous year.<br>

 Entitlement to disability living allowance is not linked to particular disabling conditions, but is based on the extent to which a severely disabled person has personal care needs and/or walking difficulties as a result of their disability. People with a mental health problem are therefore able to claim the care component or mobility component of disability living allowance if they have such needs or difficulties.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_730"><a name="81111w0038.htm_para2"><a name="081111102001071">The mobility component to disability living allowance is paid at one of two rates. Entitlement to the higher rate mobility component is broadly based on whether someone has a physical disablement which makes them unable or virtually unable to walk or is deemed to be treated as satisfying those conditions of entitlement. Entitlement to the lower rate mobility component is broadly based on whether someone requires guidance or supervision from another person when out of doors on unfamiliar routes. People with mental health problems are among the groups of disabled people who are likely to benefit from the lower rate mobility component.</p>

The scheme provides a grant for specified heating and insulation measures of up to &#163;2,700, or up to &#163;4,000 where the work approved includes installation of an oil fired central heating system. The scheme works alongside a wide range of stakeholders, including local authorities, National Energy Action and other charities to ensure that those eligible for assistance receive the help they are entitled to.

A range of support can be provided including information about alternative jobs and how best to source them; matching employees to current vacancies; offering on-site job shops and fairs; helping people draw-up CVs and brush-up their jobsearch skills; providing information about in and out of work benefits/tax credits; and facilitating the process of taking jobseeker&#146;s allowance claims where this is needed.</p>

During the period 2002 to 2008, 5 million households received insulation measures through the EEC. Suppliers were required to focus 50 per cent. of their efforts on a priority group of vulnerable and low-income households, including pensioners on qualifying benefits. However, suppliers were not required to provide a precise break-down of the types of households within the priority group that receive assistance, or geographical information as to where measures were installed.</p>

<i> [holding answer 6 November 2008]:</i> Warm Front, which is the Government's main scheme for the eradication of fuel poverty, is always seeking to asses and incorporate new technologies which can improve the energy efficiency of vulnerable households. Those homes without cavity walls present a typical case of hard to treat properties, not least because the present alternative forms of insulation available are prohibitively expensive to deliver. My Department continues to work with stakeholders to ensure that all viable options are considered and incorporated into the scheme where appropriate.</p>
