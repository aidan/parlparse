To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs if the United Kingdom continues to impose an arms embargo on Afghanistan in line with the EU's Common Position of 17 December 1996.  [61609]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81126w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Fatchett: </B> 
 We remain committed to the EU arms embargo against Afghanistan which the UK interprets as covering all goods and technology entered on Part III to Schedule 1 to the Export of Goods Order 1994, as amended.
<P>

<a name="81126w01.html_para0">Following consultations with this Department and the Ministry of Defence, the Department of Trade and Industry recently approved two export licences: the first for the export of mine-clearance suits for use by the United Nations Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Assistance to Afghanistan in its demining operations and the second for the export of mine clearance equipment for use by the Halo Trust to aid their demining activities also in Afghanistan. The grant of these licences are for humanitarian purposes, and are consistent with the purpose of the embargo.

<P>
<P>
<a name="81126w01.html_wqn1"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what discussions he has had with the Radio Authority in relation to the limits on ownership of digital radio multiplexes under the Broadcasting Acts; and if he will make a statement.  [60854]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81126w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Chris Smith: </B> 
 I have received representations from the Radio Authority and Commercial Radio Companies Association that the present limits on participation in bodies corporate holding digital radio multiplex licences which are included in the Broadcasting Act 1990 (as amended by the Broadcasting Act 1996) may hamper the development of digital radio. Although the overall regulatory framework for digital radio remains appropriate to the Government's policy aims and to the shape of the emerging digital radio sector, I believe that there is a case for some relaxation of the restrictions on the ownership of bodies corporate holding multiplex licences to encourage investment in this area.
<P>

<a name="81126w01.html_para1">Following discussions between the Authority and my officials I am today issuing a consultation paper seeking views on proposals to use my order-making power in paragraph 11(5) of part III of Schedule 2 to the Broadcasting Act 1990 (as amended) to amend the present 



<P>
<P><I>26 Nov 1998 : Column: 12</I><P>
limits in the Broadcasting Act. My proposals would allow the formation of a greater number of partnerships between radio companies for the purpose of applying for multiplex licences. However, my proposals are also designed to protect plurality of ownership and diversity of content by allowing smaller radio groups and stations the opportunity to make meaningful investments in a range of applications for local multiplex licences.
<P>

<a name="81126w01.html_para2">I am placing copies of the consultation paper in the Libraries of both Houses.

<a name="81126w01.html_sbhd2"><H4><center>Water Industry</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="81126w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. David Stewart: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland what measures he has taken to implement the conclusions of the Government's Review of the Scottish water industry; and if he will make a statement.  [61682]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81126w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Dewar: </B> 
 The Scottish Water Industry Review proposed a range of measures to modernise the Scottish water industry. A central measure was the proposal to create a new position of a professional regulator responsible for all aspects of economic regulation of the Scottish water industry and for promoting the customer interest. There was consensus in all parts of the industry, including the Customers Council, that this would be a major improvement on the present arrangements. To safeguard the operational independence of the regulator, I proposed in my statement to the House of 16 December 1997, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 145-58, that we should establish the position in statute.
<P>

<a name="81126w01.html_para3">The Water Industry Bill, which was published today, contains provisions to discharge this commitment. It will wind up the current Customers Council and establish a new Water Industry Commissioner for Scotland to promote the interests of the water authorities' customers. The Commissioner will assume most of the existing duties of the Customers Council and will have the new function of advising the Scottish Executive about setting water and sewerage charges over periods of several years. The Bill also establishes new Water Industry Consultative Committees for each water authority to advise the Commissioner on the promotion of customer interests in their respective areas.
<P>

<a name="81126w01.html_para4">These new arrangements will allow objective, professional regulation of water charges. Requiring the Commissioner to consider charges over a number of years, will ensure more long-term stability than at present. This will allow the water authorities to plan for the future with greater certainty, helping them deliver better services to their customers as efficiently as possible.
<P>

<a name="81126w01.html_para5">The Bill requires the Commissioner to publish the advice put to the Executive on charges and also any modifications the Executive might make to that advice subsequently. These arrangements will safeguard the operational independence of the Commissioner, and will make the operation of the new system transparent to the general public. The Commissioner will be accountable to the Executive and, through it, to the Parliament. I believe these arrangements will give customers the best possible deal on prices and quality of service.

<P>

<a name="81126w01.html_para6">The water industry review also stressed the need to tackle the chronic under-investment in the industry. I can report that by the end of the current financial year the water authorities will have invested over &#163;800 million since 1996 in new and upgraded infrastructure, with a further &#163;1,500 million of investment planned over the following 3 years. This scale of investment represents a massive transformation and modernisation of the industry and brings to an end decades of neglect.
<P>

<a name="81126w01.html_para7">The Review stressed the importance of a stable financial framework for the industry, and it should be helpful that the recent allocation of EFLs has been made on a three-year basis.
<P>

<a name="81126w01.html_para8">The Review also recommended that the water authorities should become more responsive at a local level. To promote this our new appointments to the Water Authority Boards brought the number of local authority representatives up to roughly half of the total. I also issued a direction to the water authorities on 14 August this year requiring them to consult local authorities and other local representative bodies regularly. Copies of this direction were placed in the Library. The evidence so far suggests that these new arrangements are working well.
<P>

<a name="81126w01.html_para9">In sum, to implement our review we are modernising and improving standards in water and sewerage on a scale unprecedented since Victorian times. We are investing massive sums in improving the quality of drinking water and cleaning up our beaches, as can be seen by the new investment being put in place through the length and breadth of Scotland. And we are ensuring that our authorities are open, democratically accountable, responsive to local concerns and professionally regulated.

<a name="81126w01.html_sbhd5"><H4><center>Floodlighting</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="81126w01.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Walter: </B> 
To ask the Chairman of the Accommodation and Works Committee what change has been made to the floodlighting of the river frontage of the Palace of Westminster.  [60991]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81126w01.html_spnew5"><B> Sir Sydney Chapman: </B> 
 A new floodlighting scheme for the riverside elevation of the Palace was switched on for the first time on 18 November. My Committee agreed that it should be implemented as part of this year's programme of works because the previous floodlighting arrangements on the terrace were so unsatisfactory. They had consisted of temporary lights which were placed on the terrace only during the summer recesses. At other times of the year this elevation of the building was not illuminated because the floodlighting caused nuisance by spilling light into the rooms on the river front. The night time view of the unlit Palace from the riverside was most disappointing, in contrast to other well-lit buildings along the river.
<P>

<a name="81126w01.html_para10">The new scheme has been designed so that the floodlights are close to the base of the wall. By casting light upwards at a shallow angle the nuisance from light spilling into rooms is greatly reduced and the effect is to highlight the modelling of the stonework. The lamps themselves are highly energy efficient, so the electricity cost of the new scheme is some 30 per cent. less than before.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland how many motorists in Northern Ireland have <i>(a)</i> been given a fixed penalty notice and <i>(b)</i> been prosecuted for the unlawful use of fog lights in each of the last five years.  [60990]<P>

<P>
<a name="81126w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The computerised records system does not permit a breakdown by particular offence. To provide the information requested would require a manual check of all records over each of the years in question and would incur a disproportionate cost.

<a name="81126w02.html_wqn1"><B> Mrs. Ellman: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many trainees are currently held at Medway Secure Training Centre; and if he will make a statement.  [61711]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81126w02.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 As of today, there are 36 trainees at Medway Secure Training Centre. This is fewer than the maximum of 40 trainees who may be held there because I have asked Rebound ECD, the contractors for Medway Secure Training Centre, to put in place a programme of work, including refurbishment, to address difficulties that have been experienced at the centre so as to ensure the high standard of care, control, education and training required by the contract. While this programme of work 



<P>
<P><I>26 Nov 1998 : Column: 15</I><P>
is being taken forward, the number of trainees held at Medway will be reduced on a temporary basis to 25 to help facilitate this work. Other trainees will be placed in local authority secure accommodation. The Government are committed to ensuring that secure provision for those young people whose offending is so serious or persistent as to require a period in a secure environment is of good quality, positive and constructive in tackling offending behaviour. We are working closely with Rebound ECD to achieve that. We are monitoring the situation at Medway closely and will continue to do so.

<a name="81126w02.html_para1">I welcome the Committee's report and the agenda of work it has identified for itself during the review. I particularly endorse the Committee's conclusion that it should be more open and pro-active, and that its independent role needs to be emphasised.
