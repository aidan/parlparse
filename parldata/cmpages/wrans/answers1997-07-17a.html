<a name="70717w01.html_sbhd0"><H4><center>Pensions Review</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="70717w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Davidson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security if she will make a statement about the review of pensions which her Department is to undertake. [9606]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70717w01.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Harman: </B> 
 Our Election Manifesto promised a review of the central areas of insecurity for elderly people in this country. I have today launched a wide-ranging review of pensions.
<P>

<a name="70717w01.html_para0">We have inherited a major pensions challenge. The failure over the last two decades to develop an adequate pensions strategy has resulted in widening inequalities amongst pensioners. Too many of our older citizens do not enjoy security in retirement.
<P>

<a name="70717w01.html_para1">Only by achieving a sustainable consensus for change can the country meet the pensions challenge. We want everyone who can make a positive contribution to this review to do so.
<P>

<a name="70717w01.html_para2">Our starting-point must be the health and success of the wider economy. We must give everyone a real opportunity to be able to participate in it. By establishing the conditions for stable, sustainable growth, we will build a stronger economy and provide the essential foundations for decent and secure pensions. By opening up fresh opportunities to come off welfare and into work, we will ensure that more people have the opportunity to contribute to their own pensions.
<P>

<a name="70717w01.html_para3">The review will address nine fundamental challenges:

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>To achieve a sustainable consensus on pensions policy. We need to reach a broad-based agreement, which will allow people to plan for their long-term future and avoid the constant changes in pensions policy we have seen in the last 20 years.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>To agree where the responsibility for funding pensions should lie and to establish the right balance between the public and private sectors.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>To respond to demographic change. Talk of a demographic "time-bomb" is exaggerated, but there are real issues to address as the ratio of working age people to pensioners falls in the first half of the next century.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>To respond to social and labour market change. The last 50 years have seen far-reaching changes in the way we live and work. The pension system needs to reflect this. It must be capable of responding to future change. We need to ensure it provides everyone--men and women, the self-employed, full and part-time workers, those in permanent jobs and those on short-term contracts--with the chance to build up better pensions in their own right.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>To ensure resources devoted to pensions are used to maximum effect. We need to make sure that every penny available for pensions is used as efficiently and effecively as possible, whether it comes directly from individuals and employers, or indirectly from them through the tax system.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>



<P>
</UL></FONT><P><I>17 Jul 1997 : Column: 240</I><P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>To get the regulation of pensions right. The personal pensions mis-selling scandal illustrates too clearly what can go wrong when pensions are not properly regulated. People need to have confidence in pensions and be sure their pensions are secure. We need to find a balance with provides an appropriate level of security, eliminates the scope of abuse and does not impose an undue burden on providers.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>To raise awareness of pensions and improve the level of financial education so that people understand the importance of saving for retirement and make the right choice about which pension product is best for them.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>To narrow the pensions gap between men and women so as to give women more security in retirement. Many pensions are simply not flexible enough to cope with women's working patterns. Women still earn less on average than men and are more likely to have caring responsibilities.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>To strike the right balance between the generations. We face the challenge of providing for the future, but we must also look at the position of today's pensioners. The views and concerns of current pensioners will be at the heart of the review process. We will ensure that current pension costs are manageable and that excessive costs are not placed on future generations.</FONT></UL>
<P>

<a name="70717w01.html_para4">This is a formidable challenge and the Government has a key role in bringing change about. But it cannot tackle the issues on its own. We want to receive advice and hear new ideas from everyone with an interest in pensions.
<P>

<a name="70717w01.html_para5">We shall retain the basic state pension as the foundation of pension provision, and SERPS for those who wish to remain in it.
<P>

<a name="70717w01.html_para6">We will also build on the good quality second pensions that many employees enjoy by supporting and strengthening the existing framework of occupational pension provision where that is necessary. And we wish to consider with the pensions industry how an Investors in Pensions award could be established to set a benchmark against which employers, employees and trustees can measure the quality of their own scheme.
<P>

<a name="70717w01.html_para7">We recognise that, for many people, security in retirement can best be achieved by building up their own funded second pension. We shall therefore consult widely on how best to take forward our proposals for new Stakeholder Pensions. These will offer secure, flexible and value for money second pensions for those who cannot join an employer's occupational scheme, whose pay is low or intermittent, and for whom personal pensions are usually unsuitable.
<P>

<a name="70717w01.html_para8">The review will take forward consultation on the development of Citizenship Pensions for carers who are unable to contribute to pensions in their own right. As a result, carers can lose out on the pension entitlements they would otherwise acquire, and end up on means-tested benefits.
<P>

<a name="70717w01.html_para9">Both these proposals, which we plan to legislate for and implement in this Parliament, will be particularly good news for women.
<P>

<a name="70717w01.html_para10">As part of our consultative approach, I have invited Tom Ross, of Alexander Clay and vice-president of the National Association of Pension Funds, to chair a group of pensions experts to report to me on the current state of pension provision in the United Kingdom and on likely future trends. Their work will inform the development of our plans for a modern, responsive pensions system for the future.




<P>
<P><I>17 Jul 1997 : Column: 241</I><P>

<P>

<a name="70717w01.html_para11">Modernising the social security system is a key priority of the Government. Our long-term objective is to ensure that everyone has the opportunity to build up an adequate pension to guarantee security in retirement. We aim to build a society in which there is a wide consensus on the future for pensions, both now and tomorrow, and provide dignity in retirement for the whole nation.

<a name="70717w01.html_sbhd1"><H4><center>Chief Adjudication Officer</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="70717w01.html_wqn1"><B> Ms Stuart: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security when she will publish the thirteenth annual report of the Chief Adjudication Officer; and if she will make a statement. [9607]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70717w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Keith Bradley: </B> 
 The report published today records some welcome improvement in the Benefits Agency and the Employment Service in standards of decision making. Whilst overall the improved performance of last year has been maintained, the report makes clear that there is still much to be done.
<P>

<a name="70717w01.html_para12">The Social Security Bill introduced on 10 July is a key step towards building a modern welfare state using new technology to develop improved benefit processes. The Bill makes provision for the simplification of decision making and appeals.
<P>

<a name="70717w01.html_para13">The report describes favourably the numerous initiatives that the Agencies have introduced to tackle weaknesses and improve their overall performance. But the decision making and appeals framework at present works against the decision makers. Despite the valuable help the Agencies get from the Chief Adjudication Officer and his staff, the system is too cumbersome, over-legalistic and prevents the use of modern technology.
<P>

<a name="70717w01.html_para14">The Social Security Bill will create a framework which enables the Agencies to make decisions in a more straightforward way. The decisions made will be more accurate and easier for both the decision makers and customers to understand.

<a name="70717w01.html_sbhd2"><H4><center>Social Fund</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="70717w01.html_wqn2"><B> Ms Stuart: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security when she intends to publish her annual report on the Social Fund for 1996-97 and the annual report of the Social Fund Commissioner. [9608]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70717w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Keith Bradley: </B> 
 The Secretary of State's annual report on the Social Fund for 1996-97 (CM 3667) was published today and has been laid before Parliament. The report records that the gross budget allocated to the discretionary part of the Fund during the year was &#163;440.5 million.
<P>

<a name="70717w01.html_para15">Total gross expenditure in 1996-97 was &#163;539 million. This included almost 2 million non-repayable grants and interest free loans worth &#163;432 million and Funeral, Maternity and Cold Weather Payments worth &#163;107 million.
<P>

<a name="70717w01.html_para16">The Secretary of State makes clear in the Report our commitment to modernising and improving welfare delivery. The current Social Security Bill will enable the decision-making process for budgeting loans to be made easier for applicants to understand, less time consuming for staff to operate and more cost effective to administer.

<a name="70717w01.html_sbhd3"><H4><center>Windfall Tax</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="70717w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Garnier: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security if she will ensure that social security entitlements are increased to match any increases in consumer charges due to the windfall tax. [2976]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70717w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Field: </B> 
 Any increase in consumer charges will be a matter for the regulators. Representations from individual companies would have to be considered on their own merits, but we can see no reason for any price increases as a result of the windfall tax. Benefit amounts will be reviewed at the normal time in the normal way taking account of movements in the Retail Prices Index and Rossi indices.

<P>
<a name="70717w02.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Dawson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security if she will review the compensation available for people disabled by immunisation. [7238]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70717w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Denham: </B>

<P>
<a name="70717w02.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Wicks: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security if she will give a breakdown of the current numbers of people claiming and in receipt of income support by <i>(a)</i> duration, <i>(b)</i> client group and <i>(c)</i> local authority area. [8514]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70717w02.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Bradley: </B> 
 The information has been placed in the Library.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70717w02.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. McWalter: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security if she will make it her policy to abolish the Child Support Agency. [9020]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70717w02.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Bradley: </B> 
 Children are entitled to the support of both parents wherever they live. The receipt of regular maintenance is a key part of our programme for helping lone parents into work and we are determined to ensure that all absent parents honour their responsibilities to their children. We intend to look closely at all aspects of the Child Support Agency to ensure that it provides an efficient and effective service. Our key objectives for the Agency during the coming year are to sort out cases faster, tackle the backlog of cases and pursue fathers who avoid paying.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70717w02.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Rooney: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security if she will <i>(a)</i> list and <i>(b)</i> make a statement on recent amendments to the rules for Parkinson's disease sufferers' entitlement to disability living allowances.[9110]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70717w02.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 Entitlement to Disability Living Allowance is based not on specific disabilities, but on the effects that a person's disability has on their need for help with personal care and/or mobility needs. There are no particular rules relating to the claims from people with Parkinson's Disease.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70717w02.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Collins: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what legislative changes affecting the tax status of self-employed building contractors <i>(a)</i> have been made since 1994 and <i>(b)</i> are planned for the future; when such changes will take effect; what penalties are provided for non-compliance; and if he will make a statement. [7458]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70717w02.html_spnew4"><B> Dawn Primarolo </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 11 July 1997]:</i> Legislation contained in the 1995 Finance Act introduces new rules governing entitlement to subcontractors' tax certificates. Further legislation in the 1996 Finance Act provides for the introduction of registration cards for those subcontractors who will not qualify for certificates under the new rules. The Inland Revenue are continuing to discuss with industry representatives the legislation which will contain more detailed arrangements for the scheme. An announcement will be made shortly about the implementation of these changes. Penalties of up to &#163;3,000 will be chargeable for certain offences under the scheme.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70717w02.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Fabricant: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what assessment he has made of the effect of the changes in tax credit provisions in the Budget on the maturation of with-profits endowment mortgages; and if he will make a statement. [7896]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70717w02.html_spnew5"><B> Dawn Primarolo </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 15 July 1997]:</i> The changes to the tax credit provisions should have very little, if any, effect on the maturity benefits from ordinary life assurance policies, including those used to back mortgages. Tax credits are not generally paid to insurance companies in respect of the investments supporting this type of business.

<a name="70717w02.html_sbhd6"><H4><center>Pocket Budget</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="70717w02.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Heathcoat-Amory: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what was the cost of preparing, printing and distributing the pocket Budget edition of the Budget proposals. [8927]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70717w02.html_spnew6"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 The Treasury has for some years printed and distributed a "popular" short-form version of the Budget. The final cost for this year will depend on the demand for copies but is expected to be around &#163;50,000.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70717w02.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Gordon Brown: </B> 
 Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) will have profound implications for British businesses and the British economy whether Britain is in or out. Britain's national interest demands a better informed and more reasoned debate than we have had in the past.




<P>
<P><I>17 Jul 1997 : Column: 245</I><P>

<P>

<a name="70717w02.html_para1">I have therefore announced the publication of a report on the pros and cons of EMU. Copies are available in the Vote Office. The report was first published by David Currie earlier this year for the Economist Intelligence Unit. The Government has republished it today, in a shorter and more accessible form.
<P>

<a name="70717w02.html_para2">I have also announced that the Treasury will publish on 24 July a practical guide for businesses on EMU. Copies of the guide will also be available from the Vote Office. The aim of this is to give businesses the information they need to make the preparations that are necessary whether or not we join EMU.
<P>

<a name="70717w02.html_para3">I announced today that I shall be establishing an advisory group with senior representatives from across the private sector, to discuss matters of common concern about the practical implications for business of EMU.
<P>

<a name="70717w02.html_para4">The Government's policy towards EMU has not changed. Those countries that choose to take part in EMU must do so on the basis of sustainable convergence as set out in the Maastricht Treaty. Any decision about Britain joining the single currency will be determined by a hard headed assessment of Britain's economic interests.
<P>

<a name="70717w02.html_para5">While nothing has been ruled out, there are still formidable obstacles to the UK joining the single currency in the first wave.

 As my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister explained in response to the hon.

As it is not practicable to distinguish particular groups as lobbyists, we cannot keep a register of such meetings.

<P>
<a name="70717w04.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 I have today published for consultation draft regulations which would implement the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive (85/377 EC) as it applies to offshore oil and gas activities on the United Kingdom Continental Shelf.
<P>

<a name="70717w04.html_para0">Implementing the Directive for oil and gas projects will give the public improved rights of access to environmental information about projects likely to have significant effects on the environment and make the decision process more open than it is now. This should give people greater confidence that consent decisions are being made on the basis of proper science and thorough evaluation.
<P>

<a name="70717w04.html_para1">Member States are required by the Directive to consider environmental information which the interested public has had an opportunity to see and comment on before consent can be given to projects which could have a significant effect on the environment.
<P>

<a name="70717w04.html_para2">The draft Regulations would implement the Directive as it applies to consents for significant offshore oil and gas projects, including deep drillings, production developments and pipeline construction. They set out how the Secretary of State should decide which projects are likely to have significant effects on the environment and so require environmental assessments; the initial data companies must provide to permit that decision to be made; and, if one is required, the detailed information needed in any environmental statement.
<P>

<a name="70717w04.html_para3">They also require applicants to place notices to inform the public that an environmental statement has been required for a particular project and that copies of the statement can be obtained from or inspected at public addresses so that the public's views may be taken into account in reaching any decision on consent.
<P>

<a name="70717w04.html_para4">The proposed regulations would replace the Department's present procedures under which assessments have been required for developments within 25 miles of the coast or in other sensitive areas where recommended by the Government's statutory environmental advisers such as the Joint Nature Conservation Committee. These advisors will continue to be consulted under the new procedure.
<P>

<a name="70717w04.html_para5">The draft regulations have been sent to other Government departments and to the organisations normally consulted on oil and gas licensing, including the Wildlife and Countryside Links' Oil and Gas Environmental Consortium--which represents Friends of the Earth, the Marine Conservation Society and other national and regional environmental interest groups--and

 Ministers and officials are in regular contact with business people representing all sectors and sizes of firms from across the country. In addition to consulting business and other interested parties from time to time on specific policy proposals, my right hon. Friend the President of the Board of Trade has initiated a more formal process of consultation with business on policies and priorities to improve competitiveness.
<P>

<a name="70717w05.html_para0">This initiative--Competitiveness UK--will include establishing an Advisory Group of prominent business people to advise the President on all aspects of competitiveness; holding a Business Summit on 23 July to establish common ground on a range of areas for further discussion; and creating a number of Working Parties drawn mainly from business to advise on specific aspects of competitiveness. This will help inform the development of policies for a White Paper on Competitiveness to be published next year.

<a name="70717w06.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 The European Court of Human Rights recognises that states have a margin of appreciation in deciding, through a democratic process, how best to legislate in controversial areas. The Government welcome the Court's recognition of the importance of this doctrine in enabling countries to have distinctive, appropriate and fair controls that reflect genuine national differences. Social and moral questions, on which there can be widely differing opinions, will often fall within the margin of appreciation. In taking the view that the age of homosexual consent is a matter on which Parliament should decide what is appropriate for the United Kingdom, on the basis of a free vote, the Government again emphasise the importance of the margin of appreciation in such issues.

 The investigation of crime is primarily a matter for the police force in whose area the offence occurred. All chief officers may call for, and be asked to provide, assistance in such investigations, whether the offence was committed in this country or elsewhere. The Metropolitan police exceptionally takes the lead in providing assistance in respect of hostage situations involving British citizens abroad.

To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland if he will make an assessment of the additional amounts that local authorities in Scotland will have to pay into their pension funds as a result of the proposed changes to advance corporation tax; and from where these moneys will be provided. [7342]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70717w07.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Chisholm </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 8 July 1997]:</i> The funding of local authority pension funds is a matter for local authorities. Although the loss of tax credits will have some impact on the income of local authority pension funds, the extent to which these changes feed through to authorities' budgets will depend on the overall judgements made by the funds' actuaries as they undertake subsequent revaluations to the funds. In addition, pension funds should benefit from improved company performance as a result of the reduction in Corporation Tax and other measures in the Budget to encourage quality long term investment.

To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland on what occasions <i>(a)</i> Ministers and <i>(b)</i> officials have refused to (i) arrange and (ii) attend meetings with hon.

<P>
<a name="70717w08.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Dewar: </B> 
 It would not be practicable for Ministers and officials, among their other duties, to check requests for meetings against the Register of Members' Interests. The First Report of the Nolan Committee made it clear that, when hon. Members are meeting Ministers on matters in which they have an interest, the onus is on the Member to declare that interest and not on the Minister to know of it (Cm 2850 paragraph 2.63).

 Market prices for cereals have fallen significantly over the past twelve months but it is difficult to say how much of this is due to green pound revaluations and how much to other factors.

 The House of Lords Select Committee on Science and Technology recommended that consideration should be given to the establishment under the Common Fisheries Policy of a system requiring fishermen to report to the authorities if there is a high proportion of juvenile fish in their catch. Following receipt of such a report the area should be surveyed by the appropriate national authority and, providing that the report is verified, the area should be closed until the juvenile fish have dispersed.
<P>

<a name="70717w09.html_para2">Following the Committee's report, the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (CEFAS) undertook a review of the feasibility of operating temporary closures of areas with large numbers 



<P>
<P><I>17 Jul 1997 : Column: 273</I><P>
of juvenile fish. They concluded that, where the nursery areas are large, permanent and contain high concentrations of juveniles that are discarded, then it is to the benefit of the fishery to close such areas on a permanent or temporary basis. This applies primarily to flatfish nursery grounds, for which there is already a closed area known as the Plaice Box, and the Government is seeking to improve the effectiveness of the Plaice Box in current negotiations on a European Commission proposal for new technical conservation measures.
<P>

<a name="70717w09.html_para3">For the large stocks of roundfish, the juveniles are much more dispersed and their distribution is more dynamic. For these stocks CEFAS concluded that temporary closure of areas in the way proposed by the Committee does not appear to be a practical proposition, and monitoring and enforcement would be costly. However, there are a number of fixed areas which are closed to different types of fishing to protect young roundfish and pelagic fish. The Norway Pout Box, off eastern Scotland, protects young haddock and other gadoids from small mesh industrial fisheries. The Mackerel Box off south Cornwall protects juvenile mackerel. Many herring spawning grounds are protected as the vulnerable spawn are densely laid on the gravel seabed. The UK has also introduced restrictions on fishing in the estuarine nursery areas of bass.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70717w10.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Information on the level of rat and mice infestation is being collected as part of the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions' 1996 English House Condition Survey. The results of the survey are expected to be published towards the end of this year.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70717w10.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The recommendations of the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health were made following publication of the 1993 National Rodent Survey and they were fully considered at the time. The position will be reviewed after the results of the 1996 English House Condition Survey on rodent infestation are known later this year.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what requirements are placed upon local authorities to <i>(a)</i> record and <i>(b)</i> respond to incidents of rat infestation. [8442]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70717w10.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Under the Prevention of Damage by Pests Act 1949, local authorities are required to keep their districts as free as practicable from rats and mice and to carry out such inspections as may be necessary for this purpose. The Act requires occupiers of land, other than agricultural land, to give notice in writing to the local authority of rodent infestations.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70717w10.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Although the results of the 1993 National Rodent Survey showed that there had been a small increase since the late 1970s in the level of rat infestation in properties used for domestic purposes, overall, the survey did not provide sufficient evidence to warrant a change in current rodent control policies. The situation will be reviewed in the light of the 1996 survey, the results of which are expected to be published towards the end of this year.

<a name="70717w10.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 In 1993, 4.8 per cent. of properties were infested with rats. This information is not available at the level of local authority due to the small sample size. Figures are not available for other years.

 Rodent numbers can be affected by a number of factors including climate, food availability, level and effectiveness of control, availability of breeding sites and levels of predators. The 1996 English House Condition Survey, the results of which will be available later this year, will provide more detailed information about levels of rodent infestation.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what assessment he has made of the study from Oxford University on horizontal transmission of BSE, with particular regard to its relationship to stocking density; and if he will make a statement. [8695]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70717w10.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 Professor Anderson, who heads the team at Oxford University, was a member of the epidemiology sub group of the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee (SEAC) which advised Government on maternal transmission. That advice was made public through a MAFF press notice issued on 18 April 1997, copies of which are available in the Library of the House.
<P>

<a name="70717w10.html_para1">I understand that Professor Anderson's team are shortly to publish further papers. Professor Anderson has recently been reported as saying that the higher incidents of BSE in larger herds, as compared with smaller herds, could be due to one of two factors, either:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(i) greater use of concentrated cattle feed in larger herds; or
<P>
<BR>
(ii) horizontal transmission from cow to cow as opposed to maternal transmission which is from a cow to its own calf.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="70717w10.html_para2">Professor Anderson went on to say that he was not able, on the basis of the information available to him, to distinguish between these two hypotheses.
<P>

<a name="70717w10.html_para3">The variation in risk according to herd size is one of a number of observations first published by scientists from the Central Veterinary Laboratory, Weybridge in the Veterinary Record in 1992. I am putting a copy of that paper in the Library of the House. The view of my own advisers is that the more likely explanation for the higher incidents in the larger herds is more intensive use of animal feed in such herds as this ties in with certain other epidemiological observations, including the fact that a number of large herds which had a high incidence of BSE have, as a result of changing feed patterns, eradicated BSE within those herds which had been free for some years. This explanation argues in favour of the feed rather than the horizontal transmission hypothesis.

 <i>(a)</i> It is not possible to give a simple estimate of the number of broiler chickens which suffer from leg disorders.

 There are already arrangements for disposing of fallen stock and the destruction of animal casualties other than via hunt kennels. Disposal can be by rendering at an approved rendering plant, incineration or burial, in accordance with the provisions of the Animal By-Products Order 1992 (as amended). This Order also provides for certain premises to receive fallen stock, including knackers' yards: knackermen will usually be licensed slaughtermen for the purpose of killing animal casualties.

 My Department is this year collecting, for the first time, statistics on the number of planning applications which were decided by planning officers under delegated powers by each local authority. This information should allow an assessment, over time, of the relationship between the numbers of applications decided by local authorities, their performance and their use of delegated powers. The first figures will be collated at the end of September. I will ensure the figures are forwarded to my honourable Friend as soon as possible after they have been compiled and checked.

 UK emissions of greenhouse gases from agriculture are evaluated using research sponsored by my Department and by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.
<P>

<a name="70717w12.html_para1">We estimate that, in 1995, UK agricultural production was responsible for about 1 per cent, 30 per cent. and 10 per cent. of UK emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide respectively. Agricultural land use change resulted in the release of a further 4 per cent. of total emissions of carbon dioxide. Together these emissions were equivalent to about 7 per cent. of the

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what responsibilities have been placed upon the water companies to control rat infestation of the sewerage system. [8451]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70717w12.html_spnew4"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 There is no specific duty on water and sewerage companies in relation to the control of rats in sewers. However, all sewerage undertakers have programmes to control and reduce the number of rats in their systems. This includes the use of baits in pumping stations and air vents to stop rats entering the system, or on ledges within sewers. In addition, I understand that the water industry will be undertaking some research into the issue of rats in sewers early next year.
<P>

<a name="70717w12.html_para3">Local authorities have a long standing duty to keep themselves informed about the sufficiency of drainage systems in their area to ensure that they do not pose a threat to public health. Failure to control rat infestations on property could be enforceable by the Local Authority Environmental Health Officer under Part III of the Environmental Protection Act 1990, if it is judged to be a statutory nuisance.
<P>

<a name="70717w12.html_spnew6"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 The most recent statistics on hedgerow planting and removal come from a survey of hedgerow changes in England and Wales between the years 1990 to 1993, undertaken by the Institute of Terrestrial Ecology on behalf of the Department of the Environment. That survey estimated that on average some 4,400 km of hedgerows were newly planted each year, whilst an average of 3,600 km of hedgerows were removed each year.
<P>

<a name="70717w12.html_para5">Estimates for future years have not been made. New planting is encouraged, in England, through the Countryside Stewardship and Environmentally Sensitive Areas Schemes administered by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and, in Wales, through Tir Cymen and the Hedgerow Renovation Scheme operated by the Countryside Council for Wales. Important hedgerows are protected from removal under the Hedgerows Regulations 1997.

 The import of furs into the United Kingdom is controlled under European Council Regulation 338/97 which implements the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) within the European Union as a whole. A permit is required from the Department of the Environment to import the fur of any species listed in the CITES Appendices. Trade in furs from endangered species, such as leopards and tigers, is strictly prohibited. Trade in other less sensitive species is strictly controlled and monitored to ensure that they are not over-exploited. My Department is also responsible for the EU ban on the import of furs from harp and hooded seal pups under the EC Seals Directive 83/129. The Directive is implemented in the UK through the Import of Seal Skins Regulations 1996.

 The policy on the construction of the A46-47 link road is the same as that for all road schemes presented to the Secretary of State. The overall merits are assessed in the context of the public interest.

<a name="70717w13.html_para2">The A46-47 forms part of the accepted package of transport proposals which constitute the Central Leicestershire Package. Advice on the appraisal of projects and on the preparation of package bids is issued to authorities each year. This covers, inter alia, environmental issues and economic benefit.

To ask the secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will list the red-route proposals under consideration by his Department for the London Borough of Wandsworth.[9098]<P>

<a name="70717w13.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The roads in Wandsworth designated as red routs are the A3, A24, A205, A214, A217, A306, A3205 and A3220. We are currently consulting on whether the A214 should remain in the red route network. The implementation programme for other red routes in Wandsworth is set out in the Traffic Director for London's Annual Report and Accounts for 1996-97, a copy of which is in the Library.

 The Government has no powers to prevent train operators changing the conditions applying to the Network Card. Train operators' participation in the Network Card scheme is entirely voluntary and there is no formal obligation on them to offer the Network Card.

<P>
<a name="70717w13.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Milburn: </B> 
 The information requested is not collected systematically. However, a recent survey carried out for management purposes identified the hospitals listed as having recently been, or are currently, the subject of consultation which could lead to the full closure. Closure is normally dependent on the reprovision of services elsewhere and/or are conditional on a successful Private Finance Initiative contract.

 As my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister explained in response to my hon. Friend the Member for Newport, West (Mr. Flynn) on 2 June 1997 at column <i>99</i>, Ministers and officials in the Department receive deputations from many groups who are concerned to press their own interests or those of their clients, which Ministers and officials take due care to consider within the wider public interest and Government policy. As it is not practicable to distinguish particular groups as lobbyists, the Department cannot keep a register of such meetings.

 Statutory responsibility for the control of rat infestations rests with local authorities.

Officials from the Department of Health, in discussion with officials from other government departments, will continue to monitor trends in infestation and the adequacy of current control measures.

 All general practitioners practising as principals have had to undergo vocational training. During this period of vocational training the general practitioner will be exposed to the variety of patients who present in Primary Care. As most people with learning difficulties are living at home, they will be included in this training. EL(96)109 stated that the Government intends to take steps to improve the vocational training scheme for GPs to allow those starting constructed schemes after 1997 to spend a greater proportion of training time in general practice from April 1998. This will result in greater exposure to such patients.

To date nine studies have been commissioned and the results of this research will become available over the next three years. A further &#163;0.5 million has been allocated this year to expand this research programme. Once we have a clearer picture, we will be able to plan accordingly and make sure that the National Health Service is equipped to deliver the services required based on the best scientific evidence available about the disease.

<a name="70717w15.html_para4">The Task Force to Review the Effectiveness of Services for Drug Misusers, whose report was published in May 1996, found that treatment and care services were effective in reducing the level of criminal activity amongst the drug misusing population. Guidance to health and local authorities issued in March this year asked them to prioritise the needs of drug misusers who are involved in, or at risk of, criminal activity when commissioning services.

 Out of 14,512 dentists who received payment under the General Dental Services for at least one filling in the quarter April to June 1997, we estimate that 13,600 received a payment for at least one amalgam filling. Evaluation of relevant, scientific research by authoritative national and international expert committees has indicated no risk of systemic toxicity and only a few cases of hypersensitivity. The Department continues to monitor and evaluate research in this area.

 Under plans originally announced by the previous Administration last December, central government support for schools capital investment in 1997-98 has been set at &#163;396 million for local authority county and controlled schools, &#163;145 million for grant-maintained schools, and &#163;104.2 million for voluntary aided schools.

<P>

<a name="70717w16.html_para1">Taking account of estimated local authority capital receipts and revenue and governors' contributions to voluntary aided schools, we would expect some &#163;672 million to be devoted to projects at county and voluntary controlled schools, &#163;145 million in grant-maintained schools and &#163;117 million in voluntary aided schools in 1997-98, and on the same basis some &#163;656 million in county and voluntary controlled schools, &#163;141 million in grant-maintained schools and &#163;115 million for voluntary aided schools in 1998-99.
<P>

 The First Report from the Committee on Standards in Public Life (Cm 2850) recognised the value of enabling Members to retain interests outside the House, provided these were properly declared, both in the Register of Members' Interests and on other occasions. Subject to these requirements, and to the rules of the House relating to delegations to Ministers, Members are free to seek meetings with Ministers and officials, who will consider such requests alongside the many other approaches from individuals and organisations concerned to press their own interests or those of others.

 The First Report from the Committee on Standards in Public Life (Cm 2850) made it clear, that, when Members are meeting Ministers or others on topics in which they have an interest, the onus is on the Member to declare that interest not the Minister to know (paragraph 63 of Cm 2850). It is not practicable for Ministers and officials, amongst their other duties, to vet requests for meetings against the Register of Members' Interests. Should evidence of non-declaration emerge, or contravention of the Resolution of the House relating to delegations to Ministers, the matter would be brought to the attention of the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards.

in <i>(a)</i> England and <i>(b)</i> each English LEA for (i) 1997-98, (ii) 1998-99 and (iii) 1999-00 assuming that all of the additional funding allocated to education in the Budget is spent on education. [8584] <P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70717w17.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Byers </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 15 July 1997]:</i> For 1997-98, net Education Standard Spending (ESS) for England equates to &#163;2,382 per pupil. In 1998-99, at constant prices, this will rise to &#163;2,499. Allocations for each LEA in the form of Standard Spending Assessments for 1988-89 will be made in the Autumn. Figures for 1999-00 will be determined nearer the time. ESS is not prescriptive: LEAs are free to spend more or less, in the light of their own view of priorities.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your questions about how many claimants had their Income Support reduced in each of the first two quarters of 1996-97 for non-attendance or failure to complete (i) Jobplan Workshops, (ii) Restart Courses, (iii) Workwise and Worklink and (iv) 1-2-1, and how many claimants had Income Support reduced for (a) two weeks and (b) four weeks for non attendance or failure to complete Project Work in the first two quarters of 1996-97. This is something which falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of the Agency.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Unfortunately, the information is not available in the form you require. It may help if I explain that decisions on Income Support for non attendance on or failure to complete Project Work are based on opinions given by Employment Service adjudication officers. In the period April 1996 to September 1996, Employment Service adjudication officers gave 43 opinions which may have led to a reduction in the amount of Income Support payable. The information 



<P>
</UL></FONT><P><I>17 Jul 1997 : Column: 309</I><P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>available does not show whether this would have been for two weeks or four weeks. Not all adverse opinions will necessarily have resulted in a reduction of Income Support.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Information on the number of claimants whose Income Support was reduced during the same period for non attendance on or failure to complete Jobplan Workshops, Restart Courses, Workwise, Worklink, and 1-2-1 was not collated centrally and unfortunately can not therefore be provided.

<a name="70717w18.html_wqn2"><B> Mrs. Gordon: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what is his Department's assessment of the <i>(a)</i> advantages and <i>(b)</i> disadvantages of league tables for public examination results; and what assessment he has made of the utility to parents of data contained in these reports. [8438]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70717w18.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 Performance tables of examination results inform the debate on standards and focus attention on the areas where action is needed. Most parents are aware that the information is available and find it valuable when making decisions. But they need to have a fuller picture. Secondary tables this November will show how schools have improved over time. We aim to include value-added measurements the following year.

<a name="70717w18.html_wqn3"><B> Mrs. Gordon: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what assessment he has made of the advantages of taking account of secondary school intake in school performance tables. [8440]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70717w18.html_spnew3"><B> Ms. Morris: </B> 
 Secondary school performance tables need to show the progress pupils have made, from their different starting points, as well as success in public examinations. The School Curriculum and Assessment Authority have reported that it is possible to measure value added in schools. I have asked them to take forward this work with the aim of including such measures in secondary tables in 1998. We shall consult fully on this.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment when his departmental officials last met representatives of the Further Education Funding Council regarding the provision of further education services to patients detained under the Mental Health Act 1983. [8504]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70717w18.html_spnew4"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 Officials have not held any meetings with FEFC officers on this issue, but there has been contact with FEFC, by telephone and correspondence, on this matter.
<P>
<P>
<a name="70717w18.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Etherington: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what plans he has to ensure that further education services are available to patients detained under the Mental Health Act 1983; and if he will make a statement. [8503]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70717w18.html_spnew5"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 Section 60 of the Further and Higher Education Act 1992 debars the Further Education Funding Council from funding the education of patients detained under the Mental Health Act 1983. The Government has no plans for amending the legislation in this area.

<a name="70717w19.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Byers: </B> 
 The White Paper "Excellence in Schools" set out our plans for introducing a new framework of community, aided and foundation schools to replace the existing categories of schools. Chapter 7 proposes that, in order to minimise disruption for schools, the necessary legislation should be framed in terms of a set of assumptions that schools in an existing category will generally move to a specified new category. But the governing body will be able to choose a different legal category if they wish, and parental ballots will be available as a mechanism for parents to express their views.

<P>
<a name="70717w19.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Byers: </B> 
 Unlike today, there was no systemic national collection of statistics on the entry to universities in the 19th century. However the view that most historians of education take of the position of higher education in England at the turn of the century would support the statement in the White Paper. For example, V. H. H. Green in <i>The Universities</i> (Penguin, 1969) on page 125 states that, "Oxford and Cambridge still remained in 1900 the principal finishing schools of the upper and middle classes, recruiting most of their undergraduates from the independent public schools".

 The First Report from the Committee on Standards in Public Life (Cm 2850) made it clear that, when Members are meeting Ministers or others on topics in which they have an interest, the onus is on the Member to declare that interest, not the Minister to know (paragraph 63 of Cm 2850). It is not practicable for Ministers and officials, amongst their other duties, to vet requests for meetings against the Register of Members' Interests. Should evidence of non-declaration emerge, or contravention of the Resolution of the House relating to delegations to Ministers, the matter would be brought to the attention of the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards.

 The controls are the same as for manufacturing projects, except that the ceiling on percentage contribution does not apply. This change allows for the different financial profile of tradable services projects which normally do not involve the substantial expenditure on capital items that is typical of manufacturing projects.

<P>
<a name="70717w21.html_spnew2"><B> Dr. Reid: </B> 
 The First Report from the Committee on Standards in Public Life (Cm 2850) recognised the value of enabling Members to retain interests outside the House, provided these were properly declared, both in the Register of Members' Interests and on other occasions. Subject to these requirements, and to the rules of the House relating to delegations to Ministers, Members are free to seek meetings with Ministers and officials, who will consider such requests alongside the many other approaches from individuals and organisations concerned to press their own interests or those of others.

<P>
<a name="70717w21.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The internal operating cost budget (i.e. excluding extramural research, non-Abbey Wood capital works and equipment procurement expenditure) of the Procurement Executive at Abbey Wood and elsewhere is some &#163;325 million or 1.5 per cent. of the Defence budget in the current financial year.

<P>
<a name="70717w21.html_spnew4"><B> Dr. Reid: </B> 
 The defence budget for 1997-98 is &#163;21.822 billion, which reflects a reduction of over 25 per cent. in real terms over the past 10 years. Within this, the Ministry of Defence does not distinguish between costs incurred in delivering its objectives and costs incurred in administering the delivery of those objectives. Responsibility for expenditure on all elements of defence operating costs, which include the costs of administration as well as those of delivering most aspects of military capability, is delegated to thirteen Top Level Budget holders. Planned expenditure by them for 1997-98 is &#163;16,382 million, or 75.1 per cent. of the defence budget.

<a name="70717w21.html_spnew5"><B> Dr. Reid: </B> 
 Operational effectiveness is defined differently according to the context. At the highest level it is the ability of the UK's forces successfully to carry out their missions. At the operational level, it is evaluated by measuring operational capabilities against those of potential adversaries in particular sets of circumstances.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70717w21.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 No. Recruitment to posts in the Civil Service is governed by the Civil Service Recruitment Code which permits the recruitment of staff on permanent, short term or casual contracts. This depends on the nature of the employment offered. Where a job is clearly temporary, or there is genuine uncertainty about work requirements, casual appointments for periods of up to 12 months are permitted.

 As my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister explained on 2 June 1997 in response to the hon. Member for Newport, West (Mr. Flynn), <i>Official Report,</i> column <i>99,</i> Ministers and officials in the Department receive deputations from many groups who are concerned to press their own interests or those of their clients, which Ministers and officials take due care to consider within the wider public interest and Government policy. As it is not practicable to distinguish particular groups as lobbyists, the Department cannot keep a register of such meetings.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence, pursuant to his answer of 30 June, <i>Official Report,</i> column <i>63,</i> relating to the Atomic Weapons Establishment site at Llanishen, how long he estimates it will take to decontaminate the site. [9111]<P>

<P>
<a name="70717w22.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 It is never possible at the outset of such a process to give a reliable estimate of how long it will take, because the extent of decontamination work must depend upon precisely what is encountered. During the process of decommissioning and decontaminating the Llanishen site, Land Quality Statements will be produced which will determine what measures are required to render the site fit for subsequent use. Given these circumstances we would not expect the process to be completed in less than five years.

 None. His contract is with the New Millennium Experience Company.

Member for Newport, West (Mr. Flynn) <i>Official Report</i>, 2 June 1997 column <i>99</i>, Ministers and officials in the Department receive deputations from many groups who are concerned to press their own interests of those of their clients, which Ministers and officials take due care to consider within the wider public interest and Government policy. As it is not practicable to distinguish particular groups as lobbyists, the Department can not keep a register of such meetings.

<a name="70717w24.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The Government has no current intention to regulate the practice of will-writing. We are aware that there have been complaints about some firms providing will-writing services and are keeping the matter under review.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70717w24.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 Barristers and solicitors in the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) have full rights of audience in the magistrates' courts where the vast majority of criminal cases are dealt with. The Government is addressing the issue of whether it would be in the interests of justice to extend rights of audience to include CPS lawyers. The Government is considering the existing statutory procedures in this area.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what plans he has to extend automatic exemption from the requirements to pay fees <i>(a)</i> in (i) county court and (ii) High Court proceedings to litigants in receipt of (1) income-based jobseeker's allowance, (2) family credit and (3) disability working allowance and <i>(b)</i> in family proceedings to litigants in receipt of (x) family credit and (y) disability working allowance; and if he will make a statement.

<P>
<a name="70717w24.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The Lord Chancellor has announced his intention to review the structure of civil court fees. As part of that review, he intends to examine the basis on which remissions are granted and to consider whether it would be appropriate for other categories of benefit to give rise to an automatic exemption from the liability to pay court fees. In Family Proceedings exemption from fees is already granted automatically to those in receipt of family credit as well as those in receipt of income support or of advice and assistance under the Green Form scheme. Other forms of benefit are in practice taken into account by court staff, to whom the day-to-day exercise of the Lord Chancellor's power to reduce or remit fees is delegated.

To ask the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster on what occasions <i>(a)</i> Ministers and <i>(b)</i> officials have refused to (i) arrange and (ii) attend meetings with hon. Members to discuss matters relating to interests registered by those Members under categories 1, 2, 3, 4(b), 8 and 9 in the Register of Members' Interests. [8069]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70717w24.html_spnew5"><B> Dr. David Clark: </B> 
 The First Report from the Committee on Standards in Public Life (Cm 2850) made it clear that, when Members are meeting Ministers or others on topics in which they have an interest, the onus is on the Member to declare that interest not the Minister to know [paragraph 63 of Cm 2850]. It is not practicable for Ministers and officials, amongst their other duties, to vet requests for meetings against the Register of Members' Interests.

To ask the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster if he will ensure that <i>(a)</i> Ministers and <i>(b)</i> officials in his Department refuse requests from hon. Members to (i) arrange and (ii) attend meetings relating to interests held by those Members under categories 1, 2, 3, 4(b), 8 and 9 in the Register of Members' Interests. [8066]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70717w24.html_spnew6"><B> Dr. Clark: </B> 
 The First Report from the Committee on Standards in Public Life (Cm 2850) recognised the value of enabling Ministers to retain interests outside the House, provided these were properly declared, both in the Register of Members' Interests and on other occasions. Subject to these requirements, and to the rules of the House relating to delegations to Ministers, Members are free to seek meetings with Ministers and officials, who will consider such requests alongside the many other approaches from individuals and organisations concerned to press their own interests or those of others.
