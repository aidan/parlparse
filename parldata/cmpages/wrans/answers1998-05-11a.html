To ask the President of the Council what is the budget under the direct control of the United Kingdom Anti-Drugs Co-ordinator.  [40262]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80511w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mrs. Ann Taylor: </B> 
 The UK Anti-Drugs Co-ordinator, Keith Hellawell, is a special adviser to the Government, and as such has no budget to spend. As part of the Government's Comprehensive Spending Review, he has overseen a review of existing drug resources. This has informed the Government's new anti-drugs strategy, 'Tackling Drugs to Build a Better Britain', launched last month. This estimated that the Government currently spend about &#163;1.4 billion a year on anti-drugs activity within departmental programmes. An announcement on funding from 1999-2000 will be made later in the year, following the outcome of the Comprehensive Spending Review.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what monitoring his Department conducts on the extent to which outside individuals have attempted to hack into his Department's computer system; how often reports are made on this matter; and what is the current security classification of such reports.  [40755]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80511w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 Ministry of Defence policy on the connection of computer systems to external data networks, such as the Internet, is that the computer system should be dedicated to the purpose and, unless the system processes only unclassified data, be protected by a security architecture which includes firewall technology that monitors attempts at hacking. There is no evidence of a successful intrusion from an external source to any MOD computer system.
<P>

<a name="80511w01.html_para2">The MOD is a contributing Department to the Government-wide Unified Incident Reporting and Alert Scheme, UNIRAS, run by the Security Service. Security incidents, including attempts at hacking, are reported to UNIRAS and an annual report, classified RESTRICTED, is produced by the Security Service.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80511w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. George Robertson: </B> 
 Extensive facilities for brigade-level armoured training in Poland are already available for use by other nations, and the United Kingdom makes regular use of them. The enlargement of NATO is unlikely in itself to result in additional opportunities for armoured training in Poland, Hungary or the Czech Republic.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80511w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. George Robertson: </B> 
 The NATO study on the costs of enlargement is a classified document, and I am therefore withholding it under exemption 1 (defence, security and international relations) of the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information and do not propose to publish it. I have however provided a copy of the study to the Defence Select Committee, whose Third Report of Session 1997-98 (HC 469) reproduces the unclassified information provided to it.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80511w01.html_spnew9"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 The pre-school needs of children up to the age of eight are safeguarded by statute under the Children Act 1989. This requires every local authority to keep a register of persons who act as childminders on domestic premises and also of persons who provide day care in non-domestic premises. The local authority has to be satisfied that those registered are suitable to be looking after children up to this age and have adequate regard to the needs of all children. The Department published, on 27 March 1998, a Consultation Paper on the Regulation of Early Education and Day Care.

 Although approximately &#163;3.2 million was earmarked to meet the cost of operating the New Deal Pathfinders in 1997-98, with &#163;5m programme expenditure held centrally, it is not possible to give actual expenditure figures at this stage.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80511w01.html_spnew11"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The number of mature students entering higher education courses in higher education institutions in the UK rose by 1 per cent. between 1996-97 and 1997-98, from 339,100 to 342,900. Mature students are defined as postgraduates aged 25 and over, and undergraduates aged 21 and over. Information on the numbers of lone parents entering higher education as mature students is not held centrally. However, data from the Labour Force Survey show that the number of lone parents aged 21 or over in full-time higher or further education rose from 207,000 in 1996-97 to 222,000 in 1997-98, representing an increase of 7 per cent.

Friend said in the House on 23 July 1997, <i>Official Report</i>, column 951, the Government will ensure that savings promised from the new funding arrangements for higher education are used to improve quality, standards and opportunities for all in further and higher education. As evidence of our intention, the funding package announced by my right hon. Friend on 23 September 1997 will allow an extra &#163;165 million to be spent on higher education in 1998-99.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what assessment he has made of the earnings of graduates relative to those of non-graduates; and what assessment he has made of the impact of gender on the earnings of graduates.  [41593]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80511w02.html_spnew6"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 Compared with those who obtain the qualifications to go to university but choose not to do so, graduates on average see their earnings rise by broadly a fifth by their early 30s as a direct result of their higher qualifications.
<P>

<a name="80511w02.html_para1">Comparing the gross weekly earnings of people whose highest qualification is a degree with the gross weekly earnings of people whose highest qualification is 2 or more A levels shows that both male and female graduates earn more than male and female non-graduates throughout their working life.
<P>

<a name="80511w02.html_para2">The pattern of earnings for young women graduates is broadly similar to men, but diverges after the age of 30. Women's earnings are lower than men's on average, reflecting a greater likelihood of part-time work or time out of the labour force. However, after allowing for this, the earnings of graduates compared with non-graduates remains greater for women than men.

<a name="80511w02.html_para4">The Bill to reform the National Lottery will widen access to the benefits of the Lottery and allow a more strategic and co-ordinated approach to distribution to reflect identified needs. As part of this new approach, I hope the English Sports Council will plan to introduce in future a suitable programme under which existing sporting facilities can apply for funding from the Lottery.

<P>
<a name="80511w03.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 Four port state inspections were carried out on the merchant vessel REMA in the UK in the past five years. An additional five inspections were carried out in other countries within the region of the Paris Memorandum of Understanding in the period since 20 August 1996. The Marine Accident Investigation Branch will be investigating the loss of the REMA on behalf of the Belize Authorities. A report detailing their findings will be published in due course.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what were the minimum certificate of competency requirements for the seafarers on the vessel Rema; what was the issuing authority of those certificates of competency; and if the vessel complied with these on the day of her loss.  [40349]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80511w03.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The minimum certificate of competency requirements for the seafarers on the vessel REMA being registered in Belize are stipulated by the International Merchant Marine Registry of Belize in accordance with Regulation V/13(b) of SOLAS. The vessel's Minimum Safe Manning Certificate, issued 10 February 1998, specifies One Master, One First Mate and One Engineer Officer. These were the only personnel required to hold certificates of competency. When the vessel was inspected in February 1998, the certificates of competency were issued by the International Merchant Marine Registry of Belize. It is not possible to say if the vessel complied with the requirements of the Minimum Safe Manning Certificate on the day of her loss.

<P>
<a name="80511w03.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The last port State inspection of the vessel REMA in Montrose, UK, on 9 February 1998 resulted in detention of the vessel. It was released on 13 February 1998, after all detainable deficiencies had been rectified.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what the minimum manning requirements were for the vessel Rema; and if the ship complied with these on the date of her loss.  [40352]
<P>
<UL>Ms Glenda Jackson: The minimum manning requirement for the vessel REMA, being registered in Belize, is as stipulated by the International Merchant Marine Register of Belize in the vessel's Minimum Safe Manning Certificate. When the vessel was inspected in Montrose in February 1998, the minimum safe manning required by Belize was four and it was noted that there was no Engineer Officer aboard. When this was queried, Belize responded by producing a Minimum Safe Manning Certificate for seven, including an Engineer officer, but the ship had life-saving appliances and accommodation for only five. As this was approximately the manning that could be reasonably expected on a vessel of this size and type, the REMA was released from detention with a crew of five, including an Engineer Officer, on the condition that the discrepancy between the Safe Manning Document and life saving appliance was rectified, by Belize, before departure from the next port after release from detention. Once again we cannot say whether there were five aboard the vessel at the time of her loss.

 <i>[holding answer 8 May 1998]:</i> No agreements have been reached in respect of the import of toxic waste from South Africa. In March 1998, the Environment Agency received a request from the Government of the Republic of South Africa to export 5,550 tonnes of wastes into the United Kingdom over a three year period. The wastes in question were a mixture of polychlorinated biphenyls, pesticides and hexachlorobenzene, destined for disposal by high

To ask the Prime Minister if he will make a statement on the work of the Social Exclusion Unit on school exclusions and truancy.  [41752]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80511w04.html_spmin0"><B>The Prime Minister:</B> 
 I launched the Social Exclusion Unit last December, with a remit to co-ordinate and improve Government action to reduce social exclusion. As one of its first priorities, I asked it to report by Easter on how to make a step change in the scale of truancy and exclusions from school, and to find better solutions for those who have to be excluded. The Unit has worked closely on this task with other Government Departments, drawing on outside expertise and research, as well as a wide programme of visits and meetings and a written consultation exercise.
<P>

<a name="80511w04.html_para7">The Government have now reached their conclusions. These decisions, and the underlying analysis, are set out in the Unit's report <i>Truancy and School Exclusions</i>, published today. Copies of the report are available in the Libraries.
<P>

<a name="80511w04.html_para8">The report sets out what we know about the scale of truancy and exclusion.
<P>

<a name="80511w04.html_para9">Our information on both is imperfect. For truancy, figures compiled from registration statistics suggest that around 1 million pupils take at least one half day off without authority. But in confidential surveys pupils admit to much higher levels: one survey suggested nearly one in ten 15 year olds truanted at least once a week.




<P>
<P><I>11 May 1998 : Column: 18</I><P>

<P>

<a name="80511w04.html_para10">The numbers permanently excluded from school stand at around 13,000 a year and have been rising fast. Over 100,000 are excluded temporarily. 83 per cent. of excluded pupils are boys, and half are aged fourteen or fifteen. African Caribbean children are 6 times more likely than average to be excluded, and children in care 10 times more likely.
<P>

<a name="80511w04.html_para11">The causes of both problems are complex. Parents are responsible for ensuring that their children attend school, and poor parental supervision is often the cause of truancy. Peer group and community attitudes are also important, as are anxiety about exams, poor basic skills, fear of bullying or boredom with school.
<P>

<a name="80511w04.html_para12">The reasons for exclusions vary widely, from relatively minor issues which should not have warranted such a response, to serious, even criminal, behaviour. The rise in exclusion has been attributed to a wide mix of factors, including poor basic skills, limited aspirations and opportunities, high levels of family stress, as well as lack of training and support in schools, and pressures on academic standards.
<P>

<a name="80511w04.html_para13">More often than not, excluded children do not get reintegrated into school quickly, Those who are educated outside school rarely receive a full timetable and many get little more than a few hours tuition per week, and are otherwise left to their own devices.
<P>

<a name="80511w04.html_para14">Both truancy and exclusion are strongly associated with a range of other problems including unemployment and homelessness, but above all with crime. An Audit Commission study showed that nearly half of all school age offenders have been excluded from school and a quarter truanted significantly. The problems cut across departments and agencies and therefore require coherent solutions that involve not only schools, but also the police and social services, as well as parents.
<P>

<a name="80511w04.html_para15">There is much good practice to learn from. Where it is followed, exclusion and truancy have been greatly reduced. As a result, there are wide variations in the levels of exclusion and truancy between regions and between schools with similar intakes and results.
<P>

<a name="80511w04.html_para16">The report published today draws on the lessons of what works. It commits the Government to the goal of cutting levels of both exclusions and truancy by a third by 2002. The measure to deliver this span a range of departments and local agencies, as well as schools, parents and pupils, reflecting the multi-dimensional nature of the problem.
<P>

<a name="80511w04.html_para17">The national target will be underpinned by local authority level targets for truancy and exclusion reductions. The Government will consult on the detail of how targets should be set. The Secretary of State for Education and Employment will introduce an amendment to the Schools Standards and Framework Bill to permit school level targets for the worst performers on truancy.
<P>

<a name="80511w04.html_para18">The Crime and Disorder Bill introduces parenting orders for parents who fail to ensure their children attend school.

<a name="80511w04.html_para19">To cut down on inappropriate exclusions, the Government will lay down clear rules on when exclusion is justified and give them legal force. There will be special Ofsted inspections for schools with particularly high levels of exclusions. Children excluded from school during the two GCSE years will stay in their original school for league table purposes, so there is no advantage in excluding poor performers.
<P>

<a name="80511w04.html_para20">The number of children from ethnic minorities who are excluded will be measured and reported at school level. The DfEE task group on raising achievement of ethnic minority pupils will look at what can be done to promote community mentoring in ethnic minority communities. There will be a major push to improve the school performance of children in local authority care, with more detailed proposals announced later this summer.
<P>

<a name="80511w04.html_para21">The Government will develop proposals to target more resources on preventive work with children at risk of exclusion. Local education authorities will also have incentives to provide more support to schools. There will be a requirement that all excluded pupils receive full time education so that their discipline or other problems are tackled in controlled environments and they are not abandoned to roam the streets. Decisions on the extra funding that is necessary, and on how funding will be organised, will be taken in the Comprehensive Spending Reviews. Full provision will be phased in over no more than three years.
<P>

<a name="80511w04.html_para22">In addition, Education Action Zones will have a special focus on areas with particularly high levels of exclusion and truancy, to give extra encouragement for innovative approaches to bringing them down.

<a name="80511w04.html_para23">A Ministerial Task Force under the Minister for School Standards will oversee the implementation of these policies.
<P>

<a name="80511w04.html_para24">Together, these measures will ensure that far fewer young people lose time from school. In the short-term, children themselves will benefit from keeping up with their education. The wider community will benefit from less crime. In the long-term there will be benefits as fewer young people leave school without qualifications.
<P>

<a name="80511w04.html_para25">These measures will require schools, police, and parents to play a part in ensuring that education is no longer optional, and they will end a situation where failure to attend school has been tolerated and sometimes even condoned.

 The report, entitled <i>Evaluation of the Environmental Performance of EC Programmes in Developing Countries</i>, was recently published and distributed by the European Commission. The evaluation is acknowledged within and outside the Commission to have been a very useful exercise, which presents detailed findings and recommendations on aspects of policy and practice.
<P>

<a name="80511w06.html_para0">We are waiting for the Commission's response to the report. We then intend to monitor follow-up work and examine ways in which we can assist the Commission in their efforts. However, the Commission is reorganising its foreign policy services in order to rationalise and streamline policy formulation and implementation. This reorganisation can be expected to address many issues raised by the report. In particular, the Commission's capacity to implement recommendations should be strengthened as manpower and technical resource deficiencies are addressed. The Commission is also in the process of substantially revising its <i>Environment Manual</i> for development assistance. We welcome this positive action and would urge the commission to continue in this direction.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80511w06.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Foulkes: </B> 
 We continue to seek to ensure resources are spent effectively and efficiently through dialogue with Commission officials in Brussels and in delegations, and through our active participation in the Commission's management committees. We have also seconded 13 staff to work in the external development Directorates-General to use their expertise to assist the Commission. Amongst those seconded are a social development adviser and a forestry specialist.
<P>

<a name="80511w06.html_para1">Although the European Commission's own internal project cycle management guidance stresses the importance of cross cutting issues such as environmental and social issues in the project cycle, continuing efforts are required to ensure this is always fully reflected in the design and implementation of projects and programmes.
<P>

<a name="80511w06.html_para2">This is why one of DFID's priorities during the UK Presidency has been to try and improve the poverty focus and effectiveness of the Community's aid programmes. This has involved reviewing the implementation of important previous policy resolutions, on poverty and gender, to see how effective we have been and consider what more needs to be done to improve performance and impact in these key areas. We expect conclusions on this work to be adopted at the Development Council on 18 May.
<P>

<a name="80511w06.html_para3">In addition, we are seeking to promote the integration of environmental and social issues into the programme and project cycle through: our participation on the Commission's Scientific Environmental Monitoring Group and the forestry and water expert groups; providing a project leader to prepare an EC/Member States strategy for bio-diversity conservation; working closely with the

Scalloway has no SFI office, but has been included in recognition of the scale of landings made there.

 Despite the recent reports in the press, there is no evidence that black pod disease is adversely affecting cocoa production in the Ivory Coast. Nevertheless, a wide range of cocoa diseases are being tackled by the world-wide research programmes. The International Cocoa Organisation, of which the UK Government are an active member, is co-ordinating various projects aimed at combating cocoa diseases and addressing other difficulties affecting cocoa production. There is a specific project to fight witches broom disease in Brazil.

 Regular payments of maintenance can transform the lives of lone mothers and their children, providing a stable income that can help them off Income Support and into work. We expect the Child Support Agency to provide a consistent, fair and efficient service to all its clients.

<a name="80511w07.html_para1"><i>Letter from Faith Boardman to Mr. Steve Webb, dated 8 May 1998:</i>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I am replying to your Parliamentary Questions to the Secretary of State for Social Security about maintenance due to parents with care who are receiving or moving off Income Support.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In cases where the parent with care is receiving Income Support and the maintenance liability changes, the Child Support Agency notifies the Benefits Agency to advise them of the change. Benefits Agency staff then access the Income Support Computer System and input the revised amount of maintenance liability, and Income Support is adjusted accordingly. This revised information will then be available via Common Enquiry Services.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Where the parent with care is moving off Income Support, the Benefit Agency notify the Child Support Agency of the date from which Income Support is no longer payable so that maintenance payments can be passed onto the parent with care.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Statistics are not collated on the time between the notification and payment as these details would not prove very informative due to the several factors that have an influence on when a payment is due and in turn actually made. The length of time is influenced by the complexity of the change, the payment preferences of the parent with care and the absent parent, and also the absent parent's pay frequency. It is therefore difficult to estimate an average length of time for this process.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Agency is very aware of the need to deal with changes and ensure payments are passed on to the parent with care as quickly as possible. Where the change is straightforward all aspects can be dealt with in 2 weeks; in more involved cases (e.g., where a deduction from earnings order is in place) the change can take 8 weeks. During 1997-98, the Agency exceeded its Secretary of State target which required that 97% of payments be passed to the parent with care within ten days of receipt from the absent parent.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We are constantly looking at how we can adapt and improve our procedures to speed up the time taken. The timescales achieved for many cases have shortened over the last 2 years. Such an example is that the Agency is building more pro-active use of the telephone into its procedures between assessment and first payment to ensure that timescales are shortened wherever possible. The vast majority of payment advice is now conducted by telephone.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>As part of the Welfare to Work programme, the Agency is committed to ensuring that the disincentives and barriers to entering employment are minimised, and that obstacles are removed which jeopardise the prospect of lone parents moving from welfare dependency to work. The Agency has agreed to process as a priority cases where the parent with care has signed up to a New Deal for Lone Parents Action Plan. Also the Agency has agreed to answer straightforward inquiries from New Deal for Lone Parents Personal Advisers on behalf of lone parents immediately, and more complex ones within five working days.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>As the Department moves towards a more Active Modern Service, one of the key elements is to provide staff with a system which cuts across all Agencies where they will have access to information regarding payments and records of other Social Security systems. This should alleviate problems encountered by staff acting in ignorance of information held by other Agencies.</FONT></UL>

<P>
<P>
<a name="80511w08.html_spnew4"><B> Mrs. Beckett: </B> 
 I understand from BNFL that, as at the end of March 1998, the Thorp plant had sheared some 1,450 tonnes of spent fuel since the plant was actively commissioned in March 1994.
<P>

<a name="80511w08.html_para2">In July 1993 BNFL published a document entitled 'The Economic & Commercial Justification for Thorp'. That document stated that the expected throughput for the first ten years of Thorp's operation would be 7,000 tonnes.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80511w08.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 The unirradiated fuel, which amounts to eighty per cent of the uranium fuel received from Georgia, will be processed in existing equipment at Dounreay which does not require refurbishment. It is likely to be two years before the remaining twenty per cent., which has been irradiated, will be reprocessed. This could be done in one of a number of different plants and a decision has yet to be made about which one to use. As the plant used will also be used to reprocess other material, it is not possible to say at this stage what share of the refurbishment cost will fall to the irradiated Georgian fuel.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80511w08.html_spnew6"><B> Mrs. Beckett: </B> 
 All waste arising from reprocessing activities at Dounreay will continue to be stored in accordance with the regulatory requirements in force at the time. UKAEA contracts for reprocessing foreign nuclear materials are commercially confidential but they all comply with Government policy on nuclear waste repatriation (in force since 1976) by including a clause stipulating that waste will be returned. In all such cases this return of waste condition is backed by a Government to Government agreement. The Georgian highly enriched uranium (HEU) was recently transferred to Dounreay to improve international security. In this case, an exception

(9) pursuant to the oral answer of 27 April 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, column 21, on what occasions the Chief Constable has made representations on UKAEA police numbers to ministers in the past five years; in relation to which sites; and with what outcome.  [41082]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80511w09.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Battle </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 6 May 1998]:</i> The UKAEA Constabulary polices sites at Chapelcross, Risley, Sellafield, Springfields, Capenhurst, Dounreay, Harwell, and Winfrith. It assumed responsibility for policing these sites in 1955, with the exception of Chapelcross and Winfrith, where the relevant dates are 1956 and 1957 respectively.
<P>

<a name="80511w09.html_para2">The current force establishment of the UKAEA Constabulary is 471. Police numbers at all sites are subject to a continuing process of review and are approved as necessary by the Police Authority in the light of developing requirements. It is normal security practice not to reveal details relating to the police establishment at particular sites, or the security category of those sites, because this information is of potential use to criminals. The Chief Constable's requests for extra staffing in the past three years have been met in full. He has made no representations to Ministers on UKAEA Constabulary numbers.

 At the 1992 Summit in Munich, G7 leaders launched a programme of nuclear safety assistance for the countries of Eastern Europe and the Former Soviet Union. Although the EU was providing some help in identifying options for dealing with the sarcophagus, Chernobyl was not a target for nuclear safety assistance as Ukraine planned to close the plant by the end of 1993. Following 



<P>
<P><I>11 May 1998 : Column: 37</I><P>
the Ukrainian Parliament's reversal of that decision in late 1993, the EU at the 1994 Corfu Summit offered Ukraine an action plan leading, amongst other things, to the closure of Chernobyl. After extensive negotiations, the G7 countries, European Commission, and Ukraine signed a Memorandum of Understanding in 1995 which provided for support for Ukraine's energy sector, including help with nuclear safety at Chernobyl and the decommissioning of the plant. The MOU commits Ukraine to close the plant by the year 2000. Of the 100 mecu Tacis assistance offered by the EU at Corfu, 60 mecu has been allocated for work on site. This includes a site survey (0.5 mecu), development of a plan for dealing with the sarcophagus (2.5 mecu) and turnkey projects for three decommissioning facilities (38.5 mecu). An on-site assistance team is now in place primarily to help with the procurement of these facilities.
<P>

<a name="80511w09.html_para3">In 1993, the UK's Know How Fund supported completion on a &#163;217,000 land remediation study for the benefit of Ukraine's Ministry of Chernobyl Affairs. The EU has financed a number of studies linked to the development of an optimal management route for dealing with the different types of contamination around the site.
<P>

<a name="80511w09.html_para4">The EU has also contributed 20 mecu to the EBRD-managed Nuclear Safety Account. Of the UK's &#163;18.25 million contribution to that account, &#163;10 million has been specifically scheduled for the Ukraine. The commitments to this fund stand at 270 mecu and the 118 mecu project for Chernobyl includes safety upgrades for Unit 3, as well as a liquid radwaste treatment plant and a spent fuel interim storage facility to assist with decommissioning.
<P>

<a name="80511w09.html_para5">The G7 and the Ukraine have now agreed on a Shelter Implementation Plan to ensure that the sarcophagus is transformed into a safe and environmentally stable condition. The EU has pledged $100 million to the fund which has been set up to finance this plan. The UK is making a separate bilateral donation of $16.8 million. A project management team has now been appointed and tendering will shortly begin for the first stage of the work. A &#163;20,000 UK Government-financed study into the options for treating the water trapped in the sarcophagus is shortly to be made available to the project management team.

 We intend to produce a coherent strategy which reinforces our messages about sensible drinking and provides an effective framework for action to tackle alcohol misuse in all its forms. It will need to reflect all of the issues of major concern about alcohol across Government, as well as for other interested parties, including the alcohol industry. Much new co-ordinated work on alcohol is already taking place, for example through the Ministerial group on under-age drinking; the Department of Environment, Transport and the Regions' consultation exercise on drink-driving and the Home Office's recently announced review of liquor licensing. But that work will be more successful if it can take place within the context of a clearer framework for activity. Alcohol Concern have secured private sector support to carry out an extensive consultation exercise by the end of 1998 on what form an alcohol strategy might take. All interests should be reflected in this process and we will await its results before taking further action.

These documents are being used by the countries concerned and international donors, to help shape safety upgrading programmes. The UK continues to work with our G7 and European Union partners to improve nuclear safety in the countries concerned and to encourage them to develop viable energy sector strategies that enable alternative generating capacity to be brought on line, allowing the older, less safe, reactors to close.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80511w13.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 The well-being of elderly people is a very high priority for this Government. Crimes against the elderly are particularly shocking, and we are determined to ensure that they are effectively addressed. Measures in the Crime and Disorder Bill will help achieve this goal.
<P>

<a name="80511w13.html_para1">Under the Bill, the police and local authorities will be required to form partnerships to identify and to reduce crime and disorder. These partnerships will bring together many agencies and, importantly, will entail the full involvement of the local community. Implementation will involve local consultation, and guidance which we plan to issue in July will include specific reference to the need for public meetings and other forms of consultation to be accessible to all members of the community, including the elderly. The partnerships will be required to conduct an audit of current levels of crime and disorder and to devise a strategy to tackle specific local problems, including those affecting the elderly.
<P>

<a name="80511w13.html_para2">Fortunately, crime risks for the elderly are lower than they might appear from media coverage. The British Crime Survey found that, across a wide range of offence categories, risks for those aged 16 to 29 were at least treble the risks for the elderly. For assault, young people were 37 times more at risk.

 The Crime and Disorder Bill includes a range of measures to reduce crime and disorder, and the fear of crime. Foremost of these is the proposal for the police and local authorities together to undertake a crime and disorder audit in the district, borough or unitary authority area, in consultation with other agencies and the wider community. They will then have to develop a local

<P><I>11 May 1998 : Column: 51</I><P>
strategy to tackle the identified crime and disorder problems. The work of the partnerships created to implement the local strategies, which will include clear targets, will include action at a much more local level within the local authority area. I am confident that these measures will have a significant effect on local levels of crime and disorder, and that this will in turn help people to feel more secure both in their homes and their communities.

 Statistics on animal use can be collated only in retrospect and this is done on a calendar year basis. We expect to publish the figures for 1997 in July. We do not expect a significant increase.
<P>

<a name="80511w13.html_para3">We cannot predict the number of procedures that will take place in the coming year. Although project licence applicants must estimate how many animals are to be used per year in each protocol, these figures are not collated centrally and, in practice, the number of animals actually used falls short of this estimate. We cannot predict the number of new project licence applications that we will receive during the year, or the number of animals that each will seek authority to use.
<P>

<a name="80511w13.html_para4">The Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 does not make provision for controlling the overall number of procedures; it requires that project licences be granted only if the benefits have been weighed against the costs and the purpose of the work cannot be achieved by other means. Whilst we can ensure that the number of animals used in each programme of work is minimised, we cannot dictate how many applications for new project licences will be submitted nor how many proposed programmes will satisfy the requirements of the Act, particularly the cost/benefit assessment. The number of scientific procedures involving animals is dependent on a number of factors, including the implications of scientific breakthroughs and the buoyancy of United Kingdom industry.
<P>

<a name="80511w13.html_para5">The primary purpose of the 1986 Act is to reduce suffering. In consequence, where there is a choice between one protocol involving a certain number of animals and a more severe protocol involving fewer animals, the former will, in many cases, be authorised. One of the roles played by the Home Office Animals (Scientific Procedures) Inspectorate is to ensure that applications to use animals have taken full account of the 3Rs concept of alternatives (refining procedures to minimise suffering; reducing the number of animals used; and replacing procedures with ones not involving protected animals), while ensuring that the scientific integrity and value of the work is not compromised.

<P>

<a name="80511w14.html_para2">The future of probationer training in the North East is under examination in the light of the forthcoming expiry of the lease of the present site at Durham in December 1999 and against the background of the demand for probationer training places generally. A working group composed of representatives of the Association of Police Authorities, the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO), the police staff associations, National Police Training (NPT) and the Home Office, has been set up to consider NPT's accommodation requirements in the North East and more generally, and to make recommendations. No final decision has been made and there is no preconceived view that probationer training should not take place in the North East. The working group, whose members include the Chief Constable of Durham Constabulary, will take full account of the views of the police authorities and forces in the North East. The correspondence from Councillor Gill has also been circulated to the working group.

In doing so, they will take account of the shortcomings in the facilities at the centre and the cost of the premises compared to alternatives, including the possibility of a Public Private Partnership.

 Research by the Home Office and others has shown that one of the strongest factors in relation to the commencement of offending by juveniles is poor parental supervision.

<P>

<a name="80511w14.html_para4">The Crime and Disorder Bill <i>[Lords]</i> will give local authorities a permissive power to introduce local child curfews for unsupervised children under 10 who are out on the streets late at night. The aim of such curfews is two-fold. They will address the need to protect young children from being drawn into anti-social or criminal behaviour, and they will protect communities from the misery and distress which can be caused by groups of unsupervised children.
