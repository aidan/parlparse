 DFID&#146;s assessment is that there are circumstances when the private sector can play a role in meeting the needs of poor people. This is because, in spite of extensive technical assistance, public water utilities in developing countries have found it difficult to improve their performance and outreach. This has come about for a variety of reasons that we need to understand and learn from. DFID continuously assesses and learns from examples of public and private sector participation in delivering water.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_298"><a name="60629w0001.htm_para11"><a name="06062978000049">There are good and bad examples of both public and private service provision. The best approach often involves partnerships between the public sector, the private sector and communities. An important factor for success is effective regulation, with enforceable contracts that set out clearly what is expected. One example is a four-year public-private partnership in South Africa focusing on poor rural communities, which has brought water to more than nine million people in five provinces.</p>

 The Department, especially through the Patent Office, helps businesses to combat copyright infringement in a number of ways, for example through raising awareness of the intellectual property system and the value of intellectual property, as well as coordinating enforcement action against intellectual property crime. However, as our awareness activities usually cover the whole range of intellectual property and as copyright infringement on a commercial scale is usually associated with other offences, we do not have figures available relating specifically to copyright infringement.</p>

As a result of the restructuring which completed in January 2005, the Government have taken direct financial responsibility for BE&#146;s historic spent fuel liabilities. The following payments have been made since restructuring to meet those historic spent fuel liabilities: 2004-05&#151; &#163;185 million; 2005-06&#151;&#163;189 million.

The legacy is made up of experimental facilities created 30 and 40 years ago and which were built without any consideration at the time for future decommissioning and clean up. About 80 per cent. of the total legacy costs relate to Sellafield and Dounreay&#151;neither of which ever produced much electricity. In its approved Strategy the NDA set out its proposals for nuclear clean up which is estimated to be &#163;62.7 billion. This is the life time cost of clean up&#151;likely to take up to 100 years plus to implement.</p>

 We believe that work is the best route out of poverty. It builds family aspirations, fosters greater social inclusion and can improve an individual&#146;s health and well-being. Our Green Paper sets out proposals aimed at achieving an employment rate equivalent to 80 per cent. of the working age population.

 On 25 June, the Government of Sudan suspended all UN activity in Darfur apart from humanitarian assistance provided by the World Food Programme and the UN Children&#146;s Fund, UNICEF. They lifted the suspension the following day. There has been some impact on the UN&#146;s humanitarian work in West Darfur, but minimal disruption elsewhere.</p>

 The neighbourhood management pathfinder programme is subject to a comprehensive national evaluation.

Planned future research will address more directly the costs and benefits of the programme, though it should be noted that quantifying the impact of neighbourhood management is made harder because it works by influencing existing service providers rather than delivering and funding new services and projects directly.</p>

 The abolition of academic selection is one element of a whole package of reforms of post-primary education. The focus of the new arrangements is on the educational needs of the child. The new arrangements will be implemented locally by schools and school managing authorities working together, taking account of local needs and circumstances. Until local arrangements are developed, the financial implications cannot be assessed. &#163;24.7 million has been made available over the period 2005-06 to 2007-08 to support the preparation for and phased introduction of, key elements of the new post-primary arrangements.</p>

 Contractors only provide orthodontic treatment to a person who is assessed as having a treatment need in grade four or five of the dental health component of the index of orthodontic treatment need (IOTN) or grade three of the dental health component of that index with an aesthetic component of six or above. This is unless the contractor is of the opinion that orthodontic treatment should be provided to a person who does not have such a treatment need by virtue of the exceptional circumstances of the dental and oral condition of the person concerned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_476"><a name="60629w0020.htm_para12"><a name="06063018000664">Research has shown that IOTN grades four and five constitute about 30 per cent., of the 12 year old child population, the age most suitable for treatment. Although many orthodontic practitioners based their treatment planning on IOTN, all grades could be treated in the general dental services. It should also be noted that children do not necessarily receive orthodontic treatment within the primary care trust which they reside.</p>

As of April, 35 contracts were agreed and three rejected in the South West Oxfordshire PCT area while 23 contracts were signed and 13 rejected in the Swindon PCT area. The signed contracts represent 98.1 per cent. and 93.1 per cent. of dental services respectively. This reflects that fact that many of those who rejected new contracts were dentists who treated relatively few NHS patients. PCTs are using the funding associated with the rejected contracts to commission additional services from other  dentists.</p>

 For the latest Government-wide figures on the percentage of Government expenditure researching new technologies, I refer to the answer given by my hon. Friend the Member for Poplar and Canning Town (Jim Fitzpatrick) on 21 June 2006 showing R and D expenditure broken down by department for 2003-04. The Home Office figure in that table did not separately identify or estimate the research expenditure on new technologies from the Government services category. Overall the table shows the Home Office spent 0.64 per cent. of its budget on R and D work in 2003-04.</p>

 Details of the names, locations and funding awarded to sexual assault referral centres and rape crisis organisations are provided in the following table. This information dates back to 2001-02 for rape crisis and to 2003-04 for sexual assault referral centres. Information preceding this is not readily available. The overall purpose of sexual assault referral centres is to deliver a holistic and high quality service to victims of rape and sexual assault including medical care, counselling and support, and to provide enhanced facilities for gathering evidence. Rape crisis provides a network of co-ordination, support and advocacy for member voluntary and community organisations. Each rape crisis centre and sexual assault referral centre will have its own objectives.</p>

 There are two prisoners currently serving sentences of imprisonment in the UK for crimes falling within this description. Radislav Krstic is serving a 35 year sentence for crimes committed in the former Yugoslavia. The prisoner was transferred to the UK in 2004 in accordance with the Sentence Enforcement Agreement between the UK and the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia. Farayadi Sawar Zardad, serving a sentence of 20 years, was convicted in the UK of crimes committed in Afghanistan. It would be inappropriate for operational reasons to disclose the prisons in which they are held.</p>
