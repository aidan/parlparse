 We welcome the detailed EU and Commonwealth Observer Mission reports. Both made clear that the election campaign was marred by violence and intimidation. Despite this, about half of the electorate turned out to vote in polls which were conducted in a peaceful and orderly manner. For the first time Zimbabwe has a sizeable opposition in Parliament, and the result demonstrates a clear desire for change on the part of the people of Zimbabwe. The Movement for Democratic Change is proposing to mount legal challenges in 26 constituencies.

 <i>[holding answer 10 July 2000]:</i> The Government have looked very carefully at how best to achieve an end to the advertising and promotion of tobacco at sports events in a way that will minimise any damage to the sports concerned. A Task Force of business and sponsorship, which I chair, exists to assist sports. All sports will be given up to July 2003 to secure alternative sponsorship, and the Government supported a derogation in EC legislation that those meeting the criteria for 'global events' will be allowed up to July 2006 if they agree to a reduction in expenditure and advertising.
<P>

<a name="00712w02.html_para1">Seven sports have sought assistance to make the transition from tobacco sponsorship--rugby league, clay pigeon shooting, billiards and snooker, pool, darts, ice-hockey and angling. Over the last 18 months there has been extensive contact with the seven sports and the Task

<P><I>12 Jul 2000 : Column: 544W</I><P>
Force has been there to: make information available; offer advice to support the development of new marketing strategies; to make initial contacts with potential sponsors; and offer professional advice on how the sports can start to position themselves in a changing marketplace. The Task Force last met together on 18 October 1999. Since then, there have been further meetings between members of the Task Force and the governing bodies.
<P>

<a name="00712w02.html_para2">The Task Force has now concluded the first phase of its work to identify the needs of the sports and ascertain how it can best assist them. Most sports have confirmed that it is too soon to be looking to replace existing contracts, and have indicated that the help of the Task Force can most effectively be targeted in the 12-18 months before these contracts lapse, which is the normal lead time for negotiating new sponsorships. It has been agreed with the sports therefore that there is no need for the Task Force to continue to meet on a regular basis. The Task Force has made it clear to all the sports that its assistance is still available in its second phase, as and when they require it.

<a name="00712w02.html_para3">I have had recent discussions with the British Darts Organisation and the Ice Hockey Superleague, who have both indicated that they wish to continue to utilise the expertise of the Task Force.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security when he will publish the inspection report of the Benefit Fraud Inspectorate in respect of Braintree district council.  [130672]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00712w03.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The Benefit Fraud Inspectorate report has been published today in respect of Braintree district council and copies of the report have been placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="00712w03.html_para3">The report provides recommendations aimed at helping the council address weaknesses and to improve the administration of Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit, as well as their respective counter fraud activities.
<P>

<a name="00712w03.html_para4">Inspectors found the Benefits Section at Braintree placed a strong emphasis on achieving high levels of speed and efficiency, which compared favourably against the performance of other councils. However, concern is noted that the high priority given to processing claims speedily had been at the expense of ensuring that all payments were secure and valid.
<P>

<a name="00712w03.html_para5">The BFI considered the security of Braintree's benefits system needs to be strengthened in three areas: full compliance with the Verification Framework; fraud investigation; overpayment recovery and classification.
<P>

<a name="00712w03.html_para6">The report notes that Braintree had introduced the Verification Framework eight weeks before Inspectors arrived for the on-site inspection. Although it was still early days, the report notes signs that its introduction was already paying off, by uncovering claims with undeclared income and capital. This was contributing to a reduction in Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit expenditure. The council had also introduced other new security initiatives including the "Do Not Redirect" mail scheme and was using a Remote Access Terminal to access information from the Department and Benefits Agency.
<P>

<a name="00712w03.html_para7">The report illustrates that the council is committed to customer service in their speed of processing claims for benefit. It is encouraging that they have also committed themselves to the Verification Framework which provides a minimum set of standards for ensuring that payment of benefit is made to the right person in circumstances that are checked for correctness.

<P>

<a name="00712w03.html_para10">The BFI reports that Eden District Council had a strong commitment to ensuring benefit payments were paid promptly and overpayments recovered wherever possible. The report notes a reasonable standard of verification was being applied to claims and Inspectors anticipated further improvement once the impact is felt of the council's implementation of the Verification Framework.
<P>

<a name="00712w03.html_para11">Inspectors had a number of concerns, which included a lack of information that was necessary to support the council's benefit operations. It is reported that the combination of this and inadequate targets, measurements and procedural guidance meant that management were taking organisational decisions based on insufficient information. In addition minimal management checking provided little assurance that fraud and error was being prevented from entering the council's benefit system.

 We have no plans to change the current arrangements, which give effect to changes as quickly as is practicable. Once the information is received from the Office for National Statistics of an alteration in the interest rates, the Department immediately sets in motion the procedures, to amend the relevant computer systems, and legislation. On the last two occasions that the standard interest rate was changed, in April and June 2000, it took six working days and five working days respectively from the date the Department received notification of the change in rates, to the date that regulations were laid. Regulations are laid at least 21 days in advance of their coming into force to allow for proper Parliamentary procedures to be followed. The same timetable applies when the standard interest rate increases as when it decreases.

<a name="00712w04.html_wqn1"><B> Dr. Iddon: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security for what reasons it is necessary for pensioners to comply with the requirements of the housing benefit verification framework.  [130067]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00712w04.html_spnew1"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 The Verification Framework guidance is aimed at ensuring proper standards in the administration of Council Tax Benefit and Housing Benefit by local authorities. This ensures that the right amount of benefit is paid to any claimant who is properly entitled to it. The checks local authorities are required to make under the Framework apply to all claimants, no matter what their age or status.
<P>

<a name="00712w04.html_para0">That said, as we announced in the Housing Green Paper, we are moving towards organisational changes, which will see services to pensioners being better tailored to their needs. This includes looking at whether there is a need to require pensioners to make claims as often as they have to at the moment. However, any change is still likely to need rigorous checking at the outset to ensure that the full and correct amount of benefit is put in payment.
<P>

<a name="00712w04.html_para1">Anecdotal evidence from local authorities indicates that in some areas the introduction of the Verification Framework has highlighted a significant number of incorrect payments to pensioners. Although in many cases overpayments have been identified, there are also a substantial number of cases where underpayments have been established and rectified as a result of verification.

 Following the normal practice, Widows Benefit was uprated in line with RPI of 1.1 per cent. with effect from April 2000. Housing Benefit for non- pensioners was uprated by the Rossi index of 1.6 per cent. for the same period. Housing Benefit for pensioners was uprated by average earnings of 4.6 per cent. We have no plans to use a common index for uprating Widows Benefit and Housing Benefit.

 <i>[holding answer 4 July 2000]:</i> Participation in education by 16-year-olds in England rose to 77.4 per cent. (provisional) at the end of 1999, from 76.2 per cent. in 1998. The Secretary of State recently launched a major &#163;3 million advertising campaign aimed at encouraging this year's school leavers and others to stay on in some form of learning. The "Don't Quit Now" campaign is particularly aimed at those who left this year with few, if any GCSEs and are in danger of dropping out of education and training.
<P>

<a name="00712w04.html_para2">Figures for participation in education in Dudley LEA are given in the following table; data for 1998-99 are not yet available. Figures for GST in Dudley TEC are also shown, as there is evidence that in TEC areas high rates of training compensate to some extent for lower levels of full-time education.

 The Code of Guidance on Parts VII and VII of the Housing Act 1996 includes guidance on section 167 of the 1996 Act, which requires local housing authorities to consult registered social landlords with which they have nomination agreements when adopting or changing a housing allocation scheme. The Code also includes guidance on framing allocations policies. The Housing Green Paper, "Quality and Choice; A decent home for all", proposes giving more choice to applicants for social housing, and improving the safety net for homeless households, including a multi-agency approach to developing homelessness strategies. The Government propose to issue a revised Code of Guidance on Parts VII and VII of the Housing Act 1996 later this year, taking account of the developing agenda on social lettings and homelessness as set out in the Housing Green Paper and responses to the consultation on this.

 The Government consider that choice for those seeking social housing should be as wide as possible. However, the Housing Green Paper proposals recognise the wide variations in demand for housing in different parts of the country. Local authorities are responsible for local housing strategies and developing lettings policies which reflect local housing needs. We will wish to ensure that the framework for lettings schemes is flexible enough to deal with these local circumstances. We intend to consider responses to the Housing Green Paper and to consult with local government, Shelter and others before finalising our proposals.

 Planning Policy Guidance note 17: "Sport and Recreation" emphasises the special significance of playing fields and that they should normally be protected. The Town and Country Planning (Playing Fields) (England) Direction 1998 requires referral to the Secretary of State of planning applications for development of local authority-owned playing fields or those currently, or in the previous five years, in educational use, where Sport England has objected but the local planning authority is minded to grant permission. The Secretary of State then has the opportunity to call in the application for his own determination.

<a name="00712w07.html_para0">This Government are committed to increasing representation of women in public life. In support of this, the Department has drawn up an action plan for increasing the number of women and ethnic minorities holding public appointments. The latest plans, together with the Governments overall plan, were published on 24 May 2000 in "Quangos, Opening Up Public Appointments 2000-2003", a copy of which is deposited in the Libraries of both Houses.

Neighbourhood Renewal. The consultation included over 70 events around the country and to date over 600 written responses have been received. Housing quality was raised at a number of the events. The written response is currently being analysed and it is too early to assess how many concern good quality housing. The results from the consultation will be reflected in the final strategy document to be issued later this year.

 The local voluntary sector has an important role to play in combating social exclusion. Local authorities, including Islington borough council, provide substantial funding to that sector. The extent of that funding is a matter for individual councils bearing in mind their statutory responsibilities, their priorities and the wishes of their electorate.

<P>
<a name="00712w08.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The work of the Short Term Training Team is progressing well, with the recruits due to complete their infantry training before the end of July. In the light of the success of this training, and in order to provide further support for the Government of Sierra Leone, I have approved a second six-week course, which will run to early September. The training team for this course will be largely drawn from one Royal Irish, whose equipment will be transported by the RFA Sir Galahad, which will then return to the UK. The existing RFA, Sir Percivale, will remain in support. In addition, the Government will be providing some items of personal equipment needed by the trainees, including boots and ponchos, from surplus MOD stocks, as well as an additional 5 million rounds of 7.62 mm link ammunition to help to meet urgent operational needs. As with the previous batch of ammunition announced on 29 June, this will be delivered to Sierra Leone subject to the Government of Sierra Leone securing formal agreement from the ECOWAS Secretariat that this ammunition can be imported as an exception to their Small Arms Moratorium. In accordance with UNSCR 1171 (1998), this shipment will be notified to the UN Sanctions Committee. Its provision will also be subject to confirmation that it will be used only by regular SLA soldiers, in accordance with international humanitarian law and human rights standards, and not by child soldiers.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>You asked whether there had been any delay in the Nimrod upgrade programme. Following EAC approval for Development and Manufacture in July 1996, the Nimrod MRA4 contract was let with BAE SYSTEMS in December 1996 with an In-Service Date (ISD) of April 2003. Following technical and resource problems, BAE SYSTEMS advised the DPA in late 1998 that they could not meet this date. In May 1999, following extensive negotiations, the contract was re-baselined with an ISD of March 2005, a delay of 23 months, with the MOD securing various benefits in compensation.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In the MPR 99 report, published on 6th July, the delay in the Nimrod MRA4 ISD is shown as 51 months. This derives from the method the NAO have used in the past to account for ISD slippage. As well as the 23 months described above, it includes an earlier cumulative delay of 28 months judged against the earliest estimate of when a Nimrod MR2 replacement aircraft was needed, but ahead of any meaningful Industry input. In future MPRs, ISD slippage will be measured against the most recent approval, which in the case of Nimrod MRA4 would be the Main Gate equivalent in July 1996. This will show the slippage to be the 23 months described above.</FONT></UL>

 The Government have now approved the procurement of Type 45 destroyers, in line with our firm commitment to a modern and effective destroyer and frigate force. Subject to the satisfactory completion of negotiations, a contract will be placed later this year with the prime contractor, BAe Systems, for the first three of these ships, and including some major long-lead equipment for a further three, at an estimated cost in excess of &#163;1 billion. It is planned that the first and third ships will be assembled by BAe Systems Marine, and the second ship by Vosper Thornycroft. The first of class is expected to be launched from the BAe Systems Marine Scotstoun yard on the Clyde.
<P>

<a name="00712w10.html_para0">The class is to be named the 'D' Class and Her Majesty the Queen has graciously agreed to the first of class being named HMS Daring and the second HMS Dauntless. This revives two names that have served the Royal Navy well since the early 1800s.

 The annual cost per patient of the beta- interferons in the United Kingdom is &#163;9,320 (Betaferon), &#163;9,490 (Avonex), &#163;9,090 (lower dose of Rebif) and &#163;12,070 (higher dose of Rebif).

<a name="00712w11.html_para0">The Department has made no studies of the cost of treatment in different countries. As far as the prices of the beta interferon medicines are concerned, the Department has information both from the manufacturers and from contacts in the health authorities of other countries. Direct comparisons of prices of products of this type are misleading because they are often supplied direct to hospitals, making list prices less significant. Furthermore, some countries include distribution costs and some aspects of care within the list price while others account for them separately.

 <i>[holding answer 11 July 2000]:</i> On 16 June 2000 we announced the second wave of nurse consultant posts. A nurse consultant in intermediate care at the Northumbria Healthcare National Health Service Trust was 1 of the 91 posts that we approved. Details of the new posts are set out in "Making a Difference: Strengthening the nursing, midwifery and health visiting contribution to health and health care", copies of which are available in the Library.

<P>
<a name="00712w12.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 There has been an encouraging improvement in the efficiency of cataract operations as a result of the introduction of the phacoemulsification technique whereby ultrasound is used to break up the opacified lens so that it can be removed through a thin cannula. We have allocated &#163;20 million over two years to the modernisation of the equipment and facilities used in cataract operations.

 In my reply to my hon. Friend on 17 April 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 329-30W, I announced that, while I had concluded that it was no longer appropriate for the Department to run such a child care facility as Glenthorne Youth Treatment Centre, no decision would be taken on when the centre would finally close until suitable alternative placements had been found for the 12 children accommodated in the centre at that time.
<P>

<a name="00712w12.html_para2">The Department and the management of the centre have worked closely with the local authorities and the Prison Service to identify the most appropriate alternative places. Suitable arrangements have now been made for all 12 children. The last child has now left the centre.
<P>

<a name="00712w12.html_para3">I therefore propose to close the centre on 13 July 2000.

 <i>[holding answer 27 June 2000]:</i> It is not possible to calculate a meaningful figure.

In addition, there are a number of pesticides available for use in organic agriculture but little information on the levels of their use. Some organic pesticides are permitted for use at higher rates than are the alternative conventional pesticides. On the other hand, some organic farmers seek to avoid the use even of these pesticides.

Where other payment terms are exceptionally agreed, they are used to measure performance. Performance is measured against all supplier invoices paid. For 1998-99, 93.3 per cent. of invoices were paid on time; in 1999-2000 89.5 per cent. of invoices were paid on time.

<a name="00712w16.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 The list was drawn up to include technologies with the greatest potential to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Six were identified initially on this basis. Two more have been added subsequently. The Government will keep the list under review.

<P>
<a name="00712w16.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Andrew Smith: </B> 
 The Central Computer and Telecommunications Agency (CCTA) and Property Advisers to the Civil Estate (PACE) are part of the Office of Government Commerce (OGC) which became operational on 1 April this year. Since 1 April, key strategies for the new organisation have been developed, and a review has been put in hand to ensure that resources and the organisational structure support those strategies. The terms of reference for the review are:
<P>

<a name="00712w16.html_para0"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>To review the present structure of OGC, covering its executive agencies and all other units; and to make recommendations on how best to align OGC's resources to deliver successfully its vision and strategies. The review will take into account the views of stakeholders including staff, central departments, other departments, customers and suppliers. It will also take account of requirements for Agency quinquennial reviews, in order to provide the specific reviews required for CCTA and PACE in the next year.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="00712w16.html_para1">In ensuring that the review will take account of the need for quinquennial reviews of CCTA and PACE, it will consider past performance, organisational options for service delivery and ways in which service can be improved. These issues are also relevant to the whole organisation, not just CCTA and PACE. Similarly, the organisational review will incorporate an independent input and will seek the views of both customers and suppliers about how the OGC as a whole can best catalyse the most efficient and effective use of the civil procurement budget.

 In my reply to the hon. Member on 17 April 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 380W, in which I stated that members of the public often find it particularly difficult to accept that species that are kept as domestic pets or companion animals, such as dogs, are also used in research to find cures for illness. Such animals must be purpose bred and supplied by designated establishments and can only be used if there is no viable alternative for that particular procedure. I should emphasise that dogs are only used in about a quarter of 1 per cent. of all procedures.

<a name="00712w16.html_para2">Table 1 of the Statistics of Scientific Procedures on Living Animals Great Britain records the number of scientific procedures performed on dogs and Table 1a records the number of dogs used by primary purpose of the procedure.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department (1) how many football hooligans <i>(a)</i> detained and <i>(b)</i> arrested at (i) Euro 2000, (ii) Copenhagen in May and (iii) the Scotland versus England match last year (A) were added to the Category C list and (B) had restriction orders placed upon them;  [128155]
<P>
<UL>(2) how many of those football fans <i>(a)</i> detained and <i>(b)</i> deported at (i) Euro 2000, (ii) Copenhagen in May and (iii) the Scotland versus England match in Glasgow last year were (1) Category C hooligans and (2) subject to international restriction orders.  [128154]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00712w16.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 The police service in England and Wales ceased to designate individuals involved in football hooliganism by categories A, B, and C, some three years ago, and have replaced this by a more targeted, intelligence-led approach. International Football Banning Orders may be sought as a result of behaviour in jurisdictions outside England and Wales only where an agreement exists for that purpose ad the individual in question has been convicted in that jurisdiction of a football-related offence.
<P>

<a name="00712w16.html_para22">No one has yet been made subject to an International Football Banning Order as a result of events at Euro 2000; it was not possible to impose International Football Banning Orders on persons detained or arrested in Copenhagen as a result of the decision of the Danish authorities not to prosecute such persons; and two people have so far received International Football Banning Orders as a result of convictions associated with the Scotland versus England match last year: additional bans will be sought on receipt of the necessary documentation from the Scottish Crown Office. None of those detained or deported as a result of their behaviour at these events last year were subject at the time to Restriction Orders or International Football Banning Orders.

 Of the 965 England supporters arrested or detained during Euro 2000, 391 had previously been convicted of a criminal offence. The National Criminal Intelligence Service now advise that the convictions are as follows: 133 convictions for violence, 200 for disorder, 38 for the possession of an offensive weapon, 122 for criminal damage and 250 for other offences. Some supporters will have been convicted of more than one type of offence.

Friend the Prime Minister discussed a number of ideas for tackling disorderly and anti-social behaviour at his meeting with chief officers of police on 3 July. These included the possibility of on-the-spot fines or fixed penalties.

 There is a twin track approach to the inspection of accommodation. First of all, officials in the National Asylum Support Service have signed a Service Level Agreement with the Property Advisors to the Civil Estate (PACE) part of the Office of Government Commerce. PACE officials are responsible for inspecting properties provided by accommodation providers and ensuring that housing conditions comply with the terms of the contract. Additionally, a Performance Monitoring Inspections Team has been established to carry out inspections in conjunction with PACE to ensure that the providers of accommodation comply fully with the contract in terms of effective housing management and access to support services.
