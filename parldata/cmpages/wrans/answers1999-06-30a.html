<a name="90630w01.htm_wqn0"><B> Liz Blackman: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what role his Department is playing in the implementation of the Chemical Weapons Convention.  [89515]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90630w01.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson: </B> 
 My Department is playing a full part in meeting the UK's obligations under the Convention. Since the convention's entry into force in April 1997, the UK has received 28 routine verification inspections, of which 19 have been to defence or former defence facilities in the UK. All have been conducted successfully by the international Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, who oversee the treaty. Earlier this month, we held the latest in a series of successful exercises to simulate an incoming challenge inspection (which could be requested by another State Party) to a defence facility in the UK, in which inspectors and observers from the OPCW and overseas countries participated.
<P>

<a name="90630w01.htm_para0">I am pleased to report that Ambassador Bustani, Director General of the OPCW, announced yesterday that CBD Porton Down has achieved the status of Designated Laboratory under the CWC, following its success in a series of demanding proficiency tests. This means that Porton is internationally recognised as competent to carry out analysis of chemical samples to the highest levels of accuracy. Such samples could be taken during routine or challenge inspections, including in cases of the alleged use of chemical weapons. Porton is one of only 12 laboratories worldwide to achieve this status.
<P>

<a name="90630w01.htm_para1">Yesterday's announcement confirms both the world class scientific and technical excellence of Porton and the UK's full commitment to ridding the world of chemical weapons.

<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I am replying to your question to The Secretary of State for Defence about Newcastle weather centre. This matter falls within my area of responsibility as Chief Executive of the Met. Office.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Following a comprehensive review of our forecasting processes, we recently announced plans to rationalise our national network of weather centres. The opportunities offered by improved technology will allow us to make greater use of automation in the production of weather forecasts and concentrate our activities at fewer locations,

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I am confident that the accuracy of forecasts will remain as high as ever in the Newcastle area, and indeed improve as meteorology continues to advance. In particular, we aim to provide a better service to the public through closer working relationships with the BBC regions. We will also continue to collect observational data locally. Knowledge of local geography and meteorological conditions will always be important, but the latest advances in technology together with improved communications, will enable us to prepare and deliver forecasts remotely, more cost-effectively.</FONT></UL>

<P>
<P>
<a name="90630w01.htm_wqn2"><B> Mr. Key: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what steps he is taking to ensure <i>(a)</i> parity of standards and <i>(b)</i> equality of opportunity between Service Children's Education and local authority provision in the UK.  [88361]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90630w01.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Spellar </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 28 June 1999]:</i> Service Children's Education was established as a Defence Agency specifically to provide an education service to the children of Service and MOD personnel serving overseas, that conforms, as far as possible, to the scope and standards required by the Education Acts in England and Wales. Key Targets are set annually and those for 1999 were announced in the House on 9 June 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column 329. Performance against Key Targets is reported in the Agency's Annual Report and Accounts which are laid before the House each year prior to the summer recess. To date, the Agency's performance has been slightly ahead of the UK LEA average.
<P>

<a name="90630w01.htm_para3">The Agency's ownership is delegated by the Secretary of State for Defence to the Adjutant General, who is assisted in this task by an Owner's Advisory Board, the membership of which includes senior representatives from the DfEE, Ofsted, and Wiltshire LEA. All the Agency's teachers are UK qualified and all the Agency's schools are subject to regular inspections by Ofsted. The Agency is implementing all the Government's latest education initiatives, in particular the literacy and numeracy strategies, in its schools worldwide. It has also successfully introduced the provision of free nursery education for 4 year olds in 48 nursery and pre-school locations worldwide.
<P>

<a name="90630w01.htm_para4">Parents have the right to express a preference in their choice of SCE school, although there is clearly less opportunity for choice in the more isolated locations. Although the Agency does try to meet Special Education Needs in its schools, it is not always possible to accommodate children with certain, more specialised needs especially in those areas lacking appropriate inter-agency support.
<P>

<a name="90630w01.htm_para5">We have also taken action, through the Families Task Force, to ensure that local education authorities are sensitive to the position of Service children returning from abroad. There is now specific guidance on this point in the DfEE Code of Practice on Schools Admission Policy.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90630w01.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 No decisions have been made on the form of a PPP for DERA. However, regardless of the precise form of PPP, the Government would wish to ensure that it had rights to retain access to any strategic capabilities for use only in extreme circumstances, such as bankruptcy.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will make a statement on the level of co- operation with Russia over year 2000 compliance.  [87654]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90630w01.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 MOD officials took part in discussions with Russia on the Millennium compliance problem under the auspices of the NATO-Russia Permanent Joint Council prior to the commencement of the air campaign in the Balkans, when Russia suspended formal co- operation on defence issues. In April, a technical expert from the MOD attended a G8 Y2K meeting in Moscow. The possibility of trilateral talks between the UK, the US and Russia is being pursued.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will list <i>(a)</i> the number of personnel currently working in the United States under the auspices of the 1958 Mutual Defence Agreement, <i>(b)</i> which US facility they are working in and <i>(c)</i> their purpose for being there.  [88136]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90630w01.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 There are four UK officials serving in the US under the auspices of the 1958 Mutual Defence Agreement (MDA). All are located in the British Embassy, Washington, DC. Their duties are to facilitate the conduct of bilateral business within the provisions of the MDA. In addition, there are three staff seconded from AWE Aldermaston to the US to assist with the technical development of facilities of mutual interest. Currently, two are stationed at the Los Alamos National Laboratory and one at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90630w01.htm_spnew6"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 During the period 1 June 1998 to 31 May 1999, a total of 235 visits to the US, involving one or more individuals, took place under the auspices of the 1958 UK/US Mutual Defence Agreement.

<P>
<a name="90630w01.htm_spnew7"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 Two Exchanges of Information by Visit and Report, EIVRs, have occurred within the last five years. One, on the subject of Test Monitoring, was generated in 1997 and first met in 1998.

 <i>[holding answer 24 June 1999]:</i> Now that KFOR troops have deployed into Kosovo, a fuller assessment of the damage inflicted on Yugoslav forces is under way. This will take some time to complete. But the measure of the campaign's success lies in the fact that it resulted in the withdrawal of Milosevic's troops from Kosovo, the entry of KFOR and the return of the refugees.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90630w02.htm_wqn3"><B> Mr. Dalyell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence, pursuant to the letter of 3 October 1998, D/MIN/(DP)(TG)/3521/98M, on atmospheric pollution, what collaborative research and development programmes aimed at identifying further alternatives to ozone- depleting substances in the applications where they are still necessary have been carried out in the last nine months; and what reduction has taken place in controlled substances where acceptable alternatives are available.  [87386]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90630w02.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Spellar </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 29 June 1999]:</i> In my response to the hon. Member's earlier question on this subject on 18 January 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, columns <i>312-13</i>, I reported on the continuing progress made by the MOD in reducing its use of ozone depleting substances.
<P>

<a name="90630w02.htm_para0">Since the beginning of the year, a number of CFC and halon systems have been converted to alternative substances. The Royal Navy has completed the conversion or replacement of refrigeration plant on HMS Fearless, HMS Illustrious, HMS Leeds Castle, HMS Sultan, HMS Lancaster and RFA Black Rover. Modification kits have been procured for conversion of refrigeration plants on HMS Spartan, HMS Torbay and HMS Trenchant, and for a chilled water plant on HMS Spartan. Installation of a new chilled water plant has started on HMS Torbay. Action has been taken to procure the kits for conversion of 



<P>
<P><I>30 Jun 1999 : Column: 161</I><P>
refrigeration plants on the Type 23 frigates. The Army has completed trials of alternatives to halon fire extinguishants for use in in-service armoured vehicle engine compartments and an acceptable fire extinguishant has been identified. A programme of work to convert these systems is now being drawn up. Work to convert CFC environment cooling systems in armoured vehicles has also started. The Defence Procurement Agency has completed the majority of its trials of alternative refrigerants in equipment for which it is responsible and the final report on the conversion of the Challenger 2 engine fire protection systems is expected during July. The Royal Air Force has completed the conversion of refrigerators on all but two of the E3 Sentry aircraft; these remaining aircraft will be modified as soon as operational commitments allow. In a number of cases, equipment that used ozone-depleting substances has been decommissioned as surplus to requirements. At DERA Chertsey, for example, this has reduced the installed quantity of CFC refrigerants by approximately 230 tonnes.
<P>

<a name="90630w02.htm_para1">The use of CFC refrigerants will be necessary until conversion programmes can be completed or, where conversion is not technically and economically feasible, until equipment is removed from service. For halon systems which protect, amongst others, existing aircraft, ship machinery spaces and armoured vehicle crew compartments, acceptable alternatives have not been identified, despite considerable international effort. The MOD Corporate Research Programme is funding a study by DERA into alternative fire extinguishants for use in normally occupied enclosed spaces. The study has identified two classes of material with promising fire extinguishing properties. These are the tropodegradable bromoalkenes and a range of phosphorus-containing compounds. The aim is to identify one or more chemicals with good performance and acceptable toxicological and environmental characteristics. This work is being undertaken in close collaboration with the US Advanced Agent Working Group and the US Department of Defence's Next Generation Fire Suppression Technology Program. The Royal Navy continues its sponsorship of research into water mist technologies for potential use in fire protection in new warships. The work has demonstrated that low pressure fine water spray systems with certain additives can give a very effective performance and this work will be validated with real-scale tests over the next 18 months. Close contact is being maintained with the US Navy and US Coast Guard who are also developing water-based technologies for use in future ships.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if he will make a statement on the progress of compensation payments to former mineworkers affected by respiratory diseases in <i>(a)</i> Scotland, <i>(b)</i> Wales and <i>(c)</i> each of the English regions; how many claims are still outstanding; and when he expects the process to be completed.  [87584]<P>

<P>
<a name="90630w03.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 As at 17 June 1999, IRISC, the Department's claim handling agent, have received some 71,500 claims from former miners and their dependants. These can be broken down into <i>(a)</i> Scotland--5,500; <i>(b)</i> Wales--20,500; and <i>(c)</i> North West--4,100; North East--7,700; North and West Yorkshire--4,700; South Yorkshire--14,100; East Midlands--10,100; West Midlands--3,400; South--1,200; Overseas--200.
<P>

<a name="90630w03.htm_para0">The contract for a national programme of spirometry testing for all respiratory disease claimants has been awarded to Healthcall Services Ltd. Healthcall have established testing centres in Newport, Cardiff, Swansea, Newcastle, Sheffield, Nottingham, Leeds and Glasgow and will shortly be opening at least 17 more in other coalmining areas. The programme of spirometry will enable us to make further interim payments beyond the &#163;25 million already offered and, in some cases, full and final offers to those who may not wish to pursue their claim further.
<P>

<a name="90630w03.htm_para1">Discussions have taken place with Scottish solicitors and similar handling arrangements to those in England and Wales are close to being agreed to compensate ex-miners in Scotland.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90630w03.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 While we recognise that security of supply is of paramount importance even in open markets, ensuring this is a matter for the Director General of Electricity Supply. The report, which he commissioned, followed the disruption to electricity supplies as a result of gale force winds on 26 December 1998. The report contains a number of recommendations concerning electricity distribution network performance, restoration of supplies, communications with customers and payments to customers under Standards of Performance Regulations.
<P>

<a name="90630w03.htm_para2">Comments on the full list of recommendations, together with suggestions for other areas where further investigation is merited, were invited, and the period for those comments ends on 25 June.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what plans his Department has to assist and co-ordinate efforts by British companies in reconstruction projects in Kosovo and the neighbouring countries.  [88596]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90630w03.htm_spnew8"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 At the Secretary of State's initiative, the Department has already established a joint Government/ private sector Taskforce to promote and co-ordinate the UK's response to the reconstruction arising in Kosovo; its prime objective is to ensure that the UK is co-ordinated to play their role in the rebuilding process. The Taskforce, which has already met twice, is chaired by Nigel Thompson of Ove Arup; the other private sector representatives on the Taskforce are from: AMEC, Mott MacDonald, Kennedy Construction, Taylor Woodrow, Crown Agents, British Consultants Bureau and the Confederation of British Industry.
<P>

<a name="90630w03.htm_para7">All the private sector members of the Taskforce are well aware that they are on it as representatives of the UK business community generally, not their own companies. As all the companies represented on the Taskforce have seats on national or international bodies covering their sector interests, this is second nature to them. These industry bodies are the channels through which the messages from the Taskforce are being disseminated to the business community more generally. Indeed, to reinforce the message that the Taskforce is representing the interests of all UK companies, the minutes of its meetings are circulated freely to all interested parties.

paid by ACT. The percentage of clients receiving benefits other than Retirement Pension and Widows Pension by ACT as at 31 May 1999 was 28 per cent.
<P>

<a name="90630w04.htm_para3">The reason for the difference between the percentage of payments made by ACT and the percentage of clients being paid by ACT is that, in general terms, clients who are paid by ACT receive payments less frequently than those clients paid by order book or girocheque.

 The procedures to be followed when a local authority has an interest in land for which a planning application is made are set out in the Town and Country Planning General Regulations 1992, with guidance contained in DOE Circular 19/92. The general principle 



<P>
<P><I>30 Jun 1999 : Column: 170</I><P>
underlying these Regulations is that local authorities must make planning applications in the same way as any other person applying for planning permission. The proposals must be advertised in the usual manner. However, applications may not be determined by a committee or officer responsible for the management of the land or buildings concerned. If it is intended to approve such a proposal, and it is not in accordance with the provisions of the development plan in force in the area, the application must be notified to the Secretary of State so that he can decide whether it should be "called in" for his own determination.

The latest estimate of the carbon savings from the escalator, published in the consultation document for the UK Climate Change Programme, stated that the escalator between 1996 and 2002 is expected to save 2-5 million tonnes of carbon in 2010. The impact of the escalator on air quality is also kept under review.

 There are no plans to vary existing consents issued in compliance with Part C of Council Directive 90/220/EEC on the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Once a GM crop has Part C (marketing) consent under the Directive it applies across all member states. Individual member states cannot vary a consent unilaterally. Under the new arrangements agreed in the Environment Ministers' Council last December, all new applications for part C consent will have to include plans for post market monitoring. Government and industry, through SCIMAC (Supply Chain Initiative for Modified Agricultural Crops), have a voluntary agreement that for consents already granted or currently under consideration crops will be grown and managed in accordance with the SCIMAC Guidelines which include post-release monitoring.

 There are no planning provisions which apply specifically to a proposed disposal of a graveyard, although a local authority may need a disposal consent in certain circumstances, for example to dispose of the land for less than the best consideration that can reasonably be obtained. A disused burial ground, which is no longer used for human interment, falls within the definition of open space for the purposes of local government and town and country planning powers. A local authority proposing to sell or otherwise dispose of or appropriate open space land must advertise the proposal and consider any objections. The disturbance of

<P>
<a name="90630w06.htm_wqn3"><B> Mr. Burgon: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what progress he has made in developing a waste strategy for England and Wales.  [89296]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90630w06.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 Consultation responses to "Less Waste: More Value" last year were overwhelmingly supportive of the vision set out in that document which we have now developed into a blueprint for a more sustainable, integrated waste management system for England and Wales.
<P>

<a name="90630w06.htm_para1">This blueprint is described in "A Way with Waste: A Draft Waste Strategy for England and Wales" which is published today for further public consultation. "A Way with Waste" makes clear that a step change is needed in the way we think about and manage our waste which applies equally to municipal and industrial waste. We need substantial increases to both recycling and energy recovery if we are to meet the challenges of sustainable development and of the European Directive on the landfilling of waste's stringent targets for diverting waste from landfill.
<P>

<a name="90630w06.htm_para2">We have therefore set two goals by 2010 of recovering 45 per cent. of municipal waste (by recycling, composting and incineration with energy or heat recovery) and of recycling or composting 30 per cent. of household waste. To do this we must meet, as soon as possible, the existing targets of 40 per cent. recovery and 25 per cent. recycling or composting. We aim to do this by 2005. Beyond 2010 we must do more. By 2015 we expect to recover value from two thirds of household waste, half of this by recycling or composting.
<P>

<a name="90630w06.htm_para3">We need to develop stronger markets for recyclate. The Government set up a Market Development Group to look at this and its report and recommendations are published for comment today alongside the draft strategy. Some of its recommendations are for Government and we will be addressing them with vigour, seeking further views as necessary. Some are for other bodies whom the Government calls on to address these proposals with same degree of energy.
<P>

<a name="90630w06.htm_para4">It will of course be for the National Assembly for Wales to decide how to take forward this draft strategy, and the responses to the consultation on it, to produce a final strategy for Wales.

<P>
<a name="90630w06.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Meale: </B> 
 The Urban White Paper will look at ways of improving the quality of life for people in our towns and cities. Urban greening, including the contribution of trees, will be an important part of this.
<P>

<a name="90630w06.htm_para5">The Government already acknowledge the important role of trees in urban regeneration by sponsoring a range of programmes which involve tree planting as part of a wider strategy to improve the urban environment. These include the Community Forest programme, the National Forest and others under the Single Regeneration Budget.

<a name="90630w06.htm_para6">We also support the work of the National Urban Forestry Unit. They have shown that, by using simple, low-cost techniques urban forestry can help to improve the environment in a practical way and make trees a more significant feature of the urban landscape.

 The Central Council of Physical Recreation estimate that there are 150,000 voluntary sports clubs affiliated to the national governing bodies of sport in the United Kingdom. However, we do not hold centrally information on the number of clubs subject to non-domestic rates, their rateable values or their rates bills reflecting discretionary rate relief awarded by local authorities. Therefore, we cannot make a reasonable estimate of the cost of allowing mandatory rate relief to voluntary sports clubs.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90630w09.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 The over-arching aims and objectives for police forces in England and Wales which were published last year include an objective of contributing to improving road safety and the reduction of casualties. That links with the police's aim to promote safety and reduce disorder. The performance measures related to the new duty of best value are likely to include performance measures in relation to this area of policing. These measures are to be agreed following a period of consultation over the summer. The new National Road Safety Strategy and casualty reduction targets for 2010 are being developed by the Department for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (DETR) in close consultation with officials in my Department and with representatives of the Association of Chief Police Officers' Traffic Committee. DETR expect to be able to publish the strategy and targets in the autumn.

<P>

<a name="90630w09.htm_para2">However, I have set up some focus groups with young offenders to discuss in more general terms their backgrounds, experience of the criminal justice system, their perceptions of custody and their plans for the future.

 <i>[holding answer 29 June 1999]:</i> Courts are required by law to inquire into the financial circumstances of a convicted offender before fixing the amount of any fine. Means assessments are also currently carried out in criminal cases before the grant of legal aid.
<P>

<a name="90630w09.htm_para3">A case is pending before the European Court of Human Rights questioning the role of the Justices' Clerk in conducting means inquiries in magistrates courts. Once the outcome of the case is known the Government will consider what action, if any, needs to be taken.
<P>

<a name="90630w09.htm_para4">The Access to Justice Bill includes a proposal to transfer from the Justices' Clerk to the Justices' Chief Executive the administrative responsibility for collecting fines. The Bill also proposes the abolition of means assessments before the granting of legal aid and the introduction of a power at the end of a case for the higher courts to order defendants to meet some or all of the defence costs. There will be power to assess the defendant's means before any such order is made.
<P>

<a name="90630w09.htm_para5">The Government have no other plans to review court procedures in this area.

<P>
<a name="90630w09.htm_spnew7"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The Police Information Technology Organisation (PITO), a Home Office Non-Departmental Public Body, is managing the Public Safety Radio Communications Project (PSRCP). This is a major Public Private Partnership project designed to replace the police service's existing radio communications systems with a modern national infrastructure delivered under a service provision contract. The Service Provider will design, build, fund and own the infrastructure and individual police forces will contract to take a range of core (mandatory) and menu (optional) services for anticipated contract periods of 15 years.
<P>

<a name="90630w09.htm_para6">A Project Definition Study has been completed and negotiations on price and contractual terms are now in progress with British Telecommunications as the candidate Service Provider. The Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) and the Association of Police Authorities (APA) are being kept fully briefed of progress. When negotiations are concluded, a formal business case will shortly be put to Ministers, ACPO and the APA, for a decision on its acceptance.
<P>

<a name="90630w09.htm_para7">Over the next three years the police service will receive an additional &#163;1.24 billion in central government funding. It is a matter for each police authority to set their budget and for each chief constable to determine how to use the resources that are available. The scope for additional funding for PSRCP is under consideration.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90630w09.htm_spnew8"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 The Prison and Probation Services work closely together to help prisoners released on licence to maintain or secure appropriate accommodation. For prisoners not subject to statutory supervision there are a number of sources of advice and guidance. These include prison officers trained by "National Association for Care and Resettlement of Offenders", accommodation specialists from the probation service and independent organisations.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what his Department has done to identify debt problems affecting prisoners that could increase the likelihood of an individual re-offending, if not dealt with before the prisoner's release.  [88672]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90630w09.htm_spnew9"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 It is recognised that financial considerations can be related to the risk of re-offending in some cases. While no specific programme is in place to identify problems of debt, it is a factor which is taken into account in wider assessments for sentence planning and in the provision of advice and information.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90630w09.htm_wqn10"><B> Lorna Fitzsimons: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what work is being done in the Prison Service to ensure that a resettlement service is provided for each prisoner.  [88673]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90630w09.htm_spnew10"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 Adult prisoners with six months or more to serve and young offenders serving one month or more are subject to a system of sentence planning to determine what can be done during their time in custody and on licence to contribute to successful release. The Prison Service invests annually in the "National Association for the Care and Resettlement of Offenders" prison link unit, providing &#163;226,000 for 1999-2000, to train prison officers to provide advice and information on resettlement issues, and for specially trained staff to provide pre-release courses.
<P>

<a name="90630w09.htm_para8">Individual prisons liaise with probation services and other statutory and independent organisations, to provide resettlement services appropriate to local circumstances.
<P>

<a name="90630w09.htm_para9">The Government have also invested nearly &#163;3.5 million in piloting Welfare to Work in 11 prison establishments. In the 12 months the pilot has been in operation, over 2,500 young prisoners have joined, and over 1,700 have completed, the programme.
<P>

<a name="90630w09.htm_para10">However, the Government recognise that there may be a particular difficulty in providing effective resettlement advice and support for prisoners serving sentences of less than a year. Under the Crime Reduction Programme, pilots are therefore to be established in seven areas to test out and evaluate new ways of meeting the resettlement needs of short term prisoners.

 Information as to whether firearms used in crime are legally or illegally held is not published in the annual Criminal Statistics because, although the police are asked for this information, in practice they are only able to provide it in some six per cent. of cases.

 Payments under options A and B of the compensation schemes for large and small-calibre handguns have been made in an average of 21 weeks, and in an average of 63 weeks under option C of the schemes. A total of &#163;60.3 million has been paid in compensation to individual firearm certificate holders. The administration costs of the compensation scheme total &#163;4.6 million. In addition, a total of &#163;3.8 million was provided to police forces in England, Wales and Scotland to help meet their costs in handling the surrender exercise.
<P>

<a name="90630w10.htm_para1">A total of 19,183 small-calibre pistols were surrendered to the police in England, Wales and Scotland during February 1998 following the passage of the Firearms (Amendment) (No 2) Act 1997. This is in addition to the 26,371 small-calibre pistols surrendered voluntarily under the Government's ex gratia payment scheme, which began in July 1997. Information on the number of persons charged for failing to surrender or otherwise lawfully dispose of .22 pistols was not collected centrally.

 The exemption was considered necessary to avoid the possibility of compromising future legal proceedings by giving a right of access to such information. The Bill as drafted requires the authority holding information falling within this class to consider disclosing it, pursuant to clause 14, in the exercise of any discretion it may have to do so. Our view was that it was appropriate to place responsibility for considering the disclosure of such information on the authority concerned.
<P>

<a name="90630w10.htm_para2">When I appeared before the Select Committee on Public Administration on 22 June 1999, I accepted that there were arguments in favour of extending rights in this area and I undertook to reconsider the scope of this exemption.

This policy will continue to apply to the work of the Article 36 Committee.

 It is vital that the people who work in the City are allowed to go about their business without fear of harassment or intimidation.

The Police Scientific Development Branch (PSDB) are not conducting any research into PAVA at present. Discussions have been held with Hertfordshire Constabulary to assess the research they have carried out to date and to assess what still needs to be done before PAVA could be considered for use in the United Kingdom. No decision has yet been taken on the future involvement of PSDB in any further research.

 The two specific recommendations cited from Pieda's report to the Scottish Office have not been adopted as targets. The Government have, however, allocated &#163;3 million a year to bring vacant and derelict land in Glasgow up to a standard suitable for housing. In addition remediation of contaminated land will be addressed by Part IIA of the Environmental Protection Act 1990, which it is planned will be brought into force by the end of 1999. A number of National Planning Policy Guidelines also make clear to planning authorities that priority should be given to the re-use of vacant and derelict land. The information in the Scottish Vacant and Derelict Land Survey has been improved to record the development potential of sites and to enable planning authorities to prioritise sites for re-use.

 Sport can play a major role in ridding society of racism, especially given the positive influence it can have on young people. It is an issue which impacts on all sports and must be tackled by them.
<P>

<a name="90630w12.htm_para2">Sport England, in conjunction with the Commission for Racial Equality (CRE), has established a Racial Equality Advisory Group to work with all sports national governing bodies to encourage racial equality in sport. The group meets on a regular basis and comprises representatives from a variety of agencies. The Group examines issues relating to ethnic minorities in sport, and advises Sport England to ensure that its policies offer equal opportunities to all people, irrespective of their ethnic background.
<P>

<a name="90630w12.htm_para3">Furthermore, all recipients of grant-in-aid must agree to have all facilities, courses and events open to the whole community. Similar criteria are also used in assessing applications for grants from the Lottery Sports Fund.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90630w13.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Banks: </B> 
 The proposals for a national register of Recreational Land were originally put forward during the preparation of The Playing Pitch Strategy by the GB Sports Council, the National Playing Fields Association and the Central Council for Physical Recreation in 1989. The objectives of the Register from the outset were to monitor change in the recreational land resource; to assist in policy development at the local and national level; and to provide information to the public. An independent evaluation of the Register 1994 found a number of shortcomings with the data. These shortcomings were due to a number of factors, including the voluntary nature of the project, with owners and managers of sites under no obligation to provide data, and many refusing to co-operate.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90630w13.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Banks: </B> 
 Sport England is the statutory distributor of Lottery funding for sport in England. It dispenses these funds according to its own published criteria within a general policy framework agreed with the Government. The Council takes individual funding decisions based on a number of principles independently of Government.
<P>

<a name="90630w13.htm_para1">Sport England has established stringent assessment criteria for applicants in which priority is given to those projects which demonstrate a commitment to increasing active sporting participation within the community, particularly those members of the community who may previously have been under-represented, for example, people with disabilities, women and junior participants. Projects that demonstrate a well thought out, structured programme for achieving this and those which expand the choice of sports available to the community are more likely to receive support. Sport England reaches its award decisions after a thorough appraisal of the many different aspects of each proposal. These criteria are fully explained in an application pack that is made available to all potential applicants to the Sport England Lottery Fund. Copies of the pack have been placed in the Libraries of the House.

 Any decision to include the National Playing Field Association as a statutory consultee on playing fields development is one for my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions. We have already introduced a number of measures to protect playing fields which require local education authorities, schools and developers to consider carefully the needs of school children and local communities for whom playing fields are a vital resource.

 We have received a number of representations from the tourism and hospitality industry on the national minimum wage, including some from the activity holiday sector, which we have passed on to the Department of Trade and Industry. The industry had good and productive discussions during 1998-99 with the independent Low Pay Commission and the Government subsequently set the National Minimum Wage at the sensible level recommended by the Commission.
<P>

<a name="90630w13.htm_para3">The Government have asked the Low Pay Commission to monitor and evaluate the impact of the introduction of the national minimum wage. The Commission will welcome views from tourism and hospitality operators on the impact the new legislation is having in practice.

 When Incapacity Benefit was introduced, transitional arrangements allowed those already in receipt of Invalidity Benefit to continue to receive their previous rate of benefit. This is standard procedure following a major change in Social Security legislation.

1. Age ranges provided in the tables do not exactly match those requested as these had missing ranges and overlapping boundaries. In addition, sample sizes for the highest age range are too small to support reliable estimates of the statistics in question. Therefore, age ranges which are as close as possible to those requested have been used.<P>

2. The estimates are based on sample counts that have been adjusted for non-response using multi-purpose grossing factors that control for region, Council Tax Band and a number of demographic variables. Estimates are subject to sampling error and to variability in non-response.<P>

<a name="90630w14.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Bayley: </B> 
 In line with recommendations from the Social Security Select Committee, we have discussed with the Disability Benefits Forum the possibility of developing alternatives to the current tests for entitlement to Disability Living Allowance and Attendance Allowance, and it was agreed that further work should be undertaken. We are now exploring the possibility of using a set of activities undertaken by disabled people in managing their lives (AMLs) as a means of assessing need; work on this is being carried out by an AMLs Working Group which includes representatives from disability organisations in its membership.
<P>

<a name="90630w14.htm_para1">The Working Group is currently in the process of carrying out initial testing of models based on AMLs, and progress was discussed with the Working Group on 25 June 1999. It was agreed that testing and analysis of the results should continue; it is, however, too early to say if it will be possible to produce an AMLs system which represents a significant and worthwhile improvement on the present methods of assessing entitlement to the benefits.

To ask the Secretary of State for Wales what estimate he has made of the cost of introducing a scheme to provide financial assistance for people who contracted hepatitis C through their haemophilia treatment; over how many years the scheme would last; and how many people would be eligible for such assistance.  [89035]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90630w16.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Jon Owen Jones: </B> 
 In Wales, we believe there about 105 haemophiliacs who have been infected with hepatitis C through NHS treatment. We estimate that the cost for a special payment scheme for haemophiliacs would be in the region of &#163;7m-&#163;8m based on UK estimates.
<P>

<a name="90630w16.htm_para1">Government policy remains that those infected with hepatitis C through NHS treatment should not receive special payments, as the same considerations would apply to patients infected with another illness or otherwise harmed as a result of medical or surgical procedure not resulting from negligence.

 It continues to be Government policy that compensation or other financial help to particular patients or groups of patients is paid only where the NHS or individuals working in it have been at fault. We are aware of compensation schemes in other countries, but these relate to the specific policy and operational circumstances in those countries and a direct comparison would not be appropriate.

<a name="90630w16.htm_spnew6"><B> Mr. Jon Owen Jones: </B> 
 The new clinical governance agenda gives local health groups an important role to play in encouraging and supporting quality improvement projects. This therefore provides a mechanism for the dental profession to have equal access to funding for dental audit projects. Applications from the primary health care sector, including dentists, will be assessed by the relevant local health group, all of whom have an elected dental member. Funding will be made available on the basis of the merits of the application/business case submitted.

 Soon after the Lord Chancellor was appointed to that office in May 1997, it became apparent to him that the then First Treasury Counsel (Common Law) should be recommended to Her Majesty for appointment as a puisne judge of the High Court. He informed the Attorney-General that this appointment would be offered. The Attorney-General and the then Solicitor-General consulted widely as to who should be appointed to the post of First Treasury Counsel, and the Lord Chancellor was among those who were consulted. Once the Attorney-General had decided who should be appointed, his Department had correspondence with the Lord Chancellor's Department to synchronise the announcement of the two appointments.

To ask the Prime Minister if he will make a statement regarding the giving of advice by the First Minister to Her Majesty on the exercise of her functions in connection with the implementation of the Scotland Act 1998.  [89358]
<P>
<UL><P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90630w17.htm_spmin0"><B>The Prime Minister:</B> 
 In a number of situations advice is by convention, given by a Minister of the Crown to Her Majesty in respect of the exercise of her functions. The majority of Her Majesty's functions in respect of which she receives advice from a Minister of the Crown in this way relate to the making of appointments and the use of the Royal prerogative.
<P>

<a name="90630w17.htm_para2">As a consequence of the new constitutional arrangements under the Scotland Act 1998, it is proposed that in some of those situations the First Minister instead of a Minister of the Crown will give advice, by convention, to Her Majesty after 1 July in respect of her functions. No formal order is required to give effect to these transfers, which will be carried out by administrative arrangement. In this context "Her Majesty's functions" refer to her statutory functions and cases where Her Majesty acts under her prerogative or common law powers. It concerns only those functions of Her Majesty which she exercises personally and not those which are exercised on her behalf by a Minister of the Crown. It deals only with circumstances in which a Minister of the Crown provides advice to Her Majesty by convention and it does not deal with circumstances in which a Minister of the Crown exercises a statutory function of advising Her Majesty. Where appropriate, provision has been made in the Scotland Act, or in subordinate legislation under the Scotland Act, to transfer these statutory advice-giving functions from the Minister of the Crown to the First Minister.
<P>

<a name="90630w17.htm_para3">In cases where Her Majesty exercises a function which is exercisable within devolved competence for the purposes of the Scotland Act 1998 and she is, by convention, advised by a Minister of the Crown about the exercise of that function, then after 1 July she will be advised by the First Minister instead of by a Minister of the Crown.
<P>

<a name="90630w17.htm_para4">For example, Her Majesty exercises the Royal prerogative of mercy and appoints regius professors of the ancient Scottish universities in this way. A list of further examples of circumstances in which Her Majesty will in future be advised by the First Minister instead of by the Secretary of State in relation to the exercise of her functions which relate in whole or in part to a devolved matter has been placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="90630w17.htm_para5">There are some matters in respect of which the Prime Minister gives advice to Her Majesty on the exercise of her functions and on which it would be appropriate for the Prime Minister to consult or to take advice from the First Minister. These matters include recommendations of Scottish candidates for honours and dignities, which are a 



<P>
<P><I>30 Jun 1999 : Column: 216</I><P>
reserved matter, and advice on the appointment of Lords Lieutenants in Scotland, the Lord High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland and members of the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution and the Forestry Commission. There are also matters where a Minister of the Crown gives advice to Her Majesty and where it also would be appropriate for the First Minister to be consulted by or to give advice to that Minister of the Crown.
<P>

<a name="90630w17.htm_para6">The Scotland Act 1998 confers upon the First Minister various functions of advising Her Majesty either directly or through the Prime Minister. This includes seeking Her Majesty's approval to the appointment of Scottish Ministers and recommending to Her Majesty persons for appointment as Scottish Law Officers. Section 95 of the Act sets out in detail the arrangements for the First Minister to nominate persons for appointment as Lord President of the Court of Session and Lord Justice Clerk to the Prime Minister, who in turn makes recommendations on those appointments to Her Majesty. It also provides for the First Minister to recommend to Her Majesty the appointment of other judges.
<P>

<a name="90630w17.htm_para7">In a number of other situations, Her Majesty is advised in relation to the exercise of her functions by the Privy Council rather than by a Minister of the Crown. The Privy Council deals with various items of Scottish business, both prerogative business and statutory matters, such as the grant of Royal Charters and Privy Council appointments. I have placed a paper in the Libraries of both Houses that briefly describes the circumstances in which the First Minister will, from 1 July, contribute to Privy Council business in the same manner as the Secretary of State for Scotland has done.

 The net impact of the climate change levy and the associated reduction in the main rate of employers' National Insurance Contributions on the Department for Education and Employment will depend on the rates of climate change levy. The final rates of climate change levy will not be set until the Finance Bill 2000.

 It is the role of the teacher to assess which children are working within Level 6 in a subject and therefore which pupils should be entered for both the Levels 3-5 tests and the Level 6 extension test. Level 6 is awarded in a subject only when a child has attained a Level 5 on the main Levels 3-5 National Curriculum tests in addition to achieving sufficient marks on the extension test.
<P>

<a name="90630w19.htm_para1">The Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA) is currently reviewing National Curriculum extension tests and is taking full account of the recommendations in the recent Select Committee Report on Highly Able Children.

 HM Customs and Excise produced standard explanatory material on Budget Day when the VAT (Finance) Order 1999 was announced. Immediately following this they undertook detailed explanatory meetings with trade representatives and advisers. Customs have sent a draft of a more detailed guidance note to a number of trade representatives for comment. They aim to publish this by mid July.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will review with Customs and Excise how they propose to handle judgments of VAT tribunals where both the financial sector and Customs and Excise have agreed beforehand to treat such judgments as test cases; and if he will make a statement.  [88923]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90630w20.htm_spnew11"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 The care and management of VAT, including the conduct of litigation, is the statutory responsibility of the Commissioners of Customs and Excise. They did not agree to treat as a "test" case any recent or current case concerning financial services.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer, pursuant to Her Majesty's Customs and Excise Information Sheet (June 1999) regarding excise duty and VAT arrangements following the withdrawal of duty free sales of goods to intra-Community travellers, what is the VAT liability on goods liable to UK VAT in the domestic market purchased on a flight from London to New York which is subsequently diverted to Paris <i>(a)</i> when the passengers are permitted to disembark at Paris to join a new flight to New York and <i>(b)</i> when passengers remain on the same aircraft until it is able to continue to New York.  [88918]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90630w21.htm_spnew2"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 The withdrawal of duty free sales of goods with effect from 1 July only affects travellers on intra-Community journeys. Passengers travelling outside the EU will continue to be able to purchase duty free goods. Diversion of an international flight via another Community airport would not affect the VAT relief of sales to passengers on that flight. In such circumstances passengers, and any duty free goods that they had purchased, would be subject to the usual arrangements whereby they would remain within a Customs controlled area pending their onward flight.

 I have today laid before Parliament the Statement on the 1999 Community Budget, entitled "European Community Finances". This White Paper is the nineteenth in the series. As in the past, it covers annual budgetary matters and includes details of recent developments in European Community financial management and in countering fraud against the Community Budget. It also describes the Community Budget for 1999 as adopted by the European Parliament, and the United Kingdom's gross and net contributions to the Community Budget between 1996 and 1999.

Samples sizes for the highest age group are also too small to support reliable estimates of the statistics in question. Other age ranges provided in the tables do not exactly match those requested as these had missing ranges and overlapping boundaries. Therefore, age ranges which are as close as possible to those requested have been used.<P>

2. The estimates are based on sample counts that have been adjusted for non-response using multi-purpose grossing factors that control for region, Council Tax Band and a number of demographic variables. Estimates are subject to sampling error and to variability in non-response.<P>

 No information on which to base an estimate is available from Inland Revenue's records. Tax offices will generally be aware of cases where tax has been overpaid only when tax returns are sent in, or when claims are made for the repayment of tax deducted at source.
