<i> [holding answer 15 March 2011]:</i> The proposed undertakings in lieu would be given to me as the Secretary of State and under the relevant statutory framework I have power to enforce them. Under the undertakings, the directors of Sky News (of which a majority are independent, including the Chairman), are responsible for ensuring the independence of Sky News. The requirement is embedded in the constitution of the new company, which of course the directors must uphold in accordance with their duties under company law. Transparency of Sky News' independence is secured by the undertakings' requiring that the editorial committee report on it in the annual report.</p>

I would carefully consider it taking into account all relevant considerations at the time. If Sky News were to be sold to any other media enterprise, or anyone with other interest in the media were to purchase Sky News shares, this could potentially trigger another public interest intervention.</p>

We received over 200 emails, in addition to the contributions we received on the Cabinet Office's 'Your Freedom' website and the Department's own 'Cut Red Tape' website. These contributions, together with those gained from a variety of events we hosted and attended with organisations and representative bodies, informed the ongoing programme of work to review the Building Regulations that was announced on 16 December 2010, <i> Official Report</i>, columns 114-15WS.

 The analysis of the Ministry of Defence (MOD)'s estates and basing requirements goes far beyond a "RAF basing review". The MOD is currently undertaking a comprehensive review of the estates and basing implications of the conclusions of the Strategic Defence and Security Review and the comprehensive spending review. This does include the consequences of the changes to the RAF's force structure, but also includes the basing, accommodation and training requirements in the UK of units returning from Germany; changes to the structure of the Army; reductions in the overall numbers of service personnel and MOD civil servants; and the requirement to achieve efficiencies from better use of the Defence estate.

 As we set out in the Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR) White Paper (CM 7948) we plan to replace the Army's four regional divisional headquarters with a single UK support command and to close at least two of the Army's 10 regional brigade headquarters, thereby enhancing our focus on front-line capabilities. Detailed planning is currently being undertaken to examine how best to take the SDSR direction forward, taking account of work ongoing across all three services on future basing requirements.

which the policy is implemented. This has yet to be finalised. The MOD can, however, provide details of expected savings in personnel costs. The latest estimate (January 2011) is that the saving to the Defence budget from repatriation would be approximately £5.5 million per unit (approx 600 personnel) per annum-so approximately £183 million per annum once all 20,000 personnel have been returned to the UK. This figure includes allowances, travel and subsistence and posting costs (approximately £2.3 million per unit per annum) and approximately £3.2 million per unit per annum in health care and education costs, because Defence is the sole provider for British soldiers and their dependants when posted in Germany.

 We remain deeply concerned by the regime's continued refusal to engage in dialogue with Aung San Suu Kyi and other democratic opposition and ethnic groups. The Government does not believe that the near completion of the regime's roadmap process represents progress. The regime is clearly intent on maintaining power. This is shown by the continued imprisonment of over 2000 prisoners of conscience, the deeply flawed constitution, manipulation of the electoral process, the rejection of the National League for Democracy's appeal against dissolution, and highly restrictive controls on freedom of expression. Human rights abuses also continue unabated, with ongoing arbitrary arrests and persistent corruption. Many civilians, particularly in ethnic areas, face regular threats of persecution, injustice and violence. We strongly urge the junta to work with the UN and all of Burma's political groups towards national reconciliation and a just political settlement.</p>

 Prime Minister Abhisit made clear his intention to call a general election in June. However, tensions between the anti-government and nationalist groups continue. Whilst there have been no serious outbreaks of violence since the unrest of March-May 2010, demonstrations by both anti-government (Red Shirt) and nationalist (Yellow Shirt) groups continue in central Bangkok. The Red Shirts continue to demonstrate twice a month to mark the violent incidents that took place in April and May last year. Since January this year, the "Yellow Shirt" People's Alliance for Democracy (PAD) and the Thai Patriot Network have been demonstrating outside Government House over the government's handling of the ongoing Thai/Cambodia border dispute.

2. The preferred statistics on benefits are now derived from 100% data sources. However, the 5% sample data still provide some detail not yet available from the 100% data sources, in particular, more complete information on the disabling condition of DLA claimants. DWP recommends that, where the detail is only available on the 5% sample data, or disabling condition (DLA) is required, the proportions derived should be scaled up to the overall 100% total for the benefit. This has been done for this request.<br>

3. The figure for DLA appeals in the table is the total number of DLA appeals decided and not just appeals against the disallowance of a new claim.

DWP recommends that, where the detail is only available on the 5% sample data, or disabling condition (DLA) is required, the proportions derived should be scaled up to the overall 100% total for the benefit. This has been done here.<br>
3. Caseload totals show the number of people in receipt of DLA , and exclude people with entitlement where the payment has been suspended, for example if they are in hospital.<br>

 Calculations were based on the amounts of local authority central services equivalent grant (LACSEG), which are currently paid to academies that have converted from a maintained school. There are two elements to the grant: the proportion which the Department funds from the Dedicated Schools Grant that would otherwise go to local authority schools budgets, and the proportion that the Department funds from other sources, because it is in respect of services normally paid from other local authority funds. For the latter, on the basis of local authorities' financial statements provided to the Department under section 251 of the Apprenticeships Schools Children and Learning Act 2009, we estimated an average amount per pupil across all local authorities, and applied that to estimates of the number of pupils in new academies and free schools opening over the next two years. The resultant amounts were then reduced by the Department for Communities and Local Government to reflect overall reductions in local authorities' formula grant. The top slice totals are £148 million in 2011-12 and £265 million in 2012-13, and these are the amounts to be transferred to the Department to contribute to LACSEG costs.</p>

There has been no separate consultation with others. On 25 February 2011 we announced that a new book gifting scheme would be delivered in 2011-13. Booktrust will receive £7.5 million for its delivery in 2011-12 and £6 million for its delivery in 2012-13.</p>

 We know that communicating clearly is essential to good government. We have always worked hard to try to remove jargon and we continue to make sure that staff at all levels treat this as an important issue. Consequently we provide regular training.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_596"><a name="110316w0004.htm_para50"><a name="1103171001378">For example, to promote plain English in departmental communications, we have produced a "Style Guide"-an internal tool containing advice on using plain English, writing for the web and A-Z of house style. We also regularly run writing workshops for our staff that focus on writing in plain English, making sure communications are tailored to the audience and are written in an appropriate tone of voice. This is an ongoing programme of work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_597"><a name="110316w0004.htm_para51"><a name="1103171001379">Our internal communications to staff are jargon-free, to help promote good practice. We have also featured a series of articles in our staff magazine on the importance of good writing skills and some tips on how to keep communications free from jargon and written in plain English. Each item of correspondence from young people 18 or under receives a reply from a Minister and we ensure that each reply is suitably tailored to suit the recipient's understanding.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_598"><a name="110316w0004.htm_para52"><a name="1103171001380">To support the Department's work on reducing bureaucracy, we are also developing a programme to improve the quality, format, and clarity of our communications to schools and other frontline groups. This includes improvements to statutory guidance, consultations, and online content. We also regularly test the content and tone of communications with groups of frontline staff before they are issued, so that we know that they make sense to heads, teachers and others.</p>

 All of the funding streams specified above will have ended by the end of March 2011 and are replaced by the Early Intervention Grant. The Early Intervention Grant is a new un-ring-fenced and un-hypothecated funding stream that gives local authorities greater flexibility to target resources strategically and intervene early to improve outcomes for children, young people and families. This is a major reform and gives local authorities greater freedom to respond to local needs and target resources where they will have the greatest impact.

 The Government are committed to making regulation and inspection less burdensome and more proportionate to risk. Out of school clubs provided by maintained schools are within scope for inspection by Ofsted as part of routine school inspection. For those out of school clubs run by other providers that register with Ofsted, there is a briefer inspection arrangement.</p>

As well as general safeguarding risks, there is clearly the potential in environments outside of school for children to be influenced by extreme views which are counter to democratic values and we have started to look in detail at ways to stop children coming into contact with such views alongside partners including Ofsted and the police.</p>

We are currently undertaking a call for evidence and engaging with a range of stakeholders. Officials are also currently analysing international curricula in these subjects.

 We believe that effective general practitioner (GP) commissioning will require the full range of clinical and professional input alongside that of local people. Nurses, allied health professionals (AHPs) and other clinicians all have a vital role to play and a real opportunity to develop services and improve the health outcomes of their local populations. In community services in particular, nurses and AHPs will have a key role in supporting commissioners.</p>

Appropriate structures to ensure nursing engagement are already evolving naturally in the GP pathfinder consortia areas with, for example, clinical cabinets with nurse representation. We believe, however, that the board and consortia should have the freedom and flexibility to decide how best they exercise this duty, rather than rely on rigid prescribed structures.</p>

 The numbers of people who travel overseas for treatment is low. There is very limited information on the current levels of cross-border healthcare in Europe. Assessment is therefore not easy.

1. FAEs: A FAE is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one health care provider. FAEs are counted against the year in which the admission episode finishes. Admissions do not represent the number of inpatients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>
2. Cause code: A supplementary code that indicates the nature of any external cause of injury, poisoning or other adverse effects. Only the first external cause code which is coded within the episode is counted in Hospital Episode Statistics (HES). Codes in italics are those used to define assault. Knife wound: W26 Contact with knife, sword or dagger; X78 Intentional self-harm by sharp object; X99.- Assault by sharp object; Y28.- Contact with sharp object, undetermined intent. These four codes identify any sharp object, and therefore include (but are not limited to) knives.<br>
3. SHA/PCT of residence: The SHA or PCT containing the patient's normal home address. This does not necessarily reflect where the patient was treated as they may have travelled to another SHA/PCT for treatment.<br>
4. NHS Re-organisation: In July 2006, the national health service reorganised SHAs and PCTs in England from 28 SHAs into 10, and from 303 PCTs into 152. As a result data from 2006-07 onwards are not directly comparable with previous years.<br>
5. Data quality: Hospital Episode Statistics HES are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and PCTs in England and from some independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br>
6. Small numbers: To protect patient confidentiality, figures between one and five have been replaced with '*' (an asterisk). Where it was still possible to identify numbers from the total an additional number (the next smallest) has been replaced.<br>
7. Activity included: Activity in English NHS Hospitals and English NHS commissioned activity in the independent sector.<br>

This allows newly born infants with sickle cell disease to receive a definitive diagnosis of their condition, ensuring that prompt and specific treatment can begin immediately. The Department has supported initiatives to improve the management of the condition including, asking National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence to produce a short clinical guideline on the management of a sickle cell crisis in hospital, launching a national registry to identify patients with the condition and monitor care, and funding more NHS posts to increase the number of staff with specific expertise.

cannot provide much detail for security and operational reasons. The trials confirm that denying signals in prisons is not a quick, simple or cheap option.
