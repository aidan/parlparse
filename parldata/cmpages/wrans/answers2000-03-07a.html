<P>
<P>
<a name="00307w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Redwood: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland if he will list the new public bodies established by his Department since May 1997.  [112668]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00307w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The annual Cabinet Office publication, "Public Bodies" provides information on a range of public bodies including those in Northern Ireland. The 1997 edition lists those public bodies in existence prior to May 1997. The 1998 and 1999 editions lists public bodies in existence in subsequent years. Copies of these publications have been placed in the Library of the House. Copies are also available on the Cabinet Office website (www.cabinet-office.gov.uk/quango).

<P>
<P>
<a name="00307w01.html_wqn2"><B> Rev. Martin Smyth: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland if he will make a statement on the process by which the titles of the new departments and the Information Service of the Northern Ireland Executive were decided.  [112788]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00307w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Mandelson: </B> 
 The titles of the Northern Ireland Departments are set in statute in the Departments (Northern Ireland) Order 1999. The Order was made following a statement issued by the First Minister (Designate) and Deputy First Minister (Designate) on 18 December 1998 on structures (including Departmental titles) and functions across the then proposed new Departments. The statement was considered and ratified 



<P>
<P><I>7 Mar 2000 : Column: 560W</I><P>
by the shadow Northern Ireland Assembly in January 1999 and the Departments (Northern Ireland) Order 1999 specifies the Departmental titles agreed at that time.
<P>

<a name="00307w01.html_para0">In relation to the Information Service this was an interim short title designed to distinguish the Information Service of the Executive from that of the Northern Ireland Office. The title would have been subject to consideration by the Executive Committee in the context of proposals for corporate identity and for a communications strategy which were in preparation at the time of suspension.

<P>
<a name="00307w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mrs. Fyfe: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what is the current position on the investigation into the murder of Rosemary Nelson.  [113637]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00307w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 A dedicated team, selected and led by Deputy Chief Constable Colin Port, continues to work tirelessly to track down and bring before the courts those responsible for this cowardly murder. This team, which consists of representatives from 25 policing agencies, including the Royal Ulster Constabulary, has in excess of 60 personnel, 60 per cent. of whom are from outside the RUC. To date they have interviewed more than 5,000 individuals, taken 1,500 statements and established 5,000 lines of investigation in their efforts to catch the killers. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, who has kept in touch with DCC Port, today took the opportunity to meet his team at one of their bases in Lurgan and to hear at first hand about the progress to date in this investigation. The Government are convinced that Mr. Port continues to lead a credible and effective investigation and welcome all the support and co-operation that can be given to the team in its work to solve this appalling crime.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what are the terms and scope of the review to be carried out under Section 2 of the Northern Ireland Act 2000.  [113454]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00307w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Mandelson: </B> 
 Following my decision on 11 February to suspend the operation of the institutions, both Governments will be consulting the political parties in Northern Ireland this week. These consultations are expected to continue during and after St. Patrick's Day following which the two Prime Ministers will review progress. They will focus on how best confidence can be rebuilt to enable the institutions to be restored so that the full implementation of the Agreement can be achieved.

<a name="00307w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 Since the publication of the PAT3 report, the Government have announced the creation of the Phoenix Fund, a &#163;30 million programme to promote better access to business support and finance in deprived communities. This will include an enterprise development fund, help for community finance initiatives, and a network of 1000 volunteer business mentors. The Government have also announced that HM Treasury will have an observer role on the Social Investment Taskforce, established by the UK Social Investment Forum. This Task Force will look at the next steps in devising a strategic framework for social investment, including investment in social enterprises.

<P>
<UL>(2) what recent studies his Department has made of the number of hauliers purchasing fuel from mainland Europe and the Republic of Ireland; and what were the conclusions of the studies.  [112911]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00307w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 HM Customs and Excise has responsibility for excise revenue. There are no current studies or estimates for the numbers of hauliers purchasing fuel from mainland Europe and the Republic of Ireland.

<P>
<P>

<a name="00307w01.html_wqn11"><B> Mr. Gareth R. Thomas: </B> 
To ask the Solicitor-General what training is being provided for Government lawyers to ensure that legislation is prepared to comply with human rights.  [113453]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00307w01.html_spmin0"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 The main responsibility for training rests with individual Departments which are best placed to identify the legal skills and knowledge required by their lawyers and the most economic and effective way of meeting those needs.
<P>

<a name="00307w01.html_para4">Training on the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and the Human Rights Act 1998 (HRA) has been provided, and is continuing to be provided, to all Government lawyers. This has taken the form of Civil Service/GLS wide Conferences (open to both lawyers and administrators) at which outside speakers including Judges and Counsel have spoken; two intensive one-day courses provided last year by the Civil Service College, in conjunction with the GLS, and to be run again this year; and internal training programmes run by individual Departments (but often open to lawyers from other Departments) where speakers have included both specialist Counsel and Government lawyers with ECHR/HRA expertise. In addition, many Government lawyers have attended the external training courses/seminars run, for example, by leading human rights sets of barristers' Chambers. The introductory course for all lawyers new to the GLS also includes a session on human rights.
<P>

<a name="00307w01.html_para5">Such training has meant that Government lawyers are fully equipped, not only to ensure that all new legislation complies with the European Convention on Human Rights, but also to advise their Departments on all human rights issues when they arise in the decision making process or in the context of litigation.

<P>
<a name="00307w02.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Baker: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department for what reason injury awards made to police officers in lieu of earnings remain payable after retirement age.  [112556]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00307w02.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 An injury award is payable as a form of compensation where a police officer becomes permanently disabled for police duty as the result of an injury received in the execution of their duty.
<P>

<a name="00307w02.html_para0">The award compensates an officer for the reduction in their earning capacity. In the wider context, it is considered that earning capacity should be related to a person's main source of livelihood. Therefore, where a police officer has reached retirement age their injury pension will continue to be paid where their opportunity to obtain a larger pension has also been reduced by the injury.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00307w02.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Baker: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what assessment he has made of the police personnel procedure regulations in respect of the provision to allow those suffering from long-term sickness to have their employment terminated.  [112557]<P>

<a name="00307w02.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 There is no provision within Police Regulations for the termination of employment solely on the ground of long-term sickness.

<P>
<a name="00307w02.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The Government keep under review legislation on animals, but have not announced any plans to change it. Existing legislation bears on the range of species and number of animals which can be sold in pet shops.
<P>

<a name="00307w02.html_para3">Pet shops are licensed by local authorities under the Pet Animals Act 1951 (as amended in 1983), and subject to licence conditions to safeguard the health and welfare of the animals in their charge. In considering whether to grant a licence to run a pet shop, a local authority will need to satisfy itself that the welfare of the animals will not be compromised.

 None of the primates were killed by order of the Home Office Inspectorate under the provisions of Section 18(3) of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 on the ground that they were undergoing excessive suffering. All of the decisions to treat or euthanase the animals were made by the relevant named veterinary surgeon.

<a name="00307w02.html_para5">My previous answer explained that the majority of the primates were euthanased once they began to show clinical or biochemical evidence of terminal organ failure or when their clinical condition began to give cause for concern. The aim of this procedure is to prevent unnecessary suffering to the animals.

<a name="00307w02.html_para6">Twenty-nine wild-caught primates were used in xenotransplanation research in 1996; 16 in 1997; three in 1998 and none in 1999.

<a name="00307w02.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The Government recognise the particular concern about the use of dogs in scientific procedures. Under the terms of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, animals may be used only where there are no alternatives and where the benefits of the programme outweigh any suffering caused to the animals concerned. In addition, certain species (including dogs) can be used only where animals of no other species are suitable. Special conditions, tailored to each project, control and minimise any pain or suffering caused.

This was completed in April 1999 and distributed to medical health staff at Harmondsworth. The provision of nursing services at Harmondsworth Detention Centre was also extended to 12 hours each day.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00307w03.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 This matter is kept under close review and representatives of other sports are periodically consulted. Section 166 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 currently makes it an offence for an unauthorised person to sell, or offer or expose for sale, a ticket for a designated football match. The law applies to football because the risk of disorder associated with that sport is increased if ground segregation is undermined by the sale of unauthorised tickets. There is no evidence to suggest that other sports are currently experiencing significant crowd safety and security problems as a result of ticket touting.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, pursuant to his answer to the right hon. Member for Maidstone and The Weald (Miss Widdecombe) of 27 January 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 249W, if he will list, for each category of offence, the specific offences for which those prisoners released to date under the Home Detention Curfew scheme were convicted; what was the <i>(a)</i> average and <i>(b)</i> maximum sentence (i) received and (ii) served for each offence; and if he will make a statement.  [112739]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00307w04.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Boateng </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 2 March 2000]:</i> A further breakdown of the original offences committed by prisoners released under the Home Detention Curfew scheme in 1999 is shown in the table. The data are taken from the Prison Service's inmate information system based on the data recorded by each prison. The maximum sentence for each type of offence, and maximum time served, could be obtained only at disproportionate cost by manually sifting the details of some 15,000 prisoners who were placed on Home Detention Curfew in 1999.
<P>

<a name="00307w04.html_para0">In operating the Home Detention Curfew scheme the Prison Service has an overriding duty to protect the public. No prisoner can be placed on Home Detention Curfew without first passing a risk assessment. Where there is a likelihood of offending while on curfew, or of breaching the curfew, or where the risk to the public is unacceptable, Home Detention Curfew is refused. The effectiveness of the risk assessment is demonstrated by the fact that overall the scheme has an impressive success rate of 95 per cent. of curfewees completing their period of curfew licence.

 <i>[holding answer 3 March 2000]:</i> Schools have a legal obligation to teach IT, both as a curriculum subject in its own right, and across all other subjects. The burden of this teaching role falls largely upon the classroom teacher. In order to provide teachers with the skills to discharge this responsibility, the New Opportunities Fund (NOF) ICT Training programme was developed specifically for teachers in schools, and it aims to give serving teachers the opportunity to raise their pedagogical capability to that now required of newly qualified teachers.

<a name="00307w04.html_para4">The purpose of the Computers for Teachers initiative is to complement that training by raising teacher competence and confidence in their personal use of ICT.

 We are unable to provide the information in the format requested, but can provide data on the overall number of new child care places created through government funding. In 1998-99 some 66,000 new child care places were funded through the Out of School Childcare Initiative, the Further Education Funding Council and DfEE grants to Early Years Development Partnerships. This compares with 22,286 new child care places created by the Out of School Childcare Initiative in 1994-95.

<a name="00307w05.html_para4">Early Years Development and Childcare Partnerships (EYDCPs) are responsible for ensuring full coverage of both urban and rural areas within their areas of remit. EYDCPs have been set up in every local authority area of England. DfEE's planning guidance to Partnerships requires them to pay particular attention to the development and maintenance of provision in rural areas.

 The Government welcome the European Commission's proposal for a directive covering discrimination on the grounds of race (COM (1999) 566) as an important contribution to combating racial discrimination throughout member states and accession countries. The proposal raises a number of issues including those mentioned by the hon. Member in his question and we will be considering the full implications of these during the course of negotiations. Negotiations are still at an early stage within the Working Group of the Social Affairs Council and adoption will require unanimous agreement by the member states.

 I understand from BNFL that MOX fuel was exported from Sellafield to Germany in October 1996. Similar transports to Switzerland were undertaken in November 1995 and August 1997. As regards requests for any fuel to be returned to the UK, the position in respect of Switzerland was set out in my Answer to my hon.

The European Parliament has not proposed a change to this wording, although it has proposed a change to the dates from which it will apply, and the vehicles to which it will apply. Conciliation between the Council and Parliament now seems likely. On this particular issue, the UK will aim to secure flexibility for member states in deciding how best to organise free take-back and recycling.

Turkey needs to expand its generating capacity considerably. We know that they are looking at coal, gas and oil fired stations elsewhere in Turkey and also at nuclear power. It is natural that they should see hydro power--a clean, renewable energy source which does not involve imports--as having a place in meeting this need.

 If a mortgage loan is a regulated agreement under the Consumer Credit Act 1974, the lender cannot charge interest on arrears, when the borrower defaults, at a rate which exceeds the contractual rate of interest. The Act also contains provisions, not restricted to regulated agreements, which enable consumers to apply to the courts to have their credit bargains re-opened if they are extortionate. One of the factors the courts can take into account when considering whether a credit bargain is extortionate is prevailing interest rates at the time the agreement was made. Among other remedies, the court is able to alter the terms of the credit agreement or order the creditor to repay sums paid under the agreement to the borrower.

Tenants can choose how and in what they are involved and this will be set out in the compact with their authority. Our new tenant empowerment grant programme, which I will launch on 31 March also helps tenants to get independent advice on options for involvement, including tenant management if they wish.

 Light rail, and similar rapid transit systems, can have an important role to play in delivering integrated transport in major conurbations. Experience from existing light rail schemes has shown that they can be effective in providing a high quality public transport option in densely used transport corridors and in encouraging motorists to switch from their cars. However, the capital costs of light rail schemes are high compared with bus priority measures and guided bus schemes, which may offer a more cost-effective alternative. Central Government support can be provided to local authorities to fund light rail systems where these bring net benefits which are greater than those offered by the available alternatives; cannot be entirely funded from local sources or by the private sector; provide good value for money and are essential to the achievement of the objectives of the relevant authority's local transport plan.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what appraisals his Department has undertaken of the time that lorries are delayed on congested motorways and trunk roads; if he intends to take action to reduce delays by lorries and other heavy vehicles; and if he will make a statement.  [112705]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00307w11.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 In preparation for our report, "Tackling Congestion and Pollution", published in January, we estimated the total amount of extra journey time (total vehicle hours spent travelling less those which would have been incurred at free flow speeds) resulting from congestion on English roads in 1996. By drawing on this analysis it is possible to estimate the proportion of the total amount of time lost by different kinds of vehicle on a range of road types. Although these techniques are not yet sufficiently well developed to allow a separate estimate to be produced for the trunk road network, estimates can be produced for motorways and A roads as a whole. These estimates suggest that, taken together, motorways and A roads outside urban areas accounted for some 12 per cent. of the total amount of time lost by heavy goods vehicles on English roads in 1996. This estimate includes only time lost due to general congestion and does not allow for time lost due to incidents or road works.
<P>

<a name="00307w11.html_para1">Our integrated transport White Paper set out a package of measures to tackle congestion and pollution, based on concerted action by local authorities, businesses, Government and the general public. We will continue to take this forward, including through the Transport Bill, and our 10-year plan to modernise Britain's transport system (to be published in the summer).

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>was based on the assumption that no other work beyond a simple overlay of porous asphalt would be necessary. I regret that this assumption has proved incorrect in the light of further work.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>A more detailed survey and analysis has ow been completed and has identified the need for additional works if an overlay is to be successfully applied. The existing concrete carriageway, consisting of a series of individual concrete slabs, would need additional work to stabilise it so that small movements in the joints between the slabs did not cause the overlay immediately above the joints to crack. Once cracks form in porous asphalt, the road surface disintegrates very quickly. The overlay would also have to be thicker for the same reason. The extra thickness of the overlay would also make it necessary to raise long lengths of safety fencing to maintain its effectiveness. All this would increase the time taken to complete the work and the costs of the associated traffic management.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Based upon this more detailed work, our estimate for the cost of resurfacing the M25 between junctions 8 and 9 with porous asphalt is around &#163;18 million, with our estimate for applying it between junctions 8 and 10 now being &#163;34 million.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00307w11.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 The new Drinking Water Directive (98/83/EC) tightens the standard for lead in drinking water from its current 50g/to 25g/1 by 25 December 2003 and to 10g/1 by 25 December 2013. Where action is necessary to meet these standards, water companies will first treat water to reduce its ability to dissolve lead from pipes, or will optimise that treatment where it is already in place. Replacement of company lead pipes will be needed where water treatment fails to achieve the standards--mainly soft-water areas. This will become fully apparent only after optimised treatment has been in place for some months. Pipework within the property boundary will remain the responsibility of the property owner. Local authorities have discretionary powers to pay grants to help homeowners to replace lead piping in their properties.

[113522]<P>

<P>
<a name="00307w13.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 The main reasons we included the A1033 Hedon Road Improvement in our programme were to relieve congestion and delays on the main access route to the port of Hull and to assist regeneration. Hence the jobs and prosperity classification for the scheme in "A New Deal for Trunk Roads in England. The New Approach to Appraisal" assessment shows that time savings are the scheme's main benefit, but it will also enhance road safety through improving junction layouts and create a safer environment for pedestrian and cyclists, including provision of a dedicated cycleway.

It shows that employment in sport, including the commercial sector and central and local government, was 368,587 in 1998, an increase of over 20,000 on the 1995 figure, although the expanding employment market generally meant that the sports sector proportion of total employment fell from 1.64 per cent. to 1.59 per cent.

1. The latest information available is for 1997-98 derived from Households Below Average Income (HBAI) data. The 1979-96/7 HBAI publication presents estimates of the income distribution of individuals by ethnic group. A copy of this is in the Library.<P>

2. The definition used of a family is a single adult or a couple, together with any dependent children. A family is defined as ethnic minority if the head of the family is non-White.<P>

3. The HBAI estimates for 1997-98 are taken from the Family Resources Survey and relate to Great Britain. All estimates are subject to sampling error.<P>

4. The figures are presented on household income both Before Housing Costs (BHC) and After Housing Costs (AHC) in line with HBAI conventions. Figures are also provided including and excluding the self-employed reflecting concerns over the accuracy of income information for the self-employed at the bottom of the income distribution. <P>

with US$1 million for helicopter operations. This support allowed the South African Defence Force to continue their essential rescue and relief operations.
<P>

<a name="00307w18.html_para2">We have also mobilised an additional nine helicopters, including four from the RAF, to assist with the rescue and relief effort. To assist with the effective tasking of all helicopters, we have seconded a logistics expert into the World Food Programme. But helicopters are not the total answer. We also deployed 70 boats and specialist trained crews, together with a number of large capacity self- inflating life rafts.
<P>

<a name="00307w18.html_para3">We have also arranged through the Ministry of Defence for the Royal Fleet Auxiliary Fort George to be deployed off Mozambique. The ship will arrive at the end of this week and will provide a further five helicopters to assist in the air relief operations. DFID has already contributed over &#163;7.2 million for rescue and immediate relief including the provision of shelter, water, sanitation and health support. This funding has been channelled through the United Nations Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs, UNICEF, World Food Programme, Red Cross, ActionAid, Oxfam, Save the Children Fund and World Vision. These activities are being co-ordinated with the Mozambican authorities. We stand ready to provide further assistance.

 We will continue to base our decisions during humanitarian emergencies on the needs on the ground; resources available locally and regionally, details of assets available from the Ministry of Defence, their speed of response and operational viability and how they compare to available alternatives. We will always seek to use the UK development assistance budget as effectively as possible in order to maximise the benefit of the budget for people affected by humanitarian emergencies.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00307w18.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Foulkes: </B> 
 The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) is the lead organisation in the Weapons in Exchange for Development pilot programme in Gramsh, Albania, which has recently been extended to the Elbasan and Peshkpja regions. The Council Decision of 17 December 1999 enabled the European Commission's earlier pledge of 500,000 euros to be applied across the extended pilot programme.
<P>

<a name="00307w18.html_para6">The UK has contributed bilaterally to this programme since early 1999 by providing two ammunition technical officers to UNDP to oversee the collection process. We are also funding a feasibility study on the long-term safe disposal of ammunition and ordnance in Albania, the recommendations of which will be passed to NATO, OSCE and other donors.

<a name="00307w19.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Foulkes: </B> 
 I assume the review to which the hon. Member refers concerns a report that DFID commissioned by the National Institute of Social Work in 1998. This report evaluated a programme of child welfare activities in Romania that we supported between 1995 and 1998, undertaken by the European Children's Trust. I will place a copy of the report, which was passed to the Romanian authorities, in the Library of the House. No specific action was necessary as a result of the report, but relevant lessons identified by the report's authors have been taken into account in discussions on further assistance in this field, currently under way with the Romanian Government.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health (1) how he will assess whether a provider of approved indemnity cover for GPs has sufficient reserves to meet its liabilities;  [112413]
<P>
<UL>(2) what criteria will be used to approve providers of indemnity cover for GPs under the Health Act 1999; and what steps he is taking to ensure that the approval procedure does not discriminate between classes of indemnifier;  [112412]
<P>
(3) if the procedure for approving provision of indemnity cover for GPs will ensure that indemnifiers comply with requirements on insolvency margins equivalent to those made under the Insurance Companies Act 1982; and if he will make a statement.  [112414]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00307w19.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 Section 9 of the Health Act 1999 gives the Secretary of State power to require Part II practitioners to hold approved indemnity cover with an approved body. The Secretary of State has power in Regulations to prescribe the circumstances in which such cover shall be required, and the terms for the cover.
<P>

<a name="00307w19.html_para0">This enables the Secretary of State to ensure that cover will be approved only if it is adequate to meet the anticipated level of claims. This will apply both to cover provided by the medical protection organisations and commercial insurers. It is intended that the regulations will ensure through the approval mechanism that cover will still meet claims that arise from events when the clinician was covered but only come to light later, even if 



<P>
<P><I>7 Mar 2000 : Column: 626W</I><P>
this is after the period of cover has ceased. Other criteria are currently the subject of consultation with interested organisations.
<P>

<a name="00307w19.html_para1">The purpose of section 9 is to provide greater protection to patients awarded damages following negligence claims. The approval process will be open and transparent, the intention will be to ensure the highest level of protection reasonably achievable in the current climate.

 The table illustrates that the number of nursing, midwifery and health visiting staff, together with hospital medical staff employed in Worcestershire, has increased during the period 1992 to 1998. While the figures are not directly comparable due to hospital reconfigurations throughout the period, the figures for 1997 and 1998 clearly demonstrate the Government's commitment to continue to increase the number of doctors and nurses working in the National Health Service.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will make a statement on the reasons for the disparity in the allocation of whole-time equivalent health visitors employed by Parkside Community Health Trust between the health authority in Brent and Harrow and the Chelsea and Westminster Health Authority.

<a name="00307w20.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 Decisions about the level of investment in health visiting services are made by health authorities, in discussion with Primary Care Groups and/or Primary Care Trusts and National Health Service trusts, and take account of the identified health needs of the local population. It would, therefore, be misleading to compare the service provided by Parkside Community Health Trust to these two health authorities on the basis of whole time equivalents only. The three Primary Care Groups in Brent are currently developing integrated nursing strategies which will take a broader view of population need and review the current deployment of all nursing and therapy provision, including health visiting.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In an increasingly competitive marketplace, which was subjected to shrinking national defence budgets, only a relatively few nations have a real interest in large second-hand capital equipment and therefore demand was not widespread.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In 1998/99 the DSA operated in a depressed market particularly for major platform sales--this was not only in economic terms as sales opportunities had also been lost because of political events, changing operational requirements and security considerations outside the Agency's control or sphere of influence. Sales targets have traditionally been the major Key Targets of the Agency over the last 5 years. In that time the Agency has surpassed its targets by a 10% margin (&#163;370M as compared to cumulative 5-year target of &#163;335M). In year variances, however, do occur. Estimating sales receipts, based inevitably on limited and shifting information from the three Services, together with the sometimes incomplete conditional state of the surplus equipment when it is declared for sale and set against unknown market conditions is far from an exact science.</FONT></UL>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I am replying to your six questions to the Secretary of State for Defence about the Nimrod MRA4 programme (previously known as the Replacement Maritime Patrol Aircraft). This matter falls within my area of responsibility as Chief of Defence Procurement and Chief Executive of the Defence Procurement Agency.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>You asked about the cost of the Nimrod MRA4 programme. Overall project costs are estimated at &#163;2317M (at 1999/00 prices), a reduction of &#163;92M (on the same price base) on the estimated costs at MoD Approval in August 1996, prior to contract placement in December that year. The reduction is due primarily to the renegotiation of the contract in early 1999, which included changes 



<P>
</UL></FONT><P><I>7 Mar 2000 : Column: 643W</I><P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>in risk assessment and recovery of Liquidated Damages (LD). The additional run-on costs on the existing Nimrod MR2 (up to its currently planned out of service date) consequent on the slippage in delivery of Nimrod MRA4 are offset by the reduction in the cost of operating Nimrod MRA4 over the same period.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>You asked also about the nature of technical and programme factors which led to the slippage of the ISD to 2005. As the Minister made clear when he announced the slippage BAe Operations Ltd. (now known as BAE SYSTEMS) experienced technical difficulties with the development of new information technology toolsets, particularly in the area of design and concurrent engineering, and difficulty in resourcing this complex aircraft project. Additionally, the acquisition of the necessary software tools took longer than anticipated and the company faced particular difficulties in applying new information to the design of the aircraft.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In three of your questions you asked about contract terms and conditions and the differences in the renegotiated contract, in particular penalty clauses and the recovery of Liquidated Damages. It is not practical or meaningful to list all the terms and conditions of the renegotiated contract here. But the main features related to programme timescales which resulted in the slippage of the in-service date (ISD) from April 2003 to March 2005, changes to the contract specification to clear up ambiguities, operationally acceptable reductions in specification and benefits in through life support. The MoD also secured a revised Variation of Price (VOP) formula whereby our commitment to pay inflation over nine years of the contract period is greatly reduced. In addition, we secured BAE SYSTEMS' commitment to integrate the Active Search Sonobuoy System during the main aircraft programme and so deliver an active search capability at ISD. Liquidated Damages will also be recovered from BAE SYSTEMS for delayed contract deliverables and a new Liquidated Damages provision was negotiated to protect against further delays.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Your final question related to the recent Critical Design Review (CDR). The Air Vehicle Critical Design Review for the Nimrod MRA4 was held at the end of September 1999. There were 34 time-bound actions placed at the review which have all now been completed, signifying that a major engineering design milestone for the Nimrod MRA4 Air Vehicle is complete: thus far the aircraft has met the revised programme milestones.</FONT></UL>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The 1998/99 Key Targets were announced in the House of Commons on 8 April 1998. A summary of the Agency's achievement against these appears in the DCTA Annual Report and Accounts 1998/99 that was published in July 1999. Copies are available in the House of Commons Library.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>All Key Targets were met, apart from Key Target 3 which was "to exceed 90% of customers' perceived satisfaction of requirements." In a Customer Survey in December 1998 by the Defence Analytical Services Agency (DASA) on DCTA's behalf, the Agency scored 87%--missing the target by 3%. Notwithstanding that the target was missed and that we continued to try to improve, 87% is an extremely high achievement by industry standards. Further details are in Annex A.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Measures taken during 1999-2000 to attempt to improve performance against Key Targets include the further development of DCTA's helpdesk, shorter pipeline times, enhanced availability, and continued improved communications with our customers, to ensure we are providing the quality and quantity of items which they require.</FONT></UL>

The Agency achieved a score of 87% overall customer satisfaction in an independent survey, missing the testing target by only 3%. There were many positive comments, all indicating a customer perception that DCTA had improved availability, fitness for purpose and communication during the period. Further development of the helpdesk, communication, shorter pipeline times and maintained improvement of product availability were the major lessons learned, from which several business initiatives have been implemented by FY 99/00. A more detailed Customer survey is being conducted in the present year (FY 99/00) to assess the impact of these initiatives.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Key Targets published for 1998-99 are listed below.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Key Target 1:</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>From within available personnel resources, achieve 100% of required professional and military trained personnel, at the specified readiness for deployment in support of the National Contingency Force.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Key Target 2:</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>To achieve an overall increase in dental fitness to 75% for Service personnel.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Key Target 3:</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Measures are to be implemented to target dental treatment towards clinical priority groups leading to a zero increase in the Treatment Needs performance indicator.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Key Target 4:</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>To reduce the percentage of failed appointments with Dental Officers and the time wasted by such failures by 10%. To reduce the percentage of failed appointments with Dental Hygienists and the time wasted by such failures by 25%.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Key Target 5:</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>To limit the number of personnel in dental fitness category D4 (not inspected for 12 months or more) to 15% of the total service population.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Key Target 6:</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>To achieve a success rate for Dental Support Specialists training of 95% of the requirement which is determined by single Service manning supply.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Of these targets 4 were achieved but Key Targets 2 and 4 were not met.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>For Key Target 2 the overall level of dental fitness achieved at the end of the reporting year was 72%. When the target was set, as had been previously recognised for 1997/99, we were not resourced to meet this target for the Army. It was therefore set as a purely "aspirational target". In 1999-2000 the aim is to maintain an agreed level of fitness as may be decided by mutual agreement with each of the Agency's three single Service customers.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>For Key Target 4 it was recognised that this parameter was not wholly or even primarily within the control of the Defence Dental Agency and this target does not therefore feature in the 1999-2000 targets set for the Agency.</FONT></UL>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>1. I am replying to your Question to the Secretary of State for Defence about Key Targets in 1998/99 and 1999/00 as this matter falls within my area of responsibility as Chief Executive of the Logistic Information Systems Agency (LISA).</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>2. Much of the information requested is contained in the Annual Report and Accounts 1998/99 (HC688), a copy of which is in the Library of the House. However, for clarity, it is repeated below.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>3. Your first question asked about those targets for 1998-99 which were, and were not, achieved, giving the factors affecting the outcome in each case. The details for this are as follows;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a. The first Key Target was, "To deliver the agreed levels of service within budget levels defined by the customer". This target was achieved.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>b. The second Key Target was, "To achieve a reduction in unit cost of 3% by April 1999". This target was also achieved.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>c. The third Key Target was in three parts, that is, "To improve delivery performance to customer requirements such that".</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>i. "95% of Requests For Change are assessed within 7 days". This target was not achieved. Measures taken to reduce assessment intervals included an increase in the number of Personal Computers with access to RED BOX (the Service Management tool-set) and associated training programme to educate LISA Customer Service Managers in the effective use of the package in the progression of RFCs. These measures, together with the identification and elimination of bottlenecks in the process, secured a very substantial improvement in performance from 67.21% in the previous year achieving 92.6% by the end of March 1999. Actions taken to improve target achievement performance in 1999/00 include exploitation of new features offered by the latest release of RED BOX, and a continuation of the RED BOX training programme. The latter has the objective of improving use and perception of the package and increasing its acceptance throughout the Agency as a significant means of improving performance.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>ii. The average period required for Request for Change authorisation is reduced by 10%. This target was achieved.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>iii. "85% of Requests For Change are moved from the Tasking Phase to the Implementation Phase within 90 days". This target was achieved.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>4. In addition, a new, and significant, means to improve performance is the implementation of Resource Accounting and Budgeting (RAB). As a result of this, Customer-Supplier Agreements are being used to enable the customers themselves to define the outputs required from the Agency. For example, this has enabled LISA to develop one of the targets from one of unit cost to one that now commit the Agency to delivering requirements defined by the customers, but at 97% of the cost of the Agreement to which the customer has agreed and contracted.</FONT></UL>

For your information, I attach copies of the relevant pages of the Report. The Agency's Key Targets for 1999-2000 were also set out in the Annual Report and Accounts for 1998-1999 and announced to Parliament by the then Minister for the Armed Forces on 9 June 1999 (Official Report, Columns 322-333). The Agency's Owner, the Principal Finance Officer for the Ministry of Defence, sets these targets each year with the help of his Advisory Board, made up of all the Agency's major customers and members from outside the Ministry of Defence with a thorough understanding of the Agency's business. The Advisory Board agreed that the targets for 1999-2000 were an extremely challenging measure of business success. The Agency uses the Business Excellence Model to help ensure continuous improvement in all aspects of its business.</FONT></UL>

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what factors underlay the decision not to authorise road use of the Foden Thompson Carmichael MWD within the UK.  [111772]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00307w25.html_spnew3"><B> Dr. Moonie </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 6 March 2000]:</i> The MK1 version of the Foden Thompson Carmichael MWD was developed in 1995-96 to meet an urgent operational requirement in the Balkans. It is essentially a fuel tanker with a number of design features to improve its manoeuvrability in difficult terrain. The vehicle was exempted from full compliance with the Construction and Use Regulations under Schedule 1, Article 6 of The Motor Vehicles (Authorisation of Special Types) General Order 1979. This Order authorises the Secretary of State for Defence to use specified vehicles, notwithstanding that such vehicles do not comply in all respects with the requirements of the Construction and Use Regulations. The principal areas on non-compliance related to the absence of both a speed limiter and an anti-lock braking system (ABS). While these factors did not make the vehicle unsafe, the vehicles' lack of full compliance with UK legislation led to the decision not to authorise road use within the UK. A modification programme to bring all 34 MK1 vehicles up to full compliance has begun. All MK2 vehicles are fully compliant.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00307w25.html_spnew4"><B> Dr. Moonie </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 6 March 2000]:</i> Prior to 1998 the vehicle was deployed in the Balkans without any formal vehicle-specific driver training having taken place in the UK. Nominated drivers were, however, required to hold the necessary civilian licences and a Hazardous Materials qualification before being trained on the vehicle in the Balkans under the guidance of a qualified driving instructor and an experienced driver from an outgoing Unit. Since 1998, pre-deployment training on the MK1 vehicle has been carried out by qualified military driving instructors at the Army School of Petroleum at Westmoor 



<P>
<P><I>7 Mar 2000 : Column: 649W</I><P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="00307w25.html_spnew5"><B> Dr. Moonie </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 6 March 2000]:</i> No accidents involving the Foden Thompson Carmichael Multi Wheel Drive vehicle have been attributed to either mechanical failure or defective maintenance. Driver error has been assessed as a contributory factor in eleven accidents.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00307w25.html_spnew6"><B> Dr. Moonie </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 6 March 2000]:</i> There have been three accidents involving the Foden Thompson Carmichael Multi Wheel Drive vehicle that have resulted in fatalities or injuries. The first, on 12 April 1996, resulted in serious injuries to two soldiers. The second, on 7 July 1997, resulted in the deaths of two soldiers. In the third accident, on 22 June 1998, a soldier suffered a slight injury. All three accidents occurred in Bosnia.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00307w25.html_spnew8"><B> Dr. Moonie </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 6 March 2000]:</i> There is no evidence of any technical or mechanical problems with either the gearbox or the braking systems across the Foden Thompson Carmichael Multi Wheel Drive vehicle fleet. An inquiry following a fatal road traffic accident in 1997 raised a concern that there was a possibility for a clip within the vehicle's gearbox to become dislodged as a result of excessive wear. This might cause the gearbox to slip into neutral despite a gear being selected. A check was made across the fleet but no problems were discovered and no such occurrences have been reported. The accident inquiry concluded that there was no evidence that this was a contributory factor and concluded that there was insufficient evidence to establish conclusively the cause of the accident.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00307w25.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Swayne: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will make a statement on the safety record of the Foden Thompson Carmichael MWD.  [111825]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00307w25.html_spnew9"><B> Dr. Moonie </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 6 March 2000]:</i> The vehicle has coped well in operations in arduous terrain and harsh weather conditions over the past three years. 



<P>
<P><I>7 Mar 2000 : Column: 650W</I><P>
While the two serious accidents are extremely regrettable, the accident rate for this vehicle is not considered excessive. The vehicle continues to perform well and is considered safe in all regards.

 <i>[holding answer 6 March 2000]:</i> To address Gulf veterans' concerns, on 8 September 1999, the Ministry of Defence offered to arrange independent testing for Depleted Uranium to those Gulf veterans who had their urine tested for Depleted Uranium in Canada. This offer must not be taken as an indication that the Ministry of Defence believes veterans do have high levels of Depleted Uranium in their bodies. Rather it is 



<P>
<P><I>7 Mar 2000 : Column: 653W</I><P>
something the Ministry of Defence would like to do so that we can move forward from a firm scientific basis. A draft protocol under which this testing will take place is with veterans' representatives for comment. If it is agreed, we believe that approximately 30 veterans would be eligible for testing. My Department estimates that the cost of obtaining and testing a sample of veteran's urine will be approximately &#163;3,500 per person, excluding Ministry of Defence overheads.

 Lists of <i>(a)</i> county court and <i>(b)</i> magistrates court closures, and (c) justices bench amalgamations are as set out.
<P>

<a name="00307w27.html_para0"><i>(a)</i> The list of county court closures and the following paragraph have been supplied by the Chief Executive of the Court Service. Fifty-five county courts in England and Wales have been closed or amalgamated since 1 February 1994. The financial savings to the Court Service are in terms of rent and accommodation charges, running costs such as staff salaries, telephone, postage, maintenance of buildings and judicial expense. There have been no savings in financial terms in respect of police forces as this is not relevant to the county courts. The Lord Chancellor does not keep statistics on what representation costs or witness expenses may have been saved through county court closures. Precise figures on all the savings accruing from county court closures since 1994 are not specifically kept by the Court Service. However, a broad conservative estimate of accommodation charges saved and general running costs would indicate a minimum saving of &#163;6,000,000 over the six year period.

When determining the future of its courthouses, it is for each Committee to identify the scope of its own criteria for the number and location of magistrates courts within its area and the possible financial savings. The financial saving achieved by the closures and amalgamations is not collected centrally and could be obtained only from each Magistrates Courts Committee at a disproportionate cost.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what training magistrates receive on sentencing; and if he will make a statement.  [112806]<P>

<P>
<a name="00307w28.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Lock: </B> 
 Training of magistrates is the responsibility of individual Magistrates Courts Committees within a framework set on behalf of the Lord Chancellor by the Judicial Studies Board, an independent, non-departmental public body. Magistrates are trained to approach sentencing in a structured way, taking into account a range of factors including the nature and seriousness of the

offence. Sentencing is a matter for judicial discretion taking into account the statutory framework, any Court of Appeal sentencing guideline judgments and other relevant case law. Magistrates are encouraged to use the sentencing guidelines published by the Magistrates Association, with the approval of the Lord Chancellor and the Lord Chief Justice, in reaching their decisions.
<P>

<a name="00307w28.html_para0">The Human Rights Act 1998 and the revised sentencing powers in the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 create new challenges for the magistracy but the Government, which is committed to the lay magistracy continuing to play a significant role in our system of justice, is confident that magistrates will rise to those challenges.
