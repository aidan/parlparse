 There have been no deaths or casualties sustained on operations in Iraq or Afghanistan of those aged under 18. No Service personnel under the age of 18 are deployed on any operation, outside the United Kingdom, which would result in them becoming engaged in, or exposed to, hostilities. In line with United Nations policy, Service personnel under 18 are not deployed on UN peacekeeping operations.</p>

 There are no plans to change the current policy. Service personnel under 18 years who have completed 28 days of service have the right to discharge at any time before their 18th birthday provided they give the required 14 days notice. A service person under the age of 18 years three months who registered before their 18th birthday, their clear unhappiness at their choice of career can request permission to leave the armed forces. They do not have discharge of right at this age but it is exceedingly rare for such an individual to be refused permission to leave. These safeguards help to ensure that young servicemen or women under the age of 18 years may, if they wish, leave the armed forces and that any commitment to service is both considered and voluntary.</p>

<i> [holding answer 20 December 2010]:</i> Between 12 May 2010 and 30 November 2010 the Ministry of Defence (MOD) appointed 177 members of staff on fixed-term contracts. In all instances fixed-term appointments are used to reflect the finite nature of the requirement and include casual appointments as well as longer fixed-terms.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_67"><a name="110110w0001.htm_para12"><a name="1101105000203">The cost of the payroll in future years will depend on a number of factors, including the number of civilian and military personnel employed.

Final savings figures will depend on detailed implementation of these reductions, which will be subject to full consultation with all relevant parties, including the trade unions and the devolved Administrations, as well as the results of mandatory assessments on the impact that the measures will have on sustainability, equality and diversity and health and safety. The MOD is therefore not prepared to release more detailed figures at this time.</p>

 Expenditure on the grey fleet was some £34 million in 2008-09 and £32 million in 2009-10. This expenditure represents the cost of fixed mileage rates through which service and civilian personnel are assisted with the expenses they incur when using a privately owned vehicle for travel on official Ministry of Defence business. The figures do not include the reimbursement of any parking or toll charges, where incurred, as we do not break down such expenses by mode of travel, whether private vehicle, MOD vehicle or hire car.</p>

 Most local authorities, and the local resilience forums of which they are part, have multi-agency flood plans, which set out their planned responses to flooding events. These are based on guidance produced by central Government; DEFRA is the lead Department for the central response to potential and real flooding events including from melting snow. Local authorities also benefit from the daily forecasts from the Flood Forecasting Centre, which include assessments of the risk of flooding from snow melt at an individual county level.</p>

These reviews will determine how we can accelerate progress towards the millennium development goals and achieve maximum value for money for the UK taxpayer. This includes identifying priority countries and sectors where UK aid will have the greatest impact on the world's poor, as well as the most effective mechanisms for delivering aid. The full results of these reviews will be announced in spring 2011 and will form the basis for the Department for International Development's (DFID's) operational plans. These plans will set out how DFID intends to achieve the spending target of 0.7% of GNI from 2013. We will closely monitor and manage progress against the target.</p>

The figures do not include the values of contracts further down the supply chain, in tiers two, three and so on, which are awarded by the tier one contractors and not by the ODA. For example, the steel for the aquatics centre was provided by Rowecord in Newport, a contract worth millions of pounds, Cardiff-based Euroclad have won contracts on both the Olympic stadium and the media centre, whilst Vannplastic from Saltney produced decking boards for the new facilities at Weymouth and Portland, where the sailing events will take place in 2012. The ODA estimates that the total value of supply chain contracts to the regions runs into hundreds of millions of pounds, but these are not public procurements and so the full value of contracts won across the UK is not captured by the figures provided. The ODA estimates that overall up to 50,000 contracts will be generated throughout its supply chains.</p>

 The table lists both lottery and grant in aid (GIA) awards made to Wales in the last five years.

The ending of education maintenance allowance (EMA) will have no impact on which pupils attract the pupil premium, as EMA is solely for young people post 16.

 The Schools White Paper 2010 "The Importance of Teaching" defines a new minimum or "floor" standard which we expect all schools to meet. For secondary schools, a school will be below the floor if fewer than 35% of pupils achieve the "basics" standard of 5 A*-C grade GCSEs including English and mathematics, and fewer pupils make good progress between key stage two and key stage four than the national average. Based on 2009 GCSE results, 437 secondary schools were below this floor standard.</p>

 Currently each local authority receives an ethnic minority achievement grant based on an agreed formula. In 2010-11, ethnic minority achievement grant funding amounted to £201 million overall. The funding formula takes account of the number of minority ethnic pupils from underperforming groups and those with English as an additional language.

<i> [holding answer 22 November 2010]:</i> Take up of free early education places remains high nationally, with 95% of three and four-year-olds accessing at least some of their free early education. However, significant gaps in take up remain between children from the most disadvantaged families and their peers. To improve life chances for these families, children's centres will refocus on supporting families in the greatest need. We know that children's centre outreach workers play an important part in reaching families in greatest need. We are considering what role outreach can continue to play, alongside health visitors, social workers and other early years professionals to promote children's centre services (including free early education places for two, three and four-year-olds), to those families least likely to take up these services.</p>

 Primary legislation-s7 of the Childcare Act 2006-requires local authorities to secure nursery education free of charge for every three and four-year-old, whether or not there is statutory guidance in place. The legislative position is reiterated in new guidance, the code of practice, which came into force in September alongside new regulations which extend, to 15 hours per week, the amount of free nursery education to which each child is entitled. The code of practice, supports local authorities to deliver free nursery education and provides guidance on flexibility, quality, funding and working in partnership with providers. The extension and new code of practice was introduced following extensive consultation with providers and their representatives following trials in 34 pathfinder authorities.</p>

 The Government have not carried out any recent studies explicitly to benchmark school's online educational practice internationally but the Department does monitor and is aware of the research available in this area. The latest OECD 'Education at a Glance' publication shows that the UK fares favourably on per student expenditure compared to other OECD countries. For example we are aware of computer to pupil ratios of 1:3 at secondary, 1:7 at primary, and 1:3 at special schools in England. These figures stand up well to international comparisons and suggest healthy levels of online education which many reports suggest work best when combined with effective interpersonal teaching.</p>

On 24 September the Secretary of State announced that he had asked Mr Darren Henley, the managing director of Classic FM, to carry out a review of music education and to make recommendations on how we can make sure music funding benefits more young people and improves the music opportunities young people receive both in and out of school.

 In 2009 the Social Work Task Force recommended the establishment of a College of Social Work to articulate and promote the interests of good social work. It will give the profession itself strong, independent leadership; a clear voice in public debate, policy development and policy delivery; and strong ownership of professional social work standards.</p>

<i> [holding answer 7 December 2010]:</i> The Government want to continue to improve the quality of all teachers and teaching, and to raise the status of the teaching profession. The regulations requiring SENCos to be qualified as teachers and, if new to the role, to undertake nationally approved training were introduced following a recommendation by the cross-party Education Select Committee in 2006. The Committee heard evidence from parents and professionals who were concerned about variations in teaching skills among those working with SEN pupils in mainstream schools.</p>

The work force element of the SEN Green Paper will draw on this input and will build on the reforms set out in the Importance of Teaching White Paper. More recently, my colleague, the Minister of State for Children and Families (Sarah Teather), has recently met a group of SENCos as part of her consideration of the issues which the Green Paper will address. A Call for Views to inform the Green Paper also received 95 responses from SENCos.</p>

By comparing these relative amounts we can deduce an indicative value for the relative probability for children from broken homes coming under the supervision of a Youth Offending Team.</p>

1. These statistics are based on Households Below Average Income (HBAI) data sourced from the 2008-09 Family Resources Survey (FRS). This uses disposable household income, adjusted using modified OECD equivalisation factors for household size and composition, as an income measure as a proxy for standard of living.<br>
2. All estimates are based on survey data and are therefore subject to uncertainty. Small differences should be treated with caution as these will be affected by sampling error and variability in non-response.<br>
3. The reference period for households below average income figures are single financial years. Three survey years have been combined as regional single year estimates are subject to volatility.<br>
4. Number of children in low-income households have been rounded to the nearest 100,000, while proportions have been rounded to the nearest percentage point.<br>
5. These statistics are based on incomes before housing costs.<br>
6. Each of the measures is defined as:<br>
<i> Relative poverty:</i><br>
Percentage of children living in households with less than 60% of contemporary median household income.<br>
<i> Absolute poverty:</i><br>
Percentage of children living in households with less than 60% of 1998-99 median household income held constant in real terms.<br>

 Following full implementation of Universal Credit, marginal deduction rates will reduce for around 1.5 million workers in total, with the average (median) reduction in marginal deduction rate being 20 percentage points. As part of this, Universal Credit will particularly improve earnings incentives for 700,000 low-earning workers, reducing the highest marginal deduction rates from 95.8% to around 76%.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_330"><a name="110110w0005.htm_para77"><a name="1101116001693">The Government are committed to ensuring that no-one loses as a direct result of these reforms and we expect 350,000 children and 500,000 working-age adults to be moved out of poverty.

<p><a name="stpa_331"><a name="110110w0005.htm_para78"><a name="1101116001694">Around 2 million workers will see an increase in their marginal deduction rates with a median increase of just 4 percentage points, and none of these households will be worse off financially when they move to Universal Credit. A change in marginal deduction rate does not mean a change in what a family receives, only a difference in how much of their benefit they retain as they increase their hours worked or earnings marginally. Indeed, many of these families will see this change in their marginal deduction rates because Universal Credit allows low-earning households to keep more of their benefit, so as a consequence some households who previously received no state support will now do so. They will therefore have an increased marginal deduction rate but a higher income, as they are now receiving support which is withdrawn where previously there was none. Other households among this group will receive more than they previously did-and hence be better off financially. Some households will see a slight increase in deduction rates but they and their families will see no actual loss at the point of change, because they will be transitionally protected.</p>

The draft FDP Guidance and the "Consultation on an updated Waste Transfer Pricing Methodology for the disposal of higher activity waste from new nuclear power stations", also published on 7 December 2010, provide more detail on those costs for which a new build operator will be responsible. In summary, an operator's full share of waste management and disposal costs is considered to be: the cost of managing their waste pending disposal; the costs that are directly attributable to disposing of their waste in a geological disposal facility (GDF); a contribution towards the fixed costs of constructing a GDF; and an additional element or elements to reflect any financial risks being taken on by the Government in agreeing to title to and liability for the operator's waste.</p>

The scheme has been piloted during 2009-10 and is now being rolled out across the Department.

 The duration of university courses is a matter for institutions taking into account the complexity and content of the subjects delivered and demand from students. The new funding regime is designed to move from a situation where the bulk of funding is via direct grants to one based on the informed choices of students. Students will want to take into account course length and content, the quality of their experience at university and their employment prospects on graduation in deciding which courses to apply for, in addition to the fees being charged. Students will benefit from a fairer and more progressive system of graduate contributions and so we do not expect a particular impact on four year courses where there is a clear rationale for the length of study. Overall, however, we would expect innovative approaches to teaching, such as compressed degrees.</p>

However, the Department has provided grant funding to TB Alert, a United Kingdom charity, to work with at-risk groups, to encourage prompt referral for TB testing and treatment. This work includes building the capacity of a range of third sector organisations to raise awareness of tuberculosis with their local communities.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what the annual cost of legal representation was of the Government at completed inquests into all cases where the Government was represented in each financial year since 2007-08; and how much the Government spent on legal aid to the families of the deceased in each such year.

 The Ministry of Justice (MOJ) does not hold details of the annual cost to the whole of Government of legal representation at inquests. Each Department makes their own arrangements.</p>

These charges came to £1.8 million in 2007-08; £2.2 million in 2008-09 and £2.7 million in 2009-10.

The total amount spent on exceptional funding was £1.1 million in 2007-08; £1.5 million in 2008-09 and £1.6 million in 2009-10. While most of the applications for exceptional funding are for inquests, it is not possible to disaggregate the expenditure on inquests from the total amount spent on exceptional funding.</p>

 Under the homelessness legislation that applies to England (Part 7 of the Housing Act 1996) a person becomes intentionally homeless if he or she is required to leave accommodation as a consequence of his or her own deliberate behaviour, and, but for that behaviour, it would have been reasonable for that person to continue to occupy the accommodation. A person who does not have accommodation owing to an inability to pay rents may or may not have become intentionally homeless, depending on the circumstances of the case. However, it is for local housing authorities to make decisions in individual cases.</p>

 Where an individual planning application is submitted for determination by the local planning authority, it will be for that authority to decide whether or not permission should be granted. In taking such decisions a local planning authority must have regard to the local development plan for its area (which will incorporate any relevant neighbourhood development plans) and any other material considerations. (It is unlikely that the fact that there has been a "yes" or "no" vote in a referendum on a specific development proposal would be a material consideration-i.e about the planning merits of an application-which the local planning authority could take into account).

 For reasons of taxpayer confidentially, HM Revenue and Customs do not give Companies House a reason for objecting to the striking off of a company from the Register of Companies. HM Revenue and Customs write to the company explaining why an objection has been made. The precise reasons can vary from cases to case. The most common reasons are that the company owes money to HM Revenue and Customs, that an inquiry is being conducted into the company's tax affairs, or that a Corporation Tax return is outstanding.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs with reference to the letter from the Minister for Europe of 11 November 2010, on the European Union Bill, for what reasons his Department believes that the present terms of UK membership of the EU are in the national interest.

 There are many things about the EU we would like to change. However, membership of the EU gives UK business full access to the world's most important trading zone, comprising 500 million consumers without the barriers of customs or tariffs. This is of great importance to the UK's prosperity. 10% (3.5 million) of UK jobs are reliant on exports to EU member states, the beneficial effect of EU trade on UK households is estimated at between £1,100 and £3,300 per year, UK exports to member states are worth more than £200 billion, and EU Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) comprises 49% of overall FDI to the UK. Under the present terms of membership the UK plays a strong and active role in influencing and shaping developments within the EU, allowing us to further goals essential to the national interest, such as strengthening and expanding the single market, delivering growth, and promoting a resource efficient, low carbon EU economy. The European economic area (EEA) and European Free Trade Association (EFTA) members, in contrast, have to contribute to the EU budget without being able to negotiate the detail and content of EU legislation, and without receiving benefits such as the exemption from customs requirements and costs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_563"><a name="110110w0009.htm_para16"><a name="11011132000159">In addition, EU membership gives the UK better leverage and negotiating power on the global stage, allowing us to better achieve our international objectives on issues such as freer international trade, conflict prevention, stabilisation, climate change, human rights and development. There are also wide-ranging benefits for UK individuals, such as the right to study and work within the EU, and to receive free or reduced cost health care on temporary visits within EU member states.</p>
