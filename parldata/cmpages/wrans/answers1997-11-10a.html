To ask the Prime Minister if he will publish the annual cost to public funds of maintaining the private offices of former Prime Ministers. [14986]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71110w01.html_spmin1"><B>The Prime Minister:</B> 
 All former Prime Ministers are eligible to receive an allowance to assist them with the continuing heavy burden of office and secretarial costs arising from their special position in public life. The allowance is similar in purpose and amount to the parliamentary office costs allowance, but is paid in respect of public not parliamentary duties.
<P>

<a name="71110w01.html_para0">The maximum amount of the allowance available to former Prime Ministers during the current financial year is &#163;47,568 plus &#163;4,757 for contributions to pension schemes of members of staff whose salaries are paid from the allowance.
<P>

<a name="71110w01.html_para1">I do not think it right to disclose the amounts of this allowance claimed by individual former Prime Ministers, any more than the House discloses details of claims by Members under the office costs allowance.

<P>
<a name="71110w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson: </B> 
 We are working actively on the implication of the WTO findings on the EC banana regime. We are in close touch with the Commission in Brussels, which has responsibility for devising a WTO compatible response on behalf of the Community. They will be discussing the implications with our traditional banana suppliers and other interested parties such as the US. At the CHOGM in Edinburgh last month, my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary made clear to Caribbean leaders that the UK will play a major role in devising new banana import arrangements. We want to ensure Commonwealth and other ACP banana producers have continuing access to the EU banana market. New arrangements are likely to come into effect in early 1999.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what transitional arrangements the Government plan to make to reduce the impact of the recent World Trade Organisation ruling on Commonwealth banana producers; and if he will make a statement. [14996]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71110w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson: </B> 
 In the Edinburgh Economic Declaration agreed at CHOGM last month, Heads of Government resolved to encourage the EU and WTO members to accommodate the legitimate interests of the ACP banana producers and facilitate the diversification of their economies. The UK has for a number of years been promoting good commercial practice and competitiveness among those Commonwealth banana producers likely to be most affected by the WTO ruling, principally the Windward Islands. The UK-funded Cargill report outlined the steps necessary to restructure and modernise their banana industries and was agreed with the Windwards Governments in 1995. Caribbean Governments also receive large allocations of EC aid to improve competitiveness, assist economic diversification and develop social safety nets.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71110w02.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Tony Lloyd: </B> 
 Since 3 July, when Jon James and Camilla Carr were kidnapped, their employers and we have sought to establish the facts and are working hard for their release. As their families know, the Prime Minister spoke to President Yeltsin about the couple last month. We are also in touch with the Chechen authorities, but the ability of the Russian or, indeed, any government to help in this troubled region is limited. There has been a spate of kidnappings in and around Chechnya in recent months, which may be criminally inspired: one reason why our strong consular advice is that British citizens should not travel to Chechnya.

 While a solution to the serious problems in Algeria must come from the Algerians themselves, we condemn unreservedly the violence which has prevailed there. In our regular contact with the Algeria authorities, we encourage Algeria's democratisation process.

 The August 1997 session of the Preparatory Committee considered mechanisms for triggering action by the Court, the Court's procedures, and the relationship between the Court and national criminal justice systems. Progress was made towards producing an agreed text on all these issues and in particular on the last. Further discussion will be possible at the two remaining sessions of the Preparatory Committee, but many matters will be left for decision at the Diplomatic Conference next year.

 New Article K.4 of the Treaty on European Union, as introduced by the Treaty of Amsterdam, provides that the Council shall lay down the conditions and limitations under which the competent authorities referred to in Articles K.2 and K.3 may operate in the territory of another Member State in liaison and in agreement with the authorities of that state. By virtue of Article K.6, the Council must act by unanimity.

<P>
<a name="71110w02.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson: </B> 
 There is no such requirement under the Treaty of Amsterdam. Article 158(2) of the Treaty establishing the European Community as amended by the Treaty of Amsterdam provides for future members of the European Commission to be nominated by the Governments of the member states "by common accord" with the nominee for President. This will inevitably entail dialogue between the nominee for President and the Governments of the member states.

This will include procedures and conditions for issuing visas by Member States for intended stays of no more than three months. After a period of five years after the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, such measures are to be adopted by the council in accordance with the codecision procedure.

 Electricity prices are coming down. Northern Ireland Electricity reduced tariffs form 1 April 1997 by an average 8 per cent. for domestic and up to 3 per cent. for industrial and commercial customers. The MMC review of NIE's price controls will have retrospective effect from 1 April 1997 and will lead to further tariff reductions of at least 6 per cent. for domestic and 2 per cent. for industrial and commercial customers. The precise details of the revised price controls are currently the subject of legal action. In addition, the Director General of Electricity Supply has secured voluntary agreements on lower generation costs at both Coolkeeragh and Belfast West power stations. He has announced his intention to refer the Ballylumford and Kilroot contracts to the MMC and, in the absence of voluntary agreement on these contracts, is likely to do so very shortly.

 I have asked the Chief Executive of the Student Awards Agency for Scotland to provide a full report on the difficulties encountered by the Agency in processing student award applications timeously this year so that we can determine what measures need to be implemented to prevent a recurrence.

To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland what factors underlie the delays in the payment of grants by the Student Awards Agency for the current academic year; and what steps he is taking to address the problem. [14291]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71110w04.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 A number of factors have combined to affect adversely the ability of the Student Awards Agency for Scotland to process awards within its normal timescale in the current academic year. Most of these flow from the introduction of a new awards processing system in April of this year. There were a larger number of initial problems encountered than had been anticipated and these, together with delays in converting data from the previous system, unfamiliarity with the new system, and the need to enter large volumes of 'standing' data in its first year of operation, resulted in a backlog of applications building up. The profile of receipt of applications is heavily concentrated into the months from May to September and it is extremely difficult for the Agency to recover from a backlog once one has developed. The new awards system has, however, performed well after the initial problems were overcome. It has proved resilient under intensive use and significant improvements in efficiency are expected to be realised in future years.
<P>

<a name="71110w04.html_para1">Scottish higher and further education institutions were provided with an advance of their block grant in recognition of the fact that their income from tuition fees in October would be less than they had reason to expect. This was also designed to enable institutions to offer short term assistance to those students in financial difficulties because of delays in receiving their grant cheques, and was in addition to the Access Funds which are normally used for this purpose. Meanwhile, the Agency was set a demanding target to clear the vast majority of the backlog by the end of October, which has largely been achieved. It is expected to be up to date with processing applications by the end of November.

[14293]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71110w04.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 The closing date for the receipt of undergraduate applications by the Student Awards Agency for Scotland in academic year 1997-98 is 31 January 1998 and it is not therefore a factor in the present

situation. Students continuing a period of full-time education were, however, advised to apply by 15 May 1997 in order to ensure that any grant payable would be available at the start of the first term. New students are encouraged to apply as soon as they receive an unconditional offer of a place on a course.
<P>

<a name="71110w04.html_para2">Of the 71,436 applications received from continuing students up to 3 November 1997, 20,656 were received by 15 May. At the same date 40,434 applications had been received from new students. Applications are not attributed to a specific course at the point of receipt and term dates vary between institutions. The best estimate is that about 27,750 applications had been received four or more weeks before the start of the term, which is the normal period allowed for processing fully completed applications.

<a name="71110w04.html_para3">As at 3 November, 42,884 awards had been processed in sufficient time to allow any payment to be made at the beginning of the students' terms and a further 22,721 had been processed in time to allow any payment to be made by 4 weeks after the beginning of the term. A total of 90,217 applications had been processed and 28,927 had yet to be processed; many of the latter are likely to be "fees only" cases with no payment due to the student.

 The student award application forms already have facilities for the collection of information on parental, spouse and student income, as required, and these will in future be used to collect the necessary information from EU students.

<a name="71110w04.html_para5">We are currently considering the nature of the documentation which will be required to support the information provided, and the most appropriate means of dealing with currency differences, to enable EU students' contributions to tuition costs to be assessed on the same basis as those of Scottish domiciled students.

 A transporter can be removed from operating under a General Authorisation or a Specific Authorisation can be revoked or suspended in the event of repeated infringements against the Order or any one infringement which involves serious suffering to animals.

 The Welfare of Animals (Transport) Order 1997 came into force on 1 July this year, with the Specific Authorisation Scheme operational from 1 October.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71110w04.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Enforcement of the rest period requirements of EU Directive 95/29 is the responsibility of the authorities of the member state in which a rest is required to take place. For their part, the Government ensure that exporters plan journeys in accordance with the EU rules, making such arrangements for rest periods as are required. We will not hesitate to use the sanctions provided by the Directive against transporters who are shown to have made false declarations about the journeys they have undertaken.

 It is for distributors to determine the detailed criteria for awards. For capital schemes, they may provide a revenue grant or an endowment to cover the costs of a project or to ensure its completion. We are looking at this area as part of the review of distribution announced in the White Paper, "The People's Lottery".

 In the White Paper, "The People's Lottery", I announced our intention to ensure that Lottery money is spent according to a strategy drawn up in the light of need across all regions and parts of the country and between different groups in society. My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister has already announced a pilot scheme where some distributors will work together on small community grants in Scotland. We hope to see this kind of approach extended where appropriate as soon as possible.

I will be announcing the results of our review of access to national museums and galleries within the next few weeks.

 <i>[holding answer 3 November 1997]:</i> There is no requirement for British subjects or those persons deemed never to have ceased to be British subjects to register or make themselves known to the British Embassy in Dublin. It is therefore impossible to estimate the number of British subjects resident in the Republic of Ireland. According to the Office for National Statistics, in 1995 there were approximately 50,000 British passport holders resident in the Republic of Ireland.

<a name="71110w08.html_para3">CS sprays will be stored in specifically designed secure cabinets at the Operational Command Units. These cabinets are marked in accordance with fire and chemical storage regulations. A detailed record is maintained in relation to all devices. Each device is individually serial numbered and is issued against signature. The record of issue is then updated following discharge or disposal of the device.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what assessment he has made of the potential effects on remand prisoners' rights to a fair trial of arbitrary restrictions in the period leading up to and during their court appearances; what steps he has taken to ensure that the Prison Service is aware of this problem; and what special measures exist for the supervision monitoring of the treatment of prisoners in these circumstances. [13091] 
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71110w08.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 6 November 1997]:</i> It is our policy that detention must not affect a person's right to a fair trial. In recognition of their special status, all unconvicted prisoners have extra privileges such as: the right to wear their own clothing; the right not to work; the right to extra visits, telephone calls and letters; and the right to continue their (legitimate) business activities. In addition, all prisons have legal aid officers and access to unlimited visits with their legal representative. Nearly all local prisons and remand centres have bail information schemes which assist prisoners to obtain bail if appropriate.
<P>

<a name="71110w08.html_para4">Both Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Prisons and the Prison Service Standards Audit, on their visits to local prisons, seek to ensure that the rights and privileges of unconvicted prisons are observed.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how he intends to implement the House of Lords judgment in Regina v Secretary of State for the Home Department ex parte Pierson given on 24 July. [15640]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71110w10.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 This judgment concerned the discretion of any holder of my office to increase a tariff once set for an adult convicted of murder. The majority of the House found that it is lawful for the Secretary of State to increase a tariff previously set, as set out in a reply given by my predecessor, the right hon. and learned Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Mr. Howard) on 27 July 1993, <i>Official Report</i>, columns <i>863-65</i>. However, one of that majority found that that statement did not purport to apply to a decision to increase a tariff set before 27 July 1993, and so a different majority found that the increase of the tariff in the Pierson case was unlawful.
<P>

<a name="71110w10.html_para1">So far as the procedures for setting and reviewing tariffs of adult murderers are concerned, I am continuing the practice of my predecessor, as described in his answers of 27 July 1993, <i>Official Report,</i> columns <i>861-64 </i> and 7 December 1994, <i>Official Report, </i>columns <i>234-35</i>. In particular, before setting tariff, I am continuing to take the advice of the trial judge and the Lord Chief Justice, informing the prisoner of the substance of that advice and inviting representations about it, and giving reasons for any departure on my part from the judicial review.
<P>

<a name="71110w10.html_para2">With regard to the discretion to alter tariff, I reiterate that the view which I take (or a Minister acting under my authority takes) at the beginning of a mandatory life sentence, of the period necessary to satisfy the requirements of retribution and deterrence is an initial view of the minimum period necessary to satisfy those requirements. It therefore remains possible for me, or a future Secretary of State, exceptionally to revise that view of the minimum period, either by reducing it, or by increasing it where I, or a successor in my office, conclude that, putting aside questions of risk, the minimum requirements of retribution and deterrence will not have been satisfied at the expiry of the period which had previously been determined. The procedure for 



<P>
<P><I>10 Nov 1997 : Column: 420</I><P>
considering any increase of a tariff once set will include the opportunity for the prisoner to make representations after being informed that the Secretary of State is minded to increase tariff, and to be given reasons for any subsequent decision to increase it.
<P>

<a name="71110w10.html_para3">So far as the potential for a reduction in tariff is concerned, I shall be open to the possibility that, in exceptional circumstances, including for example, exceptional progress by the prisoner whilst in custody, a review and reduction of the tariff may be appropriate. I shall have this possibility in mind when reviewing at the 25 year point the cases of prisoners given a whole life tariff and in that respect will consider issues beyond the sole criteria of retribution and deterrence described in the answer given on 7 December 1994. Prisoners will continue to be given the opportunity to make representations and to have access to the material before me.
<P>

<a name="71110w10.html_para4">I intend to apply these policies in respect of all tariffs for adult murderers, whether or not they were originally set before 27 July 1993 and whether or not they were originally fixed by me personally, or a Minister acting on my behalf, or by or on behalf of a previous holder of my office. In the Pierson case, where the tariff has now been quashed, I intend to invite representations from the prisoner before re-setting tariff at a level which I consider appropriate.
<P>

<a name="71110w10.html_para5">I take the opportunity to confirm that my approach on the release of adults convicted of murder once tariff has expired will reflect the policy set out in the answer given 27 July 1993. In particular, the release of such a person will continue to depend not only on the expiry of tariff and on my being satisfied that the level of risk of his committing further imprisonable offences presented by his release is acceptably low, but also on the need to maintain public confidence in the system of criminal justice. The position of a prisoner subject to a mandatory life sentence continues to be distinct from that of a prisoner serving a discretionary life sentence, a decision on whose final release is a matter for the Parole Board alone.
<P>

<a name="71110w10.html_para6">Everything in this answer about my practice in relation to mandatory life sentence prisoners applies equally to persons who are, or will be, sentenced, to custody for life under section 8 of the Criminal Justice Act 1982. For present purposes, a life sentence imposed under section 2 of the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997 is treated as a discretionary life sentence.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how he intends to implement the House of Lords judgment in Regina V Secretary of State for the Home Department ex parte V and T given on 12 June. [15641]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71110w10.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 This judgment was concerned with the periods of imprisonment, known as the tariff, set by my predecessor, the right hon. and learned Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Mr. Howard) as being necessary to reflect the requirements of retribution and deterrence in the cases of the two boys convicted of the murder of James Bulger. The House of Lords concluded that the current arrangements for reviewing tariff in the cases of offenders under the age of eighteen, convicted of murder and sentenced to detention at Her Majesty's pleasure under section 53(1) of the Children and Young Persons 



<P>
<P><I>10 Nov 1997 : Column: 421</I><P>
Act 1933, failed adequately to reflect the distinctive nature of that sentence. In particular, the judgment requires that the initial view of what is necessary by way of retribution and deterrence should be capable of reduction in the light of the offender's personal development while in custody, and that the offender's personal development should therefore be considered alongside the public interest in retribution and deterrence in keeping the tariff period under review.
<P>

<a name="71110w10.html_para7">The House of Lords did not conclude, however, that the sentence of detention at Her Majesty's pleasure was purely reformative in character, nor that the Secretary of State's declaration of an initial view of what was necessary by way of retribution and deterrence was unlawful. The public properly expects the unique crime of murder to attract an appropriate punishment, regardless of the age or circumstances of the offender. It is in the interests of victims' families, public confidence, and of the individual offender that a clear indication should be given, relatively quickly following conviction, of the Secretary of State's initial view of the minimum period of imprisonment necessary to reflect the seriousness of the particular offence. I intend to continue to provide that initial view as at present, taking into account the advice of the trial judge and the Lord Chief Justice, any representations made on the offender's behalf and the overarching requirements of public confidence in the sentence of detention at Her Majesty's pleasure. That initial view will continue also to reflect an awareness of the offender's age and personal circumstances at the time of conviction.
<P>

<a name="71110w10.html_para8">Public confidence in the sentence will not be maintained if that initial tariff is curtailed lightly or as a matter of course. Rather, it should be reduced only where the balance between the public interest in punishment on the one hand, and the public interest in the offender's welfare on the other, has clearly shifted so as to justify such a reduction. Moreover, the more serious the circumstances of the offence, as reflected in the length of the initial tariff, the higher will be the threshold at which the public interest in the offender's welfare may outweigh the public interest in the offender's punishment.
<P>

<a name="71110w10.html_para9">However, I have also to act on the House of Lords' conclusion that the law requires the sentence's effect upon the offender to be kept under review and that there may be circumstances in which the desirability of promoting the child's eventual re-integration into society may justify a revision of the initial view on tariff.
<P>

<a name="71110w10.html_para10">Taking these considerations into account, this is the new procedure which I shall adopt. I shall continue to seek the advice of the trial judge and of the Lord Chief Justice in deciding what punishment is required in any individual case of a person convicted under section 53(1) of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933. I shall then set an initial tariff with that advice, and the offender's personal circumstances, in mind. I shall continue to invite representations on the prisoner's behalf and give reasons for decisions.
<P>

<a name="71110w10.html_para11">Officials in my Department will receive annual reports on the progress and development of young people sentenced under section 53(1) whose initial tariff has yet to expire. Where there appears to be a case for considering a reduction in tariff, that will be brought to the attention of Ministers.




<P>
<P><I>10 Nov 1997 : Column: 422</I><P>

<P>

<a name="71110w10.html_para12">When half of the initial tariff period has expired, I, or a Minister acting on my behalf, will consider a report on the prisoner's progress and development, and invite representations on the question of tariff, with a view to determining whether the tariff period originally set is still appropriate. In complex and difficult cases, I shall seek the assistance of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Health in securing independent professional advice (that is to say, independent of those already charged with the care of the offender) on the young offender's condition and development.
<P>

<a name="71110w10.html_para13">Any request for a review of tariff before it expires will be considered on its merits, whether that request is made by or on behalf of the offender or by one of the agencies or individuals responsible for his or her care.

<P>

<a name="71110w10.html_para15">So far as the offender's age is concerned. I shall take into account the Government's international and domestic obligations to children under the age of 18 in deciding where the balance between the public interest in punishment and the public interest in the offender's welfare lies. That balance will also have been at the heart of the decision on the proper length of the initial tariff.
<P>

<a name="71110w10.html_para16">Where I consider that the offender's welfare may be seriously prejudiced by his or her continued imprisonment, and that the public interest in the offender's welfare outweighs the public interest in a further period of imprisonment lasting at least until the expiry of the provisionally set tariff, I will decide to reduce the tariff. In these circumstances, release on or after tariff expiry will be dependent on the question of risk, decided in the same way as at present.
<P>

No one who has committed murder and is sentenced to detention at Her Majesty's pleasure will be released unless two conditions are satisfied: first, the tariff period necessary for

<P>
<P>
<a name="71110w11.html_wqn0"><B> Ms Jenny Jones: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make a statement on the Director General's review of management and organisation of the Prison Service. [15642]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71110w11.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 The Director General has now completed an internal review of the management and organisation of the Prison Service.
<P>

<a name="71110w11.html_para0">The review has recommended, and I have endorsed, a programme of action with the following key elements:
<P>

<a name="71110w11.html_para1">(i) measures to assert and reinforce Ministerial responsibility for the Prison Service. The Government have already made clear their commitment to taking proper Ministerial responsibility for the Prison Service. Parliamentary Questions are now answered by Ministers and not by the Director General. Further measures to be taken in the light of this review are as follows:

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>from 1 January Ministers will chair quarterly meetings to review formally the performance and plans of the Prison Service. The report concludes, and I agree, that in the circumstances of the Prison Service such an arrangement better supports the Government's approach to Ministerial oversight than any form of separate Advisory Board;
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the Agency Framework Document will be updated and reissued with a new Ministerial preface when the Comprehensive Spending Review is further advanced;
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the Prison Service will take action to develop a greater sensitivity to the nature and demands of Ministerial responsibility for the Service at all levels in the Agency. This will be reflected in specific training programmes and in key documentation.</FONT></UL>

<P>

<a name="71110w11.html_para2">(ii) a new focus on the delivery of effective prison regimes and preparation for the release of prisoners. The Government are committed to the development of constructive prison regimes which address offending behaviour. Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons has drawn attention to, and been critical of, the wide variation in standard levels of performance between prisons of the same type. The review concludes that an improvement 



<P>
<P><I>10 Nov 1997 : Column: 424</I><P>
in performance in this area is required; and that the top management of the Prison Service is not, at present, organised in such a way as to deliver the necessary leadership and direction required to secure an improvement. The Prison Service will, therefore:

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>plan for and seek substantial improvements in the effectiveness of regimes and the preparation of prisoners for release, while continuing to maintain its performance in relation to security and control; and 
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>create a stronger capacity within Headquarters to develop regime standards and polices for all prisoner groups and to support the operational line in monitoring performance and spreading best practice. This will be provided by a Director of Regimes at Prisons Board level, supported by Assistant Directors with separate, specific responsibility for: young offenders; women; adult males, lifers and parole; and prisoner administration.</FONT></UL>

<P>

<a name="71110w11.html_para3">(iii) a major programme of change to improve the managerial effectiveness of the organisation. This reflects the need for:

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the Prisons Board itself to operate more strategically and effectively. Responsibilities will be clarified at Board level, with separate policy Directors of Regimes, Security and Healthcare. One policy Director will be designated as Deputy Director General and will deputise for the Director General in his absence and ensure effective co-ordination of the day day to work of the Service;
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>more effective standard-setting and performance management systems. A clear set of core standards will be formulated, supported by a set of functional standards for different types of prisoner and prison. The contact between the Governor and the Area Manager will be used as the key business management tool of the Prison Service; and in the longer term the Service will move towards the replacement of contracts with more formal service level agreements, providing a form of internal purchaser/provider arrangement;
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a major investment in management development and training will be taken forward when the Prison Service can identify efficiency savings. The net for recruiting managers to all levels in the Prison Service will also be widened.</FONT></UL>

<P>

<a name="71110w11.html_para4">I welcome the outcome of this review--not least because it is the product of an internal, rather than externally imposed, analysis. None of the proposals to be implemented is intended to pre-empt the outcome of the wider review of the Prison and Probation Services which I announced in reply to a Question from the hon. Member for Bristol, North-West (Dr. Naysmith). <i>Official Report, </i>column <i>172</i>, or the Comprehensive Spending Review, which are proceeding in parallel. The action proposed will, however, help to position the Prison Service for whatever changes may emerge from these reviews and make improvements which are needed in their own right. The Review will be taken forward within existing Prison Services resources.

 Extending conditional fees to all civil, but not family, cases, and withdrawing legal aid from most civil claims for money or damages, can be done under existing legislation. Subject to consultation, we expect to bring in the necessary regulations soon. Making contracting the only way to provide legal aid services, and changing the merits test to reflect the availability of resources, will need primary legislation.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71110w11.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 I propose to control the legal aid budget by ensuring that legal aid is targeted to where it can do most good and is used only where no appropriate alternative method of funding is available. For the longer term I wish to see legal aid being delivered under contracts that will define the price quality and quantity of service to be provided tailored to the local needs of the community.

<a name="71110w11.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Laurence Robertson: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what measures his Department is taking to ensure consistency in decisions relating to the granting of legal aid. [14930]




<P>
<P><I>10 Nov 1997 : Column: 426</I><P>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71110w11.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 Civil legal aid is granted by the Legal Aid Board in accordance with the statutory merits test. The Board use a number of procedures to ensure the test is applied consistently. There is a programme of work to improve the decision making process in the Legal Aid Board Area Offices, through the revision of existing guidance and the production of new guidance. My officials are also reviewing the operation of the merits test with the Legal Aid Board.
<P>

<a name="71110w11.html_para6">In addition the Lord Chancellor recently announced plans to tighten the merits test so that a case would generally need a 75 per cent. chance of success in order to receive legal aid unless there were other compelling reasons for granting it. It is also proposed that the decision to grant should also take account of the available resources. However it would require primary legislation to give effect to these proposals.
<P>
<P>
<a name="71110w11.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Steen: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what was the cost of legal aid in each of the last three years <i>(a)</i> exclusive and <i>(b)</i> inclusive of VAT.  [15069]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71110w11.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 Net expenditure on legal aid for the last three years is as follows:

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>1994-95: &#163;1,298.7 million
</FONT></UL><P>

<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="71110w11.html_para7">Information on VAT is not readily available and could only be obtained at disproportionate cost. Since not all disbursements attract VAT, and not all solicitors and counsel have always been registered for VAT, it is not possible to calculate the total VAT that is paid out of the Legal Aid Fund.
<P>
<P>
<a name="71110w11.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Laurence Robertson: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department if he will list <i>(a)</i> the amount of expenditure on the Green Form scheme for 1996-97 and <i>(b) </i>the percentage of that expenditure which relates to (i) immigration, (ii) welfare benefits, (iii) debt, (iv) consumer and (v) other. [14931]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71110w11.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B>

<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71110w11.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 Moneys recovered by way of the statutory charge relate to cases where charges have been outstanding over a number of years, and therefore there is no annual total statutory charge against which the moneys recovered in the same year could be measured as a percentage.

 Our plans for legal aid reform were announced by my right hon. and noble Friend the Lord Chancellor in his recent speech to the Law Society Annual Conference. Subject to consultation, we intend to make conditional fees available for all civil non-family cases; to withdraw legal aid from most claims for money or damages; and to make contracting the universal way of procuring legal aid services. These changes will allow us to target scarce resources on the people who need them most, and will bring the cost of legal aid under better control and improve quality and value for money.

 One clear measure of the standards of oral health is the incidence of dental caries. The British Association for the Study of Community Dentistry co-ordinates annual surveys of dental caries prevalence in different aged children. The attached tables show the most recent data for the mean number of decayed, missing and filled in deciduous teeth only of five-year-old children, and in the permanent teeth only of twelve and fourteen-year-old children in North Staffordshire, West Midlands and England. Similar data for adults are published every ten years. However, since the most recent data are based on a survey in 1988 and are therefore not particularly up-to-date, they are not presented here.

<a name="71110w14.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 Latest figures show an encouraging downward trend in the overall suicide rate--9.8 per cent. since 1990 (based on a three-year average) but there is no room for complacency. As there is no single reason why people take their own lives, action needs to be taken on a number of fronts. Measures include: reducing access to means, for example, we recently announced restrictions on paracetamol and aspirin pack sizes and improvements in warnings about the effect of overdose; increasing public awareness and understanding about mental illness; focusing on high risk groups, for example, the development of a telephone helpline for young men; educating health and social care professionals about depression; audit of serious incidents and the dissemination of findings; and improving primary and secondary mental health services.

 Figures for 1995 and 1996 are in the table. The trend shows that the number of peak passengers into and out of London has increased but the levels of crowding have reduced. Certain ScotRail services are also subject to Passengers in Excess of Capacity (PIXC) monitoring, but figures are not yet available.

 We reacted swiftly to the environmental emergency in South East Asia with a grant of &#163;62,066 to the United Nations Department of Humanitarian Affairs to provide relief goods to those affected. We offered to send aircraft with infra-red reconnaissance capability to pin-point the location of fires but these were no longer required. We have also provided two experts to support the United Nations' disaster assessment and co-ordination role and a fire-fighting and logistics expert to lead the Technical Co-ordination Group established to co-ordinate international assistance for the provision of ground fire-fighting equipment and training.

 Unemployment is Europe's most acute problem. A special European Council (the "Jobs Summit") is to take place in Luxembourg on 20/21 of this month, and my right hon. Friends the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary will attend for the UK. The main challenge for the Jobs Summit is to produce agreement on the areas where Member States should be taking measures to tackle unemployment and to promote a high and sustainable level of employment. The Summit will discuss draft Employment Guidelines, which are required under the provisions of the Amsterdam Treaty. The Guidelines are central to the efforts of Member States and the EU in the field of employment. We shall want the agreed Guidelines to reflect the paramount importance of employability and job creation. The Commission's draft, published on 1 October, provides a good basis for discussion in it's key themes of adaptability, employability, entrepreneurship, and equal opportunities. We shall want the Summit to commit Member States to take positive action which can be realised during our Presidency and carried forward in the Presidencies that follow.

<a name="71110w15.html_para0">The UK Presidency of the Council in the first half of next year gives us a real opportunity to shift the European agenda in a new direction. Our intention is for the Presidency in the Social Affairs and Education fields to have employability as a key, shared theme. There will be a joint informal Council meeting in London next March of next year, formal Councils later in the Presidency and a range of key conferences. Education and Social Affairs Ministers across Europe will be working together and we will be looking to engage many people in our discussions and in taking work forward.
<P>

<a name="71110w15.html_para1">The Presidency will encompass work on lifelong learning and on innovative ways of tackling unemployment and combating social exclusion. Following the Jobs Summit we intend to set the framework for the Community's new education and training programmes and to focus on the role of the member states and the Community in improving skill levels. During our Presidency we intend to shift the European agenda decisively and to make a concrete start in giving people the skills and adaptability needed for successful careers in the flexible labour markets which are a key part of ensuring the competitiveness of Europe.

 The Government are committed to ensuring that the New Deal will actively promote equality of opportunity for young people of all ethnic and racial groups. Delivery arrangements for each element of the programme--the Gateway, the four options and follow-through support--will promote racial equality and are based on detailed consideration of how best to deliver provision for young people from ethnic minorities, including consultation with the Commission for Racial Equality and encouragement to Race Equality Councils to be involved in local arrangements.

 In January 1997 local education authorities in England were providing home tuition to 10,800 children under their duty to arrange suitable education for pupils who cannot attend school. It has been estimated that a further 10,000 children are educated outside the school system, under arrangements made by their parents.

 We have no plans to reverse the "Greenwich judgment", under which LEAs may not give preference to children living in their administrative area over children living elsewhere.

<a name="71110w16.html_spnew6"><B> Dr. Howells </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 6 November 1997]:</i> The cost of returning to a full grant system would be about &#163;29 million in academic year 1998-99 and &#163;180 million in 1999-2000, at 1997-98 prices. This assumes that both student numbers and the levels of parental contribution remain unchanged; that the new arrangements would be introduced for all students; and that the existing loan entitlement would be replaced by a means-tested grant. The savings generated by the new higher education funding arrangements we have announced would also be foregone.

 As my right hon.

We are determined both to provide a working environment that is free from any form of racial harassment or discrimination and to encourage more people from the ethnic minorities to join the Armed Forces. It has been made absolutely clear to all personnel, from all three Services, that we will not tolerate racism in the Armed forces and will be unremitting in our efforts to remove any racist attitudes, racially discriminatory practice, behaviour or language.
<P>

<a name="71110w17.html_para2">Changes in attitudes within the Services and perceptions outside will, of course, take time, but we are determined to make real progress in this area.

Each Service has issued Equal Opportunities Directives and leaflets, which are issued to all servicing and new personnel, spelling out clearly what equal opportunities means, harassment and complaints procedures and their rights and responsibilities. These are supported by individual Service Equal Opportunities Action Plans which allow us to monitor our policies and practice to ensure there is no discrimination.

 The Benefit Fraud Inspectorate (BFI) will play a vital role in driving up operational standards to maximise counter-fraud performance and minimise the risk of fraud throughout the Social Security system.
