<a name="21028w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Desmond Browne: </B> 
 In Northern Ireland, a consultation exercise took place between October 2000 and January 2001 on the document XConfidence in the Future", which addressed prevention, recognition and management of poor performance in the HPSS. The recommendations made in this report are currently being taken forward. Discssions are also ongoing with national bodies such as the National Clinical Assessment Authority on how to put in place further guidance to the HPSS on the management of poor performance when it is identified.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland if he will make a statement on the Government's policy towards funding animal sanctuaries in Northern Ireland; and if money raised by licences will be used to help fund these bodies.  [76967]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21028w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Pearson: </B> 
 Animal sanctuaries in Northern Ireland are not required to be licensed under the 1972 Welfare of Animals Act. In line with developments in Great Britain, DARD will be reviewing the need to introduce specific welfare controls on animal sanctuaries, which may include licensing. As part of that review, the issue of funding sanctuaries can be considered but there is no financial provision currently available for such funding. If a licensing fee were to be introduced it is unlikely that this could provide a significant source of income for animal sanctuaries.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland how many incidents and attacks on Fire Service and Ambulance Service personnel and vehicles have been recorded in each month since January; and what measures he has taken to protect staff of the emergency services.  [74176]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21028w01.html_spnew3"><B> Jane Kennedy: </B> 
 The Northern Ireland Fire Brigade report all attacks and associated incidents as 'civil disturbance' calls. It is not possible to identify the number of actual attacks on the brigade, however, they do record the number of firefighters injured and appliances damaged as a result of these 'civil disturbance' calls. The Northern Ireland Ambulance Service record the actual number of attacks on personnel and vehicles. These are detailed in the following table.
<P>

<a name="21028w01.html_para0">The Government condemn attacks on those who are there to provide a vital service to the entire community. Those who engage in this type of behaviour need to be reminded that some day they or their families may need to call on the assistance of these same emergency services.

 The Secretary of State met representatives of the Fire Brigades Union on 6 September 2002. The subject of pay, conditions and potential industrial action was raised and the Fire Brigades Union set out their position, which the Secretary of State noted.
<P>

<a name="21028w01.html_para2">I met with the Fire Brigade's Union on 24 October 2002 about their proposed industrial action. At that meeting I asked the Fire Brigades Union to reconsider their threat to strike and to co-operate with the independent review which is examining the issues of pay and modernisation.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what measures will be in place to give fire cover in the North Down constituency if the Fire Brigades Union takes strike action.  [77627]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21028w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Desmond Browne: </B> 
 In the event of strike action by the Fire Brigades Union, fire cover will be provided throughout Northern Ireland, including the North Down constituency, by the Army, supported by the Police Service for Northern Ireland, with the strategic deployment of 32 Yellow Goddesses and 19 Breathing Apparatus Rescue Teams. Deployment locations for these resources include Belfast and Bangor. These alternative arrangements cannot replicate the current firefighting capability, but will try to minimise the danger to human life. There is also likely to be cover provided by members of the Retained Fire fighters Union in rural locations but the extent of support will not be apparent until near the first day industrial action.

<a name="21028w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Desmond Browne: </B> 
 In the event of a firefighters' strike, emergency cover will be provided in Northern Ireland by the Army, supported by the Police Service for Northern Ireland, using 32 yellow goddesses and 19 breathing apparatus rescue teams. These alternative arrangements cannot replicate the current fire service capability, but will try to minimise the danger to human life to ensure that day to day activities can continue as normal. Government Departments and the Fire Authority have been involved in providing advice to businesses, public bodies, including schools, and the public on reducing the risk of fire and road traffic accidents.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland how many organs were retained at the Royal Victoria Hospital between 1972 and 2001; what the ratio was between heart and other organs; and what definitions of <i>(a)</i> organs and <i>(b)</i> tissues were used.  [76636]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21028w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Desmond Browne: </B> 
 The inventory provided by the Royal Victoria Hospital to the Chief Medical Officer in March 2001 showed that a total of 1,131 organs were retained and stored in the period 1970 and 2001 (including 151 paediatric organs that pre-dated 1970). Approximately one-third of the organs were hearts.
<P>

<a name="21028w01.html_para5">For the purposes of the inventory an organ was defined as an entire organ or something that was recognisably an organ. Tissue referred to the contents of blocks and slides derived from organs or larger samples. The Human Organs Inquiry used the following definitions: XOrgan(s)&#151;a part of the body composed of more than one tissue that forms a structural unit responsible for a particular function (or functions)"; and XTissue&#151;organs contain tissue, ie collections of cells which give organs their special functions".

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>(a)</i> Mr. McKee did not hold the position of Chief Executive of the Royal Victoria Hospital.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland if he will make a statement on his policy on coroners' post-mortems; and if he will permit bereaved relatives to claim organs retained by the coroner.  [76638]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21028w01.html_spnew11"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton:  </B> 
I have been asked to reply as I have ministerial responsibility for the Northern Ireland Court Service, which includes the administration of the Coroners Service. A coroner in the exercise of his judicial discretion may order a post mortem examination in respect of deaths notified to him under the Coroners (Northern Ireland) Act 1959. Where organs are removed for forensic analysis following such a post mortem they may be retained for such period as 



<P>
<P><I>28 Oct 2002 : Column 515W</I><P>
the coroner thinks fit. It is now policy to inform the relatives of a deceased person if any organs have been retained following a post mortem. At a later stage after the cause of death has been established the Coroner will usually exercise his judicial discretion to return the retained organs to the family.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland when Dr. Sodhi was employed as resident pathologist at the Royal Victoria Hospital; and how many hearts he retained after post-mortem during that time.  [76633]<P>

<a name="21028w01.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Desmond Browne: </B> 
 No record of the employment of Dr. Sodhi nor of any details of organ retention by him/her is available. This may reflect the fact that records of staff employed prior to the 1980s were not retained.

 Extensive consultation on the Burns Report has demonstrated almost universal support for abolition of the Transfer Tests and a predominant view that academic selection should be ended although there was also substantial opposition to this proposal. In light of the views expressed the Department of Education will be meeting with key education partners to build on that consensus and develop new post-primary arrangements that are fair, enable all children to reach their full potential and provide a modern education system for the 21st century.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister if he will make a statement about the timing of local elections in England in 2004.  [78132]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21028w02.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 We want to see a modern, efficient electoral system, so that voting for all electors is as convenient and as straightforward as possible. We are therefore concerned that in 2004 many electors are being asked to vote on two separate occasions within the space of five weeks. Firstly, in local council elections or elections for the London Mayor and Assembly on 6 May, and secondly, for the European Parliament on 10 June.
<P>

<a name="21028w02.html_para7">As a result, I am, along with the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department, my hon. Friend the Member for Pontefract and Castleford (Yvette Cooper), who is responsible for European Parliamentary elections in England and Wales, launching today a consultation document inviting views on our proposal to postpone the English local elections and the Greater London Authority elections from Thursday 6 May 2004 to Thursday 10 June 2004, the same day as the European Parliamentary election.
<P>

<a name="21028w02.html_para8">In this consultation we are seeking views on the practical issues that would arise from making this change. We are also seeking views on the option of weekend voting. We are seeking views by January 2003. I am placing a copy of this document in the Library of the House.
<P>

<a name="21028w02.html_para9">We would need primary legislation to make this change. We are therefore considering introducing a clause in the proposed Local Government Bill, which would allow us to change the date of the 2004 local and GLA elections by means of Statutory Instrument. Subject to the outcome of our consultation, and to Parliament's approval of the necessary legislation, our aim would be to put in place any postponement of the 2004 local and GLA elections by autumn 2003.




<P>
<P><I>28 Oct 2002 : Column 519W</I><P>

We are considering separately whether the programme of election pilots such as voting by the internet, by phone, or by all-postal voting should go ahead in full in 2004, were we to move the local and GLA elections to coincide with the European Parliamentary elections. We intend to reach a firm conclusion on this in good time, taking into account that any piloting in such combined elections would require separate primary legislation.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21028w03.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 Information on the cost to parish councils of internal audit is not held centrally, and could only be provided at disproportionate cost. The new 'lighter touch' audit regime does not impose any new internal audit requirements. There has been a legal requirement for councils to maintain a system of internal audit for many years, and guidance on good practice on carrying out internal audit is available from the national associations representing parish councils.

[77084]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21028w03.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The proportion of the cost of specialist residential placements for vulnerable children contributed by the NHS in different health authorities is not taken into account in the standard spending assessments for social services. This is also true of the options for the new formulae which we have consulted on over the Summer. Resources for health and social services to an area are allocated separately, with social services providing the majority of residential care. Joint funding arrangements that are then reached between Primary Care Trusts (which now commission NHS services) and local authorities are a local policy decision.

 Places of work and entertainment are already subject to a range of duties under fire safety and health and safety legislation. The owner or operator of a building or other type of site is responsible for safety on site and emergency evacuation arrangements. Organisers of public sporting events should therefore check their preparedness and review their contingency arrangements accordingly, in consultation with the local Chief Fire Officer as appropriate. The command and operational structure for emergency fire cover has been designed to enable maximum flexibility and use of available resources, and deployment of resources will be kept under continual review.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21028w03.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 Emergency cover in the Greater London region will consist of a number of elements including 90 Green Goddesses, 20 breathing apparatus teams, a rescue team equipped with specialist equipment and the police. These will be deployed in four sectors, so a breakdown across Inner London is not practicable. The provision of MoD emergencyfire cover has been planned in consultation with the Chief Fire Officer to maximisethe effectiveness of call-outs and the availability of a range of firefighting capabilities.

 We have no plans to restrict the marketing and use of fireworks during any strike by the firefighters, and no plans to introduce special measures for areas with significant numbers of thatched cottages.

 Emergency cover in Somerset, as for the rest of the country, will consist of a number of elements including Green Goddesses, breathing apparatus teams, rescue teams equipped with specialist equipment and the police. The Somerset Fire Brigade has 40 pumps and 15 special appliances. The provision of MoD emergency fire cover has been planned in consultation with the Chief Fire Officer to maximise the effectiveness of call-outs and the availability of a range of firefighting capabilities.

<P>
<P><I>28 Oct 2002 : Column 524W</I><P>
personal liability the members of the armed forces will have whilst attempting to rescue or help people in their firefighting role; and what life insurance he provides to armed service personnel carrying out firefighting duties.  [77262]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21028w03.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 Personnel have been trained and equipped to provide basic emergency fire and rescue cover. The level of training is dependent on the skills already held by personnel and the role that they would perform in the event of a strike. Drivers and basic crew only require a short training package because of the simple nature of the equipment. Fire Rescue Teams fulfil a more difficult role, which utilises technical equipment in dangerous situations. Some Fire Rescue Teams are already trained and experienced in the use of breathing apparatus and other specialist equipment but additional personnel have also been trained in these techniques. Other support training as well as driver training includes first aid training and specialist equipment maintenance training.
<P>

<a name="21028w03.html_para2">Basic training for fire rescue team personnel lasts up to five weeks, depending on skill levels and role, plus any other necessary follow on training. All military personnel carrying out firefighting duties are being issued with protective kit. While providing the emergency cover, military personnel would follow standard health and safety guidelines, and members of the Armed Forces would not be subject to personal liability. Normal insurance cover and support would be provided to all members of the Armed Forces, as they would be for any other operational duty.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21028w03.html_spnew15"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 As the Deputy Prime Minister set out in his statement to the House on 22 October, the Government have put a range of measures in place to 



<P>
<P><I>28 Oct 2002 : Column 525W</I><P>
secure public safety in the event of industrial action by the FBU. Our focus has been on taking what steps we can to safeguard life and, as far as possible, to protect property where the normal fire cover is not available. Detailed planning began in August and training started on 28 August. The plans are based on support from the armed services, and the acceptance by the police of additional responsibilities during an industrial action.
<P>

<a name="21028w03.html_para4">There are three main elements to the plans. First, on the assumption that the fire control centres will not be operating during the strike, arrangements are being made for fire service 999 calls to be redirected. Every call will be answered. Secondly, emergency cover will be provided by a range of appliances staffed by crews from the Army, RAF and Navy. Nationwide, there will be 827 Green Goddesses, which will be able to provide a basic firefighting capability. There will also be 331 specialist breathing apparatus rescue teams and 59 regional equipment support teams that will offer specialist skills.
<P>

<a name="21028w03.html_para5">Thirdly, the Government has made available basic safety guidance and information to the public and to business. That is being supplemented by a range of other measures such as a public information campaign on radio and television, a mail drop to some 4 million households and a letter to the 15,000 largest businesses giving specific advice on fire safety and general health and safety issues. In the event of a strike by the FBU, the military and police, assisted by those firefighters and fire officers who choose to continue to work, will be in a position to provide a basic emergency service. We have always emphasised that the military cannot seek to replicate the cover provided by the Fire Service. With that in mind, the government has been working with industry and other players to introduce a range of measures to mitigate the effects of a FBU strike.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what the guidelines to local authorities are for imposing council tax concerning servicemen with homes in the UK but who spend considerable amounts of time abroad on duty.  [77762]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21028w04.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Leslie: </B> 
 When a local authority determines council tax liability, a member of the armed services who spends time abroad is treated in the same way as anyone else who spends time abroad. Section 6 of the Local Government Finance Act 1992 sets out the basis of liability to pay council tax. A key factor in determining liability is whether the property is the person's sole or main residence. There is significant case law on this subject for local authorities and their legal advisors to call upon.

 Arthur Andersen were chosen in November 1999 as jointly appointed Reporting Accountant to the Department and BNFL in relation to the potential introduction of a public-private partnership for BNFL. This appointment ended in December 2001. Deloitte and Touche acted as accountancy adviser to the Department on BNFL from March 2000. Following a competitive tender the Department decided in July 2002 to reappoint Deloitte and Touche as its accountancy adviser on BNFL and the proposed Liabilities Management Authority. In August 2002 Deloitte and Touche completed its transaction with Andersen UK under which partners and staff of Andersen UK joined Deloitte and Touche.

 The Government attaches great importance to ensuring that UK exports are not misused, diverted or re-exported to undesirable end-uses, and this risk is among those identified in the consolidated EU and national aims export licensing criteria. The consolidated criteria set out factors to be considered by Member States in assessing the risk of diversion. The Government believes the best way of minimising the risk of diversion is a thorough risk assessment at the licensing stage and this process includes careful examination of information about the proposed end-use and end-user of the goods. After a detailed assessment of the individual circumstance&#151;less than &#189; ounce of the application it was judged that the proposed export of 10 grams of beryllium, to the

 Broadly speaking, the great majority of employment legislation applies to employees working on board ship, provided their ship is registered as belonging in a port in Great Britain, they do not work wholly outside Great Britain under their contract of employment and they are ordinarily resident in Great Britain. Where statutory minimum standards apply to terms and conditions of employment, employees can complain to the employment tribunals if they believe that those standards have not been met. There are some exceptions to the application of employment legislation to UK seafarers and I understand that the Department for Transport's Shipping Task Force is examining their position under the legislation.
<P>

<a name="21028w05.html_para3">Turning to the Working Time Directive, sea transport is one of the sectors that were excluded from the original Directive as it is covered by other legislation. Non-mobile workers are covered by the Horizontal Amending Directive (2000/32/EC), which is due to be implemented by 1 August 2003. Seafarers are covered by Council Directive 1999/63/EC, implemented by the Merchant Shipping (Hours of Work) Regulations 2002 and Merchant Shipping (Medical Examination) Regulations 2002 and Council Directive 1999/95/EC, implemented by the Merchant Shipping (Hours of Work) Regulations 2002.

Although this is a cause for concern, Government generally do not interfere in what is essentially a competitive market on the basis that the terms and conditions of insurance policies are best set by insurers themselves in the light of their customers' needs, taking a commercial assessment of the risk to determine premiums. Companies experiencing difficulties in obtaining insurance cover are advised to contact Peter Staddon at the British Insurance Brokers' Association on 020 7397 0204 for general advice and assistance in finding a suitable insurance broker.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what representations she has received about improper transfer of energy accounts by npower; and if she will make a statement.  [75898]<P>

<P>
<a name="21028w06.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 I have received a number of representations about the erroneous transfer of gas and electricity supply by energy companies. Such transfers may arise from administrative or data problems or from sales malpractice. In January 2001, the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets (OFGEM), which regulates the sales activities of energy suppliers, imposed undertakings on npower following a rise in marketing complaints. These undertakings were lifted in April 2002 after npower met objectives agreed with OFGEM. OFGEM continues to monitor npower and other suppliers, and can investigate any company that appears to have breached the terms of its supply licence.

 'Your passport to export success' is a national Trade Partners UK programme, delivered regionally, to develop small businesses in international trade. Promotion is done regionally. There has been no national campaign, but the press has picked up success stories.

Our Embassy in Hanoi is a leading player in the EU Human Rights Working Group which has a regular human rights dialogue with the Vietnamese Government. Religious freedom is raised in this forum, for example at its most recent meeting on 16 October.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21028w09.html_spnew2"><B> Clare Short:  </B> 
It is a fundamental principle of the international and bilateral agencies working in Zimbabwe and elsewhere that food aid is targeted on the basis of need alone, and is not politically determined. The World Food Programme is working through non-governmental organisations under an agreement with the Government of Zimbabwe that enshrines this principle. Our bilateral feeding Programmes also work through NGOs on the same criteria, and within NGOs' established operational agreements with the Government of Zimbabwe. DFID and other donors are closely monitoring events on the ground to ensure that principles and agreements are honoured, and where problems are found or reported, that these are resolved through transparent complaints procedures.
<P>

<a name="21028w09.html_para0">Food assistance through the Government of Zimbabwe does not operate to similar levels of openness and transparency. I share the concern that there appears to be selective distribution. Whilst I am very concerned about malnutrition and hunger, it is premature to suggest there is starvation.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21028w09.html_spnew3"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 There has been no systematic obstruction of food aid provided by the UN agencies and international donors in Zimbabwe. There have been particular problems in one or two areas and for particular organisations apparently attributable solely to bias on the part of the authorities or local activists. There is on-going negotiation in country on problems for two UK NGOs. Where problems have arisen, aid has been suspended until the organisations concerned have been satisfied that unfettered distribution can resume. At present the major constraints to food aid are the need to scale up the capacity of all the implementation organisations, and to get full funding of the UN appeal.

It will also have a positive effect in countering the rate of increase of HIV/AIDS. The communicable disease control elements support strategies to combat the spread of tuberculosis, to improve immunisation coverage of childhood diseases, and to increase treatment and prevention of malaria.

 Health sector-wide approaches (SWAPs) enable better priority setting in the context of locally-owned strategies for improving health outcomes for the poorest. They facilitate joined up working between development partners, Governments and other stakeholders, and eliminate duplication and ineffective donor activity. Assessments of health SWAPs have been undertaken by inter alia the Overseas Development Institute. These show that SWAPs are more than a change in the form which development assistance takes. They are responsible for increased Government ownership and commitment to delivering accessible health care to the poorest through strengthened health systems.
<P>

<a name="21028w10.html_para0">In most cases it is still too early to assess the long term impact of SWAPs on health outcomes for the poor. However, there are many early positive outcomes. In Uganda and Tanzania the SWAP has helped better identify the health needs of the poorest. In Uganda, Mozambique and Ghana, more people are using health services. But SWAPs are a partnership: they will only deliver real pro-poor benefits with the continued political will and investment of both donors and developing country partners.

 The presence of land mines in Angola has understandably led Angolans to believe that they cannot move around their country in safety. This affects all aspects of rural life, and has meant that much farmland remains unused. Given that the season for planting seeds is now coming to an end, this is likely to have a significant impact on food production in Angola. As a result, demining of residential areas targeted for returnee communities, and their agricultural land, is the main priority for the clearance agencies after roads and bridges.

 Along with almost all other elements of the national infrastructure, the network of roads, bridges and railways has been severely damaged by the civil war. The Angolan Government has made rehabilitating the transport infrastructure a top priority, and some progress is now being made with vehicles able to reach the interior of the country, bringing goods and people. Arguably, however, rebuilding the physical infrastructure is only one of the key tasks which confronts the Government of Angola. They also urgently need to re-focus government spending on the social sector, in particular health and education, and to improve the macro-economic management of the country.

 UNHCR estimates that there are around 440,000 Angolan refugees in Zambia, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Namibia. UNHCR are co-ordinating the return and resettlement of these refugees. However plans are at an early stage, and although some refugees have chosen to return to Angola under their own steam, UNHCR do not expect to begin their return programme until 2003. The reintegration of refugees will take place against the backdrop of the widescale return of internally displaced people (IDPs) and former fighters anticipated by the Government. In reintegrating all three groups, it will be vital to ensure that adequate services reach the resettlement areas. We expect the Government of Angola to take the lead in this, and are pressing them to ensure that all resettlement is carried out in line with the Norms for Return and Re-settlement which are now part of Angolan law, and are based on the guiding principles drawn up by Francis Deng, the UN Special Rapporteur.

<a name="21028w10.html_spnew10"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 Angola is a very fertile country, and its agricultural potential is significant. Many of the internally displaced people (IDPs) and ex-combatants around the country have begun to plant, using seeds and tools provided by the international community. If this agricultural development is to be a success, Angolans will need timely provision of seeds and tools, and access to food and shelter (as well as a civil administration, schools and medical services and a functioning local judicial system) during the growing period. They will then need access to markets to exchange their surplus agricultural products for goods and services which they cannot themselves provide. A holistic approach is therefore essential.

To this end, we have recently allocated US$ 459,000 to UNDP for a project aimed at improving the effectiveness of mine action through strengthened coordination and planning at the provincial level.

 Unaccounted funds are related to the lack of transparency in oil sector flows and weak public finance management. During the past five years, extra-budgetary expenditures have averaged 11 per cent. of GDP per year, and residual unexplained discrepancies in the fiscal accounts have averaged 12 per cent. of GDP per year (approximately $1 billion). Budget execution data have yielded a large share of expenditures as unclassified; substantial funds received as signature bonuses for oil contracts and oil royalties have been outside the control of the Treasury; oil companies have given money to funds and foundations with little independent oversight; and non-transparent external debt transactions have been made. My Department is working with others to address these issues in a number of ways.

 My Department does not support any specific anti-corruption measures in Angola.

<P>
<a name="21028w10.html_spnew18"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 As a relatively small donor in Angola, my Department's strategy is based around a series of focused interventions in sectors where we feel we can best add value. These interventions include support to the disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration (DDR) process, provision of basic services in peri-urban shanty towns, and support to the interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (I-PRSP). We do not at present plan to support activities in the agricultural sector. However a number of other donors, including the USA and the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), have been carrying out seeds and tools programmes designed to help displaced people resettle on agricultural land.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21028w10.html_spnew19"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 The humanitarian situation in Angola is very serious. Prior to April 2002, more than 80 per cent. of the country was inaccessible. Since the cease-fire, already over-stretched aid agencies have been able to reach many thousands more severely malnourished people. The UN Under Secretary for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Co-ordination, Kenzo Oshima, estimated that a quarter of the population&#151;3 million people&#151;would require assistance in the next few months. WFP has raised its caseload figure of people requiring assistance to 1.9 million and this is expected to rise further following a DFID funded comprehensive needs assessment.
<P>

<a name="21028w10.html_para6">The UK has been working hard to ensure that donors and implementing partners develop a consensus view on future needs.

 UNHCR are co-ordinating the return and resettlement of refugees to Angola, and WFP will form part of the international community's response. However plans are at an early stage, and although some refugees have chosen to return to Angola under their own steam, UNHCR do not expect to begin their return programme until 2003. UNHCR have been keeping donors up to speed with their plans, but my Department had no specific discussions with them at this stage. Our focus to date has been on the urgent needs of internally displaced people (IDPs) and the former UNITA fighters, many of whom have begun to be resettled by the Government. We are in very close touch with WFP, and other agencies, on this and have recently given #250,000 to the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) for a project to assist the return and reintegration of IDPs in the Kuanza Sul and Huambo Provinces.

 Over the last 12 months, my Department has contributed #1.7 million to the United Nations appeal for Angola to ensure that critical humanitarian needs are met and to assist in the reception areas for ex UNITA fighters.

 Low public sector wages are one of the major constraints to the improved provision of services in many of our partner countries. However, all countries, not only developing ones, have limits regarding the affordability of pay increases. My Department is working with developing country governments in reforming all aspects of public sector management, which includes, where relevant, strategies to increase revenue as well as improving terms and conditions of service. Other reforms are also important&#151;such as better recruitment practice and performance management for all staff. But these reforms can be implemented only where Governments are committed to their implementation; we cannot demand that action be taken.

<a name="21028w11.html_spnew3"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 There is conflicting evidence on the impact of low public sector wages alone on the potential for corruption. It is widely assumed that extremely low public sector wages create a motivation for corrupt practices. However, there is increasing evidence that public sector wages will only have an impact on the levels of corruption when it is part of a comprehensive package of civil sector reform, including among others, merit-based recruitment and promotion, replacement of corrupt personnel (particularly managers) and appropriate training.

 The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) provide an internationally agreed framework for assessing the overall effectiveness of the development effort. A working set of 48 indicators has been agreed against which to measure progress. These provide a baseline for the international community to help ensure an adequate set of internationally available indicators that the UN will use to report global progress annually.
<P>

<a name="21028w12.html_para6">Within individual countries DFID and other donors are committed to using Government performance indicators and data whenever possible to monitor progress. This minimises additional demands for information on developing countries, and allows us to strengthen country statistical systems at the same time as improving data for measuring our own effectiveness.
<P>

<a name="21028w12.html_para7">Most of the world's poorest countries are developing Poverty Reduction Strategies (PRSs) which set out how their Governments will address poverty. These PRSs must set out a monitoring framework which specifies the indicators which the Government and donors will use to assess progress. These frameworks have focussed attention on the poor quality and availability of existing data, and have encouraged increased and better co-ordinated Government and donor support to build capacity to collect the information required. DFID is currently supporting the PRS monitoring process in several countries, including Uganda, Malawi, Pakistan and Ghana, both directly and by helping to build general statistical capacity to underpin the PRS framework. Other bilateral donors are supporting efforts here and elsewhere. Strengthening country data systems also improves the availability and quality of the

<P>

<a name="21028w12.html_para8">In addition, there are several multilateral initiatives which aim to improve the quality of data available within partner countries. The IMF's General Data Dissemination System project&#151;partly funded by DFID&#151;supports African countries in drawing up and implementing plans for improving their statistical systems. The World bank is currently considering ways of improving its capacity for results-based management, including new ways of increasing the funding available for statistical capacity building.

 The Government of Sudan and the Sudan People's Liberation Movement/Army parties resumed the Inter Governmental Authority on Development (IGAD) talks on 14 October. The parties have agreed a Memorandum of Understanding on a cessation of hostilities for the duration of the talks. This was implemented on 17 October. We warmly welcome these developments. The cessation of hostilities will improve the atmosphere for the negotiations and facilitate the delivery of humanitarian assistance. We urge the parties to seize this opportunity and shall continue to provide our full support as they work for a just and lasting peace. We have provided, and continue to provide, political and financial support to the Sudanese peace negotiations being mediated by the regional IGAD envoys in Kenya. We will continue to attend the talks as an observer and offer support and advice as necessary.

 Repression of ethnic minorities is one of the deplorable human rights abuses resulting from the long-running conflict in Sudan. We are concerned about the human rights of all in the Sudan regardless of their ethnic or religious background and we regularly urge all sides in the civil war to respect and promote human rights and fundamental freedoms. But the only long-term answer to the suffering in the Sudan is a peace settlement which will allow the people to rebuild their lives. We actively support the Inter-Governmental Authority on Development (IGAD) peace process as offering the best chance to bring an end to the civil war through a negotiated settlement.

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development if she will publish the text of the final list of requests for market access tabled by the European Commission under the general agreement on trade in services; and what she estimates their impact would be on <i>(a)</i> poverty and <i>(b)</i> sustainable development in each of the developing countries affected.  [76267]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21028w13.html_spnew0"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 Requests for market access as part of the general agreement on trade in services (GATS) are made on a bilateral basis with WTO members making requests directly to other members. The commitments then offered by countries receiving requests will be made public by the WTO and will apply to all WTO members according to the Xmost favoured nation" principle. Countries are therefore not under any obligation to make their requests public and any information regarding these requests would ordinarily be treated as confidential by the WTO secretariat. The European Commission has, however, published a summary of its requests on its website (http://europa.eu.int/comm/trade/services/gats&#151;sum.htm).
<P>

<a name="21028w13.html_para0">It should be stressed that regardless of the requests being made or the Member making them, no country receiving requests is under any obligation to make commitments in any sector. The GATS is a Xbottom-up" agreement whereby countries individually choose in which sectors they want to make binding commitments and in which they do not.
<P>

<a name="21028w13.html_para1">For developing countries to make informed decisions regarding the liberalisation of service sectors (or any other area of trade liberalisation) they must have a clear understanding of the likely impact any such actions will have on their domestic economies and the livelihoods of their citizens, especially the poor. This is why DFID is engaging with a variety of donor organisations (primarily the World bank and UNCTAD) to help ensure that developing countries are given adequate support in this area.
<P>

<a name="21028w13.html_para2">However, the number of developing countries involved in the GATS negotiations is very large (the majority of WTO members are developing countries) and it would not be possible for DFID to collect and present impact assessments for all these countries.
<P>

<a name="21028w13.html_para3">Instead, each country will be responsible for carrying out its own assessments which it may or may not choose to make public. DFID's role is to help ensure that developing countries have the necessary capacity to carry out informative and useful impact assessments which take proper account of the interests of the poor and of sustainable development issues.

<a name="21028w13.html_spnew2"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend has made it clear that students will not suffer financial disadvantage as a result of changing their institution due to regrading of A-level results. The A-level claims fund has been established to meet the legitimate costs of students who are able to transfer and students have until 31 January 2003 to apply. The fund can meet accommodation, books, travel and, where necessary, tuition fees, as well as other costs at the discretion of the institution.
<P>

<a name="21028w13.html_para4">The costs falling to the fund are not likely to be high, given the relatively small number of students affected. Institutions will pay claims from students in the first instance and they will be fully reimbursed.

 Through the Special Educational Needs and Disability Act 2001, the Government have amended the Disability Discrimination Act to place new duties on providers of post-16 education. These duties started to be effective from September 2002. It is now unlawful to discriminate against disabled students by treating them less favourably than others, and responsible bodies have a duty to provide reasonable adjustments to provision where disabled students might otherwise be substantially disadvantaged. This duty includes ensuring that any course materials provided to disabled students are available in an accessible format.

 <i>[holding answer 24 October 2002]:</i> The Industrial Training Act 1982 gives industrial training boards the power to raise a levy from employers in the industry they cover. The Engineering Construction Industry Training Board (ECITB) makes annual proposals to me for its levy arrangements, including the rates of levy that it feels are needed to encourage adequate training. The proposals must have the agreement of organisations representing the majority of those employers who pay most of the levy. Parliamentary approval is also required before I can make an order to put them into effect. I have no plans at present to change the legislation.

 This Government are committed to widening participation in higher education. Our reform of secondary education will improve attainment levels and encourage greater numbers to enter higher education. Through our 14&#150;19 proposals we will ensure that young people have access to both academic and vocational study which is attractive and relevant to them, further raising the post-16 staying on rate, levels of attainment and aspirations.
<P>

<a name="21028w14.html_para0">We have introduced the Excellence Challenge, worth over #190 million over three years, which will raise aspirations and attainment in some of the country's most deprived areas, and our AimHigher campaign promotes the benefits of higher education to young people. We have also increased student support for those who need it, including Opportunity Bursaries for young people from low income backgrounds, increased Access and Hardship Funds and a new child care grant and travel, books and equipment grant for student parents.
<P>

<a name="21028w14.html_para1">The forthcoming higher education strategy document will set out a 10-year vision for developing higher education, and widening participation will naturally be a key element of that vision.

 Defra came into existence in June 2001 as a result of machinery of Government changes. It took several months to incorporate all staff of the new organisation into the Department's HR system. Therefore, the information requested is not available for the period in question.

 Defra funding at Horticulture Research International (HRI) relates to specifically commissioned R&D projects and work won by HRI through our R&D competitions. We have also given HRI grants for capital and other purposes. A summary of the total funding provided by Defra (and, prior to 2001&#150;02, MAFF) in each of the last five years is given in the table. I also refer the hon. Member to the reply given in relation to question 192.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what steps the Government are taking to stop the illegal trade in ivory.  [76094]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21028w16.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Commercial trade in ivory is currently prohibited under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). In order to prevent illegal trade, the UK has strict controls which are actively enforced by HM Customs and Excise. Between 1 April and 30 September 2002, Customs made 55 seizures of ivory, including two weighing 26.6kg and 445kg. Under the Customs and Excise Management Act (1979) the illegal import or export of ivory can result in an unlimited fine and/or up to seven years imprisonment. Similarly, under the Control of Endangered Species (Enforcement) Regulations (1997) the illegal, commercial use of ivory within the UK can lead to an unlimited fine and/or up to two years imprisonment.
<P>

<a name="21028w16.html_para0">The UK has also provided #60,000 towards the Elephant Trade Information System (ETIS) which provides information on the worldwide illegal trade in ivory. ETIS has just produced a detailed report which will be considered at the twelfth Conference of CITES Parties (CoP12), in Chile, next month, when the issue of whether to allow the resumption of trade in ivory from five southern African states will be discussed. The UK will not support any proposal which seems likely to undermine the conservation of the elephant, or lead to an increase in the illegal killing of elephants.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what mechanisms she is using to monitor the conservation duty on internal drainage boards in the Land Drainage Act 1994; and what action she is taking to enforce this duty.  [76387]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21028w16.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 In November 1999, following Ministerial agreement with the Environment Agency, the Local Government Association and the Association of Drainage Authorities, the Government published a number of High Level Targets (HLT) for flood and coastal defence operating authorities. These targets were adopted by Defra on its creation in June 2001.
<P>

<a name="21028w16.html_para1">High Level Target 1 requires all flood and coastal defence operating authorities to produce a publicly available policy statement setting out plans for delivering the Government's policy aims and objectives. Section 2.3 of Defra's guidance on preparing these policy statements requires internal drainage boards to state in their policy how they will comply with statutory environmental obligations and contribute to relevant biodiversity targets.
<P>

<a name="21028w16.html_para2">HLT9 and 10 are designed to ensure that all operating authorities meet their obligation to 'further the conservation and enhancement of natural beauty and the conservation of flora, fauna and geological or physiographical features of special interest' as required under Section 61A of the Land Drainage Act 1994.
<P>

<a name="21028w16.html_para3">HLT9 requires all operating authorities, in addition to their statutory obligations when carrying out flood and coastal defence works, to aim:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>to avoid damage to environmental interest;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>to ensure no net loss to habitats covered by Biodiversity Action Plans (BAP habitats); and</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>to seek opportunities for environmental enhancement.</FONT></UL>

<P>

<a name="21028w16.html_para4">They are further required to report all losses and gains of BAP habitats resulting from their flood and coastal defence operations to the Environment Agency. The agency report on the collated information annually to Defra.
<P>

<a name="21028w16.html_para5">Under HLT10, all operating authorities are required to complete and implement Water Level Management Plans, in partnership with English Nature, for sites designated under the European birds and habitats directives and for sites of special scientific interest. The Environment Agency is required to report annually to Defra on operating authorities' progress in implementing and reviewing WLMPs against their published programme.

 Complaints concerning services relating to railways are a matter for the Rail Regulator exercising concurrent jurisdiction with the Director General of Fair Trading. Section 55 and schedule 11 of the Competition Act 1998 imposes a general restriction on disclosure of information. No information relating to the affairs of an individual, or any particular business or undertaking, can be disclosed during the individual's lifetime or while the business is carried on unless consent is obtained.

 Concessionary travel, as it currently stands, contributes to social inclusion by making transport more affordable to older and disabled people, who are often on lower incomes. However, others who may be socially excluded might also benefit from cheaper bus fares, but cannot do so under the current arrangements. We are therefore considering, in the context of our review on bus subsidies, whether local authorities should have greater discretion to extend lower fares to other groups such as those who are

 No. A working group was set up in 1988&#150;89 that examined the design options for central reservation policy. It took account of European practice at that time. It did not find any evidence of significant benefits for safety, the environment or tourism in the use of such planting.

 The Strategic Rail Authority (SRA) has a duty under S206(4) of the Transport Act 2000 to consider the introduction of regional Eurostar services. The SRA have said that they will soon publish a strategy relating to services in various parts of Great Britain for facilitating the carriage of passengers or goods by rail by way of the channel tunnel.

<P>
<a name="21028w19.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Buses and coaches have consistently been one of the safest forms of passenger transport. Since 2001 we have introduced requirements to improve their very good safety record such as the fitment of anti lock braking systems, seat belts in coaches and improved designs of buses to cater for disabled passengers. In the longer term we are working with others to improve the European standard for the protection of coach passengers in the event of a roll over accident. The revised standard is not expected to be applied to new coaches until after 2004.

 My Department supports the work of Kick it Out and Show Racism the Red Card, which co-ordinate anti-racism work in football. Both bodies are co-sponsored by the Football Foundation, through which public funding for the sport is channelled.

 Customs and Excise's New Export System (NES) went live at all Maritime and Inland locations (including Inland Clearance Depots) throughout the UK on 27 October 2002. NES is an 



<P>
<P><I>28 Oct 2002 : Column 606W</I><P>
electronic-based system which enables exporters and agents to send their export declarations to Customs electronically.
<P>

<a name="21028w23.html_para0">It replaces the current paper-based system, facilitates legitimate trade and helps combat VAT and Excise fraud. NES provides a number of tailored models and procedures to meet the needs of different trade sectors. It will allow Customs to target their controls more effectively and therefore minimise disruption to legitimate trade; and there will be a reduction in the time it takes to process an export declaration.
<P>

<a name="21028w23.html_para1">The legal basis for the information supplied by exporters and their agents under NES is the Community Customs Code (Council Regulation (EEC) 2913/92) and the Implementing Regulation (Commission Regulation (EEC) 2454/93). Article 15 of the Community Customs Code imposes an obligation of privacy on customs authorities. NES complies with the Data Protection Act (DPA) 1998.
<P>

<a name="21028w23.html_para2">The Paymaster General received one representation on NES from the British International Freight Association (BIFA) on 20 December last year, to which the Financial Secretary replied on 24 January 2002.
<P>

<a name="21028w23.html_para3">To operate the New Export System electronically a digital certificate may be required. Either an individual or an organisation may apply for a digital certificate.Customs require Level 2 Security to meet authentication and non-repudiation requirements for all non-European Community declarations made via the world wide web to their export declaration processing system.
<P>

<a name="21028w23.html_para4">The policy of the e-Envoy's Office is that Level 2 security requirements should be met by use of digital certificates. Customs have adopted the e-Envoy's Office's policy for Level 2. Agreements concerning digital certificates are a contractual matter between the issuer and applicant; the Electronic Communications Act 2000 and the EU Electronic Signatures Directive determine the general legal admissibility of digital certificates.
<P>

<a name="21028w23.html_para5">The Government do not approve or carry out audits of digital certificate providers, but it encourages them to seek approval from tScheme, a voluntary, not-for-profit, industry-led body or an equivalent approval scheme. Equifax is one of several digital certificate suppliers undergoing tScheme accreditation. tScheme is the organisation set up to create strict service criteria and to approve electronic trust services, including qualified certificate services. Any digital certificate provider that meets the tScheme requirements and is technically compatible is able to supply digital certificates that can be used with the Government Gateway. Other providers are ChamberSign and BT Trust Services (available from mid-November 2002).
<P>

<a name="21028w23.html_para6">The only contract between these digital certificate providers and the UK Government are a standard Xrelying party agreement". This contract ensures that each provider supplies up-to-date lists of all digital certificate holders so that the UK Government can verify their identities when transacting through the Government Gateway.

<P>

<a name="21028w23.html_para7">The information supplied by applicants will depend on the certificate issuer and the intended use of the certificate. Any personal information provided and not intended for public access is covered by the DPA. It is not the Government's role to make assessments on the compliance of certificate issuers with the DPA but they are bound by its requirements.
<P>

<a name="21028w23.html_para8">Whether or not a digital certificate complies with US export laws is a matter for the firm and the issuer of the certificate, not the UK Government. The certificate policy should make clear the extent of any liability of the certificate issuer to the certificate relying party. This is a matter for the certificate issuer and the applicant.

 Under Pay As You Earn a code number is used to ensure that about the right amount of tax is deducted from pay according to an individual's known circumstances. And, at the end of the year, the Inland Revenue checks to see that the correct amount of tax has been paid. The Inland Revenue issues approximately 26 million notices of coding every year and each is based on the latest information available.
<P>

<a name="21028w23.html_para9">The Inland Revenue computer systems automatically determine a code number for each taxpayer prior to the start of each tax year. During the tax year, some code numbers are revised by staff on receipt of information from a taxpayer or employer. The Inland Revenue undertakes annual reviews to monitor the accuracy of work in the Department. This shows that coding accuracy in 2001&#150;02 was 94 per cent.

 XRed diesel" is gas oil which has been marked with a red dye and a tracer chemical making it eligible for a rebated rate of excise duty. The effective duty rate in the UK is currently 3.13 pence per litre. This rebate is specific to the UK. While many other EU member states operate rebate schemes that are similar to the UK's, they are applied in very different ways so no direct comparison is possible.

 The Financial Services Authority issued a discussion paper on the split capital investment trust market in December 2001. The results of this discussion paper were published in May 2002. Since then the FSA have been investigating past problems, including possible problems with marketing literature, possible mis-selling and alleged collusive behaviour by some managers of split capital trusts. Looking forward, they have been considering if any changes are needed to the rules of their regulatory handbook or the listing rules.

 The police have powers to confiscate alcohol from under-age drinkers in public places (Confiscation of Alcohol (Young Persons) Act 1997). Section 29 of the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001 further clarified the confiscation powers. This enables the police to deal with situations where young people's drinking is causing a nuisance to others or may lead to bad behaviour. We have taken careful note of representations from the police to increase the confiscation powers to include sealed containers, and we intend to bring forward amendments to do this when parliamentary time allows.

 A major Home Office review of all aspects of the use of anti-social behaviour orders (ASBOs) was published in April 2002. The review found that ASBOs were being used successfully to reduce many different types of anti-social behaviour, although there were some areas in which the orders were not being applied for. In response to these findings we brought forward a wide range of enhancements to the law relating to ASBOs in the Police Reform Act.

 The advisory group, chaired by Professor Sir Bernard Crick, will be making recommendations on language and citizenship education for people seeking naturalisation. The advisory group is working on a programme of study, which will be part of English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) language teaching for those assessed as not having sufficient English. The Group has had two meetings so far and intends issuing an interim report early in the New Year, with a final report around Easter 2003.

<P>

<a name="21028w25.html_para4">The Group is presently interpreting 'sufficient English' as meaning enough linguistic ability to sustain unskilled employment in an English-speaking environment. For those with that minimal level already, they consider that attendance at classes should raise their level of competence to the next entry level, as defined in the existing adult learning language skills criteria. In other words, the Group is considering the concept of attendance and progression, rather than requiring all applicants to reach an absolute standard that for some might never be achievable.
<P>

<a name="21028w25.html_para5">The Group has considered whether there might be some sort of screening process to filter out those people who already have sufficient English. While we do not want to make unnecessary work for people who already have a good command of one of the UK languages, we do want them to demonstrate their knowledge of life in the UK. Screening might also be used to allocate people to programmes which best meet their needs. ESOL

teachers are well used to assessing linguistic capability to get people on to the right course and a number of such tools already exist.
<P>

<a name="21028w25.html_para6">Defining these borderlines more precisely will of course take a little time. Issues of numbers and resources, as well as standards, will also need to be considered. And, as I have said already, those with good English already may not be required to attend all the classes and may study privately for the citizenship element of the programme. This will require some innovative thought about delivery methods, bearing in mind that the overall objective is to facilitate integration and not just to test knowledge.
<P>

<a name="21028w25.html_para7">For those people for whom any course of study would be too challenging, perhaps by virtue of their age or infirmity, or because they have learning difficulties, the Bill includes a provision to waive these requirements. So, people who can provide sound reasons for not demonstrating progress or achievement will not be debarred from acquiring British citizenship.

<P>

<a name="21028w25.html_para10">I understand that, because some migrants do not become eligible for free education immediately, the Group intends recommending that the kind of information contained in the XLiving in Britain" programme should be made available, perhaps at the point at which entry clearance is granted, to people such as work permit holders or spouses who have an avenue to indefinite leave to remain. For this purpose, the members will be proposing that the Government produces a 'Living in Britain' booklet to be given out at ports of entry or at posts abroad. Such a booklet could be translated into a number of languages to help those who, as yet, have not acquired language skills but who could, nevertheless, benefit from what it contains in their path to becoming active, involved citizens.

 I regret that the information requested is not available. In 2001, 65 per cent. of applications for asylum were made in-country and 35 per cent. were made at port.
<P>

<a name="21028w26.html_para1">The 1951 United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees recognised that people trying to escape persecution often relied upon the use of false documents and unusual means of travel. Article 31 of the Convention provides that refugees should not have any penalties imposed upon them as a consequence of entering the country of refuge illegally in order to seek sanctuary, provided that they travel to that country directly from their own country, present themselves to the domestic authorities without delay and show good cause for their illegal entry or presence.

 Discussions with European colleagues about the problem of child prostitution have been largely in the context of negotiations over a Draft European Union Council Framework Decision on combating the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography. This will require member states to criminalise particular aspects of the sexual exploitation

<P>

<a name="21028w26.html_para7">Strengthening our laws to meet the requirements of the framework decision will form part of our plans to reform the framework of laws dealing with sexual offences on which we will be publishing a paper later this autumn. This follows on from XSetting the Boundaries", the report of the Review of Sex Offences published in July 2000, which made a number of recommendations to strengthen the law, including providing better legal safeguards against those who seek to exploit children in prostitution.
<P>

<a name="21028w26.html_para8">We also issued in May 2000 guidance to the police and other agencies on XSafeguarding Children Involved in Prostitution", which highlighted the importance of children involved in prostitution being treated primarily as abused children. This followed discussions with representatives from the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) and the other agencies concerned.
<P>

<a name="21028w26.html_para9">Moreover, we have been supporting under the Crime Reduction Programme a number of local projects aimed at evaluating best practice in dealing with prostitution, including how best to help young people leave behind their involvement in prostitution. All these projects are supported or led by the police and involve local agencies working together to find practical solutions. The aim is to identify the most effective strategies so that these can be disseminated.

<a name="21028w26.html_para10">A public awareness campaign was launched by the Home Office in December 2001, following discussion in the Task Force, to alert children of 14&#150;16 and parents of younger children to the dangers presented by paedophiles using the internet, to deliver key safety messages, and to advise them of sources of information and support. The campaign used advertisements in national newspapers and magazines, radio, cinemas, satellite TV, and online. The key points were to make clear that someone a child meets on the internet may not be who they seem, and that children should not give out personal information online. This was well received and evaluation showed that it was successful in raising awareness of the key messages. We are now considering further activity to be carried out later this year.

 Crime against the elderly is horrifying, but is thankfully uncommon; levels fell by 20 per cent. between British Crime Survey (BCS) 1996 and BCS 2000, and older people are on average only a sixth as likely as the young to suffer a personal crime. We are making special efforts to reduce the chances still further, and in particular we have developed and implemented a strategy to clamp down on the despicable crime of distraction burglary. Levels of fear of crime among older people are still too high; we are committed to reducing them, and we are working with charities such as Help The Aged to find new and better ways of tackling fear of crime among seniors as well as crimes against them.

While we are considering incentives and further ways to enhance activities available to detainees, we have no plans to require detainees to undertake paid work or to assist in the running of removal centres.

 The Government strongly believe that custody for juveniles should very much be a last resort, and we have provided the courts with a wide range of community-based penalties which are specifically targeted at young people. Sadly, however, we recognise that there is a small minority of young people&#151;just 4 per cent. of those juveniles dealt with by police and courts each year&#151;whose offending is so serious or so persistent, that custody may be the only immediate answer. In those cases, we must ensure that such a sentence is as constructive an experience for them as possible, and to this end we have introduced the new Detention and Training Order for juveniles and improved the custodial regimes with supervision and support after release.

Subsequent investigations of a suspected money laundering offence are undertaken primarily by police forces, the National Crime Squad or Her Majesty's Customs and Excise (HMCE), but can also fall within the investigative remit of other agencies such as the Serious Fraud Office or Inland Revenue. Prosecutions for money laundering offences are conducted by the Crown Prosecution Service and HMCE.

Its aim will be to target the most prolific offenders, to bring more offences committed by them to justice, and to rehabilitate them more effectively. This scheme is an important part of the 'Narrowing the Justice Gap' programme which aims to reduce the difference between the number of crimes reported to the police and the number of offences brought to justice. In addition the Government have already: given the courts new secure remand and tagging powers for 12 to 16-year olds who repeatedly offend on bail; funded the Youth Justice Board's intensive supervision and surveillance programmes for the most prolific young offenders; and renewed its commitment to maintain the time from arrest to sentence for persistent young offenders at or below 71 days.

 The Police Negotiating Board (PNB) Agreement of 9 May, approved by the Secretary of State, contains a number of measures that will improve the pay and conditions of all police officers and particularly frontline officers from 1 April 2003. There will be a new special priority payment scheme which is targeted on frontline operational officers in particular and gives extra rewards to officers in the most difficult and demanding posts. In addition, there will be increases in basic pay on top of the annual police pay award, shorter pay scales and competence-related pay for the most experienced officers in the federated ranks.

 The number of police officers in England and Wales is the highest ever, 129,603 officers on 31 March 2002. Police strength is on track to reach our target of 130,000 officers by March 2003. We have set a further target for it to reach 132,500 officers in 2004.

 We are committed to tackling the administrative burdens and inefficient working practices that keep officers off the streets. My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary established a task force, under the chairmanship of Sir David O'Dowd, to identify ways in which forces can free up the time of front line officers. The task force's report was published on 17 September and contained 52 recommendations to increase the presence of police in communities. This is a vital opportunity to change the culture of the police service and bring about a real difference to the everyday lives of officers on the front line.

 Measures already in place include a new police driver training course, launched in December 2000, which introduced a universal standard for driving in England and Wales. An essential element of the course is that officers should recognise the need to give priority to public safety above all other considerations such as attending an incident or apprehending a suspect. Where pursuits are concerned, there is a nationally agreed ACPO Pursuit Code of Practice and it is already police policy to consider continuously the consequences

 The Government believe that prison is right for those convicted of an offence who are a danger to the public or who are serious or persistent offenders and that sentences served should be as long as necessary for punishment, public protection and rehabilitation but no longer. It also recognises that short sentences with no support and no supervision after release do not allow the correctional services to do effective behavioural or rehabilitation work with offenders. We set out our proposals for reducing the use of short sentences in the White Paper XJustice for All".
<P>

<a name="21028w31.html_para1">Home detention curfew plays an important role in managing the prison population by enabling prisoners to be released from prison early, while still subject to restrictions placed on their liberty. This facilitates a smoother and more effective integration back into the community and helps offenders to serve or resume employment or training as soon as possible.
<P>

<a name="21028w31.html_para2">As also announced in the White Paper XJustice for All" I have commissioned an independent review of the correctional services in England and Wales looking particularly at effectiveness and value for money in the delivery of services to reduce re-offending and how we improve our ability to manage the prison population.

 The Government's street crime initiative is targeted at the 10 forces which account for 83 per cent. of robbery in England and Wales. The initiative is serving to identify and remove any systemic blockages which currently hinder the tackling of street crime not only in those 10 areas, but across the country. Good practice in partnership working across the criminal justice system and between other agencies will be disseminated to all areas, including Sussex.
<P>

<a name="21028w32.html_para3">The Government have recently published figures for the first six months of the initiative including a document detailing the achievements made through partnership working, the XDelivering the Street Crime Initiative: Partnership in Operation" can be found in the Library or on the Crime Reduction website on www.crimereduction.gov.uk/streetcrime.
<P>

<a name="21028w32.html_para4">Examples of what has been achieved so far which have national implication are:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The extension of section 130 of the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001 to provide for remands of 12 to 16-year-olds. This power has now been extended to the rest of the country.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The extension of the Bail Act 1976 and the Child and Young Persons Act 1969 to provide tagging while on bail for 12 to 17-year-olds.

The provision of door-steeping conditions while on bail which allows police officers to check on curfew conditions.</FONT></UL>

the police and other criminal justice agencies, and local government. The group's discussions have focussed on how the police in the 10 areas with the highest levels of street crime can target the problem most effectively. They have also been on how the whole of Government can make a difference, how other agencies, the Crown Prosecution Service, the courts, the Youth Justice Board, schools, local authorities, health, education and social services can join together in a concerted effort to rid the streets of crime on a sustainable basis.

 On 14 October 2002, my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary announced the results of the Street Crime Initiative to date. The figures show that, since the start of the initiative, street crime has fallen by 16 per cent. during the period April to September in the 10 police forces which accounted for over 80 per cent. of the robbery problem in 2001&#150;02. For robbery, the more serious offence, the number of offences in September is 25 per cent. lower than March for the 10 forces as a whole.
<P>

<a name="21028w32.html_para6">The new figures show that what was an escalating situation has been reversed over the period since the launch of the Street Crime Initiative. There has been a 10 per cent. reduction (4,600 offences) in the number of robberies during the period April to September, compared to the same period last year.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21028w33.html_spnew6"><B> Maria Eagle  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 21 October 2002]:</i> Disability living allowance and attendance allowance are designed to provide a contribution towards the extra costs associated with severe disability. The benefits are assessed by looking at the disabled person's care needs and, in the case of disability living allowance, mobility needs.
<P>

<a name="21028w33.html_para6">Disability living allowance was introduced in 1992 by bringing together the separate attendance and mobility allowances into a single benefit, which gave additional help to severely disabled people under age 65 for whom disability is more financially disruptive in terms of lost opportunity to earn and save.
<P>

<a name="21028w33.html_para7">The vast majority of people can expect to have some restrictions as they get older and it is reasonable to expect people to make provision for this. Attendance allowance continues to be available for severely disabled people aged 65 or over who need help with personal care.
<P>

<a name="21028w33.html_para8">Disability living allowance unified and simplified the six months qualifying test inherited from attendance allowance and the 12-month prospective qualifying test inherited from mobility allowance by providing that a severely disabled person must have satisfied the entitlement conditions throughout the past three months and be likely to continue to satisfy them throughout the next six months.
<P>

<a name="21028w33.html_para9">Attendance allowance retains a six month qualifying period because a prospective test is less likely to be relevant to the disabilities&#151;often degenerative&#151;suffered by older people.

 Disability living allowance is a non-contributory benefit designed to complement the substantial range of other help available to severely disabled people in the United Kingdom. It has always been Government policy, therefore, that it should be available only to people who normally reside here.
<P>

<a name="21028w33.html_para11">Disability living allowance is listed as a 'special non-contributory' benefit in EEC Regulation 1408/71.

<a name="21028w34.html_spnew0"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 We believe that the current disregard of #10 a week for war disablement and war widows' pensions in the income-related benefits strikes the right balance between acknowledging the special reasons for these pensions and prudent use of public funds.
<P>

<a name="21028w34.html_para0">In addition to the statutory provision, local authorities have the discretionary power to disregard up to the full amount of any war pension in housing benefit and council tax benefit. Any amount on top of the #10 statutory disregard is funded from authorities' own resources.
<P>

<a name="21028w34.html_para1">Local authorities, through their discretionary schemes, are best placed to determine the needs of their local residents, taking account of local priorities. We have no plans to change the present arrangements.

 Incapacity benefit recipients with an occupational pension were not separately identified prior to 6 April 2001 as receipt of a pension was irrelevant to their claim. Therefore this information is not available.

 Customers will be able to choose from a range of account options. For some people the Post Office card account may not be the most suitable option and they may prefer to use an account with a cheque book or pass book. Customers will be supplied with information which clearly sets out their account options and which will enable them to decide which is right for them.
<P>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Death rates from breast cancer in women are given in the first table, for each county in England, and for the whole of Wales. The most recent ten year period for which these data are available is 1992 to 2001.

The equivalent figures for Northern Ireland are not readily available.</FONT></UL>

Rates for the years 1993 to 2000 have therefore been adjusted by 2.7 per cent. to produce comparable trends for this period.<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Health how much has been spent on raising awareness of breast cancer since 1997; what progress has been made in cutting the number of deaths from breast cancer since 1997; and what care is available to people who suffer emotionally from the removal of a breast after treatment for breast cancer.  [74406]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21028w34.html_spnew9"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 We congratulate the charities that work together on breast cancer awareness month and their efforts to raise awareness of the disease. In addition to these efforts, the Government have spent approximately #10,000 on a breast awareness teaching kit for primary care in conjunction with the European Community and the cancer research campaign. #38,500 has also been spent nationally on XBe Breast Aware" leaflets and #131,000 on information leaflets for women about breast screening.
<P>

<a name="21028w34.html_para9">There has been a 6 per cent. reduction in deaths from breast cancer between 1997 and 2000. The annual numbers of deaths in England has decreased from 11,240 in 1997 to 10,609 in 2000. Over the same period the age standardised death rate for breast cancer has fallen by 7.7 per cent. from 1997 to 2000.
<P>

<a name="21028w34.html_para10">The National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) is due to publish guidelines on supportive and palliative care in October 2002. This will include guidance on information, communication and psychological and social support. The NICE guidance is now available for consultation on the NICE website at www.nice.org.uk.
<P>

<a name="21028w34.html_para11">The Patient Cancer Survey 1999&#150;2000 found that women with breast cancer reported generally positive experiences of breast cancer services.

 The Department has received a number of informal representations about waiting times for radiotherapy. In order to tackle radiotherapy waiting times, we are making unprecedented investment in new radiotherapy facilities, streamlining care processes through the cancer services collaborative and working to best utilise the current workforce and to increase the number of staff in post and in training.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what representations his Department has received concerning the effectiveness of new systems for logging data relating to cancer treatment introduced under the NHS cancer plan; and if he will make a statement on these systems.  [75784]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21028w35.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 No representations have been received. Monitoring the national health service cancer plan targets robustly and effectively requires the ability to track information across the patient pathway of care, from urgent general practitioner referral for suspected cancer, to their first definitive treatment. The Department, in collaboration with the NHS information authority, is developing a national database so that this data can be collated nationally and locally. The database is currently undergoing user testing in the NHS prior to general introduction.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health (1) what the waiting list for breast cancer was for each month since September 2002; and how many breast cancer patients were tested to ascertain their suitability for a NICE-approved treatment for each of these months;  [75796]
<P>
<UL>(2) what the waiting lists for breast cancer were for each month since September 2000; and how many <i>(a)</i> prostrate, <i>(b)</i> ovarian and <i>(c)</i> lung cancer patients were tested to ascertain their suitability for a NICE-approved treatment in each of these months;  [75797]

(3) what the waiting lists for breast cancer were for each month since September 2000; and how many leukaemia patients were tested to ascertain their suitability for a NICE-approved treatment in each of these months.  [75798]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21028w35.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 Data on waiting lists for breast, leukaemia, prostate, ovarian and lung cancer for each month since September 2000 are not collected centrally.
<P>

<a name="21028w35.html_para0">The cancer plan sets out waiting times targets for cancer treatment that will be implemented over the next five years. By 2005, all cancer patients will wait a maximum of one month from diagnosis to treatment and a maximum of two months from urgent general practitioner referral to treatment.

 The NHS cancer plan set out new goals to reduce waiting times for cancer treatment. The ultimate goal is that no one should wait longer than one month from an urgent general practitioner referral for suspected cancer to the beginning of treatment except for a good clinical reason or through patient choice.
<P>

<a name="21028w35.html_para4">The first step in reducing cancer waiting times was the introduction of the two week waiting time standard from urgent general practitioner (GP) referral to out-patient appointment for cases of suspected breast cancer from April 1999. The two week standard was extended to all other urgent cases of suspected cancer during 2000.
<P>

<a name="21028w35.html_para5">From December 2001 targets of a one month maximum wait from diagnosis to first treatment for breast cancer and a one month maximum wait from urgent general practitioner referral to first treatment for children's cancers, testicular cancer and acute leukaemia were introduced.

The table shows good progress in increasing the number of doctors working in cancer services. This increase means the national health service is on track to hit the target set out in the cancer plan of nearly 1,000 extra cancer consultants by 2006.

<P>
<a name="21028w37.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 When the Department becomes aware of an impending licence for a significant new cancer treatment it is considered for referral to the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE). The appraisal process takes a minimum of 54 weeks from referral to completion as it has been designed to allow the full participation of patients, clinicians, companies and stakeholders. NICE is fully aware of the need to ensure that the process is as streamlined as possible, without losing any of the important safeguards it contains, in order to publish guidance soon after the treatments are launched.

<P>
<P>

 The Government recognises the importance of physical activity to improving health and has set up a programme of activity to increase rates of physical activity. Together with the Countryside 



<P>
<P><I>28 Oct 2002 : Column 664W</I><P>
Agency and Sport England, the Department is developing a programme of local exercise action pilots (LEAPs), which will test out different community approaches to increasing physical activity. The results will inform and lead action on physical activity across the National Health service.
<P>

<a name="21028w37.html_para0">Local strategies to increase physical activity are being developed as part of the national service framework for coronary heart disease. To support the development of local physical activity programmes, the Department published a national quality assurance framework for exercise referral systems in April 2001. This offers guidance to primary care and fitness professionals who work together to offer tailored exercise programmes to patients whose health would benefit from increased exercise.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21028w37.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 The issue of whether Primary Care Trusts (PCTs) should appoint physical activity co-ordinators as part of their public health teams is a matter for local determination. However, what is clear is that PCTs have a role in delivering improvements to public health, including increasing rates of physical activity. In order to assist PCTs in this, together with the Countryside Agency and Sport England, the Department is developing a programme of local exercise action pilots (LEAPs) to test out different approaches to increasing physical activity.
<P>

<a name="21028w37.html_para1">This programme will fund one pilot in each of the nine regions in England. Pilots will be led by PCTs and based in neighbourhood renewal areas and some will also involve sport action zones. The ongoing results will inform and lead action on physical activity across the National Health Service.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health whether his Department has considered the case for a cross departmental strategy at national, regional and local level for joined-up action and funding to improve physical activity levels.  [75210]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21028w37.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 The Government recognises the importance of a strategic approach in order to increase rates of physical activity. This Department works closely with other Government Departments to ensure that policy initiatives on health, sport and recreation, education and transport are co-ordinated and contribute to our shared goal of increasing access and rates of physical activity. This has been backed up by significant investment, including #581 million from the new opportunities fund for a physical education and sports programme, #459 million to transform physical education, school sport and club links over the next three years and #2.5 million for a new programme of local exercise action pilots, led by primary care trusts (PCTs).
<P>

<a name="21028w37.html_para2">At a national level, Ministers from the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, Department for Education and Skills and the Department of Health have regular monthly meetings to ensure joint working and co-ordination on issues relating to physical activity and sport. The Department of Health has also set up a 



<P>
<P><I>28 Oct 2002 : Column 665W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="21028w37.html_para3">At a regional level the positioning of regional directors of public health and their teams in the Government offices of the regions provides a very real opportunity to make connections across policy areas that will support increased physical activity.

<P>

<a name="21028w37.html_para6">The NHS Cancer Plan sets out new goals to reduce waiting times for diagnosis and treatment. The ultimate goal is that no one should wait longer than one month from an urgent referral for suspected cancer to the beginning of treatment, except for a good clinical reason or through patient choice. In order to tackle radiotherapy waiting times we are making unprecedented investment in new radiotherapy facilities, streamlining care processes through the cancer services collaborative and working to best utilise the current workforce and to increase the number of staff in post and in training.

<P>
<a name="21028w39.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 We have today published proposals to reform the welfare food scheme under the title Healthy Start.
<P>

<a name="21028w39.html_para1">The welfare food scheme has done great service for the last 60 years in providing milk and vitamins, primarily to expectant and nursing mothers, babies and children under five years of age in low income families. In line with our commitment in The NHS Plan, we are seeking to bring the scheme up to date in line with the latest expert advice on nutrition. Our proposals for this #142 million scheme will broaden the nutritional base of the scheme and offer a wider choice to families. We propose to do this through the introduction of a fixed face value voucher that can be exchanged for fruit and vegetables, cereal based foods, other foods suitable for weaning, as well as milk and infant formula. We are also proposing to link the scheme more closely with the NHS through antenatal and post-natal clinics. The new scheme will provide a healthier start for children from poorer families and link with our wider efforts to tackle health inequalities, and improve nutrition and food access.
<P>

<a name="21028w39.html_para2">We are already working with the devolved administrations and actively seeking the views of interested parties and stakeholders on these proposals, including the users of the scheme, health professionals, the food and dairy industry and small firms. This consultation will run until 13 December.

Copies of the report are available in the Libraries of the House. The number of press officers employed in the Department's Corporate Commissions division Headquarters Press Office during the financial years 1999&#150;2000 and 2000&#150;01 was 13 and 25 respectively. The difference in the figures relates to staff turnover throughout the year.

However, the Directorate General of Corporate Communications (DGCC) carries out corporate research on behalf of the Department as a whole. Since June 2001 DGCC has let two focus group research contracts: one with Colquhoun Associates to better understand the public reaction to the events of 11 September 2001 as part of our work on theNew Chapter to the Strategic Defence Review; and the other conducted by internal staff supported by Independent Field Work Company to look into the public image of the MOD.

 The Ministry of Defence has two central schemes, which have not been subject to a national roll out. In the last academic year the Department rolled out its Skill Force programme to 11 pilot locations: Ashfield (Nottinghamshire), Birmingham, Bristol, Great Yarmouth (Norfolk), Knowsley (Merseyside), North Lanarkshire, Leicester, Rochdale, Newcastle, West Norfolk, Islington (London). The budget for the Skill Force programme was approximately #1 million funded by the Treasury's Invest to Save Budget, Ministry of Defence and co-funding from local partner organisations. The initiative is expanding to 23 schemes with a start date of November 2002. This expansion is being co-funded by the DfES and Welsh Assembly.
<P>

<a name="21028w40.html_para1">The Army Cadet 'Outreach' programme is being undertaken by 25 counties within the UK: Berkshire, Bristol, Bucks, Cheshire, Cleveland, Dorset, Durham, Dyfed, Essex, Glamorgan, Gloucestershire, Gwent, Hampshire, Kent, Middlesex, Northumbria, Oxfordshire, Powys, Surrey, Yorkshire, Perthshire, Lancashire, Hertfordshire, Leicestershire, and Wiltshire. The cost for this programme is some #150,000.

 According to information supplied to the United Nations by Iraq the annual production capacity of the al-Muthanna site in Iraq in 1991 was 4,000 tonnes of chemical weapon agents per annum. This is indicative of the large scale of Iraq's chemical weapons programme at that time.

Medical personnel were deployed on Exercise SAIF SAREEA II solely to provide medical support to the deployed troops.

The Ministry of Defence is satisfied that it will be able to meet its military commitments through the use of Regular medical personnel and medical reserves.
