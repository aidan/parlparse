<a name="30710w01.html_wqn0"><B> Bob Spink: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport (1) if he will make a statement on the means by which <i>(a)</i> black cab drivers and <i>(b)</i> private hire taxi drivers can prevent passengers from smoking in their vehicles;  [124827]
<P>
<UL>(2) if he will bring forward legislation to enable taxi drivers to enforce a no smoking policy on passengers in their vehicles;  [124829]
<P>
(3) what research he has commissioned into the health impact on taxi drivers of secondary smoke inhalation from passengers who smoke in their vehicles; and if he will make a statement.  [124828]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30710w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 We consulted nationally on smoking in taxis in 1999&#150;2000. In March 2001, we announced that while we recognised the merits of banning smoking in taxis, we did not consider that the case was sufficiently strong to make a commitment to legislate when parliamentary time permitted. This was because we were satisfied that the present voluntary approach whereby taxi or private hire vehicle drivers have the choice of asking passengers not to smoke for the most part worked satisfactorily.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30710w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Ben Chapman: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what guidance he gives to the Civil Aviation Authority regarding air traffic control delays.  [124336]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30710w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 None. The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) exercises its role as the independent regulator for National Air Traffic Services Ltd. through the licence issued to that company; one of the conditions of which is a delay term. The CAA sets this delay term taking into account consultation with interested parties and its duties and objectives under the Transport Act 2000.

<a name="30710w01.html_sbhd2"><H3 align=center>Airports Consultation</H3>


<P>
<P>
<a name="30710w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Coleman: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what plans his Department has to assess the research submitted by BAA on air quality as part of the consultation into the future of air transport in the UK south-east.  [124411]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30710w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 Research undertaken by BAA will be assessed rigorously by the Government as part of the overall analysis of consultation responses.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30710w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Hoyle: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what recent discussions he has had with the Mayor of London on the impact of the London congestion charge.  [124485]

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30710w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 The London congestion charging scheme is the responsibility of the Mayor, not the Government. However, Ministers have regular meetings with the Mayor at which a wide range of transport matters are discussed.

<a name="30710w01.html_sbhd4"><H3 align=center>Connex South Eastern</H3>


<P>
<P>
<a name="30710w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Hoyle: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport if he will make a statement on the removal of the rail franchise from Connex South Eastern.  [124484]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30710w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 On 26 June 2003, the Strategic Rail Authority (SRA) served notice to terminate the Connex franchise on 31 December 2003. They did so because they were not satisfied that Connex had introduced agreed changes to their financial monitoring and reporting arrangements designed to ensure that the substantial public subsidy they had received was being properly used. The SRA will run the service under their 'operator of last resort' powers, but have emphasised that they will do so for only as long as is necessary to appoint a new private sector operator. In the meantime, the SRA expect it to be business as usual for passengers and for the great majority of Connex staff.

[124572]<P>
<P>
<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="30710w01.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Coleman: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what estimate his Department has made of the number of residents in London who would be affected by increased noise levels if a third runway was constructed at Heathrow airport.  [124408]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30710w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 The "Future Development of Air Transport in the United Kingdom&#151;South East" consultation document (Table 7.3) does not give estimates for London alone. In the consultation document it is estimated that in 2030 the population living within the 57dBA Leq noise contour would be 332,000 if a third runway were constructed (which would include parts of Berkshire, London, South Bucks and Surrey), compared with 278,000 if no runway were built. The 332,000 figure includes people living in areas that would be affected by air traffic using the third runway who would experience increased noise levels compared with today, as well as people in other areas affected by traffic using the existing runways (also within the 57dBA Leq noise contour) who would experience reduced noise levels. For comparison, the figure for the resident population living in the same noise contour in 2000 given in the consultation document was 307,000. This had fallen to 258,300 by 2002.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30710w01.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Coleman: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport whether he expects new areas of Hammersmith and Fulham to be affected by the construction of a third runway at Heathrow airport.  [124409]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30710w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 The modelling of noise impacts that is reported in the consultation document "The Future Development of Air Transport in the United Kingdom&#151;South East" suggests that noise generated by aircraft using the new runway would not exceed 57 dBA Leq in the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham. However, the purpose of the assessment was to allow comparison of different options at a variety of locations; it does not purport to be a precise prediction of the noise effects at specific locations.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30710w01.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Gordon Prentice: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what policies <i>(a)</i> initiated and <i>(b)</i> managed by his Department since 2001 have had an impact on Pendle; and if he will make a statement.  [124090]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30710w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 The Department for Transport has carried forward the policies that were initiated by predecessor departments.
<P>

<a name="30710w01.html_para4">Pendle benefits from policies managed by Lancashire county council. Lancashire received a total of &#163;12.051 million in December 2002 for integrated transport measures as part of the 2003&#150;04-transport settlement. This funding is being used by Lancashire to

<P>
<a name="30710w01.html_wqn9"><B> Sir Teddy Taylor: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what the conclusions are of his review of the arrangements for ports police in England and Wales.  [124630]<P>

<P>
<a name="30710w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B>

<a name="30710w01.html_sbhd9"><H3 align=center>Rail Safety</H3>


<P>
<P>
<a name="30710w01.html_wqn10"><B> Mr. Hoyle: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what measures are being taken to ensure that private contractors meet safety standards on rail maintenance.  [124487]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30710w01.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 Network Rail's Railway Safety Case, which is accepted by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE), includes Network Rail's Safety Management System to manage its contractors. This also requires Network Rail's contractors to demonstrate their ability to safely deliver the contract. Network Rail's Contractor Assurance System requires that each of its contractors have a Contractor Assurance Case that is monitored and reviewed by Network Rail. These cases are designed to ensure that contractors deliver a safe, effective and efficient railway.
<P>

<a name="30710w01.html_para5">Network Rail is fundamentally changing the way it manages rail maintenance. Its New Maintenance Programme ensures that Network Rail decides what work is completed and when. Network Rail is also taking direct control of three maintenance contract areas. This will give Network Rail clearer control of the works being completed.
<P>

<a name="30710w01.html_para6">Network Rail is also subject to regulation and enforcement by the HSE's Railway Inspectorate (HMRI). HMRI plans to monitor Network Rail's management of contractors, including its arrangement for managing maintenance contracts in-house.

 My right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry has received no representations on the operation of the new flexible working law which came into effect on 6 April this year.

Detailed guidance, including forms based on best practice, is also available on our website at www.dti.gov.uk/workingparents and also in hard copy.

The UK is not expecting any payments from Iraq in the near future. The states recognized as occupying powers under unified command are aware of these claims on Iraq.

<P>

<a name="30710w04.html_para0">A Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) of the Landfill Directive in England and Wales was published with the Second Consultation Paper on Implementation of Council Directive (199/31/EC) on the Landfill of Waste. This is available on the Defra website (www.defra.gov.uk). A base case was established and various policy mixes were costed against that base case. The additional costs of the policy mixes that reflect the levels of recycling, composting and recovery needed to meet the waste strategy targets amounted to a range of between &#163;3.4 billion and &#163;7.7 billion (net present value) over the 20 year period 2000&#150;20.
<P>

<a name="30710w04.html_para1">The RIA recognised that many of the potential benefits cannot be quantified but believes that a number will be of local significance where they result in a reduced impact of existing landfills. These benefits relate principally to reducing health and environmental risks and by promoting more sustainable options such as waste minimisation, re-use and recycling.
<P>

<a name="30710w04.html_para2">The RIA also draws attention to benefits from investment in treatment technologies and rising landfill standards that could result in new economic and employment opportunities.

 The Government accepted the increases to the minimum wage rates recommended by the independent Low Pay Commission in their fourth report earlier this year. Regulations to increase the adult rate of the minimum wage from &#163;4.20 to &#163;4.50 and the youth rate (paid to workers aged 18 to 21 inclusive) from &#163;3.60 to &#163;3.80 in October 2003 were recently laid before Parliament and will be debated before the summer recess.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30710w04.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Sutcliffe: </B> 
 The Government have agreed that the Low Pay Commission should look at the possible advantages and disadvantages of a minimum wage rate for 16 to 17-year-old workers, and to report on this issue by the end of February 2004.
<P>

<a name="30710w04.html_para4">The cost to business will be one of the many issues the Commission will want to consider. The Commission will be conducting their work in parallel with a wider Government review (led by the Treasury) which will be looking at education and training policy and the system of financial support for young people. The Commission will work closely with relevant Departments, so that the two pieces of work can inform each other and the Government will obviously be looking at this issue very carefully next spring.

The Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA) is responsible for the development and administration of the National Curriculum tests on behalf of the Secretary of State. There is a process in place, the level setting exercise, to ensure standards are maintained year on year. The level thresholds are the range of marks needed to achieve a particular level in the National Curriculum tests.<P>

We have made available &#163;17.5 million this year to support drug, alcohol and tobacco education in schools. From April 2001, we have supported the appointment of Schools Drug Advisors to help schools deliver drug education tailored to the needs of pupils. We are supporting a range of continuing professional development opportunities to support teachers and other professionals who deliver effective drug education and education about STIs. We have commissioned practical guidance for teachers on HIV and STIs to support coverage of these issues. We, together with the Home Office and the Department of Health, are also supporting a national five-year research programme called "Blueprint" which will test the effectiveness of drug education initiatives in schools.

 Because figures are estimated from surveys, information is only available for those leaving government supported work based learning for young people (WBLYP), by region (rather than by parliamentary constituency) and for those in a job six (not three) months after leaving learning. The percentages of learners on WBLYP in all regions (see specifically the South East), who were in a job six months after leaving are shown in the following table. The information in the table relates to all leavers and is taken from a postal survey sent to each learner six months after leaving the programme. The latest year for which figures are available is 2000&#150;01. Percentages of survey respondents who were in a job six months after leaving a period of government supported training by financial year, programme and region.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what role she expects micro CHP to play up to 2010 in achieving the planned carbon savings.  [123489]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30710w07.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 New technologies such as micro-CHP which are not yet available commercially have the potential to deliver carbon savings but are not expected to make a significant contribution towards carbon emission reductions up to 2010, although the contribution could be much more significant in the longer term. The 2002 draft CHP Strategy anticipated that micro-CHP may provide 400MW towards achievement of the Government's target of 10,000 MW of installed Good Quality CHP by 2010, but the exact amount of installed capacity will depend on a wide range of variables.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what measures 



<P>
<P><I>10 Jul 2003 : Column 902W</I><P>
the Government are taking to reduce emissions of radioactive waste from the Sellafield plant; what levels of technetium-99 are considered safe for human consumption; and what the scientific basis is for this assessment.  [122192]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30710w07.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 the nature and quantities of radioactive waste that may be discharged from any site are controlled by the Environment Agency under the Radioactive Substances Act 1993. In November 1999, Ministers asked the Environment Agency to carry out a full-scale review of all radioactive discharges from the Sellafield site, and to report on technetium-99 in advance of the main review. The Agency's proposed decisions were published in August 2002 and are currently under consideration by the Secretaries of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and for Health. The Agency proposed no increases in discharge limits above the current limits and reductions to eight out of 10 of the aerial and half the liquid discharge limits.
<P>

<a name="30710w07.html_para1">There are no statutory limits for technetium-99 in food. The Food Standards Agency estimates the radiation dose that a consumer would receive from consuming affected food and compares that estimate to the dose received from natural sources and the statutory dose limit of 1mSv/year from all man-made sources of radioactivity other than medical exposure. Assessments carried out by both the Environment Agency and the Food Standards Agency for the EA's review of Tc-99 indicated that, at the current discharge limit, the annual radiation dose from Tc-99 to the group of people most exposed to liquid discharges from the Sellafield site (i.e. local seafood consumers) is of the order of 0.02&#150;0.03 mSv/year. Concerns would be raised if the technetium-99 present in food added significantly to the background dose or caused doses to approach the dose limit.

<a name="30710w08.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Kidney: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment she has made of the Government meeting their target of 



<P>
<P><I>10 Jul 2003 : Column 906W</I><P>
halting the decline in biodiversity by 2010; and what part she intends that the UK's system of local wildlife sites will play in helping to meet that target.  [124249]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30710w08.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The targets we have set under the UK Biodiversity Action Plan (UKBAP) help us to understand the progress we are making towards the global target of halting the loss of biodiversity by 2010. The lead partners for the species and habitat action plans and the local partnerships reported on progress with their plans at the end of 2002 and the results have now been analysed. The emerging findings were reported to the first annual conference of the UK Biodiversity Partnership held in Perth on 21 May 2003.
<P>

<a name="30710w08.html_para0">The analysis shows mixed progress. There are some very good signs of progress for some species and habitats including the otter, the dormouse, bittern, reedbeds and cereal field margins. Others, such as limestone pavements, and the natterjack toad are more disappointing, and one species of lichen appears to have disappeared from its last remaining site as a result of air pollution.
<P>

<a name="30710w08.html_para1">Overall we believe that the targeted, partnership approach adopted by the UKBAP structure is working, albeit in some cases more slowly than we had hoped. Full details can be found on the UKBAP web site at http://ukbap.org.uk.
<P>

<a name="30710w08.html_para2">'Working with the Grain of Nature&#151;A biodiversity strategy for England' published in October 2002 sets out the measures we are taking in England to implement the UKBAP. The strategy aims to ensure that the implications for biodiversity are considered as an integral part of other key policies, such as agriculture, water, forestry, urban and marine, and as part of people's everyday lives. A set of biodiversity indicators for the strategy will be published later this year.
<P>

<a name="30710w08.html_para3">The strategy also recognises the importance of partnership working for biodiversity at the local and regional level. Since 1995 around 100 local biodiversity partnerships have been established throughout England and are helping to deliver national and local biodiversity targets and objectives. Local wildlife sites provide important wildlife refuges, link different habitats and help to maintain biodiversity as a whole. They are an important mechanism available to local biodiversity partnerships.

<P>
<a name="30710w08.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The Overseas Territories Department in Foreign and Commonwealth Office is the lead Department for the Overseas Territories (OTs), but the Department works closely with other Departments, especially the FCO, to ensure that the interests of OTs are appropriately integrated into the UK position, for example, when negotiating Multilateral Environmental Agreements (MEAs) and in making arrangements for UK ratification of MEAs. Defra will also provide advice on best practice when requested by local OT governments.

 The Government will be consulting shortly on the options available for reforming the operation of the Common Agricultural Policy in the UK, following the agreement reached at the Agriculture Council on 26 June.
<P>

<a name="30710w08.html_para4">The Government are keen to press ahead as well with reforms to the sugar, tobacco, olive oil and cotton regimes and with reviews of the wine and fruit and vegetable regimes of the CAP. We await the European Commission's proposals for these sectors, which it has indicated it will bring forward in the autumn.

<P>
<a name="30710w08.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Wiggin: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs how she estimates the UK's contribution to the CAP will be affected by the accession of 10 new EU members.  [123752]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30710w08.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The UK contributes to the EC budget as a whole and not to the CAP specifically. The costs of extending the CAP to the new member states have been limited by respect for the Berlin expenditure ceilings for enlargement-related expenditure for the period 2004 to 2006. The Copenhagen European Council agreed 40.85 billion euros (1999 prices) over 2004&#150;06 for the 10 new member states, well within the enlargement-related ceiling set by the 1999 Berlin European Council for sixs potential members.

<a name="30710w08.html_para5">For the period 2007&#150;13, the Brussels European Council in October 2002 set ceilings for CAP market support and direct payments. The Commission estimate that for the new member states, direct payments and market support will cost 6.3 billion euros in 2013. However, such expenditure for the EU 25 has been limited in nominal terms to annual growth of 1 per cent. per year from 2006. This is an important constraint on market distorting subsidies. It means that, notwithstanding accession, the cost of CAP direct support should fall in real terms. Rural development ceilings have yet to be determined for the years 2007 onwards.

Like all facilities involved with managing waste, large scale composting plants also require a waste management licence from the Environment Agency.

 <i>[holding answer 7 July 2003]:</i> There have been large and sustained reductions in discharges of the most radiologically significant radionuclides in the last 25 years, particularly those resulting from reprocessing nuclear fuel, such that current discharges from that sector are currently just 1 per cent. of their peak levels in the 1970s. The Government are committed to achieving further reductions in discharges by 2020 in order to implement the OSPAR Strategy with regard to Radioactive Substances, which was agreed by Ministers at Sintra in 1998. A UK Strategy for Radioactive Discharges, 2001&#150;20, was published in July 2002, which sets out how we shall achieve these further reductions and includes broad projections for future discharges from each sector of the nuclear industry. Key milestones are the cessation of Magnox fuel and uranium hexafluoride production at Springfields by 2006 and the end of Magnox fuel reprocessing at Sellafield by around 2012. The document is in the Library and is available on the Defra website at: www.defra.gov.uk/environment/radioactivity/discharge/strategy/index.htm.
<P>

<a name="30710w10.html_para3">Detailed information on radioactive discharges and environmental concentrations, by type of radionuclide and location, can be found in the annual publication, Radioactivity in Food and the Environment (RIFE), produced jointly by the Food Standards Agency and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency. Copies are in the Library and the 2002 edition (containing data for 2001) is on the Food Standards Agency's website at: www.foodstandards.gov.uk/science/suveillance/radio/89684.

We contributed to the production of WHO Air Quality Guidelines for Europe, and have adopted the same statutory limit for drinking water as the WHO drinking water guideline value. The WHO drinking water guideline is currently being revised and we will consider what, if any, reassessment would be required in light of changes made. An assessment of health impacts from mercury contaminated soils has been undertaken and two reports "Collation of toxicological data and intake values for humans&#151;Mercury" and "Soil Guideline Values for inorganic mercury contamination" were published last year. Both are available on the Defra website at www.defraweb/environment/landliability/pubs.htm. Dietary exposure to mercury is mainly in the form of methylmercury in fish and is assessed against international guidelines for methylmercury. The Food Standards Agency issues advice to consumers to limit consumption of certain species offish, so that exposure is within these guidelines.

 All wild birds are protected by the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, which implements the EC Birds Directive in Great Britain. It is an offence under Section 1 to kill, injure or take any wild bird, take, damage or destroy the nest of any wild bird while that nest is being built or destroy or take the eggs of any wild bird. In addition to this, birds listed on Schedule 1, such as the Osprey, are also protected from disturbance whilst it is building a nest or is in, on or near a nest containing eggs or young.

 <i>[holding answer 1 July 2003]:</i> Following a 1998 European study (the first EUROHAZCON study&#151;Dolk, H <i>et al</i>; www.lshtm.ac/eeu/research.hmtl) that reported a higher rate of non-chromosomal anomalies among people living near hazardous waste sites, the Government commissioned a programme of work on health effects of landfill sites including a much more extensive national study by the Small Area Health Statistics Unit (Elliott, P <i>et al</i>; www.imperial.ac.uk/p396.htm). This was published in the summer of 2001.
<P>

<a name="30710w12.html_para4">The SAHSU study looked at the rates of all birth defects (chromosomal and non-chromosomal) and found only a slightly higher rate (1 per cent.) in populations living near landfill sites and a 7 per cent. higher rate near hazardous waste sites. The Government's expert advisory committee, the Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment, noted that this excess risk was small and could be accounted for by factors other than the landfill sites. The study has not shown, or, indeed, could show, a causal link between landfill sites and birth defects.
<P>

<a name="30710w12.html_para5">However, the Government recognised that, in the light of the findings of these various studies, more research was needed on the health impacts of landfill sites.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence pursuant to his answer of 20 June 2003, <i>Official Report,</i> column 510W, on defence procurement, what assessment he has made of the ability of his Department to forecast the in service dates (ISD) and costs of major procurement projects; what plans he has for ensuring that projects are delivered <i>(a)</i> on their forecast ISD and <i>(b)</i> on their original budget; and if he will make a statement.

<P>
<a name="30710w15.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 An important element of the defence "Smart Acquisition" process is the reduction of risk during the early phases of a programme so that at the main approval point ("Main Gate") there is a high level of confidence that project targets, including ISD and budgets, will be achieved. In support of this risk reduction process the use of a Three Point Estimating methodology for both time and cost has been approved.
<P>

<a name="30710w15.html_para0">To ensure the quality of our estimating the Department provides guidance, training and computer tools to support the process. In addition specialist support for both the production of estimates and the risk management process is available.
<P>

<a name="30710w15.html_para1">The Defence Procurement Agency this year created two teams to support project offices across the Defence Acquisition community in using a systematic methodology for risk management and estimating. A key element of this initiative is the use of a Risk Maturity Model to assess major projects against a number of perspectives, including whether risks have been fully identified and analysed, whether risk mitigation controls are being managed as planned, and whether the projects are positioned to provide robust and reliable estimates of both time and cost to completion.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30710w15.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The estimated additional cost to the Euro fighter Typhoon programme attributable to the two delays since the production contracts were placed in 1998 is approximately &#163;610 million. Some 25 per cent. of this represents additional cash expenditure incurred by the Department because of inflation. The remaining 75 per cent. represents 'non-cash' cost of capital charges incurred by the Defence Procurement Agency as a result of the delayed transfer of asset balances to the RAF. This element does not represent a net increase in costs to the Department or the exchequer.

<a name="30710w15.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The United Kingdom has given an undertaking, as a signatory to a 4-nation memorandum of understanding, to acquire 232 Typhoon aircraft out of a total production of 620. Our commitment to the programme remains unchanged, although&#151;in common with all other elements of the defence programme&#151;Typhoon is kept under constant review. The delivery of aircraft to the Royal Air Force has now begun and will continue through to the middle of the next decade. The aircraft was designed, to be multi-role; this has not changed. When it becomes available for operational deployment in the second half of this decade, it will be configured primarily to conduct air defence missions but will also have a limited ground attack capability. Typhoon's ground attack capability will be augmented through an incremental enhancement programme.

Information relating to MOD non-departmental public bodies is included in the annual Cabinet Office publication "Public Bodies". Copies of these reports can be found at http://www.cabinet-office.gov.uk/agencies-publicbodies/publicbodies. Only Executive NDPBs employ staff. While the Cabinet Office publication gives total gross expenditure for each NDPB it does not break this figure down between staff costs and running costs, the expenditure figures have not therefore been included in the table.<P>

The level of expenditure is for these organisations to determine. Details of their expenditure on the UKSI is shown in the following table:

 The Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure in pursuing its vision of "a confident, creative, informed and prosperous society" is committed both to promoting a greater respect and understanding of the richness of our cultural and linguistic diversity and to celebrating this diversity. In progressing this objective the Department supported Diversity 21 as a means of examining cultural diversity with a view to promoting deeper understanding and to represent this diversity as a sign of strength in our society. Diversity 21 provided the means of promoting cultural diversity work already happening; identifying and delivery of new projects aimed at stimulating the imagination and exploring diversity in an open, creative and accessible way; and providing a cultural diversity grant funding scheme. Since April 2001 the Department has supported a schedule of exhibitions on language, faith and history in Northern Ireland and the wider Commonwealth, to a number of organisations and community groups throughout the Province; a programme of workshops on the different drums of Northern Ireland; and Intercom 21&#151;a contemporary music project which used music as a means of exploring diversity. In addition the Department under the Diversity 21 funding programme supported a range of community based projects. These included:

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland when work will start on construction of housing on the site of the former Somerdale School in Belfast.  [124477]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30710w18.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 In response to community representations that the scheme would infringe their human rights, the PSNI, which has a responsibility to advise on new proposals such as this, undertook to review its original advice that the scheme could proceed. That undertaking was given at a public meeting on 4 June 2003 and the PSNI report is still awaited. The scheme is therefore delayed meantime.
<P>

<a name="30710w18.html_para5">However, subject to a positive response from PSNI, my Department and the Housing Executive, which is taking the lead in trying to resolve the community issues at local level, are firmly committed to seeing this much needed scheme start on site at the earliest possible date. We have given commitments to local residents that they will be fully consulted beforehand.
<P>

<a name="30710w18.html_para6">Provided the outstanding difficulties are resolved, it is hoped that the scheme can start in 2004&#150;05.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland pursuant to his answer of 30 June 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 98W, on MOT tests, what proportion of vehicle test failures were due to brake defects in each year since 2000&#150;01.  [124555]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30710w18.html_spnew5"><B> Angela Smith: </B> 
 This information is not currently available.
<P>

<a name="30710w18.html_para7">Until recently the records of the Driver and Vehicle Testing Agency of the Department of the Environment were largely manual and it was not practicable to collate information on the causes of test failures.
<P>

<a name="30710w18.html_para8">However, when the programme to re-equip the Agency's test centres with new computerised test equipment is completed, it will be possible to develop management information systems which will provide analyses of test results. The re-equipment programme is scheduled to be completed in September 2003.
<P>

<a name="30710w18.html_para9">There is anecdotal evidence that customers and the motor trade are having difficulty in preparing vehicles for the brake imbalance test. It should be borne in mind, however, that the extent of the imbalance in braking efficiency between two wheels on the same axle that would cause the test to be failed would render the vehicle unroadworthy and constitute a road safety risk.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30710w18.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 Because of the considerable number of contracts let annually by the Northern Ireland Housing Executive, the information for each year dating back to 1997 could only be obtained at disproportionate cost. However, all contractors have money withheld, pending the making good of defects. In any given year, this amounts to an average of &#163;1.2 million.
<P>

<a name="30710w18.html_para10">The Housing Executive is currently withholding some &#163;1.3 million, pending the satisfactory completion of 221 contracts. The gross value of these contracts is around &#163;89 million. The Housing Executive is also currently involved in six legal disputes, to a gross value of some &#163;480,000, with contractors who have disputed, among other things, that their work is substandard.

<i>Crown Prosecution Service</i>
<P>

<a name="30710w22.html_para8">The Crown Prosecution Service, along with other criminal justice agencies, is subject to a Public Service Agreement for which the Home Secretary, the Lord Chancellor and the Attorney General are jointly responsible. The Public Service Agreement prescribes three targets for the criminal justice system: to narrow the justice gap by bringing more offences to justice and reducing ineffective trials; to improve public confidence in the criminal justice system; and to increase value for money. These are overarching targets applying to the police, the courts and the Crown Prosecution Service. Day to day delivery is the responsibility of all of these agencies, working together in partnership through Local Criminal Justice Boards established across each of the 42 operational areas of the criminal justice system.
<P>

<a name="30710w22.html_para9">Underlying these targets are a number of measures specific to the Crown Prosecution Service, which demonstrate the contribution of the service to the criminal justice system as a whole and govern the performance of its 42 areas. The targets for 2003&#150;06 are as follows:
<P>

<a name="30710w22.html_para10"><i>Narrowing the justice gap</i>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>To reduce by 5 per cent. in 2003&#150;04 the proportion of unsuccessful outcomes in defendant cases in both the magistrates courts and the Crown court. Further targets are to be agreed for 2004&#150;06;

<BR>
To increase the number of recorded offences brought to justice for which the offender was a persistent offender at the point of charge;

are met by their local authority under the "free personal care" arrangements made by the Scottish Executive. The loss of entitlement to attendance allowance in these circumstances follows the normal social security benefit rules to prevent duplicate provision from public funds for the same purpose (following the same principle, receipt of free nursing care, irrespective of the setting in which it is provided, does not affect the payment of attendance allowance). Information is not routinely collected about the precise period covered by the loss of entitlement to payments in individual cases, or about the weekly amount paid before that loss of entitlement, and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions if he will make a statement on the effect of amendments agreed in the European Parliament on occupational pensions; and whether these amendments impose <i>(a)</i> obligations and <i>(b)</i> restrictions on the use of tax-free lump sum payments.  [123649]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30710w26.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Pond: </B> 
 The finely balanced package of amendments to the Directive on Occupational Pensions, agreed in the European Parliament on 12 March 2003, contributed to a Directive that is an important first step towards a single market for occupational retirement provision. At the same time, the Directive acknowledges that, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, member states retain full responsibility for the organisation of their pension systems. The amendments will not affect the use of tax-free lump sum payments.

<a name="30710w27.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. MacShane: </B> 
 The Government support Croatia's EU aspirations. The Treaty of European Union establishes the procedure for processing a membership application. The relevant provisions state that any European state that respects the principles of liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and the rule of law may submit a membership application to the Council. The Council then forwards 



<P>
<P><I>10 Jul 2003 : Column 980W</I><P>
the application to the Commission for an Opinion on the applicant's readiness to begin accession negotiations, measured against the criteria set out at the Copenhagen European Council in 1993. Croatia's application for EU membership should be treated in accordance with these provisions.
<P>

<a name="30710w27.html_para2">Croatia applied for membership on 21 February 2003. The Council forwarded the application to the Commission on 14 April 2003.

 The UK, along with EU Partners, is deeply concerned by the arrest and detention of peaceful opposition figures in Cuba, including Oscar Elias Biscet and Juan Carlos Leiva. We have repeatedly expressed our concerns to the Cuban Government. The EU has in recent months issued three statements calling for the release of all those imprisoned in Cuba on political grounds and the UK has made clear our strong support for this stance direct to the Cuban authorities.

<a name="30710w28.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 The FCO first received allegations against BAE Systems in January 2000. These, and earlier allegations to other Government Departments, were passed to the MOD Police and Metropolitan Police. The latter confirmed that they found insufficient evidence to substantiate the allegations. In 1999, routine examinations by the South African Auditor General resulted in allegations of irregularities in the procurement process. Subsequent investigations by South Africa's Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Accounts, and by a specially-convened Joint Investigating Team drawn from three expert bodies, concluded that the primary contracts&#151;including those involving BAE Systems&#151;were sound. The investigations did conclude that there were irregularities inherent in some of the subcontracting procedures, but not those involving BAE Systems.

We support the work of the Governance Partnership, which is undertaking research to help develop a constituency for governance reform, and which is supporting the rule of law, police reform and anti-corruption initiatives. Through the United Nations we will be making a major contribution to the 2004 National and Presidential Elections. We are developing, with the Indonesian Government and the World Bank, a programme to support the establishment of effective local government. The UK has supported the training of judges (we provided human rights training for five Supreme Court Judges in March this year). From our Global Conflict Prevention Pool (GCPP) we have supported a free and independent media by holding workshops on security and peace journalism for journalists and editors in Jakarta. We also work through multilateral channels including the EU, Asian Development Bank and International Monetary Fund for various aspects of reform, including economic reform, democracy building, human rights and conflict prevention.

 In accordance with the Homelessness Act 2002, Castle Point borough council have produced a Homelessness Strategy which addresses the needs of the borough.

The council proposes to end the use of B&B accommodation for the homeless by the end of 2003&#150;04. I am advised that the council is confident that these measures will result in no homeless families using Bed and Breakfast accommodation, well before March 2004.

For this reason if there had been an additional 1,000 pensioners in receipt of income support in the county, although Cambridgeshire's Formula Spending Share would have increased by &#163;524,494, they would have continued to receive the same level of grant. In 2003&#150;04, Cambridgeshire received an increase in formula grant of 8.5 per cent. on a like-for-like basis with 2002&#150;03.

 Standard One of the older people's national service framework (NSF) sets out the general commitment to address age discrimination in access to health and social care. The requirement to provide treatment and care on the basis of clinical need, and not age alone, applies equally to the treatment of breast cancer. Since the publication of the NSF in March 2001, significant progress has been made in starting to tackle age discrimination and there is a now a wider appreciation and awareness across health and social care of age discrimination as an issue.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what process is in place to enable the assessment of interactions between food additives individually approved for use in food products.  [123831]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30710w33.html_spnew8"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 All food additives undergo a rigorous safety assessment by European Union and United Kingdom scientific committees prior to approval. As part of the approval process, a maximum permitted level of use is set to ensure that intakes do not exceed the acceptable daily intake (ADI). An ADI is the amount of an additive that can be consumed on a daily basis over a lifetime without causing any adverse health effects. For groups of additives having a similar biological mode of action, the ADI is set for the group as a whole, thereby taking account of possible interactions.

 The Government have already secured provisions which enable member states to allow the continued sale of products which do not comply with the Directive's compositional requirements up to 31 December 2009 provided certain criteria are met. The Food Supplements (England) Regulations 2003, which implement the Directive in England, make full use of this flexibility.

<P>
<a name="30710w33.html_spnew10"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 The European Community Scientific Committee on Food (SCF) established a task force of independent experts with expertise in medicine, nutrition, toxicology, biology, chemistry and related disciplines. The approach taken by the SCF task force in reviewing the upper levels of daily intakes of individual vitamins and minerals is based on an internationally agreed risk assessment model. This process takes into account all relevant scientific evidence. Following the formation of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), this work will be completed by the new EFSA expert panel on dietetic products, nutrition and allergies, which will be advised by the former SCF task force. The report of the United Kingdom expert group on vitamins and minerals on safe upper levels for vitamins and minerals has been sent to EFSA to be considered by the EFSA panel.

 No such representations have been received from BioCare. However, since 1 January 2003, correspondence has been received from an hon.

 The United Kingdom is obliged to implement the provisions of Directive 2002/46/EC into national legislation. The conclusions of the regulatory impact assessment undertaken in relation to the Food Supplement (England) Regulations 2003 were that making the current Regulations was the best option available. It maintains the widest possible consumer choice of safe and properly labelled food supplements consistent with the Directive, and imposes the minimum burden on industry.

 <i>[holding answer 8 July 2003]:</i> I am advised by the Food Standards Agency that feed for farmed fish consists primarily of fishmeal and fish oil, although feed producers have been turning increasingly to vegetable ingredients such as maize gluten feed and soya bean meal. Whether this is likely to contain a proportion of genetically modified-derived material will depend on its source, although I understand that the fish farming industry endeavours to avoid the use of GM or GM-derived ingredients.

 The Department of Health does not directly monitor or enforce record-keeping arrangements in national health service trusts or strategic health authorities (SHA).
