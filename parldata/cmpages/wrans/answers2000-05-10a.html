<P>
<P>
<a name="00510w01.html_wqn0"><B> Ms Julie Morgan: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (1) how many public toilets were closed between April 1998 and April 1999;  [120489]
<P>
<UL>(2) what plans he has to introduce best value performance indicators covering the provisions of public toilets;  [120492]
<P>
(3) if he will make public toilet provision a statutory obligation for local government;  [120491]
<P>
(4) what plans he has to tackle vandalism and drug misuse in public toilets.  [120490]
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00510w01.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 Owing to changes in the definition used by the Audit Commission, it is not possible accurately to ascertain the total number of public toilets closed between April 1998 and April 1999. However, while the total number of public toilets counted in England increased from 6,128 to 6,643, the number of public toilets open more than 12 hours a day decreased from 6,128 to 4,133. Figures for Wales are not yet available.
<P>

<a name="00510w01.html_para0">The Audit Commission has specified, for the current financial year, a mandatory performance indicator for local authorities in respect of
<P>

<a name="00510w01.html_para1"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the number of conveniences sites provided by the authority normally throughout the year.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="00510w01.html_para2">The Government have no plans to specify a best value performance indicator in this respect, or to replace the current discretionary power to provide public toilets with a statutory obligation.
<P>

<a name="00510w01.html_para3">The Government believe that the most effective way to tackle drug misuse and vandalism is through co-ordinated preventive action at a local level, involving all of the relevant agencies such as the police, local authorities and schools. That is why police and local authorities now have a statutory duty, under the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, jointly to develop partnerships to tackle crime and disorder in their area.
<P>

<a name="00510w01.html_para4">The strategies which have been produced by the 376 partnerships in England and Wales include a wide range of initiatives--many of which specifically target drug misuse and criminal damage.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00510w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Caton: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what action his Department takes to warn beekeepers when genetically modified crops are planted close to their apiaries.  [120696]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00510w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The legislation requires that proposed locations of releases of GM crops for research purposes (Part B) have to be advertised locally before sowing takes place. The advertisement must give information on the name and address of the applicant, the GM crop, the location and general purpose of the trial and the foreseen sowing dates. A full list of current and proposed releases is on my Department's website and on the Public Register.
<P>

<a name="00510w01.html_para5">Once a GM crop has Europe-wide consent for placing on the market (Part C), there is no requirement for prior notification of planting. However, only one such crop is currently grown in the UK, as part of the Farm Scale Evaluations programme. Under the agreement between the Government and the industry body, SCIMAC, the locations of the Evaluations will be published on my Department's website and the farmers involved will alert their neighbours.

<a name="00510w01.html_sbhd2"><H4><center>Water Charging</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="00510w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Swayne: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what plans he has to alter the water charging regime to allow the use of council tax bands as an alternative to metering.  [121025]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00510w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 Under the Water Industry Act 1999, companies must produce charges schemes, which include details of the basis on which they wish to charge for water and sewerage services to homes. Schemes are subject to approval by the Director General of Water Services.
<P>

<a name="00510w01.html_para6">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has issued guidance to the Director General on the approval of schemes for companies operating wholly or mainly in England. In considering whether or not to approve a new basis of unmeasured charging, key factors are the transitional effects of any change, any proposals for managing such effects and the impact of the new basis of charging on different groups, particularly vulnerable customers. Because of the potential social impacts on customers, the Director should not approve the widespread introduction of new unmeasured charging arrangements, without full consultation with the Secretary of State. There is no statutory bar on such arrangements being based on council tax. The Government will continue to consider any proposals that come forward provided that they address the key factors.
<P>

<a name="00510w01.html_para7">The Secretary of State's guidance under the 1999 Act and other background on water charging policy is set out in "Water Industry Act 1999--Delivering the Government's Objectives" published on 3 February, a copy of which is in the Library of the House.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00510w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 The only information currently available centrally is for new lettings of supported accommodation by Registered Social Landlords. In England from April 1998 to September 1999 there were 276 such lettings to lone parents under the age of 18.
<P>

<a name="00510w01.html_para8">As part of the follow-up to the Social Exclusion Unit report on Teenage Pregnancy, local authorities are being asked to carry out an audit of the provision of and need for semi-independent housing with support for 16 and 17-year-old lone teenage parents in their area.

<P>
<a name="00510w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Bob Russell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions how many licences under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 for the removal of peregrine have been issued in each of the last five years for which figures are available; and if he will make a statement.  [121117]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00510w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 This information is published in annual reports submitted by my Department, on behalf of the United Kingdom, to the European Commission, to meet the requirements of Article 9(3) of the European Community Directive on the Conservation of Wild Birds (79/409/EEC). These reports provide the reasons for each derogation made under Article 9 and therefore contain details of all licences issued under the 1981 Act, including any for the removal of peregrine.
<P>

<a name="00510w01.html_para9">The most recent report, the eighteenth, was published in January 2000 and covers the period 1 January-- 31 December 1998. It contains details of about 230 derogations in relation to peregrines for a variety of reasons, such as research and teaching. The majority do not involve permanent removal. As in previous years, the report will be made available in the House Libraries.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00510w01.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Bob Russell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what representations he has received following the publication of the report of the UK Raptor Working Group; and if he will make a statement.  [121116]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00510w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 My Department has received a number of representations on the report of the Raptor Working Group from a range of organisations. I welcome the publication of this report and its recommendations and hope it will help provide an integrated solution to the problems presented by birds of prey to game bird managers and pigeon fanciers. My Department will shortly be seeking English Nature's advice on the implementation in England of the report's recommendations in light of these representations.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00510w01.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Bob Russell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions which organisations tendered for the project, "A Study into the Raptor Predation of Domestic Pigeons", published in March; which organisation was awarded the tender; and what the qualifications were of the individuals who researched and wrote the study.  [121118]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00510w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 In 1995 my Department let a research contract to assess the impact of raptor predation on pigeons and to investigate the effectiveness of non-lethal deterrents.




<P>
<P><I>10 May 2000 : Column: 388W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="00510w01.html_para10">Tenders for the research contract were received from the Royal Agricultural College and the Hawk and Owl Trust. The contract was awarded to the Hawk and Owl Trust on the basis that they provided the best and most cost-effective methodology for investigating the extent of predation.
<P>

<a name="00510w01.html_para11">The research was undertaken and the report written by Hawk and Owl Trust members who have had a long history of involvement in various aspects of raptor ecology and research. They also have an extensive knowledge and experience of various aspects of survey work and are authors of numerous books, papers and articles on related topics.

 <i>[holding answer 8 May 2000]:</i> This information is not currently available to the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions and could not be collated without incurring disproportionate cost.
<P>

<a name="00510w01.html_para12">Hydrocarbons are common organic compounds, examples of which include natural gas; butane; propane; petroleum, diesel fuels, diesel oils, motor oils, motor fuels, marine oils, marine fuels, hydraulic fluids, crude oil, lubricating oils. As their type and application are so widely varied the collection of this information would prove extremely resource intensive.

 The Franchising Director has announced that he is considering replacement of the existing South West Trains franchise with an option to include or exclude Exeter to Waterloo services. This is one of a number of alterations being considered to the existing franchise map, but on which no firm decisions have yet been taken.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will list the standard spending assessment per head of population for each English local authority for the most recent year for which information is available, ranked in descending order of allocated expenditure per head; and if he will make a statement.  [121307]
<P>

<P>
<a name="00510w02.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Armstrong: </B> 
 Two tables have been placed in the Library. The first table gives the 2000-01 Standard Spending Assessments (SSAs), the mid-98 population estimate and the SSA per head, together with the ranking for education authorities. The second table provides similar information for shire districts. The tables have been sorted and ranked in descending order of SSA per head. It would be inappropriate to compare shire districts with education authorities since they have vastly different responsibilities.

 The supply of food for the Armed Forces is contracted out to "3663".

Supplies of eggs and egg products for our forces based overseas, which make up approximately 7 per cent. of the total requirement, were in the main sourced locally.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what is the latest estimate of the cost of the Trident acquisition programme; and if he will make a statement.  [121749]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00510w02.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The current estimate of the total acquisition cost of the Trident programme, with payments already made expressed at the prices and exchange rates actually incurred and future spend at the current financial year exchange rate (the hybrid estimate), is now &#163;9,745 million. Leaving aside the effects of price inflation (+&#163;12 million), there has been a real cost reduction since last year of &#163;23 million. Expenditure on the Trident acquisition programme to 30 September 1999 represented some 96 per cent. of this estimate. If all expenditure, past and projected, is brought up to the current year's economic conditions (the non-hybrid estimate) the estimate is &#163;13,170 million.

 <i>[holding answer 18 April 2000]:</i> The Government issued a consultation document on 17 March covering how disability rights in education might be implemented.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what plans he has to widen access to higher education.  [121618]

<a name="00510w02.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Blunkett: </B> 
 My Department already has a range of initiatives to increase participation of disadvantaged groups. For instance, through the Excellence in Cities programme we are giving 5,000 gifted and talented 16 and 17-year-olds a taste of university life this summer. I can confirm that we will be providing new bursaries, worth up to &#163;1,000 a year, that will give those from disadvantaged backgrounds the extra financial incentive and confidence they need to embark on a higher education course. These bursaries, which will be introduced from next year, will be known as "opportunity bursaries". However, more action is required if we are to extend the opportunities of higher education to all those capable of benefiting from it.
<P>

<a name="00510w02.html_para10">Today, I am pleased to announce a further package of measures that will open up new horizons to people from disadvantaged groups. This package includes:
<P>

<a name="00510w02.html_para11"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a further &#163;4 million to help recruit and retain bright students from areas with records of low participation in higher education. The money will add to the &#163;18 million already available to help high achievers from these areas;
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="00510w02.html_para12"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>extension of disabled student allowances of up to &#163;5,000 a year to post-graduate students; and
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="00510w02.html_para13"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a grant of &#163;63,000 to support a number of initiatives by the Sutton Trust. Both these measures and existing initiatives will become part of a concerted access drive that will enable those traditionally excluded from higher education to take advantage of a university education.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment if he will list in date order mergers between further education corporations since April 1993, specifying whether each amounted to a transfer or merger of undertakings.  [121301]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00510w03.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Wicks: </B> 
 There are two types of mergers: the first is a single dissolution where one further education corporation is dissolved and its property, rights and liabilities are transferred to another corporation; and the second is where two or more corporations are closed and their property, rights and liabilities are transferred to a new corporation. The name of the continuing or new corporation, as the case may be, may also change at the time of the merger.

 <i>[holding answer 9 May 2000]:</i> The International Energy Agency's (IEA) latest "World Energy Outlook (1998)" considers energy demand and supply for 10 world regions over the period to 2020 and concludes that world oil production from conventional sources could peak around 2015. This would result in a transfer from conventional oil to unconventional oil (for additional supplies) and might produce a rise in oil prices. The IEA's conclusions fall roughly in the middle of a range of projections from researchers which, at the extremes, envisage oil production peaking as early as 2005, or as late as 2050.

<P>

<P>
<a name="00510w06.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 There is no specific offence of violent demonstration. Section 1 of the Public Order Act 1986 prescribes a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment for the offence of riot which involves the use, or threat, of unlawful violence for common purpose such as to cause fear for personal safety. It can only

be committed where 12 or more people so act. Under section 2, similar behaviour committed by three or more people (violent disorder) is punishable with a maximum penalty of five years imprisonment. Section 3 relates to similar behaviour where only one or two people are involved (affray). The maximum penalty for this offence is three years imprisonment.

 <i>[holding answer 9 May 2000]:</i> The spectrum currently used by the police and fire services for radio communications has serious limitations and is the key reason why we arranged for the provision of new spectrum.

<a name="00510w06.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 In 1998, 968 females and 9,777 males were given an immediate custodial sentence for drugs offences (Great Britain). Statistics on drug-related offences are not collected by the Home Office, but by a programme of research at Cambridge University on behalf of the Home Office. This involves drug testing of arrestees, and indicates a strong connection between drug misuse, particularly heroin and crack/cocaine, and crime, and suggests that about one third of all property crime is committed in order to buy these drugs. The initial findings also showed that for most drug types, female arrestees were as likely, if not more likely, than males to test positive and that females were significantly more likely than males to test positive for opiates.

<P>

<a name="00510w06.html_para5">Two key objectives of the Government's anti-drugs strategy are to reduce levels of repeat offending among drug misusing offenders and to increase the participation of problem drug misusers, including prisoners, in drug treatment programmes which have a positive impact on health and crime. This relates to men and women, but the strategy recognises that specific support services may be needed for certain groups including women. Counselling, Assessment, Referral, Advice, Throughcare (CARAT) services, in place in every prison, will be tailored towards the prisoner populations in each establishment. Also, research is to be undertaken to look further into the issue of women and drugs.

 The committee of inquiry set up by the Police Foundation has produced a thorough report with a large number of recommendations and the Government will give it careful attention. However, the Government have made it clear that they do not support the Inquiry's recommendations on the re-classification or depenalisation of cannabis.
<P>

<a name="00510w06.html_para6">The Government have a clear and consistent view about the damage which drugs can cause to individuals, their families and the wider community, the link between drugs and crime--and the corresponding need to maintain firm controls. The Government are opposed to any lessening of controls on currently illicit drugs but favour a wide-ranging approach--we see a need for a balance of policies involving supply reduction, demand reduction and harm reduction.
<P>

<a name="00510w06.html_para7">The Police Foundation's report acknowledges that there are significant contradictions between Dutch drugs policy--under which small-scale possession and supply of cannabis remains illegal but the laws are not enforced--and international agreements. The Preamble to the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs 1961, states that effective measures against abuse of narcotic drugs require co-ordinated and universal action and that such action calls for international co-operation guided by the same principles and aimed at common objectives. The Government support these principles and have no intention of breaching their obligations under the 1961 United Nations drugs convention which commit the international community to working together against the illicit drug trade. It naturally follows from this that the Government also have no intention of allowing for the systematic non-enforcement of the law.

<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00510w07.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Stuart: </B> 
 Our proposals for setting maximum prices for generic medicines aim to protect the position of the National Health Service by correcting the effect of last year's price increases, while allowing reasonable returns to those in the supply chain. We believe that the proposed new prices, which are currently subject to consultation, should stimulate a good supply of generics, including patient packs, to the NHS.
<P>

<a name="00510w07.html_para1">Community pharmacists, along with other parties in the supply chain, have several months in which they can reduce their stockholdings before the proposed legislation requiring price cuts takes effect. In addition, reimbursement prices will not be brought into line with the new selling prices until the following month, thus providing a further time interval during which stocks can be run down and replaced with new stock at the lower price.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health pursuant to his answer of 20 April 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 624W, on slimming drugs, upon what grounds the urgent advice of the Committee on the Safety of Medicines has been sought concerning the drug amfepramone.  [121112]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00510w07.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Stuart </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 8 May 2000]:</i> The Committee's advice was sought following the suspension by the European Court of the European Commission Decision to withdraw amfepramone products from the Community market. The Committee was asked to consider the public health implications of the reinstatement of the licences for amfepramone.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what assessment he has made of the cost to the NHS of treatment for obesity that will arise from the withdrawal from the market of the drug phentermine and related products; and if he will make a statement.  [121108]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00510w07.html_spnew9"><B> Ms Stuart </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 8 May 2000]:</i> The decision to withdraw a product from the market is based on the safety and efficacy of that product and the associated impact on public health, not cost to the National Health Service. The decision to withdraw phentermine from the market was a European Commission Decision, with which the United Kingdom was obliged to comply, according to the legislation governing medicinal products in the European Union.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what checks are undertaken to ensure that NHS employed consultants who also work in private practice are able properly to account for their time.  [121455]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00510w07.html_spnew11"><B> Ms Stuart: </B> 
 Any National Health Service consultant who does private work is expected to devote substantially the whole of their professional time to their NHS work. It is for employers and employees to agree the balance between private and NHS work. Their responsibilities for the clinical care of their NHS patients must come first. It is for NHS management locally to ensure that all consultants are fulfilling their contractual commitments, and to take action if these are not being met in individual cases.
<P>

<a name="00510w07.html_para4">A whole time consultant is permitted to have private practice earnings of up to 10 per cent. of their gross NHS salary. If asked by their employer, they must provide fully audited accounts showing their gross income from private practice. If their private practice income exceeds 10 per cent. of their NHS salary in two consecutive years, they have the option of a maximum part-time contract, which means that the consultant foregoes one eleventh of whole time salary, in return for the removal of the restrictions on private practice earnings. However, whether on a whole time or maximum part time contract, there is a clear contractual obligation to devote substantially the whole of their professional time to their NHS duties.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health for what reason the Meat Hygiene Service inspector, Mr. Yogarathnum, was suspended from his duties at the Mead Webber Abattoir at Eardisley and replaced on 10 April 2000 by Mr. Turner of the St. David's Veterinary Practice at Exeter.  [121215]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00510w08.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Stuart: </B> 
 On 10 April 2000 St. David's Farm and Equine Veterinary Practice, Exeter commenced provision of contract official veterinary surgeons (OVSs) to the Mead Webber abattoir at Eardisley on behalf of the Meat Hygiene Service (MHS). Prior to this Mr. Yogarathnum, a Meat Hygiene Service employee, had undertaken both the OVS and principal official veterinary surgeon (POVS) duties at the premises.
<P>

<a name="00510w08.html_para0">Mr. Yogarathnum was relieved of his OVS duties at the Mead Webber abattoir, in order to allow him to spend more time on his POVS duties in a number of plants in the area. This included remaining as POVS at the Mead Webber abattoir.
<P>

<a name="00510w08.html_para1">Mr. Turner is a partner of the St. David Farm's and Equine Veterinary Practice. While providing locum cover for the new OVS that he had appointed to the Mead Webber abattoir, he identified a number of deficiencies in the operations and structure of the premises to which he drew management's attention. As a result of these

findings, the MHS Regional Director responsible for the Mead Webber abattoir visited the premises. He also discussed his concerns with plant management, Mr. Yogarathnum and the MHS meat inspection team. Mr. Yogarathnum was subsequently suspended, pending an investigation into his performance as POVS to the premises.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00510w08.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Stuart: </B> 
 Mr. Turner is a partner of the St. David's Farm and Equine Veterinary Practice at Exeter. The practice was successful in its tender to supply Contract Official Veterinary Surgeons on behalf of the Meat Hygiene Service (MHS) to Mead Webber abattoir at Eardisley. The rate per hour quoted in their tender for the provision of Contract official veterinary surgeons (OVSs) to the plant was &#163;24.98. On the basis that the OVS will be present at the plant for 21 hours (in line with previous OVS attendance), the total costs of providing contract OVSs to the plant is therefore &#163;524.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health how many Meat Hygiene Service veterinary meat inspectors were employed from 1995 to 10 April 2000 in the Mead Webber plant at Eardisley.  [121217]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00510w08.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Stuart: </B> 
 Between January 1997 and April 2000, fourteen official veterinary surgeons (OVSs) have carried out OVS duties on behalf of the Meat Hygiene Service at the Mead Webber plant at Eardisley. The vast majority of these provided locum cover for employed OVSs at the premises and as a consequence would only have spent a relatively short period of time in the plant.
<P>

<a name="00510w08.html_para2">In the time available it has not been possible to collate all of the information relating to the number of OVSs who worked at the plant between 1995 and December 1996, or the total number of meat inspection staff who have worked there between 1995 and April 2000.

<P><I>10 May 2000 : Column: 413W</I><P>

<BR>
The Benefits Agency's (BA) winter fuel team have made enquiries of their Mercia Area Directorate (AD5) which covers your constituency area. They advise that the question of replacing 13 girocheques is still outstanding pending further investigation.
<BR>
Any winter fuel payments reported lost, missing or not received are treated in the same manner as other lost or missing payments and replaced accordingly. If a customer reports a lost, missing or not received girocheque to the local BA Office a form is completed by the customer stating the circumstances of the loss or non-receipt. This can be either completed at the office or posted to the customer. If posted the process of replacement takes a little longer allowing for postage times. When the form is returned an officer acting on behalf of the Secretary of State examines the information to consider a replacement.

 There will be a thorough evaluation of the ONE service, which will use a range of standard evaluation techniques; quantitative and qualitative research, operational research and cost-benefit analysis. The success of the pilots will be evaluated by comparing the outcomes for participants in the pilot areas with those for similar people from other, comparable areas. The evaluation will also include assessments about the effectiveness of ONE compared to the present system and it will compare data from the different model pilots to assess their relative effects.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security what have been since 1992 the rates of <i>(a)</i> income support for mortgage interest and <i>(b)</i> the bank base rate.  [120380]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00510w09.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Bayley: </B> 
 From April 1992 until October 1995, the amount included for mortgage interest within the Income Support assessment for mortgage interest was determined by the actual interest rate charged by each claimant's lender. Since October 1995, the amount of Income Support allowed for mortgage interest has been determined by use of a Standard Interest Rate, limited by a maximum amount allowable. There are transitional arrangements applicable to people who were receiving help with mortgage interest at the point of change in October 1995.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security if he will make it his policy to compensate married women who received inaccurate advice from his Department about whether to revoke their decision to pay a reduced rate of national insurance contributions following the reform of national insurance contributions in 1989, and who as a result are receiving a lower rate of retirement pension.

 In 1989, the Department of Social Security ran a publicity campaign to inform lower-paid women that they could be paying more in reduced-rate National Insurance contributions than if they paid at the standard rate because of structural changes to National Insurance contributions introduced in October that year. They were also reminded that they could revoke their elections to pay the married women's reduced rate if they wish to do so.

<BR>
The Director of the Office for National Statistics (ONS) has been asked to reply to your recent question on levels of capital investment since 1988. I am replying in the Director's absence.
<BR>
Due to the introduction of a new European System of Accounts (ESA 95) the production of data on capital investment by industry has been postponed. The publication of these data is planned for the end of this year. The only information available is on investment in private (personal sector) dwellings and business investment in manufacturing industry (from 1994 only), which is given below (in &#163; million).

 The general theme of the Treasury Policy Action Team (PAT 14) report on "Access to Financial Services" is that tackling financial exclusion requires the development of new financial services products and new ways to access them. There is no single solution: diversity and choice are the watchwords.
<P>

<a name="00510w10.html_para4">The Government have made clear their expectation that the banks and building societies will play their part in combating financial exclusion. In particular a number of banks already offer basic bank accounts with no overdrafts and no charges which are suitable for those on low incomes. All Banks have been asked to provide such accounts by October. The Post Office also has a key role to play in delivering a range of banking services. The Government are contributing almost &#163;500 million to the capital costs of computerisation of the Post Office network. A number of banks and building societies have formed partnerships with the Post Office.

 Strychnine hydrochloride is a dangerous substance and strict controls are in place to regulate its circulation and use. Applications for permits to use it to kill moles are considered by MAFF's Regional Service Centres (RSCs), which issue the permit or refuse the application within 15 working days of receipt of the completed application. The established standard is quoted in the public statement of RSC customer service standards--"Commitment to Service".

<a name="00510w12.html_para7">During the 1999-2000 financial year, 98 per cent. of permits were issued within 15 working days despite an increase in applications of 14 per cent. from the previous year. We will continue to work and achieve the same standard in all cases.

 Local Drug Action Teams work in partnership with local agencies such as health and local authorities, police, probation and local education authorities to decide the financial priorities for drug prevention within their area according to local need. The Lancashire Drug Action Team receives a grant from the Home Office's Drug Prevention Advisory Service (DPAS) to fund its running costs. However, funding for their activities is channelled for the most part through local agencies. In addition, the Government's spending review is looking at ways to streamline funding and strengthen local delivery.

 Drug Action Teams (DATs) have a crucial role in the delivery of the National Drugs Strategy. They are the main mechanism for delivery on the ground, they work as a local partnership of the agencies involved in tackling drugs such as, Probation, Health, Education, Police Authorities and Local Authorities. DATs are required to plan and deliver an effective programme of activities for drugs which supports the National Strategy. DATs identify gaps in their provision and seek to address this. They assess what is being done in their area under each aim of the strategy, what is being spent and by whom and monitor the success of local initiatives.
