EFRs and SEFs are not technically complaints; they are the reporting mechanism used by units for routine equipment support issues. The data does not account for the results of subsequent investigations and therefore does not differentiate between what has actually been proven to be equipment failure, as opposed to operator error or damage sustained as a result of operations. Nor does this data give the severity of any such failures which in many cases have no discernable impact on operational capability or safety.</p>

The CPA makes clear provisions to tackle militia that operate outside the Government's control. But this process is not yet complete.
