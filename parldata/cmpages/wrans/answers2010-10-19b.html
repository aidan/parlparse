 The elections in Afghanistan were an Afghan-led process with support from the UK and the international community. The Electoral Complaints Commission (ECC) is the official body in Afghanistan who handle and investigate complaints of electoral fraud. To date, the ECC has received over 4,000 complaints in connection with the recent parliamentary elections. Allegations of electoral fraud in Helmand have been limited to 57: six have been classed as category 'A' complaints (based on credible evidence and likely to affect the outcome); 15 were classed as category 'B' (credible, but not likely to impact the overall outcome); 36 were classed as category 'C' (low credibility, poorly evidenced, unlikely to affect the final outcome).</p>

In summer 2010, Project Azure ran a campaign to raise awareness of FGM with families travelling back to practicing countries. Officers operated in Terminal 4, Heathrow airport, in plain clothes with a view to identifying proactively those girls who may have been at risk of being taken out of the UK for FGM. The initiative also sought to raise awareness with those communities about the implications of FGM. Findings from this initiative are currently being assessed and will determine any follow-up enquiries with girls identified as being at risk of FGM.</p>

 In Policing in the 21st Century: Reconnecting the police and the people, the Government have made clear that its approach to police value for money will involve ending the practice of procuring things in 43 different ways when it makes no sense to do so either operationally or financially. The Government are considering responses to the consultation paper Obtaining Better Value for Money from Police Procurement which set out proposals for Regulations to mandate the police service to use specified contractual arrangements to purchase particular equipment and services.</p>

Sir Philip Green's Efficiency Review, published on 11 October, has also highlighted the potential to save substantial sums through better procurement across Government.</p>

 We have discussed these issues with the industry and with DEFRA who are responsible for F-Gas Support, a business support unit that helps organisations affected by the fluorinated gas (F gas) regulatory regime. We are satisfied that the risk of leakage of fluorocarbons during or at the end of operation of hermetically sealed heat pumps is very small. Typically residual amounts, 1% or 2% of the system volume, might remain after refrigerant removal. This can increase to around 5% to 10% for very large, non-hermetically sealed, industrial heat pumps, where there is more scope of leakage through mechanical joints.

that total ASHP installation costs are usually in the range of £7,000 to £12,000. The costs for large homes could be significantly higher if the heat demand exceeds the capacity of the electrical supply and system reinforcement is required.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_437"><a name="101019w0002.htm_para13"><a name="10101955000162">The payback period for ASHPs depends on the fuel which they displace (that is, the counterfactual), usage and the operating efficiency of the equipment. There could be significant differences between installations. Assuming an operating efficiency of 250% to 275% and an installation cost of around £9,000 to £10,000, payback periods could range from eight to 16 years<sup>(1)</sup> when replacing electric heating. Payback periods are longer when the counterfactual is a less expensive off-grid fuel, such as heating oil and coal. In the case of natural gas, the cheapest heating fuel, the payback may be longer than the expected life of the heat pump.

 The Government have no plans to increase the statutory 10% target for audio description at this time. Following careful consideration of Ofcom's recent review of TV Access Services in the UK and the voluntary commitments made by a number of major broadcasters to audio describe 20% of their programming we have concluded that further regulation is not required at this time. We have asked Ofcom to continue to monitor levels of audio description provision and asked them to report to Government if the average level falls below the current levels. We will then consider whether to review the targets, or invite Ofcom to review and make recommendations.</p>

 The Communities and Neighbourhoods Directorate in the Department of Communities and Local Government is responsible for the formulation and in partnership with other Departments the implementation of policy on reducing the incidence of anti-Semitism. The department's work on anti-Semitism falls under the auspices of the team that works on hate crime and all other forms of hatred and intolerance. This team is made up of three officials, one at pay band 6.1, one at pay band 4.3 and one at pay band 3.2. All three have held a range of previous positions across Government including the Home Office, the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and Government Office for London.</p>

 The Department received over 400 responses to the Part L and F consultation and, having published a comprehensive Summary of Responses, has no plans to publish the individual responses to the 113 questions in the consultation document.

However, from 2013 there will be a mandatory EU-wide requirement under the energy using products directive for all circulator pumps placed on the market to be band A. The main trade association for the UK pump market argued that it would be unreasonable to expect pump manufacturers to modify designs twice in just over a two-year period.</p>

 We believe that it is vital that all children receive high-quality sex and relationships education (SRE), to ensure that they have the knowledge and skills they need to make the right decisions about relationships and sexual health later in life. We are currently considering how best to facilitate that, within the context of a slimmed down National Curriculum. We will be announcing our proposals for the curriculum as a whole later in the autumn.</p>

 Pay As You Earn (PAYE) calculations (P800s) issued to individuals are based on information held by HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC). P800s set out HMRC's information about income received and tax paid for the relevant period, together with a calculation of any further tax or repayment due. They are not assessments and do not create a legal debt: they tell customers what HMRC thinks is the correct tax position. Individuals who think the calculation is incorrect in any way should contact HMRC in the first instance. The notes which accompany the P800 explain how to get in touch with HMRC.</p>

 It is a normal part of the PAYE cycle that changes in circumstances that cannot be reflected in in-year tax deductions need to be reconciled annually. This is not a miscalculation but is a feature of the way the current PAYE system is designed.

The Coefficient of Variation (CV) indicates the quality of an estimate, the smaller the CV value the higher the quality. The true value is likely to lie within +/- twice the CV-for example, for an estimate of 200 with a CV of 5 per cent. we would expect the population total to be within the range 180-220<br>

It was accompanied by central funding over the three years 2008-09 to 2010-11 to support specific early aspects of implementation.

 The national stroke strategy launched in December 2007, sets out 20 'quality markers' which outline features of high quality stroke care across the pathway from prevention and awareness to life-long support in the community. A copy of the strategy has already been placed in the Library. Chapter 3, 'Life after stroke', sets out the wide range of support someone may need after a stroke. The range of support can include speech therapy, psychological support, physiotherapy, access to leisure, education, activities and work, accessible and aphasia-friendly information and support groups and help-lines.</p>

The Accelerating Stroke Improvement programme is therefore encouraging local areas to focus on improving arrangements for joint care plans, for six month and subsequent reviews and for access to psychological support. These measures offer opportunities for assessing the needs of stroke survivors and their carers. Meeting those needs more effectively will, over time, improve outcomes for people post-stroke.</p>

 Part 7 of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 (Criminal Memoirs etc.) was commenced by the previous Administration on 6 April 2010 and applies throughout the United Kingdom. It created a civil scheme whereby the High Courts in England and Wales and Northern Ireland, and the Court of Session in Scotland, can make certain offenders the subject of an "exploitation proceeds order". The offender may be ordered to pay the value of any benefit derived from the exploitation of material about the commission of serious offences to the relevant enforcement authority. Section 155(7) states that any sum received by an enforcement authority pursuant to an 'exploitation proceeds order' must be paid into the Consolidated Fund (or the Scottish Consolidated Fund where the scheme is operated in Scotland).</p>

 Like other public bodies, London Probation Trust must seek to use public funds in as effective a way as possible. As part of that, they must apply rigorous financial controls and undertake financial planning against a range of factors. These include, not only their overall budget, but also changes to the number of offenders requiring supervision, the effectiveness of interventions, and offending patterns. The Director of Offender Management for London, who commissions the services provided by London Probation Trust, will finalise the negotiations with them in the light of the outcome of the comprehensive spending review. These discussions will stress the need to ensure that front line activities are delivered as efficiently as possible and that HQ and support costs are minimised.</p>

For example, the Ministry's 'Transforming Justice' programme has focussed heavily on greater system efficiency, which will remain a priority over the coming Parliament and through the deficit reduction plan.

<i> [holding answer 18 October 2010]:</i> The development of local enterprise partnerships is a bottom up process. We have made no judgements regarding the optimal geography, population or gross domestic product of a LEP nor made an estimate on the optimal number of LEPs to be established. We wish to enable partnerships to better reflect the natural economic geography of the areas they serve and hence to cover real functional economic and travel to work areas. In addition, we would expect that partnerships to be of sufficient size to be able to have a strategic oversight of the area covered.</p>
