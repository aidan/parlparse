 No one has been charged or convicted under the equivalent provision in Northern Ireland. I am unable to say whether or not anyone has been arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to commit offences outside the United Kingdom: no central record is kept of arrests made under that heading.

 The independent Policing Commission is consulting widely and has received over 2,000 submissions--the vast majority from individual members of the public. It has met with many of the key figures in the field of policing and has recently held a number of public meetings throughout Northern Ireland. As the Agreement says, the Commission will report by summer 1999.

 The detailed information requested is either the subject of confidentiality or could not be answered on the ground of disproportionate costs (or both).
<P>

<a name="90222w01.htm_para0">Departments may use firms of solicitors in addition to the Departmental Solicitors Office and the Crown Solicitors Office, for example, where the relevant expertise lies in the private sector. The relationship is subject to the usual confidentiality which operates between lawyer and client.

<a name="90222w02.htm_para2">Mobile speed cameras were first introduced in Northern Ireland on 1 October 1997. Therefore the first full year for which information is available is 1998. Up to 30 September 1997 speeding offences attracted a &#163;20 fine and no penalty points. From 1 October 1997 they attracted a &#163;40 fine and 3 penalty points.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland how many punishment beatings there were in Northern Ireland between 1 May 1998 and 31 December 1998; and in respect of how many of these incidents, charges have been laid against the alleged perpetrators.  [71581]<P>

<a name="90222w02.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The table shows the number of casualties as a result of paramilitary-style attacks during the period 1 May to 31 December 1998. Charges are made on the basis of specific offences, for example, Common assault, Grievous bodily harm and Actual bodily harm. Those which are deemed to be paramilitary-style attacks are not recorded separately and it is therefore not possible to provide information on the number of persons made amenable for these attacks.

 <i>[holding answer 10 February 1999]:</i> The Crown Agents Holding and Realisation Board was established under the authority of the Crown Agents Act 1979.

 We are not currently funding any Casa Alianza projects in Honduras.

 <i>[holding answer 16 February 1999]:</i> Since 1 May 1997 the Department for International Development (DFID) has undertaken a review of international development policy, and a review of DFID's relationship with Civil Society. The review of international development policy led to the publication of the White Paper on International Development in November 1997. A report of the consultation which DFID conducted with Civil Society, North and South, will be published shortly. Key conclusions were set out in my speech on 'NGOs in a Global Future' on 13 January at Birmingham University. The costs incurred for these reviews are not separately identified, add little to the normal running costs of the department and could be provided only at disproportionate cost.
<P>

<a name="90222w03.htm_para0">The Department has also set up the Development Awareness Working Group. Expenditure of this advisory group is, to date, &#163;10,500. Preparatory documents, minutes of the meetings, and a report commissioned on "Learning from Others" are all available on the DFID website.
<P>

<a name="90222w03.htm_para1">No task forces have been established.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90222w03.htm_spnew5"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 I have not made such representations. The Zina Law is one of five laws introduced as part of the Huddood Ordinances in 1979. The implications of the proposed 15th Constitutional Amendment are not yet clear, but it is likely that it would extend the coverage of Islamic Law in Pakistan. This Amendment still has to be passed by the Senate, for which a two-thirds majority is required. We will continue to monitor developments. More generally, the Government regularly raise their concerns with the Pakistani authorities about human rights and particularly the rights of women and girls issues; and we shall continue to do so.

<P>
<a name="90222w03.htm_spnew6"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 The Zina Law is part of the Huddood Ordinance which has proved controversial in Pakistan since its introduction in 1979. Our development co-operation with Pakistan is clearly focused on reducing poverty, and takes careful account of human rights factors. We are working with the Government of Pakistan and other partners to make gender considerations an integral part of the development policy and planning; and we provide direct support for human rights and women's groups concerned with gender equity issues.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90222w03.htm_spnew9"><B> Mr. Stuart Bell: </B> 
 Clergy stipend recommendations are no longer made by the Church Commissioners, and their functions as Central Stipends Authority have been transferred by the Ministry Division of the Archbishops' Council from 1 January this year. The Central Stipends Authority gives very careful consideration to the question of stipend adequacy, including consultations with dioceses about stipend levels, and measuring the disposable income of clergy with that of other professions. A detailed review of stipend adequacy was last carried out in 1991/92, and it is likely that a further review will take place later this year.
<P>

<a name="90222w03.htm_para11">The number of candidates recommended for ordination in 1998 was 343, an increase of 5.6 per cent. on the previous year. This would clearly suggest that the level of stipend is not deterring candidates for ordination.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90222w03.htm_spnew10"><B> Mr. Stuart Bell: </B> 
 In the 3 years to 31 December 1998, 96 churches have been declared redundant and the Commissioners have become involved in settling their future. In the same period the Commissioners have vested 15 redundant churches in the Churches Conservation Trust for preservation. The Trust now maintains 317 such churches and the Commissioners provide 30 per cent. of their costs, or about &#163;1.07m in each of the Trust's last 3 financial years.

 The Army's recruiting initiative in Brent was an integral part of the Army ethnic minority recruiting campaign for 1997-98, and was designed to last for three months between January and March 1998.

 I am encouraged by indications that morale is maintained in the TA, and that it continues to attract new volunteers. We expect that the restructuring of the Territorial Army once implemented will, ensure that the TA is both more relevant and usable and, as a result, more satisfying to those who join.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will make a statement on the net effect of the review of the Territorial Army, in terms of number of units per head of the population, in <i>(a)</i> North West England and <i>(b)</i> North Wales.  [69318]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90222w07.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson: </B> 
 North Wales does not contain any TA units of Regiment or Battalion size. There are a number of sub-units in Northern Wales, but as sub-units vary considerably in size, a comparison between North Wales and the North West based on numbers of sub-units would not be meaningful. However, a comparison between the two regions based on numbers of TA members shows the net effect of the restructuring of the Territorial Army on each region.
<P>

<a name="90222w07.htm_para0">Before the review of the Territorial Army, the ratio of members of the TA to population in the North West was 1:1,023. After the review, the ratio was 1:1,366, or a net increase in the ratio of 36 per cent.
<P>

<a name="90222w07.htm_para1">Before the review of the Territorial Army, the ratio of members of the TA to population in North Wales was 1:1,050. After the review, the ratio was 1:1,832, or a net increase in the ratio of 74 per cent.

 The new strategy for the Defence Medical Services was the subject of comprehensive consultation within the three single Services and their respective medical Directors General are fully committed to implementing the recommendations.
<P>

<a name="90222w07.htm_para2">Since the announcement of the closure of the Royal Hospital, Haslar, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence has received direct representations from the Trade Unions and members of the public and there has been a protest march in Gosport. The Hospital Commander is consulting with local TUs, mainly through the Whitley process; staff in HQ DSCA are responding to the letters from the public. The representations of the protest marchers were received by the Agency Chief Executive.

<P>

<a name="90222w07.htm_spnew6"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson: </B> 
 In his statement on 14 December 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>329</i>, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence made clear that the Royal Hospital, Haslar will remain open until new arrangements are in place. The booklet supporting the strategy announcement added that closure was unlikely before 2002. The plans of the Portsmouth and South East Hants Health Authority include the redevelopment of their Queen Alexandra Hospital site. This and the establishment of our new Ministry of Defence Hospital Unit (MDHU) will take a number of years. We have agreed with the NHS that the process of change should be managed and gradual to ensure that RHH is able, in the meantime, to maintain its training role for Military personnel and treatment services for both Service and NHS patients.

 The decision to close the Royal Hospital, Haslar (RHH) was announced on 14 December 1998 <i>Official Report</i>, columns <i>328-29</i>, by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence as part of the overall new strategy for the Defence Medical Services.
<P>

<a name="90222w07.htm_para3">Since RHH became the core Service hospital in 1994, significant changes have occurred which put the continued viability of the hospital in doubt. In particular, it has become increasingly difficult for RHH to provide the specialist levels of care demanded by local GPs, new healthcare strategies have been introduced by the local NHS Trust and the location of RHH is no longer ideal for the majority of Service personnel. Additionally, the running costs of RHH (not least the use of Grade 2 listed buildings) are significantly higher than any possible alternatives. Closer DMS co-operation with the NHS, through the Ministry of Defence Hospital Unit (MDHU) concept, has already demonstrated clear operational and financial advantages over isolated military hospitals. We intend to pursue this option in Portsmouth.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will make a statement on the effect of the closure of the Royal Hospital, Haslar on local employment.  [70871]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90222w07.htm_spnew8"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson: </B> 
 Until the size and shape of the proposed Ministry of Defence Hospital Unit in Portsmouth is established it is much too early to estimate the impact of the closure of the Royal Hospital, Haslar on local employment. Once it is possible to do so, the Defence Secondary Care Agency will consult closely with Trade Unions and the Employment Services to ensure that any transfers and releases are carefully managed throughout the long lead time.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what assessment he has made of the costs of upgrading NHS facilities to replace the services supplied by Royal Hospital, Haslar to the civilian population.  [70873]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90222w07.htm_spnew9"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson: </B> 
 This is a matter for the Department of Health. The provision of health care to the local population is the responsibility of the Portsmouth and South East Health Authority.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90222w07.htm_wqn10"><B> Mr. Viggers: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how many (i) civilian and (ii) military personnel have been treated at the Royal Hospital, Haslar since 1995 <i>(a)</i> in total and <i>(b)</i> for accident and emergency cases.  [70869]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90222w07.htm_spnew10"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson: </B> 
 Hospitals count the numbers of admissions and the number of outpatient appointments. Those details for the Royal Hospital, Haslar, along with those for accident and emergency cases, are as follows in the table, from 1 January 1995.

The lower (Public Transport) rate is set at a level which reflects the average cost of travel by public transport and is paid for all other official travel by car.

<P>
<a name="90222w09.htm_spnew8"><B> Mr. George Robertson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 16 February 1999]:</i> Challenger 2 is expected to be in service with the British Army until 2025. As a key battle winning equipment, it will be the subject of enhancements throughout its life in order that it can continue to provide an effective capability. A number of enhancement measures are already being considered for the future. Specific details regarding these enhancements are classified, for reasons of operational security.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence, pursuant to his answer of 4 February 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>731</i>, for what reasons the average number of flying hours for Tornado GR aircraft was lower in 1998 than in 1997.  [71981]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90222w09.htm_spnew9"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson: </B> 
 For Tornado GR aircraft, there was a difference of just one hour flying time per aircraft per month between 1997 and 1998. We do not consider this to be a significant difference. In such a large fleet of aircraft there are numerous minor reasons for aircraft flying varying hours, but the main one in this case was the major modifications programme that the aircraft were and are still undergoing.

<P>
<a name="90222w09.htm_spnew10"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson: </B> 
 The principal reason for Tornado F3 aircraft flying fewer hours in 1998 than in 1997 is that the aircraft were undergoing a major upgrade programme.

 External lighting may require planning permission, particularly, for example, where installations are substantial and affect the external appearance of a building. Local authorities may also attach conditions to planning permissions for new development which cover the design and operation of lighting systems. These conditions can control the type and siting of light installations, and place restrictions on the spread and duration of light.

In addition, advice on floodlighting is given in Planning Policy Guidance Note 17, 'Sport and Recreation'. My officials are also in discussion with the DIY industry to identify ways in which their customers might be made more aware of the problems which badly positioned lighting can cause. Our view is that the present combination of planning controls and practical advice is the best way forward and we are not proposing to introduce further legislation in this area.

The last survey was carried out in 1996 and another is planned for 2001. As the survey is only a (representative) sample of the stock it cannot identify which particular local areas have concentrations of poor housing conditions or low energy efficiency levels. Local authorities themselves assess housing conditions and energy efficiency levels in their areas to produce locally based strategies.

<a name="90222w17.htm_spnew1"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 Our intention to commission a new research trial on the effect of night-time aircraft noise on sleep disturbance was announced on 27 February last year, when the first stage consultation on night restrictions at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted airports was published. The trial is expected to focus on methodologies, assessing experimental and analytical techniques--and their limitations--which are related to the measurement of sleep disturbance. The findings of the trial will help us decide whether to proceed with a full-scale study of sleep disturbance, and to determine what should be included in any such study. The trial will be based at Manchester Airport, which provides a suitable combination of densely populated communities close to the airport with a spread of aircraft noise throughout the night. It may be extended to Heathrow if actual noise levels in the early morning at Manchester prove insufficient for the purposes of the trial. If, on completion of the trial, we decide to continue with more detailed research, the question of where that study would be based is one of many issues which would need to be considered at that time, based on objective research considerations.
<P>

<a name="90222w17.htm_para0">A steering group, which includes community and industry representatives, has been established to oversee the trial and expert advice is obtained from a technical group made up of specialists in relevant scientific fields.

The aim is to achieve both a strong and a diverse membership.

 Our aim is to develop a framework for public transport information that builds on existing local and national sources--including the National Rail Enquiry Service--and extends them systematically across the country. At my request, the relevant parties are working together under the auspices of the Confederation of Passenger Transport. Decisions have yet to be taken on the preferred system architecture and funding, but the Department has given over &#163;1 million of credit approvals this year to enable local authorities to play their part, and has invited further bids for funding in 1999-2000.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will make a statement on his discussions with mortgage lenders and insurers on protection for home buyers.  [72509]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90222w17.htm_spnew5"><B> Ms Armstrong: </B> 
 The Government are committed to working with mortgage lenders to encourage greater provision of flexible mortgage products and better protection for home buyers. A mortgage is one of the biggest financial commitments of most people's lives. Home buyers need to think seriously about how they would meet their mortgage payments if they lost their income. Help with mortgage payments through the benefits system (Income Support Mortgage Interest) is confined to people receiving Income Support or income-based Jobseeker's Allowance; most claimants wait for nine months before Income Support Mortgage Interest is paid. Home buyers therefore need better, more effective insurance to protect their mortgage payments against unforeseen periods of financial difficulty caused by problems such as accidents, sickness and unemployment. Following discussions with the Government, the Council of Mortgage Lenders and the Association of British Insurers intend to announce tomorrow a new benchmark for mortgage payment protection insurance products which all lenders and insurers will need to meet or exceed. The Government welcome this move, which paves the way for higher quality, better value insurance operating alongside state benefits to provide a more effective level of protection. Everyone with a mortgage or applying for a mortgage should consider carefully whether mortgage payment protection insurance is suitable for their needs and circumstances. If it is, they should seek professional information and advice on a policy which meets their requirements and offers good value.

 Section 54A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 requires that planning applications are determined in accordance with the statutory development plan for the area, unless material considerations indicate otherwise. Local planning authorities are required to have regard to national and regional planning guidance when preparing their development plans. National and local strategies, including Local Agenda 21 strategies, may also inform the plan preparation process to the extent that they have a bearing on land use planning matters. Such strategies may also relate to matters which are, or which are capable of being, material considerations to be weighed when local planning authorities take decisions on individual planning applications. Local Agenda 21 strategies do not, however, form part of the statutory planning system.

<a name="90222w18.htm_spnew4"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The statistics were taken from my Department's publication "Transport Statistics Great Britain".

Total motoring costs fell by 10 per cent. to 1990, but have increased since then to the levels of 20 years ago. Labour costs, which rise faster than average prices, tend to have had a greater influence on the costs of public transport and car maintenance than on car purchase costs, which have fallen in real terms because of improved

<a name="90222w19.htm_spnew0"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The routes followed by aircraft taking off from City and Stansted airports, and those followed by aircraft inbound to the Lambourne holding position (stack) over SW Essex used by aircraft waiting to land at Heathrow, have not changed in the last two years. Aircraft preparing to land at City, Heathrow and Stansted are managed tactically by air traffic control within controlled airspace set aside for the purpose which also has not changed over this period. Much of the airspace over Essex, including that over Thurrock below an altitude of 2500ft and over Southend below an altitude of 3500ft, does not form part of the controlled airspace of the London Terminal Control Area and is available for use by general aviation.
<P>

<a name="90222w19.htm_para0">Restrictions on night flights at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted airports have not been changed in the last two years, but future arrangements to apply from 31 October 1999 were the subject of a consultation paper issued by my Department on 17 November 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>492</i>, with a closing date for responses of 12 February 1999. The consultation paper included details of the Early Morning Landings Trial for aircraft approaching to land at Heathrow from the east. As a result of the trial, which began in September 1995, more aircraft are joining Heathrow's instrument landing system at higher altitudes further from touchdown, including over London boroughs east of Central London, but there have been no variations to flight paths over Essex.

To provide the information requested for each NDPB individually from the totals issued by DETR since its formation in May 1997, and prior to that from the totals issued by the former Department of the Environment and Department of Transport would be disproportionately costly.

 <i>[holding answer 16 February 1999]:</i> Rules governing the work of the GICS are laid down in the Guidance on the work of the Government Information Service published by the Cabinet Office in July 1997. More specific guidance on the writing and issuing of press releases is given in the Working Guide for Government Information Officers. Copies of both documents are in the Libraries of the House.

<a name="90222w20.htm_para6">Press releases are principally issued on my Department's behalf via the Central Office of Information's News Distribution Service. The cost of this service for DETR for the period in question was &#163;111.8k. Figures for DETR staff and postage costs specifically in relation to the issue of press releases are not available.

 Subject to Parliamentary approval of the necessary Supplementary Estimate, the cash limit for Class XVIII, Vote 3 will be increased by &#163;157,000 from &#163;2,887,000 to &#163;3,044,000 and the gross running costs limit will be increased by &#163;157,000 from &#163;2,360,000 to &#163;2,517,000.
<P>

<a name="90222w20.htm_para7">The increase in the cash and running cost limits reflects the transfer to the Department of responsibility for minor occupier charges, together with the cost of establishing an office and support for my hon.

<P>

<a name="90222w20.htm_para8">The increase in minor occupier charges will be offset by a transfer of &#163;87,000 from Cabinet Office Class XVIII, Vote 1, and savings elsewhere within Class XVIII; and the remainder will be a charge to the Reserve and will not therefore add to the planned total of public expenditure.

To ask the President of the Council when the then Select Committee on European Legislation reported on proposals from the European Commission to regulate the growing of genetically modified plants for research and sale, when such proposals were considered in Standing Committee and on the Floor of the House; and what resolutions were passed.  [72180]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90222w20.htm_spnew6"><B> Mrs. Beckett: </B> 
 The European Commission adopted a proposal in February 1998 to amend Council Directive 90/220/EEC. This Directive establishes a system of controls which require prior consent from a Member State competent authority or any research and development release of genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Approval at Community level is required before any

product containing GMOs may be placed on the Community market. The proposed amendment, which is contained in EC document 6378/98, COM(98)85 final, is currently under negotiation. The Government submitted an explanatory memorandum on the proposal on 23 March 1998 which was considered by the then Select Committee on European Legislation on 29 April 1998. The Committee reported that the proposal raised issues of political importance but requested further information from the Government and did not clear it from scrutiny (26th report, 97-98, HC 155-xxv1). The Committee subsequently reconsidered the proposal on 9 December 1998 on the basis of further information provided by the Government in a letter of 27 November 1998 from my right hon. Friend the Minister for the Environment. The Committee maintained that the proposal raised issues of political importance and recommended that it should be debated in European Standing Committee A (3rd report, 98-99 HC 34-iii). That debate has yet to take place but will be held in good time before any decisions are taken on the proposed amendments by the Council of Ministers. An adjournment debate on the effect of Directive 90/220/EEC was held on 16 December 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 927-33, by my hon. Friend the Member for Norwich, North (Dr. Gibson).

At 1 May 1997, the regulators' published figures showed about 15 per cent. of these case reviews had been completed. The latest figures for 30 November 1998 showed 91 per cent. of priority reviews completed.

 <i>[holding answer 15 February 1999]:</i> The introduction of quarterly payments of corporation tax will affect some 20,000 companies. This measure was part of a package of measures introduced in the 1998 Budget which included the abolition of Advanced Corporation Tax (ACT) and a 1 per cent. cut in the main rate of corporation tax from April 1999. After a four year transition period, the effect for these companies of introducing quarterly payments, abolishing ACT and the 1 per cent. rate cut is likely on average to be a reduction in liability.

 <i>[holding answer 15 February 1999]:</i> In respect of all but the 1998 changes obliging companies to include amounts chargeable under the controlled foreign company (CFC) rules in their self assessment tax returns the measures referred to are aimed at stemming the loss of tax through avoidance devices and possibly outright evasion, rather than being tax raising. The relevant tax yields in the respective Budget Reports reflect the direct effects of the measures within the existing level of activity. The measures protect the Exchequer against greater losses in the future. Accurate estimates of the number of businesses affected directly at the time action was taken, or who might in future have been involved if action had not been taken, are not available.
<P>

<a name="90222w22.htm_para0">In respect of the CFC change relating to self assessment, it is estimated that 1,500 groups will be affected by the new legislation and that the total compliance cost will be under &#163;10 million in the first year. Recurrent costs will be considerably less than initial costs. The change is estimated to raise &#163;50 million in a full year.

 The Government's position on the Energy Products Directive is that we favour some aspects of the proposal, such as higher minimum rates of tax on road fuels. However, we could not accept, for social policy reasons, any obligation to impose new taxes on domestic fuel and power. Our attitude to new taxes on business use of energy will depend on the decisions we take in the light of Lord Marshall's report on 'Economic Instruments and the Business Use of Energy', which was published on 3 November 1998.
<P>

<a name="90222w22.htm_para1">Under the terms of the draft Directive, Member States may introduce optional exemptions from tax or reduced rates for certain types of energy product and to products put to particular uses. This applies to energy products used in pilot projects for the development of more environmentally friendly products, or in relation to fuels from renewable sources of energy such as solar, wind and geothermal power and biofuels.

 <i>[holding answer 16 February 1999]:</i> Under section 152(a) of the Customs and Excise Management Act 1979 the Commissioners may "compound" any proceedings for an offence under the Customs and Excise Acts i.e. accept a monetary penalty in lieu of prosecution. The decision whether to prosecute or compound proceedings is taken on the merits of each case. Offers to compound are made only if there is sufficient evidence to support criminal proceedings. Where an offer to compound is refused it is the policy of the Commissioners to prosecute for the alleged offence.

<a name="90222w23.htm_para10">The introduction of a new export licence application form and the ELATE computer system on 1 March 1999 is a first step in the process towards the use of electronic data in export licence processing. For the first time, exporters will be able to apply for a standard individual export licence using electronic information transferred on a floppy disk. The information on the disk will be entered into the ELATE system at the DTI and, where applications have to be circulated to the FCO or MoD for advice, the electronic information will be transferred to them via a modem link or on disk.

 Available information is given in the tables. No official data are collected for tax revenues from foreign enterprises or total royalties paid to abroad by the UK on FDI.
<P>

<a name="90222w24.htm_para0"><i>(a)</i> Table 1 shows the stocks and flows of foreign direct investment into the UK each year from 1978 until 1997, the latest year available. FDI covers not only the acquisition of fixed assets, stock building and stock appreciation but all other financial transactions, such as additions to, or payments of, working capital, other loans and credit, and acquisitions of securities. The figures cover transactions where the investor's purpose is to have an effective voice in the company, taken to be equivalent to a holding of 20 per cent. or more (10 per cent. in the 1997 figures). Stock figures are recorded at the end of the stated period. They are not cumulative totals of investment flows, but also take account of goodwill write-offs, revaluation of assets and exchange rate fluctuations.

<a name="90222w24.htm_wqn3"><B> Mr. Rendel: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what changes have been made to the CHN21, Dormant Company Accounts booklet to ensure that directors of dormant companies are made aware of the DCA forms.  [71136]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90222w24.htm_spnew3"><B> Dr. Howells </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 15 February 1999]:</i> A new version of CHN 21 is currently being printed. It makes reference to the availability of a form DCA for dormant companies that have not traded since incorporation. This is not a statutorily prescribed form. It is offered as a helpful aid for dormant companies and its use is entirely optional.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90222w24.htm_wqn4"><B> Mr. Rendel: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what publicity has been arranged for the Dormant Company Accounts form relating to the submission of annual accounts by dormant companies.  [71135]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90222w24.htm_spnew4"><B> Dr. Howells </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 15 February 1999]:</i> The availability of the Dormant Company Accounts form was communicated via the Companies House Magazine for customers, "The Register". This is widely read by professional presenters, who submit accounts to the Agency on behalf of companies. It has also been publicised via Companies House User Groups and at their Road Shows. Companies House cannot readily target individual dormant company directors. The Companies House publicity budget does not allow it to do more than publicise the most important issues in national media and mail drops.

[70458]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90222w24.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. Byers </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 15 February 1999]:</i> The Department has 46 per cent. of its staff located outside London. This includes the Patent Office and Companies House, which relocated from London to Wales, a strong presence in the Government Offices for the Regions and the regional networks of the Insolvency Service, Employment Tribunals Service and Radiocommunications Agency. There has been no major decentralisation in recent years. The scope for further relocation is limited by operational requirements.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90222w25.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 In 1994, the GATT secretariat estimated that, by the year 2005, the Uruguay Round Agreement could boost world incomes by up to 1.4 per cent. per annum and European Union incomes by up to 1.7 per cent. per annum.




<P>
<P><I>22 Feb 1999 : Column: 93</I><P>

<P>

<a name="90222w25.htm_para0">No reliable estimates have been made of the output or employment benefits of the Agreement to the UK alone. However, as the second largest trader with non-EU economies among EU Member States, the UK is likely to be a major beneficiary of these projected income gains.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90222w25.htm_spnew1"><B> Dr. Howells </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 15 February 1999]:</i> The draft directive is under consideration at Council Working Group level and is unlikely to be discussed by Ministers unless a greater degree of consensus can be reached.

 I am not aware of any representations concerning competition between financial intermediaries to which small businesses can apply for venture capital.
<P>

<a name="90222w25.htm_para1">I am aware that growing businesses have faced difficulties in raising venture capital in small amounts. We therefore announced, in the Competitiveness White Paper (Cmd 4176), the creation of the Enterprise Fund. One of the functions of this Fund will be to stimulate the availability of venture capital for smaller businesses.
<P>

<a name="90222w25.htm_para2">We are also working with the key players in the informal investment or "business angel" markets to stimulate the availability of venture capital from individual investors.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90222w25.htm_spnew7"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 There is a wide variety of existing measures available to manufacturing companies to learn from and adopt the best practice of their international competitors. New measures include the CBI-led "Fit for the Future" Campaign, launched by the Secretary of State in December 1998 and featured in the recently published Competitiveness White Paper. The Campaign will provide an umbrella to enable business to get help and advice when and where is it needed. The Campaign is business led and is supported by the Department to ensure coverage of all sectors and sizes of industry.
<P>

<a name="90222w25.htm_para4">The White Paper announced other measures designed to increase competitiveness through the process of "Business learning from Business". Two examples are the adaptation of the successful automotive sector project where "world-class" engineers work within the supply base to make significant improvements in manufacturing practice. The Department will be investing &#163;15 million to support projects in up to 10 new sectors. A further example is the Department's work to gather international data based to the UK Benchmarking Index. This development will enable SMEs to compare their own business performance with peer groups in the UK and world-wide.

 None. Subject to meeting relevant safety, security and international safeguard requirements, it is for the owners of spent nuclear fuel to choose whether to reprocess it or whether to seek alternative management options. The contracts now in place between BNFL and German electricity utilities are for reprocessing spent nuclear fuel. Since 1976 all new contracts for reprocessing of overseas spent fuel have contained options for return of wastes. The government intend that such options should be exercised and that wastes arising from reprocessing be returned to the country of origin. Arrangements for the return of wastes are a commercial matter between BNFL and its overseas customers, subject to meeting relevant regulatory requirements.

 The Criminal Records Bureau is being established to enable checks to be carried out to help prevent unsuitable people from working with children or vulnerable adults.

 All applicants will have to pay for certificates from the Criminal Records Bureau. We considered very carefully whether there was any way in which free checks could be provided for any groups, especially volunteers. We have concluded that it will not be practicable to provide any free checks from the Criminal Records Bureau. We realise that this is unwelcome news but providing free checks would prove an unsustainable burden on the public purse and may increase demand for certificates from the Bureau to an uncontrollable extent. In addition, we do not consider it would be fair to allow one or two groups to have free certificates when there are other equally deserving groups.

<a name="90222w27.htm_para5">It should be noted that the figures for the Refugee Legal Centre and the Immigration Advisory Service are based on outcomes (those cases in which the appeal may or may not have finally been disposed). The cases dealt with by the Refugee Legal Centre based on outputs is 8,154. The Immigration Advisory Service do not have any comparable statistical information on outputs.

 Offenders sentenced to 12 months and over are subject on release to supervision by a probation officer in accordance with National Standards, which apply whether or not an offender qualifies for the home detention curfew scheme. These Standards lay down, amongst other things, minimum levels of contact. A copy of the Standards is in the Library. They are now being reviewed in consultation with interested bodies, but revisions will not come into effect before April 2000.

Only 2 of these persons applied for asylum, both in 1996--a Ghanaian who made a voluntary departure from the United Kingdom before a decision was reached on the application, and a Nigerian whose application was refused.

The leaflet "A Review of Sex Offences" invites views on how the criminal law should apply in the area of sex offences, and asks for responses by 19 March 1999. Some 4,000 copies of the leaflet have been sent out to a wide cross-section of organisations and individuals concerned with criminal justice and social policy. The leaflet is also available on the Internet.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90222w31.htm_spnew8"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 Recorded crime statistics relate to offence type, not to the relationship between offender and victim. There is, therefore, no definitive figure for the number of crimes which are domestic in nature.

<a name="90222w31.htm_para10">Statistical returns submitted to Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) by police forces in England and Wales have included a figure on domestic violence incidents, but, until now, the definition of "domestic violence" has been interpreted very differently between forces. From April 1999, HMIC will be adopting a narrower, but common, definition.
<P>

<a name="90222w31.htm_para11">The 1996 British Crime Survey included a new computerised self-completion questionnaire designed to give the most reliable findings to date on the extent of domestic violence in England and Wales.

The police were told of 9 per cent. of incidents against women who reported one or two attacks, and 22 per cent. of incidents against women who reported three or more attacks.

The panels currently comprise 103 barristers from 42 different sets of chambers. The Attorney-General will shortly appoint a third panel of very junior barristers. The Attorney-General's individual nomination is required before a barrister who is not on one of the approved panels can be instructed to appear for the Government in litigation.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90222w32.htm_spnew6"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 In the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, we provided the means to tackle local road policing issues. In August 1998 we set new overarching aims and objectives for the police. The importance of road policing is emphasised in both the objective of improving road safety and the objective of reducing crime and the fear of crime. In November, in his letter to forces about his new development priorities, my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary specifically emphasised the importance of road policing.
<P>

<a name="90222w32.htm_para3">The recent thematic inspection of road policing by Her Majesty's Inspector of Constabulary concluded that not enough attention had previously been given to road policing and its recommendations seek the proper integration of the function which would lead to greater consistency of approach across forces.

 The National Schedule of Reference Costs, published in November 1998, is based on information supplied by National Health Service trusts. The information is based on the 1997-98 final accounts. The information is submitted to the NHS Executive by June 30 each year, on the same timescales as the final accounts information and is therefore retrospective in nature.

<P>
<a name="90222w34.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 There are an estimated 4.9 million carers in England, of whom 4.6 million are over the age of 25 years. Of these, around 900,000 (800,000 of whom are aged over 25) are in the North West. This information comes from the General Household Survey for 1995 and cannot be used reliably to estimate the numbers of carers in individual cities or local authority areas. The General Household Survey also suggests that around 2 per cent. of carers are in full-time education in England. The numbers in the survey are too small to allow estimates to be made for the North West or for Bolton. There is no information on part-time students in the General Household Survey.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90222w34.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 Carers may be prevented from entering further or higher education by the extent of their caring responsibilities, particularly if they are providing care for a large number of hours each week. Other factors which may have an effect include the availability of substitute care and the effects of caring on the carer's own health and wellbeing. Our National Strategy for Carers, "Caring about Carers", copies of which are in the Library, sets out proposals to meet carers' needs better than in the past. The availability of substitute care, to give carers a break from their caring responsibilities, will be enhanced by additional funding of &#163;140 million over the next three years for England.

 Local authorities, together with their health authority partners, will be responsible for assessing the needs of carers in their area for services to allow them to have a break from their caring responsibilities, for establishing whether current services meet carers' needs and for extending the range of services provided where this appears necessary. They will also be responsible for deciding who is eligible to receive services. In assessing how to use the additional funding, local authorities will take account of their current expenditure on respite care.

<P>
<a name="90222w34.htm_spnew7"><B> Ms Jowell </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 21 January 1999]:</i> The Department has carried out detailed investigations into the possible links between air pollution and asthma. The Department's Committee on the Medical Effects of Air Pollutants published an extensive report on the subject, "Asthma and Outdoor Air Pollution", in 1995. The report made it clear that, while asthma and other atopy based diseases, such as hay fever and eczema, had increased considerably in many western countries over the past thirty years, this increase was unlikely to be caused by air pollution. The report acknowledged that exposure to some air pollutants could adversely affect individuals already suffering from asthma and trigger attacks.
<P>

<a name="90222w34.htm_para0">Since then, evidence that air pollutants, including nitrogen dioxide (an indoor as well as an outdoor air pollutant) and diesel particles, may enhance the body's biological response to allergens has strengthened. There does not appear to be any convincing evidence that eczema is related to exposure to air pollution.
<P>

<a name="90222w34.htm_para1">The prevention and treatment of asthma and allergic conditions are high priority topics within the Department's research programmes, including the &#163;4 million National Health Service asthma management programme. The Department also funds a number of research projects as part of its joint air pollution research programme with the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions and the Medical Research Council, which are examining the impact of air pollutants on asthma sufferers as well as a separate joint programme on indoor air pollutants and damp in the home. In addition to this, the Medical Research Council also funds a substantial Government programme of basic research into asthma and allergies amounting to over &#163;2 million in 1997-98.

 The money allocated by the Department each year to health authorities is not differentiated according to the patient groups for whom services are to be provided. At the local level, most service agreements between health authorities and National Health Service trusts and other provider bodies for hospital and community health services relate to general service areas or to specific medical and surgical specialties, which will cover disabled people like others. The same is true of expenditure on family health services.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90222w34.htm_spnew9"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The National Health Service Executive appointed "Disability Matters", a specialist consultancy, to develop a proposed action programme for the implementation of Section 21 of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 across the NHS. We plan to issue guidance, based on the report submitted by "Disability Matters" later this year.
<P>

<a name="90222w34.htm_para2">It is for individual social services authorities to assess the impact on them of the implementation of the goods and services provisions of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 from October 1999. All social services authorities in England were included in the consultation carried out by the Department for Education and Employment on the implementation of the new requirements. The vast majority of social services departments were aware of what their new duties entailed, and were content with the proposals.

<P>
<a name="90222w36.htm_spnew0"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 Given the wide range of treatments available both through orthodox and complementary medicine, it would be very difficult to draw any meaningful conclusions about their relative cost/benefits as a whole. The National Research Register includes details of projects which have examined the clinical and cost effectiveness of certain types of treatment or intervention for individual conditions, including complementary therapies. The Register is available in the Library and most medical libraries on CD Rom, and on the Internet at: http://www.doh.gov.uk/nrr.htm.

<a name="90222w36.htm_spnew2"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 The availability of osteopathy within the National Health Service, as with any other forms of treatment, reflects decisions taken locally by health authorities and general practitioners about the clinical and cost effectiveness of such services and the priority given to their provision in the light of competing demands for the resources. A report published in 1995 by the Medical Care Research Unit of Sheffield University showed that some 40 per cent. of general practitioner partnerships in England provided some form of complementary therapy for their NHS patients.

 In response to continuing concerns expressed by some implanted women, an Independent Review Group was set up by the Chief Medical Officer in May 1997 to review the possible health issues associated with silicone gel breast implants and to examine the issues relating to pre-operative patient information. The members of the group were selected for their independent views, their knowledge and understanding of the issues and lack of any vested interest in the conclusions reached. The group reported back to the Chief Medical Officer in July 1998 and a copy of that report is available in the Library.

<a name="90222w36.htm_para4">The Independent Review Group took evidence from various organisations and individuals, including a representative of the British Association of Plastic Surgeons and the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons, and a representative of the British Association of Cosmetic Surgeons. Subsequent to the group's report, the Royal College of Surgeons has agreed to develop multidisciplinary clinical standards for breast implant surgery.

To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland if he will take steps to safeguard the public in West Sutherland from increased numbers of straying deer.  [69597]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90222w37.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. Macdonald </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 8 February 1999]:</i> The Deer Commission for Scotland is encouraging Deer Management Groups and estate owners to take measures as appropriate to reduce the numbers of deer straying onto roads or feeding on roadside verges, for example by introducing supplementary feeding as a method of drawing deer away from public highways. The Commission is also continuing to discuss with the roads authorities and the police matters such as road design, installation of warning signs, and use of wildlife roadside reflectors or fencing. These authorities also have discretion to introduce lower speed limits in certain circumstances.
<P>

<a name="90222w37.htm_para14">Although deer numbers in the area have not increased, there is evidence to suggest that deer are spending more time on lower ground.

 I am publishing the Green Paper "Investing in Modernisation--An Agenda for Scotland's Housing" today, and have arranged for copies to be placed in the Library of the House.
<P>

<a name="90222w40.htm_para0">The Government's firm belief is that every household should be able to live in a decent, secure and affordable home, and the Green Paper sets out a range of ideas and proposals for achieving this objective. We have already made substantial progress towards this goal, for example, by providing an additional &#163;300 million of investment for housing; by developing new programmes through the Warm Deal, Empty Homes, and Rough Sleepers initiatives; by establishing New Housing Partnerships to lever in private finance; and by putting community regeneration and tenant empowerment at the centre of our strategy. The publication of "Investing in Modernisation"--the first Scottish Housing Green Paper in twenty years--is further evidence of the importance which this Government attach to improving housing in Scotland.
<P>

<a name="90222w40.htm_para1">The Green Paper seeks views on a wide-range of issues and proposals, some forty in all. It emphasises the need for a long-term strategy which recognises the links with health, employment, and environmental policies and the role that housing can play in promoting social inclusion. It addresses all housing tenures, and places particular emphasis on the housing needs of the most vulnerable members of our society--rough sleepers and the homeless, community care users and families in cold and damp homes. "Investing in Modernisation" sets out the Government's ideas for revitalising public housing through the promotion of community ownership, which offers the prospect of fundamental and radical change which should bring major benefits to tenants, local authorities and communities. The Green Paper also highlights the importance of local authorities developing a strategic role in respect of housing in their areas, and it assesses the current activities of Scottish Homes and seeks views on how these might best be carried out in future.

To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland if he will estimate the annual cost of abolishing the tolls on the Skye Bridge and paying a shadow toll to Skye Bridge Ltd. for the remaining years of the contract; and if he will make a statement.  [69246]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90222w40.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Macdonald </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 4 February 1999]:</i> The terms of the contract with the concessionaire are that any changes to the concession agreement must have the consent of the concessionaire. Accordingly, it is not possible to estimate the final cost of shadow tolling. However, as my right hon. Friend said in his written answer of 4 July 1997, <i>Official Report</i>, columns <i>288-90</i>, the idea of removing tolls completely through 100 per cent. shadow tolls is not less expensive than buying out the contract nor in public expenditure terms does it have the effect of spreading the cost over a number of years, as people have tended to assume. The full cost of the project would be a public expenditure charge immediately because of the absence of the transfer of risk to the private sector, which is what justifies the phased public expenditure cost for DBFO roads contracts entered into before construction has begun. The cost of buying out the contract is estimated to be at least &#163;25m, but the final figure would depend upon the outcome of negotiations with the concessionaire. Hence, full shadow tolling is not considered an affordable option given the other competing pressures upon the roads budget.

 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Social Security, announced to the House on 8 February 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, columns <i>35-45</i>, that Treasury Ministers would take on responsibility for policy on National Insurance on 1 April 1999. The Social Security Contributions (Transfer of Functions, Etc. Bill currently before Parliament transfers operational responsibility for National Insurance contributions, Statutory Sick Pay, Statutory Maternity pay and contracting out matters, together with control and management of the National Insurance Fund, to the Board of the Inland Revenue. It also transfers responsibility for policy on National Insurance contributions from my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State to Treasury Ministers.
<P>

<a name="90222w40.htm_para4">Policy responsibility for Statutory Sick Pay, Statutory Maternity Pay, contracting out, credits, Home Responsibilities Protection and the security of the National Insurance Number system remains with my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Social Security. He will also continue to be responsible for benefits. Ministers and, where appropriate, officials will be accountable to Parliament on the areas for which they are responsible. Treasury Ministers will answer questions relating to the Inland Revenue including those responsibilities transferred to it by the Bill. It is for the House to decide on the areas of responsibility for Select Committees.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security where an employee takes out a stakeholder pension through the access given by his employer and then changes job, what arrangements will ensure continued access to the same stakeholder pension.  [71174]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90222w41.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 The Green Paper "Partnership in Pensions" indicated that the requirement on employers to provide access to stakeholder pension schemes, including the deduction of contributions from pay, would initially apply only to a single scheme nominated by the employer. An employee who moved to a new employer with a different nominated scheme and who wished to remain in his or her current scheme would be able to do so, but would need to make his or her own arrangements for passing contributions to the scheme, unless the new employer agreed to pass on contributions on a voluntary basis.
<P>

<a name="90222w41.htm_para0">We believe it would be desirable in the longer term to move to a position where employers would be required to pass employees' contributions to any stakeholder scheme. Before doing so, we would want to ensure that such a requirement did not impose an undue administrative burden on employers. The Green Paper indicates that we plan to consult further on the idea of a clearing house for contributions, which could be helpful in reducing the cost to employers of passing contributions to a number of different schemes.

 We intend that men and women widowed over State pension age will be able to inherit half the State second pension entitlement of their late spouse (subject to the overall maximum). In line with the proposals for bereavement benefits currently before Parliament, those with dependent children who are widowed before State pension age will also be able to inherit half their late spouse's State second pension entitlement as part of their Widowed Parent's Allowance. Those without dependent children will be able to inherit half their late spouse's State second pension entitlement when they reach State pension age (again subject to the overall maximum).

<P>

<a name="90222w41.htm_para8">Pooled investment schemes, including unit trusts, typically take most of their income from an annual percentage charge on the funds under management and should therefore be well placed to deliver flexible arrangements with charges that do not penalise individuals who stop paying in, or who wish to transfer their pension savings to another scheme. Details of the minimum standards that all stakeholder pension schemes will be required to meet, including those on charges, will be set out in due course.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security for which customers and from what dates the Contributions Agency has declined to accept national insurance contributions because of an inability to record those contributions; how many customers are affected; how much revenue has been lost; and how it will be recovered.  [71784]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90222w42.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 The Contributions Agency has never declined to accept National Insurance contributions from its customers or contributors because of an inability to record the contributions paid on the new National Insurance Recording System (NIRS2).
<P>

<a name="90222w42.htm_para0">However, there have been some situations where the Department has been unable to register an individual to pay Class 2 self-employed contributions either by the Direct Debit or quarterly payment method as a consequence of the delays in introducing the NIRS2 on-line facilities.
<P>

<a name="90222w42.htm_para1">The Department identified approximately 160,000 customers who were affected by the delays and provided them with information. Contingency arrangements were invoked where appropriate to minimise the impacts to customers.
<P>

<a name="90222w42.htm_para2">Since the introduction of the on-line facility, the Agency has cleared approximately 31,000 cases from the 160,000 outstanding backlog cases. It is also continuing to action all new applications as they are received.
<P>

<a name="90222w42.htm_para3">Collections of all outstanding Class 2 liabilities affected by the delays will be handled sensitively.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90222w42.htm_wqn3"><B> Mr. Cousins: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security what are the objectives of the NIRS2 project; when the final decision was taken to implement the project; on what dates revisions of the objectives were approved; what has been the expenditure on this project to date; and if he will list the remaining implementation milestones to completion.  [71770]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90222w42.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 The objectives of the NIRS2 project were to develop a new computer system that would replace the ageing NIRS1 system and to support the legislative changes brought about by the Pensions Act 1995.
<P>

<a name="90222w42.htm_para4">The original NIRS2 Agreement was to deliver the system in 3 releases between February 1997 and April 1999. A subsequent Deed of Agreement was agreed in July 1996, which allowed for a phased delivery of the first release. Although incorporating the original time frame, the phasing of delivery between those dates was significantly altered.

<a name="90222w42.htm_para5">Release 2-3 is the remaining milestone. The agreed delivery date is the 6 April 1999, and this is still the current target. A maintenance release incorporating changes requested by the business is also planned for 6 April 1999.
<P>

<a name="90222w42.htm_para6">As reported by the National Audit Office on 29 May 1997 the cost of implementing the NIRS2 computer system is likely to be around &#163;134 million.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security what studies have been commissioned under the Housing Benefit Computing Strategy Study; when such studies were commissioned; what agencies are employed in the study; how much expenditure has been committed so far; and what are the implementation milestones to completion.  [71786]<P>

<a name="90222w42.htm_spnew4"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 The Housing Benefit Computing Strategy (HBCS) study was announced on 5 March 1996 to explore the benefits of integrating local authority Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit (HB/CTB) computer systems with the next generation of departmental computer systems. A range of studies were commissioned in 1996. They included a national survey of local authorities (to establish details of their existing systems and their attitude towards a national computing system); an HB/CTB process mapping exercise (to baseline the business requirements of an integrated system) and a financial analysis (to model the costs and benefits for the department and local authorities of such a system).
<P>

<a name="90222w42.htm_para7">Further analytical work has been undertaken during the course of 1997 and 1998. At present, only the Department is involved in continuing work, but local authority Housing Benefit practitioners and a number of consultancy firms have been involved in the past. Excluding civil service and local authority costs, expenditure of approximately &#163;640,000 has been committed so far. The study into whether Departmental computer systems should take account of HB/CTB is continuing. Integration of local authority and Departmental computer systems is a major undertaking and progress is dependent on the implementation of the Department's overall information systems/information technology strategy. Final decisions on the outcome of the HBCS study and any future implementation plans will be dependent on this.

<a name="90222w42.htm_para13">To date, the Department's expenditure amounts to &#163;241 million. This expenditure provides a range of services and an Information Technology infrastructure that will also support our wider programme of modernisation.
<P>

<a name="90222w42.htm_para14">The Programme is presently undergoing a limited trial in the North East and South West of England using the Benefit Payment Service to pay Child Benefit and the Order Book Control Service to record bar coded order books. The remaining milestones consist of the completion of post office automation nationally, the introduction of card payment for all other benefits and the delivery of the remaining services; the Electronic Point of Sale Service which records post office product sales; and the Automated Payment Service that provides automated bill payment facilities.

 Generally, a person who is responsible for a child either because the child is living with them, or because they are contributing regularly towards the maintenance of the child, will be eligible for Child Benefit. The relationship between the child and the person claiming is immaterial.
<P>

<a name="90222w42.htm_para15">Where competing claims are received in respect of the same child and both claimants live at the same address, a parent will have priority of title over a person who is not the child's parent. Step-parents and legally adoptive parents are treated as natural parents.

 The Access to Corporate Data (ACCORD) Procurement project was established to provide the Department with long term supply options to take forward the delivery of the new generation of Information Systems/Information Technology (IS/IT) needed to underpin the modernisation of the Welfare State. The procurement set out to establish Private Finance Initiative/Private Public Partnership arrangements with suitable service providers.
<P>

<a name="90222w42.htm_para16">The announcement of the selected service providers (AFFINITY, ARCWAY and 1ACCORD) to take this work forward on behalf of the Department was made on 5 November 1998, <i>Official Report,</i> column <i>646</i>.

<a name="90222w42.htm_para17">The ACCORD Procurement Project team has, since its inception in 1996, cost in the order of &#163;3.8 million. No payments have yet been made to any service provider as a result of the procurement project. Expenditure commitments will be linked to the business allocations made under the IS/IT Services Agreement.
<P>

<a name="90222w42.htm_para18">The ASSIST (Analytical Services Statistical Information System) Project was established to produce a comprehensive statistical package to support statisticians and policy makers within the Department, with final approval for the implementation of the system given on 9 February 1998. The final milestone will be the roll out of the Data Repository to users in the Departments Analytical Services Division from 5 April 1999. Total expenditure from April 1995 to the end of the financial year 1998-99 is expected to be &#163;6.2 million.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90222w43.htm_spnew6"><B> Mr. Bayley: </B> 
 Most of the people who would be affected by the proposal to take some account of occupational and personal pensions over &#163;50 a week will continue to receive Incapacity Benefit. The estimated reduction in the number of people on Incapacity Benefit as a result of the proposed change to the National Insurance contribution conditions is 30,000 in year one, 60,000 in year three and 120,000 in year ten. Approximately 70 per cent. of these people will already be receiving income-based Jobseeker's Allowance or Income Support when their claim for Incapacity Benefit is made and we would expect their entitlement to means- tested benefit to continue.

<a name="90222w43.htm_spnew7"><B> Mr. Bayley: </B> 
 We are piloting a Personal Adviser Service under the New Deal for Disabled People in 12 areas.

<P>
<a name="90222w43.htm_spnew8"><B> Mr. Bayley: </B> 
 Information is not available in the format requested. Such information as is available is as follows. It is estimated there may be up to 2,000 successful claims a year to Incapacity Benefit on the basis of a late spouse's contributions. We estimate that about 1,500 people will be affected in the first year and 5,000 in the long run by the proposed changes to the contribution conditions.

 We are considering ways to heighten general awareness of the reduction from 100 per cent. to 50 per cent. in the amount of SERPS which can be inherited by a surviving spouse from 6 April 2000. Current widows and those widowed before 6 April 2000 will not be affected by this change. Existing compensation arrangements can offer redress to those who can show that their financial decisions have been affected to their detriment by misleading information provided by the Department.

 Rebuttals of allegations in the media are made in my Department by individual press officers either through telephone calls to the organisation concerned, or through an appropriate letter signed by an official or a Minister. Generally, it is found that reporting of Welsh matters in the regional and national media is of a response nature, and the need for rebuttals is infrequent. For that reason, there is no special unit in the Department to handle rebuttals, and no record is kept centrally of the number or cost of rebuttals.

 Council Directive 85/73/EEC (as amended) on the financing of veterinary inspections and controls requires Member States to recover the costs of those hygiene inspections conducted at licensed fresh meat plants in accordance with harmonised EC meat hygiene rules. The Directive sets standard charges (in ECU) applicable in all Member States for hygiene inspections of red meat, poultry meat and game meat, with rates varying depending on the species and size of animals being slaughtered. Subject to meeting specified criteria, such as the efficiency of operations at individual plants, the Directive provides for the standard charge to be abated by up to 55 per cent. Conversely, where the actual cost of inspection exceeds the standard charge, the Directive provides for actual costs to be charged. Similar principles apply in respect of charges in licensed cutting plants.

 I and my Ministerial colleagues have received a large number of representations calling for a ban on the import of pork and pork products which do not match British production standards. It remains the case, however, that Single Market Legislation and European Court of Justice Rulings protect the free circulation of goods in the EU. In areas where there is a common market, such as pigmeat, if products conform to EU requirements, individual member states cannot introduce a unilateral ban.

 As from 1 January 1999, "green" rates ceased to exist, because the agrimonetary system, which converts amounts under the Common Agricultural Policy and the Common Fisheries Policy into national currency, has been completely overhauled.

<a name="90222w48.htm_para3">Overall, sterling has strengthened slightly against the euro since 1 January 1999, but it is too soon to predict long term trends.

Applications for Marketing Authorisations for all veterinary medicinal products must satisfy the statutory criteria of safety, quality and efficacy. Safety includes the safety of the environment. Environmental pollution incidents involving sheep dips should be reported to the Environment Agency or the Scottish Environment Protection Agency.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what is the current statistical risk of dying from new variant CJD as a result of the consumption of beef on the bone <i>(a)</i> using 1999 data together with the SEAC published 1997 risk analysis formula and <i>(b)</i> provided to him by his Department.  [70089]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90222w49.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 It has still not been established that nvCJD is caused by exposure to BSE infectivity in food, but the Government, based on expert scientific advice, have always proceeded on the assumption that it could be. There continues to be great uncertainty about the nature of new variant CJD and about how susceptible people may be to infection. It is, therefore, not possible to estimate the current statistical risk of dying from the disease as a result of consuming beef or beef products which had been cooked on the bone.
<P>

<a name="90222w49.htm_para4">In its 1997 advice, the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee (SEAC) quoted an estimate of a 1 in 20 chance of one case of nvCJD arising as a consequence of exposure to infectivity in dorsal root ganglia in 1998.
<P>

<a name="90222w49.htm_para5">In November 1998, SEAC concluded that it was still not known how many people had become infected with nvCJD as a result of exposure to the BSE agent, nor how much BSE infectivity is needed to cause disease. Consequently predictions as to public health risks are very uncertain and SEAC did not quote specific levels of risk. However, the Committee was of the opinion that, in view of the continued decline in the BSE epidemic, the number of infected cows entering the human food chain would be less in November 1998 than in 1997.
<P>

<a name="90222w49.htm_para6">On this basis, the Committee concluded that any risk from dorsal root ganglia and bone marrow in 1999 is less than it was 12 months previously. The pattern of experimental results obtained with bone marrow led the 



<P>
<P><I>22 Feb 1999 : Column: 191</I><P>
Committee to conclude that the risk, if any, from that tissue is likely to be very small. With the Over Thirty Month Scheme in place, the Committee thought it likely that the risk from dorsal root ganglia is also very small and negligible in comparison to the possible risk earlier in the epidemic. Due to the uncertainty, neither SEAC nor Departmental officials has sought to quantify the risks numerically.

 In our discussion of Gibraltar with the Spanish Government, we have emphasised that border restrictions going beyond those compatible with EU norms for a light passport check and customs control (Gibraltar is outside the Community customs territory) are unjustified and counter-productive. We have also drawn the current situation at the Gibraltar/Spain border to the attention of the President of the European Commission; and look to the Commission to remind the Spanish authorities of their obligations. We want to see the outcome of those representations before considering further steps.
