<a name="91019w01.htm_wqn0"><B> Mr. David Atkinson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will make a statement of progress on the millennium readiness of his Department's computer systems, and those for which it is responsible in the provision of public services; if contingency plans are in place; and what slippage has occurred since the July quarterly report to the House.  [93567]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91019w01.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 My Department's Year 2000 programme is nearing completion. As reported in September, work on critical systems is almost complete and front-line systems are ready for the Millennium. Contingency plans have been developed and tested.
<P>

<a name="91019w01.htm_para0">The Meteorological Office, which provides services to the public, reports that all of its systems are now compliant and contingency plans have been developed.
<P>

<a name="91019w01.htm_para1">Details of MOD progress in tackling the Millennium problem are set out in our quarterly reports. These are available in the Libraries of the House and are published on the Internet. The overall MOD programme completion dates have not changed since the July report to the House.
<P>

<a name="91019w01.htm_para2">Within this programme, two critical systems showed some slippage in their completion dates, but both of these have now been certified as compliant. A small slippage has been reported in one non-critical system.
<P>

<a name="91019w01.htm_para3">The results of the October monthly review of progress of Government Departments and Agencies in tackling the Millennium problem are due to be announced shortly by the President of the Council.

<P>
<a name="91019w01.htm_wqn1"><B> Mr. Bercow: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence when the assessment of damage inflicted on Serbian military vehicles in Kosovo by air power will be completed.  [94138]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91019w01.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 General Clark, the Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR), gave his battle damage assessment to the North Atlantic Council on 15 September. This was made public at a NATO press conference on 16 September. A copy of the transcript has been placed in the Library of the House and can also be obtained from the NATO website at http://www.nato.int/kosovo/press/p990916a.htm.
<P>

<a name="91019w01.htm_para4">But, as my predecessor made clear in his reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Linlithgow (Mr. Dalyell) on 30 June 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>160</i>, the measure of the campaign's success lies in the fact that it resulted in withdrawal of Milosevic's troops from Kosovo, the entry of KFOR and the return of refugees.

<P>
<a name="91019w01.htm_wqn2"><B> Mr. Matthew Taylor: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what reviews the United States National Security Agency has carried out of security practices and breaches of security at RAF Menwith Hill since 1993; and on what dates his Department received copies of the reports arising out of each review.  [93939]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91019w01.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 Two reviews of security have been conducted by the National Security Agency at RAF Menwith Hill since 1993. As the then Minister for the Armed Forces stated in his answer of 11 March 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, columns <i>196-97</i>, a review was conducted in April 1997. The second review was undertaken on site in January 1998 and was finalised by the US authorities at the end of March that year. My Department was made aware of the contents of both reports at the time.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91019w01.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Kilfoyle: </B> 
 Information is not available in the form requested, not least because of the number of changes in the organisation of my Department since 1995. However, the main corporate in-house journals currently published, and their frequency, are set out below:

<a name="91019w01.htm_para5">All titles are unclassified. In addition, there are many newsletters and other internal publications on specific subjects, such as the redevelopment of MOD's Whitehall HQ, or specific to individual management areas. The vast majority of military units also produce newsletters or magazines of their own for their personnel and for the benefit of Service families.

<a name="91019w01.htm_wqn4"><B> Mr. Maclean: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will list his Department's spending on official publications since May 1997.  [93687]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91019w01.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Kilfoyle: </B> 
 The costs of production of MOD's principal official publications are borne by the Stationery Office, as with all Command Papers, House of Commons papers and Statutory Instruments.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91019w01.htm_wqn5"><B> Mr. Blunt: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what was the average annual expenditure per Defence Housing Executive administered married quarters on repairs and maintenance for the year 1997-98.  [94064]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91019w01.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. Kilfoyle: </B> 
 In the Defence Housing Executive (DHE) 1999 Corporate Plan, the action plan sets out a key target relating to the unit cost of housing and aims to achieve a figure of less than &#163;5,400 per property. A figure for 1998-99 was given on 26 July 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>56</i>. For 1997-98, the calculation is similar--i.e. by dividing the total cost of the DHE (&#163;343,429 million including some &#163;100 million rental payment to Annington Homes Ltd) by the average number of properties occupied (including those which are Substitute Services Families Accommodation--52,832). The equivalent figure for FY 97-98, uprated for inflation, is &#163;5,473.10 per property. The cost of the upgrade programme is not included as this is outside the routine cost of housing provision.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91019w01.htm_spnew6"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 My Department has made an assessment of the suitability for making nuclear weapons of the material currently being transported to Japan by BNFL. The assessment was that the risk of this material being so used is very low.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91019w01.htm_wqn7"><B> Mrs. Curtis-Thomas: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what plans his Department has to review current and future stocks of munitions to ensure that they do not have the capacity to act as anti-personnel mines; and if he will make a statement.  [94642]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91019w01.htm_spnew7"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 All UK weapons systems and munitions have been checked for compliance with the provisions of the Ottawa Convention. There are no weapons or munitions in the UK inventory which fall under the Ottawa definition of an anti-personnel mine. The UK is fully committed to a complete global ban on anti-personnel mines and will never again use these weapons.
<P>
<P>
<a name="91019w01.htm_wqn8"><B> Mrs. Curtis-Thomas: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how many mines have been retained for training purposes; and which anti-personnel types have been retained.  [94668]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91019w01.htm_spnew8"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The UK is permitted to retain the minimum necessary amount of anti-personnel mines for training and testing in de-mining techniques, as permitted under Article 3 of the Ottawa Convention. As of 1 August 1999, these comprised 2088 Ranger mines, 1056 C3 Elsie 



<P>
<P><I>19 Oct 1999 : Column: 420</I><P>
mines, and 434 HB 876 sub-munitions to the JP233 weapon system. As of 1 August 1999, the UK also held 859 anti-personnel mines of foreign manufacture for the development of and training in mine detection, mine clearance, or mine destruction techniques, as provided for in Article 3 of the Convention.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence, pursuant to his answer of 18 June 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>263</i>, on what date this year the <i>Daily Mail</i> sought permission to use the insignia of the Parachute Regiment; and what royalties or fees have so far been received.  [93827]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91019w02.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The <i>Daily Mail</i> has not, this year, sought permission from the Ministry of Defence to reproduce the insignia of the Parachute Regiment, and no royalties or fees have been received. Dispensation from royalties and fees is generally given for the publication of Crown Copyright material in newspapers and magazines, in the interest of good public relations.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if existing intellectual property rights will be transferred with the assets of DERA on privatisation; and if he will make a statement.  [93662]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91019w02.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Kilfoyle: </B> 
 No decisions have been made on the nature of a Public Private Partnership (PPP) for DERA, and it is too early to speculate on the precise form it will take, or how intellectual property rights will be treated.
<P>
<P>
<a name="91019w02.htm_wqn2"><B> Mr. Swayne: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what measures he will take to ensure the continued availability of informed independent advice to Ministers after the privatisation of DERA.  [93667]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91019w02.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Kilfoyle: </B> 
 No decisions have been made on the nature of a Public Private Partnership (PPP) for DERA. The need for continued access to informed and impartial scientific services and advice is a key tenet of the MOD's consideration of the future of DERA and is defined in the "MOD Customer Needs Statement" and laid down in Figure 1 of the DERA PPP Consultation Document, a copy of which was placed in the Library on 5 May 1999. Ministers will want to ensure each of these customer requirements is addressed when making a decision on the final PPP solution for DERA.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91019w02.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Kilfoyle: </B> 
 The detailed mechanisms under which DERA would collaborate with allies will not be known until we have decided upon the precise PPP solution to be adopted. However, DERA's participation in collaborative activities with allied powers, following the adoption of a PPP solution, would be governed by the government to government arrangements agreed with our allies.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if liabilities arising from the exposure of staff to hazardous working conditions will be transferred to the purchaser following the privatisation of DERA; and if he will make a statement.  [93664]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91019w02.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Kilfoyle: </B> 
 No decision has been made on the nature of a Public Private Partnership (PPP) for DERA, and it is too early to speculate both on the precise form it would take and how commercial and legal issues, including liabilities, will be handled. The MOD study team, which is taking forward the work on the DERA PPP, is supported by legal experts who will provide advice during the implementation stage on the future treatment of liabilities.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what provision will be made to fund the transfer of DERA employee pension entitlements from the Civil Service Pension Scheme into a private scheme following his proposals for privatisation; and if he will make a statement.  [93669]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91019w02.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. Kilfoyle: </B> 
 No decisions have been taken on the form of a PPP for DERA, and it is therefore too early to be specific about pension arrangements for staff or how they will be funded.

<a name="91019w02.htm_spnew6"><B> Mr. Kilfoyle: </B> 
 The former Staff College at the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst, was vacated in September 1997. Options for the future of the former Staff College Buildings at Camberley are being investigated by the Army. No proposals have yet been put to Ministers.

[93863]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91019w02.htm_spnew7"><B> Mr. Kilfoyle: </B> 
 Since about 1991, the Defence Scientific Staff, in providing support for the work of the Defence Research Committee, have undertaken an ongoing review of technology aspects of the defence research programme. The paper entitled "technology audit", discussed at the Committee on the 31 March 1998, dealt with the internal processes by which this ongoing review is carried out.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence when his Department started discussions with the United States Government on the decision to invest in the US National Ignition Facility; with which US Departments these discussions have been held; to which United States Department, and on what date, his Department notified the decision to invest in this facility; whether the decision to invest in this facility will be covered by a memorandum of understanding; when his Department expects to formalise the decision in a contract with the US; and with which United States Department this contract will be signed.  [93932]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91019w02.htm_spnew9"><B> Mr. Kilfoyle: </B> 
 Discussions between officials of my Department and the US Department of Energy on the possibility of optimising National Ignition Facility (NIF) technology began in September 1998. Written confirmation of the United Kingdom's decision to invest in the NIF was conveyed to the US Department of Energy on 9 June 1999. The US Department of Defense was also made aware of out intentions. The arrangements, which are being made under the aegis of the 1958 UK-US Mutual Defence Agreement, will be formalised in a number of contracts covering the procurement process between my Department and the US Department of Energy.

 "Operational requirement" is a generic term used to describe the detailed documentation setting out a military requirement for equipment, in preparation for possible procurement action. It is prepared by staff reporting to the Deputy Chief of the Defence Staff (Equipment Capability), in consultation with others in my Department, and may, when appropriate, be made available to industry during the procurement process. Since 31 December 1998, work has been initiated on some 196 new operational requirements. There is no central record of the numbers of operational requirements issued to industry. Since such documents give details of our planned future military capability, they are almost invariably classified.

<P>
<a name="91019w03.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 We are fully committed to the Ottawa Convention, which entered into force in the UK on 1 March 1999. It requires us to clear all anti-personnel mines from the Falkland Islands within 10 years of entry, unless we can show good reasons why an extension should be granted. Such reasons may include humanitarian, environmental and technical considerations. Mine clearance in the Falkland Islands is both difficult and dangerous and we should be keeping these points in mind.
<P>

<a name="91019w03.htm_para0">The Ministry of Defence estimate that 14,000 anti-personnel mines were laid by the Argentines in the Falkland Islands in 1982. The Argentine Government have offered to assist in mine clearance. During President Menem's visit to the UK in October 1998, we agreed as a first step to work together with Argentina to evaluate the feasibility and cost of clearing the land mines still present in the Falkland Islands. Work on a Memorandum of Understanding setting out how this feasibility study

<a name="91019w05.htm_spnew0"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 Education is identified as a key sector for DFID support in our recently published Country Strategy Paper for Rwanda. Since 1998, we have provided short-term planning advice and, together with the World Bank, have been helping the Government of Rwanda carry out a Public Expenditure Review of education and other key social sectors aimed at identifying strategic priorities which are affordable and sustainable. In addition, we have provided direct budgetary support aimed at increasing the proportion of Government expenditure in the social sectors.
<P>

<a name="91019w05.htm_para0">Over the next three years, we plan to build on this work as our partnership with the Government of Rwanda deepens. We are at the early stages of planning a sector support programme in education to be implemented in collaboration with the World Bank and other interested donors. In addition to providing much needed institutional strengthening and further strategic planning support, the programme would target infrastructure and training priorities.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91019w05.htm_spnew1"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 Unrest in the north-west of Rwanda in the latter part of 1998 led to the displacement of over 600,000 people. Since November 1998, we have provided over &#163;1.7 million in humanitarian assistance to the most vulnerable groups. A degree of stability has now returned to the north-west, but we stand ready to respond to any further humanitarian crises in Rwanda as needs are identified.

 My Department gave technical advice to the Government of Kenya following the outbreak of this malaria epidemic. One of our regional health team based in Nairobi joined two Government/donor teams sent to the District to assist the local health authorities in the management of the crisis and helped to co-ordinate inputs from the European Commission, WHO, and UNICEF. DFID also drew up emergency treatment protocols in collaboration with colleagues from the WHO country office which were adopted and used.
<P>

<a name="91019w05.htm_para6">DFID has provided around &#163;1.3 million over the last two years for emergency malaria work in Kenya, including one year's supply of the new first-line drug for malaria treatment, Sulphadoxine-Pyrimethamine (SP). The availability of this drug was a major factor in reducing the impact of the epidemic. We are also helping the Government of Kenya to prepare epidemic preparedness guidelines which should strengthen the response to future outbreaks.

 There are currently no plans to change the retirement provisions for clergy. The level of clergy pensions and retirement lump sums recognise the need for retired clergy to meet the cost of their housing.

Most of the finance for the scheme is provided by the Church Commissioners.

Hundreds of local congregations are also making plans for activities and events under the three themes of a New Start with God, a New Start at Home, and a New Start for the World's Poor. The Faith zone of the Millennium Dome will also celebrate the nation's Christian heritage. The Archbishop of Canterbury will lead the nation in prayer during the opening ceremony at the Dome on New Year's Eve and the Churches' Millennium Resolution, set to music by John Taverner, will be sung. Later in the year, the main focus of the Churches' celebrations will be Pentecost Sunday, June 11, when a large range of events have been planned.

 The Passport Agency does not monitor its performance on a county basis.
<P>

<a name="91019w07.htm_para0">Applications from Lancashire would normally be dealt with by the Liverpool Passport Office, which faced considerable operational difficulties over the summer. To ensure that customers' needs were met, it moved from working a ten-day turnaround target for straightforward applications--its main customer service target--to prioritising applications by declared travel dates. These dates were met in 99.99 per cent. of cases.

<P>
<a name="91019w07.htm_spnew3"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 Applications from Lancashire would normally be dealt with by the Liverpool Passport Office and their records show that in the period January 1999 to September 1999 claims were received from 22 residents in Lancashire relating to a missed travel date. The Passport Agency very much regrets the anxiety and inconvenience caused by its missing of these dates. All these cases have received an apology and compensation as appropriate.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91019w07.htm_spnew6"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 The Government supported the adoption of this Council decision which was subject to agreement by unanimity. Nevertheless, it recognises that this measure can be seen both as a police co-operation measure and as a measure to combat illegal immigration and has noted the Commission's statement in that context. The final arbiter of the correct legal base for this measure would be the European Court of Justice; it is open to any interested party to bring such a matter before the Court for such a ruling.
<P>

<a name="91019w07.htm_para3">The Government consider that, irrespective of whether the fifth recital of this Decision is redundant, it cannot as a Third Pillar measure affect the respective competencies of the Community and its member states.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91019w08.htm_wqn0"><B> Mr. Lidington: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what is his policy towards the claim of the European Commission that the EU should have competence over readmission issues.  [94133]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91019w08.htm_spnew0"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 Following the entry into force of the Amsterdam Treaty, matters concerning immigration and asylum co-operation are now contained within Title IV of the Treaty establishing the European Community and are therefore within Community competence. The Government is of the view that readmission issues could fall within the scope of Article 63(3)(b) TEC which provides for measures on immigration policy within the area of removal of illegal residents.
<P>

<a name="91019w08.htm_para0">Under the terms of the Protocol on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland, annexed to the Treaties by the Treaty of Amsterdam, the United Kingdom may decide to participate in the adoption and application of any measures, including readmission measures, brought forward in Title IV, but it is not otherwise bound by Community law in this area. Should any readmission measures be considered to be a development of the Schengen acquis, the provisions of the Protocol integrating the Schengen acquis into the framework of the European Union would also be relevant.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91019w08.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The main priority for the Prison Service is to raise the levels of literacy and numeracy among prisoners, but there are opportunities for eligible prisoners to pursue courses of higher education where resources allow.
<P>

<a name="91019w08.htm_para1">A prisoner would be deemed eligible if as a result of assessment a higher degree course was a requirement of the sentence plan. It would be necessary prior to embarking on this course of study for the prisoner to demonstrate that he or she was capable of attaining the qualification. Resources to pay for this could either come from the governor's budget, a charitable organisation or from the prisoner or a relative.
<P>
<P>
<a name="91019w08.htm_wqn2"><B> Mr. Mackinlay: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what resources are available for courses of study to further degree level in each prison; what criteria are applied in deciding the allocation of these resources; and if he will make a statement.  [94583]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91019w08.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 It is for prison governors to decide how much from their annual budget to allocate to education. The main priority of the Prison Service is to raise the levels of literacy and numeracy among prisoners, but there are opportunities for eligible prisoners to pursue higher education studies. Each application is considered on its merits, and there is no predetermined level of funding specifically for degree courses. Before any application can be approved, the governor and education officer need to be satisfied that the prisoner has the aptitude, ability and motivation to complete their chosen course.

<P>
<a name="91019w08.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 The Code of Practice on Access to Government Information sets out current Government policy on access to information. The Code of Practice promotes a culture of openness. It makes the assumption that information should be released except where disclosure would not be in the public interest. Whilst the Code of Practice identifies categories of information that are exempt from the commitment to provide information, where there is a reference to harm or prejudice, there is the presumption that information should be disclosed unless the harm likely to arise from disclosure would outweigh the public interest in making the information available. The Code of Practice is a non-statutory regime which the Government plan to replace with a Freedom of Information Act. It will, however, continue to operate the Code of Practice until a new Act is brought into force. The Government plan to introduce a Freedom of Information Bill into Parliament as soon as the timetable allows.
<P>

<a name="91019w08.htm_para4">The Government's proposals for a Freedom of Information Act are contained within Freedom of Information, Consultation on Draft Legislation. Under the provisions contained in the Bill, public authorities, including all central government departments, will have a duty to comply with requests promptly and in any event within a specified time limit. Where the information sought falls into an exempt area, it will be for the authority to consider, on a case by case basis, whether the information should be disclosed in the public interest. This will ensure that proper consideration is given to all requests by the authority. This is the appropriate way forward. It is for the United Kingdom Government to develop legislation which is appropriate to the needs of this country. It would be wrong to subject United Kingdom authorities to the scope of foreign legislation in the context of their activities in this country. It is for the Parliament of the United Kingdom to decide such matters, not the congress of the United States of America.
<P>

<a name="91019w08.htm_para5">The draft Bill was the subject of pre-legislative scrutiny by the Public Administration Select Committee, as well as a Select Committee of the House of Lords and a period of public consultation. The Government will respond to the recommendations of the Select Committees and to the public consultation soon.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91019w09.htm_spnew10"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 There were no measures in the 1997 or 1998 Budgets which increased the NIC liability of employees. In fact, the 1998 Budget included the abolition of the 2 per cent. "entry fee", which would have cost all NIC payers about &#163;1.40 per week in 2001-02 had it remained in place.
<P>

<a name="91019w09.htm_para1">In the 1999 Budget, the Chancellor announced a number of changes for NICs. The point at which people start paying NICs and the upper earnings limit will be increased by more than indexation in April 2000 and April 2001, so those 16.6 million employees earning between &#163;69 and around &#163;540 per week will be liable to less NICs and 3.9 million employees earning more than around &#163;540 per week will be liable to more NICs. The rise in the starting point for employees' NICs necessitates a rise in the upper earnings limit, to maintain the historical relationship between the two points and thus protect the base for such contributions.

 The cost of converting an existing weighing machine to operate in metric and imperial units would be between &#163;60 and &#163;145. The cost of buying a new machine in metric and imperial units would start at &#163;450, depending on the model ordered.
<P>

<a name="91019w11.htm_para2">The cost of indicating prices in metric and imperial units would be relatively low where price tickets are printed by computer, but would be more expensive where price tickets are prepared manually. There may be a relatively small increase in the cost of inspection and enforcement because of the need to check the accuracy of weighing machines and price indications in both metric and imperial units.

<a name="91019w11.htm_spnew4"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The compliance cost assessment published by the Department of Trade and Industry when the metrication legislation was laid before Parliament in 1994 estimated that about 62,000 traders would be affected. The overall business costs were estimated to be about &#163;33 million, of which about &#163;30 million was identified as the conversion or replacement of an estimated 200,000 weighing machines. The assessment did not apportion the costs between the metric changes in 1995 and the change to loose goods by the end of 1999. The UK Weighing Federation estimated that, at the beginning of 1999, only 95,000 weighing machines were still to be converted or replaced. According to the Federation, about 76,000 machines could be converted and the remaining 19,000 would have to be replaced.

 Responsibility for ensuring that competition laws are not broken lies with the competition authorities, the Office of Fair Trading within the UK or the European Commission for activities which affect trade between member states. I look to these bodies to ensure fair competition, and for those with concerns to put them to the competition authorities for investigation.

<a name="91019w12.htm_para1">In the White Paper "Post Office Reform: A World Class Service for the 21st Century", the Government confirmed that under the new financial regime for the Post Office an equivalent of a commercial dividend would be set at 50 per cent. of expected post-tax profits in the current financial year and at 40 per cent. in subsequent years. This will more than halve the rate at which profits are removed from the business and increase the funds available to the Post Office to fund future investment. Once the Post Office has been established as a plc, it will pay an annual dividend to the Exchequer rather than build up its deposits.

 I believe that the Timeshare Act has been effective and that timeshare in the UK is generally well run. Since the Act came into force in 1992, the level of complaints about timeshare made to the Office of Fair Trading has fallen significantly from over 11,500 in 1991-92 to less than half that number today--but there is no room for complacency with over 5,000 complaints every year.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91019w14.htm_spnew4"><B> Ms Stuart: </B> 
 Of the 242 schemes currently under way to modernise and expand accident and emergency departments, 55 include schemes of specific benefit to children. They range from creation of separate children's observation and assessment wards to separate waiting and play areas within the department. They amount to &#163;28,360,000. In most cases, the children's schemes are an integral part of much wider A&E redevelopment schemes and it is not possible to identify the specific costing for the children's element of the schemes. The other 187 schemes, which are more general, will also be of benefit to children and their parents. Their safety, and that of the staff caring for them, will be better safeguarded. In other schemes, children will benefit from new diagnostic and resuscitation equipment.

<a name="91019w15.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The establishment of Primary Care Groups has been funded using moneys released by the abolition of fundholding. The first Primary Care Trust will be established early next year. The cost of establishing Primary Care Trusts, like those of PCGs, will largely be met using moneys released by the abolition of fundholding. The previous Government had set aside an annual budget of &#163;180 million to run fundholding. We have used those moneys both to set up Primary Care Groups and to improve services to patients.

 At the end of August 48,900 patients (4.54 per cent. of the total list) had been waiting over a year for hospital admission. This is 23,000 lower than at the end of June 1998. In tackling waiting lists, we are reducing waiting times.

<P>
<a name="91019w15.htm_spnew10"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The Government are committed to improving the prevention, detection and treatment of all cancers including prostate cancer. We have identified this as a priority for the National Health Service. There is, as yet, no consensus of medical opinion about the correct management of early localised tumours. The Health Technology Assessment Programme has already funded two systematic reviews of the diagnosis and management of prostate cancer and the National Co-ordinating Centre for the HTA programme is commissioning a &#163;200,000 study at the University of Bristol looking at the feasibility of conducting a multi-centre randomised trial of treatment for localised prostate cancer.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health what representations he has received regarding the level of the standard mortality ratio in the Barnsley area.  [92615]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91019w15.htm_spnew11"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 High level performance indicators show that the standard mortality rate for Barnsley in the age range 65-74 years is 103, compared with the national figure for England of 90. The comparatively poor health status of Barnsley, particularly with regard to coronary heart disease, stroke and some cancers, evident from measures such as the high level performance indicators and standard mortality rates, has been recognised. Barnsley (together with Rotherham and Doncaster) was designated last year in the first wave of health action zones which are at the vanguard of our new approach to tackling health inequalities, through partnership working and with targeted investment to achieve modernisation, reform and results.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91019w15.htm_spnew13"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 The United Kingdom has a good record of tuberculosis (TB) control and we are determined this should remain the case. The Government are responding positively to adverse developments in other countries. These developments inevitably impinge on the incidence of TB in this country and we have recently seen small annual increases in the incidence of TB. However, notifications of TB in the UK have reached the relatively low levels of about 6,500 cases a year from nearly 50,000 in 1950.
<P>

<a name="91019w15.htm_para1">In addition to the existing provisions we have for the surveillance, prevention and control of TB, including drug resistant TB, within the UK, recent developments include:

<P>
<a name="91019w16.htm_spnew2"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 We have pledged to tackle unacceptable levels of geographical variations in access to NHS infertility treatment and have set in motion a programme of work to achieve that aim. A Departmental survey of current health authority infertility service provision has recently taken place and the results are being analysed. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists have published two sets of evidence based on clinical guidelines on infertility and intend to publish the third and final set on specialised services like IVF in January 2000. The RCOG guidelines have been commissioned by the Department.
<P>

<a name="91019w16.htm_para0">The survey will enable the cost implications of any policy changes to be estimated and the RCOG guidelines will indicate the circumstances in which infertility treatment can be most clinically effective. We then hope to move towards fairer access to NHS infertility services where those most able to benefit from such treatment will be able to receive it.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91019w16.htm_spnew3"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 The Department has invested in measures to highlight the importance in preventing the development of osteoporosis and resulting fractures and the need for health authorities to develop their own local strategies. An osteoporosis strategy for England was launched in June 1998 by my right hon. Friend the 



<P>
<P><I>19 Oct 1999 : Column: 470</I><P>
Member for Dulwich and West Norwood (Ms Jowell) at the sixth Bath Conference on Osteoporosis and Bone Mineral Measurement. The strategy consisted of a quick reference primary care guide, a laminated desk top guide and a local health action sheet.
<P>

<a name="91019w16.htm_para1">The Department does not specify what proportion of health authorities' funding allocations is to be spent on services to combat osteoporosis. It is for health authorities, in partnership with National Health Service trusts, primary care groups, local authorities and local stakeholders to determine how best to use their funds to meet national and local priorities for improving health and modernising services. The additional resources of at least 5.45 per cent. cash increase to all health authorities for 1999-2000 will help them in this.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health, pursuant to his answer to the hon. Member for Southport (Mr. Fearn) of 19 July 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>410</i>, how much money the National Health Service Executive expects to raise from the sale of the National Health Service sites listed for which planning permission for housing has been granted.  [94290]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91019w17.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 Most of the sites listed are in various stages of the planning process, and planning permission has not yet been issued. Of those where planning permission has been granted, the anticipated income is in the region of &#163;15.5 million. If planning permission is granted for others listed, the anticipated income is approximately &#163;180 million.

<P>
<a name="91019w18.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 All proceeds from the sale of surplus National Health Service estate are directed back into central Departmental funds, to be redistributed back to regional offices as part of their overall capital allocations. The closure and sale of Barnsley Hall was the culmination of a range of investment in Bromsgrove and Redditch health services over the past few years, and as such the sale proceeds from Barnsley Hall can be seen as a partial

To ask the Secretary of State for Health (1) what estimate he has made of the number of cancer patients who will be seen per week by NHS consultants under the Government's proposal to ensure that no patient referred by a GP waits more than two weeks once it is implemented in April 2000;  [94026]
<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="91019w18.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The Department does not currently collect data on the number of cancer patients seen by consultants per week.
<P>

<a name="91019w18.htm_para0">However, data from the first quarter monitoring of the two week breast cancer standard, which began in April 1999, show that an average of 1,686 urgent referrals of suspected breast cancer were seen per week over the three months April-June 1999.
<P>

<a name="91019w18.htm_para1">Health Service Circular HSC1999/205 requested that health authorities, in consultation with their National Health Service Trusts and local primary care groups, should undertake state of readiness surveys in preparation for the extension of the two week standard for urgent referrals for all cases of suspected cancer. These will include baseline assessments of numbers of urgent referrals. The surveys will be carried out on a rolling basis, in line with the planned roll out of the two week standard during 2000.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will make a statement on his advice to hospital trust boards on the implementation of the National Booked Admissions Policy.  [94146]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91019w18.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The National Booked Admissions Programme was established last year with 24 pilot sites across England. It has since been extended to a further 60 pilots plus nine looking specifically at cancer services. These pilots were set up to enable patients to pre-book their admission dates or hospital appointments. The Programme is closely managed and supported by the National Patients' Access Team, which is currently headed by Peter Homa, and National Health Service Executive Regional Offices. They are closely monitoring the pilots' performance against outcome plans and milestones. Support includes training in project management and redesign techniques and also regular meetings where all the pilot sites discuss progress and share experiences.
<P>

<a name="91019w18.htm_para2">The first wave of the programme and the cancer work is being evaluated by the Health Services Management Centre, based at the University of Birmingham, over a 3-year period. They will report at regular intervals, to enable lessons learnt to be fed back to the pilot sites and spread more widely to the NHS. The first initial evaluation report will be published shortly and will be sent to all health authorities, trusts and primary care groups.

 Our new health strategy <i>Saving Lives: Our Healthier Nation</i>, published on 6 July 1999, acknowledges that health is affected by a complex interaction of factors including the environment. It recognises the health benefits of a good environment and that factors such as cold, damp housing and poor quality air contribute to health problems including respiratory and cardio-vascular diseases.
<P>

<a name="91019w18.htm_para4">Recognising, among other things, the links between poor housing and health, we have made substantial additional resources available for regenerating the worst neighbourhoods, improving social housing stock and combating fuel poverty for groups most vulnerable to cold-related ill health.

 The first quarter's data on achieving the two week standard for the urgent referral of patients suspected of having breast cancer were published on 24 September. These showed that 91.1 per cent. of patients were seen within two weeks of urgent referral by their general practitioner. This represents some 12,500 women seen within two weeks of urgent referral out of a total of nearly 13,700 patients seen during the quarter. This was an encouraging start to achieving the standard and the Department is currently working with poorer performing National Health Service trusts to ensure improvement in performance in the second quarter.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. Until December 1997 the Department of Health issued circulars in the following series:<P>

Health Service Guidelines (HSG); Finance Directorate Letters (FDL); Family Health Service Letters (FHSL); Local Authority Circulars (LAC); Local Authority Social Services Letters (LASSL); Chief Inspector (CI); Family Practitioner Notices (FPN) and Professional Letters (PL).<P>

In December FPNs were discontinued.<P>

On 2 February 1998 ELs, HSGs, FDLs and FHSLs were replaced with a single series of management letters--Health Service Circulars (HSC). This was as part of the Department's strategy to improve written communications and in response to the recommendations in the "Seeing the Woods, Sparing the Trees" Efficiency Scrutiny.<P>

2. The Department's Agencies occasionally publish in the above series, and also issue circulars in their own series. Between May 1997 and September 1999 Medicines Control Agency published 72 Drug Alerts and 15 Consultative Letters. Medical Devices Agency published eight Device Bulletins, two Advice Notices, 16 Hazard Notices, 94 Safety Notices and 11 Pacemaker Technical Notes. <P>

 No decisions have been taken about the precise composition of the new Health Professions Council, which will eventually replace the Council for Professions Supplementary to Medicine, using an Order under s60 of the Health Act 1999. The Government is committed to full and wide-ranging consultation on the proposals for new legislation in addition to the statutory consultation on the draft Order required by the Health Act, with a report to Parliament on the outcome when the Order is laid.

The UK will play a full part in this reconstruction.

the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) and for the European Commission, among others, on the effects of applying different tax rates to aviation fuel under different scenarios. In reviewing such studies the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, in its Special Report on Aviation and the Global Atmosphere published earlier this year, noted that levies (taxes and charges) could be a means of reducing growth of aircraft emissions by further stimulating the development and use of more efficient aircraft and by reducing growth in demand for aviation transportation. The studies also showed that to be environmentally effective, levies would need to be addressed in an international framework. Consequently further work on market based approaches to limit the growth in aviation emissions is being taken forward by ICAO.

<a name="91019w21.htm_wqn8"><B> Mrs. Brinton: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (1) what estimate he has made of the number of people living in fuel poverty in <i>(a)</i> solid-walled and <i>(b)</i> cavity-walled housing;  [94311]
<P>
<UL>(2) what plans he has to provide funding for the insulation of the walls of solid-walled properties for those deemed to be living in fuel poverty.  [94308]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91019w21.htm_spnew8"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 Data from the English House Condition Survey shows that there were at least 4.3 million fuel poor households in 1996. Of these, 1.5 million are estimated as living in solid-walled properties and 2.4 million in cavity-walled housing. The remaining 0.4 million are thought to live in non-traditional and mixed-construction housing.
<P>

<a name="91019w21.htm_para4">The new Home Energy Efficiency Scheme (HEES) has been designed to tackle fuel poverty, focusing on those households most at risk of ill health due to cold homes. It does so by providing packages of heating and insulation improvements that will reduce the cost of keeping warm for households by up to &#163;1,000 a year.
<P>

<a name="91019w21.htm_para5">During the development of the scheme, the full range of heating and insulation measures were considered, including the use of external or internal wall insulation for solid wall properties. Discussions with the insulation industry showed that the cost of external wall insulation was about &#163;2,500 for an average 3-bedroom semi-detached property with disruption for the household. With internal wall insulation, installation costs are less but the disruption to households is greater and there is a loss of internal space. In addition, there are redecoration costs after the work has been completed.
<P>

<a name="91019w21.htm_para6">It was therefore felt that both these measures were more appropriate for large-scale estate renewal programmes where they could be combined with other work such as damp proofing, rather than for new HEES which will target individual properties, primarily in the private sector.
<P>

<a name="91019w21.htm_para7">The packages available for solid walled properties under the new HEES include higher levels of heating improvements than those for cavity walled homes, so providing similar reductions in fuel costs for both types of property.

On the issue of non-heating fuel, 54 per cent. felt that all fuel costs should be taken into account; 6 per cent. had various other suggestions. On the issue of housing costs, 34 per cent. felt that they should not be excluded from income; 20 per cent. felt the opposite; and 6 per cent. made other suggestions.

 All activities involving the contained use of genetically modified micro-organisms (GMMs) are required to be assessed for potential risk to both human health and the environment by the Genetically Modified Organisms (Contained Use) Regulations 1992, as amended. These Regulations also require that control measures are used to limit contact of the GMMs with the environment and general population so that harm is not caused.
<P>

<a name="91019w22.htm_para0">For higher hazard GMMs release, to the environment must be prevented. This is achieved by application of extremely stringent control methods and 100 per cent. kill of all waste and contaminated material before disposal. For low hazard GMMs, control measures must minimise release. Although absolute prevention of release in these cases is not required, waste is still treated to inactivate the GMMs prior to disposal with, typically, at least 99.999 per cent. of GMMs being killed. In all cases the risk assessment must be used to ensure that the control measures, including the degree of inactivation, to prevent or minimise release are commensurate with maintaining a high level of safety for both human health and the environment.

Such agreement would only be given if fully justified by the risk assessment. In all cases the level of inactivation (ie percentage kill) must be commensurate with the level of risk. For hazardous GMMs inactivation must be 100 per cent.

<a name="91019w22.htm_para8">The Health and Safety Commission (HSC) recently consulted on proposals to replace these Regulations in order to implement revisions to the European Directive on the contained use of GMMs. The proposals included significant improvements in the quality and quantity of information to be placed on the public register.

 It is the responsibility of each local authority to implement best value in its own area. However, I am aware that Sefton, like many other authorities around the country, is making progress. Each Department has drawn up proposals for a five-year fundamental review of all its services. In addition, Sefton is undertaking five pilot reviews.

 The Government have a Manifesto commitment to impose a new duty on local authorities to protect those who are homeless through no fault of their own and are in priority need. This includes families with children and others who are regarded as vulnerable, which can include young people. Since taking office, we have already strengthened the legislation to give homeless people reasonable preference in the allocation of long-term social housing.
<P>

<a name="91019w24.htm_para0">My Department has set up an official-level sounding board with the local authority associations, Shelter, the Chartered Institute of Housing and others to discuss further proposals for change, on which we would propose to consult more widely in due course. In particular, we will be looking at ways of encouraging more partnership working at a local level, through the development of local homelessness strategies and preventive initiatives. We will also be considering further measures to ensure that housing solutions are sustainable in order to reduce the risk of homelessness recurring.
<P>

<a name="91019w24.htm_para1">The Department has also established a Youth Homelessness Action Partnership, again with both the voluntary and statutory sectors, to look at the particular problems faced by young people and to develop proposals for tackling them.

[94646]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91019w24.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 The Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) have applied to the Radiocommunications Agency for two additional VHF working frequencies which will be used primarily for Maritime Safety Information broadcasts. The MCA application was placed before the National Frequency Assignment Panel (NFAP) on Friday 15 October 1999.
<P>

<a name="91019w24.htm_para3">Operational difficulties utilising those frequencies assigned to Maritime Safety Information broadcasts have been limited to some mutual interference between HM Coastguard transmissions and those of port operators in Clydeport, Liverpool and Medway.

<P>
<a name="91019w24.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 The Medilink equipment, known as TeleConnect, installed in HM Coastguard Co-ordination Centres is specifically designed for simplex communications. This mode of communications allows only one operator to speak at any time. Hospital medical staff who might not be familiar with this mode of communications have received appropriate training from HM Coastguard.
<P>

<a name="91019w24.htm_para4">BT Coast Radio Stations were fitted with Medilink equipment which differs from HM Coastguard's equipment in that it provides duplex communications. This mode of communications is similar to that used, for instance, in normal telephone calls.

 My right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister announced on 29 September that he was asking the Countryside Agency to consider, in consultation with the local authorities concerned, designating a National Park in the South Downs. In the event of a National Park designation being confirmed, a South Downs National Park Authority could be expected to become the successor body to the Sussex Downs Conservation Board. Arrangements for the structure and funding of National Park Authorities are laid down in the Environment Act 1995. Almost three-quarters of the membership is made up of local councillors, including parish representatives. Current funding arrangements provide for 75% of core budgets to come direct from central Government, with the remaining 25% coming from constituent local authorities, compensated through the revenue support grant.
<P>

<a name="91019w25.htm_para4">I met the hon. Member as part of a delegation from East and West Sussex and Hampshire on 12 October. As I indicated then, the Countryside Agency will liaise closely with all the local authorities across the South Downs to ensure that any recommendations it makes for a National Park properly take into account the particular characteristics of the area. I also indicated that Ministers would place importance on there being a smooth transition from the Sussex Downs Conservation Board to a successor body.

[94337]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91019w26.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 Where NATS provides air traffic control services at an airport, it does so on the basis of a contract with the airport operator. However, the means by which it charges for these services differs between six of the BAA airports and other airports. Outside the BAA-run airports, NATS is paid by the airport operator, but in the case of Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Gatwick, Glasgow, Heathrow and Stansted, the contractual arrangement between NATS and the BAA provides for NATS to charge airlines directly for its services. No other provider of air traffic control services at airports has the ability to recover its charges direct from the airlines.

<a name="91019w26.htm_para1">The Government propose that the CAA, as regulator, should review how direct charging is working after the PPP is set up. In carrying out this review, the CAA will consult with air traffic control service providers, airport operators and users. The Government will take a final view as to whether the facility should be extended to all providers, or should be withdrawn, when this review is complete. It is not the Government's intention unilaterally to force an end to a charging method that, on reflection of the arguments, was acceptable to all three parties involved.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91019w26.htm_spnew14"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 Leisure fliers are currently exempt from most air traffic control charges and NATS is not seeking to change this. There have, of course, long been differing views as to whether these exemptions should continue. But there will be full consultation with air users and other interested parties, if at any time in the future, there are proposals to remove these exemptions.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what mechanism will be set up to assess on its merits each occasion when it is necessary for the United Kingdom to be represented in international fora on air traffic matters by <i>(a)</i> Government officials and <i>(b)</i> the private sector partner envisaged in the public private partnership proposed for National Air Traffic Services Ltd.  [94327]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91019w26.htm_spnew15"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 The question of United Kingdom representation at international fora is presently being considered. Many international panels and study groups, upon which the UK is represented, are highly technical in nature. In such cases the prospect of a conflict between commercial and public interest may be minor, and outweighed by the benefit of having the best qualified body take the lead. The Government are the signatory to most international instruments and must, therefore, ensure both that all interests are taken into account in deciding the UK's negotiating position, and that all relevant sources of expertise are used to the greatest effect.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91019w26.htm_spnew17"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 The Government will need to be able to exercise control over NATS operations, and over UK civil aviation in the event of crisis, war, severe international tension or national emergency. The Government therefore intend to bring forward legislative proposals to take powers to direct the CAA, NATS and any other owner or operator of a relevant asset to:

<a name="91019w26.htm_para5">The Government will be seeking the consent of Parliament to these powers of direction being available in times of hostilities, severe international tension or great national emergency.
<P>

<a name="91019w26.htm_para6">The Government's proposals were set out in the consultation paper "A public/private partnership for National Air Traffic Services Ltd (NATS)", published on 20 October 1998, and in the Government's report on the responses received, which was published on 27 July 1999.
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what contingency arrangements are to be put in place to ensure the uninterrupted provision of air traffic control services and the compliance of the United Kingdom with its international obligations in the event of insolvency of a strategic partner in the proposed public private partnership for National Air Traffic Services Ltd.  [94326]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91019w26.htm_spnew18"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 The United Kingdom is bound by the Chicago Convention to provide continued air navigation services in national airspace. Where the company is, or is likely to become, insolvent, the proposed legislation will provide that the Secretary of State and the regulator have powers to petition the courts for a special administration order, to appoint an administrator to manage the affairs of the company. The administrator will oversee the transfer to another company, as a going concern, sufficient of the licensee's business to ensure that the licensed activities can be properly carried out, and to ensure that the licensed activities are carried out pending completion of the transfer. It is envisioned that these powers would be applied in the event that NATS was or was likely to be unable to pay its debts, or if it would be just and equitable under the Insolvency Act for the company to be wound up.
<P>
<P>
<a name="91019w26.htm_wqn19"><B> Mr. McDonnell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what sanctions the Economic Regulator will be able to impose under the public private partnership proposed by the Government for the future of National Air Traffic Services Ltd. for any abuse of the monopoly position of the private sector strategic partner.  [94335]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91019w26.htm_spnew19"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 The Government feel that any proposed enforcement regime should be both prompt and effective. However, in order to ensure that the UK can provide an uninterrupted service--as the Chicago Convention requires--the holder of the en-route licence must be allowed to continue its licensed activities while any abuse 



<P>
<P><I>19 Oct 1999 : Column: 516</I><P>
of its monopoly position is rectified. To this end, the Government will be seeking powers for the CAA, as economic regulator, to secure, where necessary, Provisional or Final Enforcement Orders. These Orders will be used to prevent any contravention or likely contravention of a licence obligation. The regulator will be able to enforce such Orders through civil proceedings, in order to obtain appropriate relief.
<P>
<P>
<a name="91019w26.htm_wqn20"><B> Mr. McDonnell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what mechanisms and criteria he will use under the public private partnership proposed by the Government for the future of National Air Traffic Services Ltd., to determine whether the strategic partner is, and remains, a fit and proper person whose ownership will not compromise the public interest or national security.  [94333]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91019w26.htm_spnew20"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 The strategic partner will be selected via a rigorous, competitive process--to ensure that they have the pre-requisite financial capability, proven commercial management expertise and strategic rationale for investing in NATS.
<P>

<a name="91019w26.htm_para7">The Government will wish to satisfy themselves, at the earliest possible stage of the selection process, that the strategic partner passes all probity and national security examinations. The Government will also ensure resolution of any actual or perceived conflict of interest issues and that the partner is committed to maintaining and, where necessary, improving NATS provision of safe air traffic control services to users of UK airspace.
<P>

<a name="91019w26.htm_para8">The design of the remaining stages of the process will allow bidders the opportunity to demonstrate their understanding of the aviation industry and public interest concerns. Shortlisted bidders will be required to prepare thorough final offers which will detail their long term commercial business plans for NATS and allow them to provide commitments for the further development and enhancement of NATS infrastructure and the broadening of NATS management skill base.
<P>
<P>
<a name="91019w26.htm_wqn21"><B> Mr. McDonnell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what assessment he has made of the response by the trade unions representing NATS staff to the Government's plans for selling 51 per cent. of National Air Traffic Services Ltd.  [94332]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91019w26.htm_spnew21"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 The Trade Unions response to the Government's proposals for the future of NATS was contained in a joint submission made by the Institution of Professionals, Managers and Specialists and the Public and Commercial Services Union. In it, the Unions recognised the case for change, in order to access additional sources of capital investment, to meet the needs of maintaining existing safety and efficiency levels against increased traffic. However, they disagreed on the best way to achieve this, arguing that NATS should stay in the public sector, and putting forward as their preferred solution, an Independent Publicly Owned Company (IPOC) option.
<P>

<a name="91019w26.htm_para9">The Government considered the IPOC model, and a range of other options, both in deciding on their preferred option in the first instance and in considering the responses to the public consultation. There are many similarities between the IPOC model and the New 



<P>
<P><I>19 Oct 1999 : Column: 517</I><P>
Partnership Company, but the Government believe that the New Partnership Company approach supplies all the solutions of an IPOC model, but with additional benefits.
<P>

<a name="91019w26.htm_para10">In common with the IPOC, the New Partnership Company secures access to private capital, separates regulation from operations, introduces economic regulation, involves all stakeholders in the company's future, provides for Government to appoint Partnership Directors, gives Government--and consequently the taxpayer--annual dividends, and provides on-going assurances that the company is operating properly in the national interest. However, the New Partnership Company also:
<P>

<a name="91019w26.htm_para11"><P>

<a name="91019w26.htm_para16">The Unions also put forward a trust model (such as NavCanada) as an alternative to IPOC, if the Government's overriding objective was to raise proceeds for other transport projects. The Government also considered a trust model in deciding on their preferred option. They concluded that, while a trust might offer limited benefits, primarily the potential for involving airspace users and NATS staff, there were a number of weaknesses in the model. These included the lack of real commercial incentives or disciplines, making costs higher than they could be, difficulties in ensuring adequate accountability, and the potential complexity of the ownership structure.

 The Department's Land Use Change Statistics show that, in 1994, 57% of new dwellings were built on previously developed land in the north-west, but these figures exclude conversions from existing buildings. The existing Regional Planning Guidance for the region emphasises the importance of channelling growth back into the main urban areas, but gives no targets. This guidance is currently being reviewed, and the issue of an appropriate target for the reuse of previously developed land and buildings for housing is under consideration.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what steps the Government take to regulate the size of audit fees for small village councils.  [94531]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91019w28.htm_spnew2"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 The setting of audit fees in respect of the audit of accounts is a statutory responsibility of the independent Audit Commission under Section 7 of the Audit Commission Act 1998. The Secretary of State has no powers to direct an auditor or the Audit Commission on the conduct of an audit.
<P>

<a name="91019w28.htm_para0">The Commission is aware of the burden that audit costs can impose on small parish councils and have introduced measures designed to reduce fees. Parish Council audit fees are charged at a rate that is 40% of that charged for principal authorities. Parishes with an income below &#163;5,000 per annum can reduce the burden further by adopting the 'triennial scheme' which allows three annual audits to be undertaken together to save on the overheads associated with an audit.

 At the request of my right hon.

The Environment Agency has already monitored for MTBE at 300 sites in its Thames region. MTBE was found at the sites listed although my advice is that the observed concentrations are all below the level at which it has been suggested that health hazards may arise.

 Arrangements are in place; the response to a major fire would be dealt with by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) in co-operation with operators of offshore installations and the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI). In line with Lord Donaldson's report on command and control at sea, DTI would co-ordinate in the event of an incident involving a Floating Production, Storage and Offloading (FPSO) installation at anchor, where there is risk of or actual damage to the environment.
<P>

<a name="91019w29.htm_para0">Under health and safety law, operators must assess major accident hazards, including fires, and take appropriate measures to deal with them. The Health and Safety Executive enforces these requirements, and inspects the installations to ensure measures are in place.

 The Government are committed to offering continuing learning opportunities for young people.

annual income for the repayment of student loans which are in <i>(a)</i> income-contingent and <i>(b)</i> old-style mortgage loans.  [94743]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91019w30.htm_spnew6"><B> Mr. Wicks: </B> 
 The starting point of annual income for the repayment of student loans which are income- contingent will be &#163;10,000; the starting point of annual income for the repayment of student loans which are old-style mortgage loans is &#163;18,192 in academic year 1999-2000. The repayment of income-contingent loans will be fairer than mortgage-style because it will be tied closely to income. Repayments will be based on 9 per cent. of income over &#163;10,000 a year so that repayments will increase or decrease in line with changes in income. The repayment of mortgage style loans above the threshold is not income-contingent. A fixed proportion of the loan has to be repaid each year: someone earning &#163;20,000 a year will repay the some monthly sum as someone earning &#163;40,000.

 My noble Friend the Minister for Education and Employment announced on 29 January that from 2000-01 we would make loans available to part-time students on low incomes to help with the costs of study, and would announce details later this year. The Department is now analysing information from the Student Income and Expenditure Survey, and will make a further announcement before Christmas.

 The Student Loans Company have informed me that at 15 October 1999, cheques have been issued to 325,000 students under the new student support arrangements. The total value of the loans was approximately &#163;346 million. These figures are for the United Kingdom.

This is a new entitlement, and performance will be kept under review. Employers can apply to the local TEC for a contribution towards the cost of the study or training.

 It is a matter for the individual institutions and private training providers to decide how they address moral and social education and pastoral arrangements for their post-16 students. There is no compulsory curriculum post-16, and therefore no requirement to study any particular subjects. However, for example, the new GCE A-level specifications have been written to identify, as appropriate to the subject, ways in which the study of the area can contribute to an understanding of spiritual, moral, ethical, social and cultural issues.

 The Government intend to change the law in order to require local education authorities to conduct the 'transition review' of a child's statement during academic year 9. At present the transition review takes place after the child's 14th birthday, which means that the review may not in practice be undertaken until year 10. Where the young person leaves school at age 16 he or she may therefore have had only one review which has focused on the personal 'transition plan'. The proposed change will ensure that 16-year-old school leavers who have statements of special educational needs will have had the benefit of at least two and in most cases three annual reviews at which planning for their transition from school has been actively and effectively addressed. Further guidance on good practice in transition planning will be provided in the revised SEN Code of Practice.

 The Education Maintenance Allowance (EMA) is being piloted in 15 local education authorities (LEAs) across England to test the effectiveness of targeted financial support on post-16 participation and attainment rates. The 15 pilot LEAs are: Middlesbrough, Walsall, Southampton, Oldham, City of Nottingham, Bolton, Doncaster, Stoke-on-Trent, Gateshead, Cornwall, Leeds, Lewisham, Southwark, Greenwich, Lambeth. Different pilot variants are being tested in different areas.
<P>

<a name="91019w32.htm_para0">Young people resident in the pilot areas may be eligible to receive an EMA if they left Year 11 last summer, participate in full-time post-16 education at school or college, and satisfy a financial assessment based on their parents' annual gross taxable income. The full allowance (&#163;30 in all areas except Nottingham and Oldham where &#163;40 is the maximum) will be payable if the parents' gross taxable income is less than &#163;13,000.

This framework will cover all teaching assistants including those learning support assistants who support children with special educational needs. As part of the first phrase of this work, we have commissioned LGNTO to develop national occupational standards for all teaching assistants. This work is due to be completed in Spring 2000.

In answer to your question on what was the average time that cases referred to the Employment Service Appeals Procedure took to be resolved, the only information available on speed of process is the length of time appeals take to be processed by the Employment Service. The following table shows the length of time between the appeal being made by the jobseeker and processed by the Employment Service Adjudication Officer either by revising the decision in the jobseekers favour or referring the appeal submission to The Appeals Service.

As you will see, it is split into three periods, appeals processed within 28 days of receipt, those processed between 29 and 56 days after receipt and those not processed within 57 days. Because Employment Service Adjudication Officers often need to obtain further information from the jobseeker on receipt of an appeal, it is unusual for a decision to be revised or a submission to be prepared and referred to The Appeals Service immediately on receipt.
<BR>
On occasions these enquiries can be protracted which means that the Employment Service Adjudication Officer is not in a position to process the appeal quickly. However, the Employment Service sets performance targets to encourage appeal submissions to be processed as quickly as possible. These are that 70% of appeals must be processed within 28 days and 85% within 56 days. The Employment Service does not collect information on the time the appeal subsequently takes to be allocated a hearing date and resolved by The Appeal Service.
<BR>
Finally, I am sorry that the Employment Service does not keep information on the numbers of appeals which were withdrawn before the Appeals Tribunal made a decision. This would be a matter for The Appeals Service which is the responsibility of the Department of Social Security.
<BR>
You may also be interested to know that from 18 October the appeals procedure will be changing with the implementation of the new Decision Making and Appeals arrangements.
<BR>
I hope this is helpful.

 The Government have invested significant resources to ensure that all adults, young and old, have access to high quality and co-ordinated information and advice on learning and careers opportunities. Services will be co-ordinated and delivered at local level through the lifelong learning partnerships. The partnerships will be expected to identify and target particular groups of people who, for various reasons, may lack confidence and need extra support and encouragement to access the learning opportunities open to them. The Government, through the Learning and Skills Council from April 2001, will monitor the success of the partnerships in achieving this objective.

<P>
<a name="91019w35.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Information on the time of day when inspections are undertaken is not kept centrally. However, we are aware that many inspections are carried out in buildings under artificial light, irrespective of the time of day when they are undertaken. It is the Local Veterinary Inspector's responsibility as the certifying officer to ensure that the conditions during his inspection are such that he is able to carry out his certifying officer responsibilities properly.

<a name="91019w35.htm_wqn6"><B> Mr. Prosser: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what arrangements he makes to ensure that his staff at Dover dockside are able to make proper inspections when livestock vehicles are loaded on to the ship during the hours of darkness.  [93038]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91019w35.htm_spnew6"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 State Veterinary Service staff stationed at Dover are equipped to carry out the necessary inspection of vehicles carrying livestock for export, whatever the time of that inspection.
<P>
<P>
<a name="91019w35.htm_wqn7"><B> Mr. Prosser: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what steps he is taking to discourage regular sailings of the vessel which carries live farm animals from Dover to the continent at night; and if he will make a statement.  [93040]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91019w35.htm_spnew7"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 None. The timing of sailings of any vessel, whether it carries live animals or not, is a matter for the operators of the vessel and their customers, provided that the relevant regulations are obeyed.
<P>
<P>
<a name="91019w35.htm_wqn8"><B> Mr. Prosser: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what proportion of the sailings of the vessel carrying live farm animals from Dover to the continent began during the hours of darkness in the last year for which figures are available.  [93037]

<a name="91019w35.htm_spnew8"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 In the period 1 October 1998-- 30 September 1999, out of a total of 195 sailings of vessels carrying live farm animals 103 (52.8 per cent.) began between 8.00 pm and 6.00 am the following morning.
<P>
<P>
<a name="91019w35.htm_wqn9"><B> Mr. Prosser: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food how many <i>(a)</i> live sheep and <i>(b)</i> live pigs have been exported for (i) slaughter, (ii) further fattening and (iii) breeding to date in 1999; and how many of each was exported to each individual country of destination.  [93036]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91019w35.htm_spnew9"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The tables show the number of live sheep and live pigs exported from the United Kingdom during the period 1 January 1999 to 26 July 1999.
<P>

<a name="91019w35.htm_para3">Table 1 shows the number of animals certified for export from the UK to other member states during the period 1 January 1999 to 26 July 1999. These figures are derived from the electronic messages which European law requires exporting countries to send to importing countries to inform them of the number of animals being exported in a given consignment.
<P>

<a name="91019w35.htm_para4">The number of pigs exported to the Republic of Ireland for slaughter may have been influenced by a fire in a pig plant in Northern Ireland which reduced slaughtering capacity in the Province.
<P>

<a name="91019w35.htm_para5">Table 2 shows data for exports to third countries. Specifically, it shows the number of export health certificates which were prepared and sent to official veterinarians for completion during the period 1 January 1999 to 26 July 1999. In the case of exports to third countries, precise figures of how many animals were ultimately exported are not available as there is no central record kept showing exactly how many animals were certified for export to third countries. The cost of collecting this level of detail would be disproportionate.
<P>

<a name="91019w35.htm_para6">There were no exports from Northern Ireland to third countries.
<P>

<a name="91019w35.htm_para7">In view of the continual updating of statistics, the figures in Tables 1 and 2 remain provisional and subject to change.

 <i>[holding answer 27 July 1999]:</i> The Government are committed to making sure that its policies are fair and inclusive and take full account of the needs and experiences of all those affected by them.
<P>

<a name="91019w36.htm_para0">As part of this commitment, the Ministry has guidance in place to ensure that those involved in policy development check how the policy or programme will affect, either directly or indirectly, different groups of people and take action if necessary where any adverse differential impact is identified. Whilst this does not involve the establishment of a base line, it does involve the consultation of appropriate groups and consideration of their views. However, the nature of the Ministry's responsibilities means that much of its activity does not have a differential impact on different groups of people.

 Details of the Department's and its Agencies' progress in tackling the Millennium bug are set out in our quarterly monitoring returns. These are available in the Libraries of the House and are published on the internet. The results of the October monthly review of progress of Departments and Agencies in tackling the bug are due to be announced shortly by the President of the Council.
<P>

<a name="91019w36.htm_para4">The Department's key benefit paying computer systems had all corrective work and testing complete by the end of 1998 allowing a full annual processing cycle before 2000. Additionally, all telecoms systems have been confirmed as compliant and the few remaining critical embedded systems (less than one per cent.) are receiving close management attention and will be cleared by 31 October. Since the President of the Council's quarterly Report to the House in July, there has been some very minor slippage in the embedded systems area, which poses no risk to the delivery of benefit.
<P>

<a name="91019w36.htm_para5">Contingency plans are in place; have been rehearsed; and continue to be refined to mitigate the latest assessment of risks, in particular those which specifically relate to the date change. The Department will have a Millennium Control Centre in operation over the period 1-5 January 2000, which will manage a range of readiness checks and pro-active communication on our status. The Departments key Social Security services of paying benefits, pensions and Child Support have been subject to independent assessment and each were assessed as "Blue" prior to Action 2000's National Infrastructure Forum in July. The results of the latest independent assessment of the "pay benefit" sector will be announced at the next National Infrastructure Forum on 21 October.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91019w37.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The Australian Government announced in July that it intended to terminate the bilateral Social Security Agreement with the United Kingdom. We have 



<P>
<P><I>19 Oct 1999 : Column: 559</I><P>
not received formal notice of termination. The Agreement would terminate 12 months after formal notice was received.
<P>

<a name="91019w37.htm_para4">The Agreement has a bearing on UK pensioners in Australia only if they have lived there for less than 10 years. It helps them to satisfy Australia's 10-year residence test for its Age Pension. UK pension is deducted from any Age Pension due. About 3,000 UK pensioners in Australia receive Age Pension with the help of the Agreement. They would be unaffected by termination, as anyone already entitled to benefit with the help of the Agreement when it terminated would continue to be covered by its terms.
<P>

<a name="91019w37.htm_para5">If the Agreement is terminated, UK pensioners would have to have lived in Australia for 10 years before they could become entitled to Age Pension.

<P>

<a name="91019w37.htm_para7">A full disregard of War Disablement and War Widows Pension in the income related benefits would cost in the region of an additional &#163;160 million a year.

 The White Paper "A new contract for welfare: Children's rights and parents responsibilities" (Cm 4349) sets out our plans to introduce a straightforward penalty for late payment.

The penalty will be payable to the Secretary of State and may be levied at a discretionary rate for each week in which the maintenance is due but was not paid, but will not be compounded. Imposition of the penalty will be discretionary and reasons for late payment will be taken into account.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security if compensation will be paid, and overpayments will be recoverable, where the default maintenance rate applied is found to be greater than the full maintenance assessment.  [94048]<P>

<P>
<a name="91019w37.htm_spnew15"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 Paragraphs 37 to 39 of Chapter Two of the White Paper "A new contract for welfare: Children's rights and parents' responsibilities" (Cm4349) set out our plans for a default rate of maintenance when maintenance liability cannot be assessed straight away. The purpose of a default rate is to enable children to see the advantages of maintenance as soon as possible and to get non-resident parents into the habit of paying. The proposal is that it is set at or around the average assessment of average earnings.
<P>

<a name="91019w37.htm_para13">The full assessment will be payable from the date that all the information needed to complete it is provided. Maintenance liability for the past will only be recalculated if the full assessment is higher than the default rate.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91019w37.htm_spnew16"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 Under the new child support scheme, the increased number of lone parents receiving maintenance payments will result in reduced expenditure on social security benefits. These savings will build up from the introduction of the scheme and are expected to reach around &#163;40 million a year after five years, taking into account the cost of the child maintenance premium and assuming cash compliance of 75 per cent. The reduction in spending will allow us to pay for the administrative costs of introducing the new scheme without increasing Government spending.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security, pursuant to his oral answer of 24 May 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column 11, on housing benefit, what account was taken of the needs of students in his Department's review of Housing Benefit.  [93956]

 Most full-time students are not entitled to Housing Benefit as support for students comes through the educational maintenance system rather than Social Security. However, certain students in vulnerable groups, such as lone parents, remain eligible to claim. There are no plans to change this position.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department when he expects to publish the legal aid Funding Code consequent on its Access to Justice Act 1999 reforms; and if he will make a statement.  [94397]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91019w38.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Lock: </B> 
 The Legal Aid Board published a consultation paper on the new Funding Code in January 1999 at the Lord Chancellor's request. The Board intends to publish a report on that consultation, and a new draft of the Code for further consultation, on 26 October. This will constitute the consultation required by section 8(8) of the Access to Justice Act.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department on what date the reforms in the Access to Justice Act 1999 relating to <i>(a)</i> conditional fee agreements and <i>(b)</i> legal aid will come into effect; and if he will make a statement.  [94399]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91019w38.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. Lock: </B> 
 On conditional fee agreements, my Department issued a consultation paper, "Conditional Fees: Sharing the Risks of Litigation", on 23 September. This fulfilled our commitment made during the passage of the Access to Justice Act, to consult before implementing the provisions in the Act on recovery of insurance premiums and success fees. Consultation closes on 26 November. Subject to the results, we plan to implement these provisions in the first quarter of next year.

<a name="91019w38.htm_para1">On the legal aid reforms, implementation is planned to take place in several stages. On 4 January 2000, contracts for family, immigration, mental health and advice and assistance work will take effect under the Legal Aid Act 1988. These contracts will be continued when the relevant sections of Part I of the Access to Justice Act come into force in April 2000. The new Legal Services Commission and Community Legal Service will also be established in April; in the same month the Funding Code will take effect (subject to further public comment and parliamentary approval); contracting for individual high-cost cases will begin; and there will be new regulations governing financial eligibility and conditions. In October 2000, the Criminal Defence Service will replace criminal legal aid.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what assessment he has made of the impact of the Law Society's statements concerning the abolition of Queen's Counsel on the credibility of the Queen's Counsel system; and if he will make a statement.  [94400]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91019w38.htm_spnew6"><B> Mr. Lock: </B> 
 My noble and learned Friend the Lord Chancellor is very disappointed that the Law Society has seen fit to adopt a concluded public position in advance of the publication of Sir Leonard Peach's report on the operation of the judicial appointments and Silk systems. He regards Silk as a kitemark of quality which engenders public confidence and enables lawyers and clients to identify the leading members of the profession. He and his officials are absolutely committed to ensuring equality of opportunity, and he makes his decisions on Silk only after wide, extensive and highly structured consultation with those who are best placed to judge the applicants against the set criteria. In fairness to solicitor applicants, he will respond to the Law Society's withdrawal of co-operation by developing other channels of consultation to ensure that he can give fair consideration to their applications.
<P>
<P>
<a name="91019w38.htm_wqn7"><B> Mr. Dismore: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department if he will list the <i>(a)</i> individuals and <i>(b)</i> organisations consulted as part of the secret soundings for appointments (i) to the judiciary and (ii) to leading counsel; and if he will make a statement.  [94402]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91019w38.htm_spnew7"><B> Mr. Lock: </B> 
 The Lord Chancellor consults widely among the judiciary and senior members of the legal profession about the suitability of candidates for judicial appointment and Silk. He entirely rejects any suggestion that those arrangements constitute "secret soundings". Information about those who are consulted is publicly available. Assessments are provided in confidence, but many candidates take up the offer of feedback which includes the tenor of the assessments received.

 The Lord Chancellor is disappointed by the Law Society's decision to withdraw from the existing arrangements for consultation on candidates for judicial and Queen's Counsel appointments, which do not in any way constitute a "secret soundings process". He has valued the help he has received from the Law Society in assessing solicitors as candidates for appointment, and he finds it difficult to see how the interests of solicitors can be advanced by a decision to withhold the assistance previously given. In fairness to solicitor candidates, the Lord Chancellor will continue to consult such representative bodies as the Solicitors' Family Law Association and the London Criminal Courts Solicitors' Association, and proposes also to develop other channels of consultation, potentially including solicitors' firms, senior practitioners and local and regional Law Societies.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department if he will extend the terms of reference of Sir Leonard Peach in his review of appointment arrangements to Queen's Counsel and the judiciary to reflect the views of the Law Society on the secret soundings system; and if he will make a statement.

<a name="91019w38.htm_spnew10"><B> Mr. Lock: </B> 
 The system of consultation on candidates for the judiciary and Queen's Counsel is not secret. Information about those who are consulted for assessments of suitability is publicly available. Assessments are sought in a structured way against the specific criteria for appointment; they are provided in confidence, but many candidates take up the offer of feedback, which includes the tenor of the assessments received. The scope for improvements in the consultation arrangements is within the terms of reference of the scrutiny of judicial appointments and Queen's Counsel selection procedures which my noble and learned Friend the Lord Chancellor has asked Sir Leonard Peach to undertake. The Law Society has presented its views on the system to Sir Leonard, who will no doubt take these into account when he reports in due course.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what plans he has to provide <i>(a)</i> sign language interpreters and <i>(b)</i> other facilities to enable people suffering from hearing loss to observe magistrates courts proceedings.  [94403]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91019w39.htm_spnew1"><B> Jane Kennedy: </B> 
 Arrangements are in place for the provision of sign language interpreters for defendants and witnesses appearing in criminal proceedings in England and Wales. However, there are no plans to provide such interpreters for a member of the public who visits the court to observe the proceedings. The Lord Chancellor's Department has issued guidance to magistrates courts committees and local authorities on the court environment and range of physical facilities that we would expect to be provided to enable those court users with hearing difficulties to observe magistrates court proceedings. Provision of such facilities is a matter for the magistrates courts committee and local authority.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91019w39.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Lock: </B> 
 A new civil court fee structure was introduced on 26 April 1999, at the same time as the Civil Procedure Rules. Impecunious litigants continue either to be automatically exempt from paying fees or able to apply for fee remission or reduction. There have been minor changes to fee remission and exemption provisions: the wording of the hardship criterion is now the same in each Fees Order; Court Service guidelines on fee remission have been amended; and the automatic exemption provisions have been updated to take account of the introduction of Tax Credits. None of these changes has adversely affected the level at which relief is granted.

 The spending on official publications since May 1997 by the Lord Chancellor's Department was &#163;4,407,500. This represents spending by LCDHQ, Court Service, Public Trust Office, Public Records Office, Office of the Official Solicitor and the Land Registry. This excludes the cost of publications produced for internal use. Where the Department makes use of a private sector publisher, printing and design costs are generally met by the publisher as part of their acceptance of the risks of publication.

 <i>[holding answer 26 July 1999]:</i> The Secretary of State started to implement plans to reduce primary school class sizes in Wales from September 1998. Following the &#163;3.7 million Welsh Office grant for infant class size reduction in 1998-99, the Schools Census for January 1999 showed that the number of large infant classes in Wales had reduced by 50 per cent. when compared with January 1998. Out of 100,000 pupils just 15,000 remained in classes of over 30.
<P>

<a name="91019w40.htm_para1">As a result of the &#163;11.3 million allocated for 1999-2000, it is expected that 90 per cent. of the problem of large infant classes, which existed in 1997, will be solved.
<P>

<a name="91019w40.htm_para2">The Secretary of State has no further plans to reduce primary class size, as this is now a matter for the National Assembly for Wales.

The UK Government also has a domestic goal to cut carbon dioxide emissions by 20 per cent. below 1990 levels by 2010. The Government and the devolved Administrations are currently developing a draft climate change programme, which will set out how the UK will deliver its Kyoto target and move towards its domestic goal.
