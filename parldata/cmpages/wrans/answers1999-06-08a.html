To ask the Attorney-General on what grounds he decided not to exercise his discretion under the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act 1996 to certify that the charge of murder of Robert Hamill against Paul Marc Hobson be not treated as a scheduled offence.  [85494]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90608w01.htm_spmin0"><B>The Attorney-General:</B> 
 In determining whether or not to certify that an offence should be treated as a non scheduled offence, I take into account the circumstances of the case on the basis of a note and recommendation furnished on behalf of the Director of Public Prosecutions for Northern Ireland. In the case of Paul Marc Hobson, who faced a charge of murdering Robert Hamill, on the basis of the information available to me, I took the view that the offence was connected with the emergency and declined to issue a certificate.

 I have today placed copies of the new public information booklet "The Millennium Bug--Facts Not Fiction" in the Libraries of the House. This has been compiled by Action 2000 on behalf of the Government for the general public and explains what the Millennium Bug is and how it could affect people in their everyday lives. It covers domestic appliances, home personal computers, shops and petrol stations, health, travel, personal finance, insurance and utilities.
<P>

<a name="90608w01.htm_para0">The booklet will be distributed as an insert in most Sunday newspapers on 13 June and in TV listings guides the following week. It will also be available at main Post Office counters from 14 June. The booklet will be supported by TV, radio and press advertising.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will make a statement on the recent work of his Department's vaccine fact-finding team with particular

reference to the findings relating to the presence of squalene in blood samples provided by US and British veterans.  [83015]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90608w01.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson: </B> 
 The MOD's Fact Finding Team within the Gulf Veterans' Illnesses Unit (GVIU) was established in September 1997 to look into the implementation in-theatre of the 1991 immunisation programme against biological warfare agents, with particular reference to the level of coverage and uptake of vaccine across the various units of the UK Armed Forces that participated in the Gulf conflict. This review is based on oral testimony and extant documentary evidence, with a view to making public as much information as possible. The team's fieldwork was completed last autumn and a paper based on their work, and on other contemporary material that has been located, is in the course of preparation. This will be published once it is completed, which is expected to be within the next three months.
<P>

<a name="90608w01.htm_para1">This review is aimed at providing more information about how the immunisation programme was carried out in principle, not the compositions of the vaccines used, which have already been set out in the MOD paper "Background to the Use of Medical Countermeasures to Protect British Forces during the Gulf War (Operation GRANBY)".
<P>
<P>
<a name="90608w01.htm_wqn3"><B> Mr. Steinberg: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence which vaccines were acquired from the USA for the use of British soldiers in the Gulf War; which vaccines were used; and which contained squalene.  [83014]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90608w01.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson: </B> 
 Details of the Ministry of Defence's programme to immunise UK troops against the potential threat posed by Iraq's biological weapons during the Gulf conflict were published in October 1997, in the MOD paper "Background to the Use of Medical Countermeasures to Protect British Forces during the Gulf War (Operation GRANBY)". This describes in detail how a vaccine against plague was purchased from the US DoD for use by UK forces. None of the other vaccines used for this programme were acquired from the US. None of the vaccines used for this programme contained squalene. In addition, UK Service personnel would have received other immunisations against disease that potentially posed a public health threat. So far as has been ascertained, none of the latter vaccines were either acquired from the US or contained squalene.

Government had published its first Annual Report on Strategic Export Controls. The Report contains, by rating, details of all licences refused or revoked by the Government between 2 May and 31 December 1997, and none of these covered military aircraft. A report covering 1998 will be issued in due course.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90608w01.htm_wqn6"><B> Mr. David Heath: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence (1) what investigations have been undertaken into the physical rather than epidemiological aspects of illnesses exhibited by Gulf War veterans;  [84354]
<P>
<UL>(2) what research has been undertaken into appropriate treatments for illness exhibited by Gulf war veterans.  [84353]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90608w01.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson: </B> 
 The Government have pledged that appropriate research will be carried out into Gulf veterans' illnesses. In addition to two major epidemiological studies, the Ministry of Defence has in place a neuromuscular symptoms study. This study involves carrying out clinical tests on UK Gulf veterans. A separate study is examining the possible interactions between the various medical countermeasures used to protect UK personnel during the Gulf conflict, which includes laboratory research involving animals. These four research studies are complemented by an independent review of relevant research literature. A further study, which is being funded by the United States Government, is being undertaken by King's College, London. This study includes clinical tests on UK Gulf veterans.
<P>

<a name="90608w01.htm_para3">Any UK Gulf veterans concerned about their health can seek a referral to the Gulf veterans' Medical Assessment Programme (MAP) for advice and a full medical. The assessment comprises various standard investigations and any further tests considered clinically appropriate by the MAP physician to provide as full a diagnosis as possible of any medical symptoms which a patient may be exhibiting. MAP physicians provide diagnostic information and recommend any appropriate treatment to the veteran's doctor. It is the veteran's doctor's responsibility to arrange any treatment and to monitor progress. A paper on the clinical findings from the first 1,000 patients seen by the MAP was published in the "British Medical Journal" on 30 January. A copy of this paper has already been placed in the Library of the House.
<P>

<a name="90608w01.htm_para4">There is now strong scientific evidence, following the publication of a number of research papers over recent months, that Gulf veterans report more ill-health than other comparable groups. A further hypothesis, that Gulf veterans are not all suffering from a single illness, seems to be gaining support. However, there is still no medical or scientific consensus about the aetiology of the illnesses being suffered by some Gulf veterans. Nevertheless, the need for further research work in the light of emerging study findings in the UK and elsewhere (most notably from the United States), is kept under regular review by the Ministry of Defence and by the Medical Research Council (MRC), which advises the Government on its 



<P>
<P><I>8 Jun 1999 : Column: 208</I><P>
overall strategy for Gulf health issues. So far, the MRC has not recommended that the Ministry of Defence commissions research into possible treatments.
<P>

<a name="90608w01.htm_para5">Nevertheless, the Ministry of Defence is aware that the United States Government announced in March that it would be beginning two medical treatment trials-- an antibiotic treatment trial and exercise-behavioural therapy--in April to evaluate possible therapeutic approaches to improving Gulf veterans' health. The Ministry of Defence will monitor the outcome of these trials.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will list those British military uniforms which are produced by overseas countries; and if he will list the countries that make such equipment.  [84965]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90608w01.htm_spnew6"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson: </B> 
 This is a matter for the Chief Executive of the Defence Clothing and Textiles Agency. I have asked the Chief Executive to write to the hon. Member.
<P>

<a name="90608w01.htm_para6"><i>Letter from Michael Roycroft to Mr. Tom Cox, dated 8 June 1999:</i>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I am replying to your question to the Secretary of State for Defence as this matter falls within my area of responsibility. You ask that we provide a list of those British military uniforms which are produced by overseas countries and the countries that make such equipment.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Unfortunately, we are unable to provide the requested information. The Defence Clothing and Textiles Agency (DCTA) is responsible for the procurement of all clothing items for the Armed Forces. The vast majority of DCTA purchases are made-up garments, with MOD having no requirement for contractors to specify the country of origin of the textiles used to make the items, and there is no remit on DCTA to record such information.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We can, however, provide some analysis of clothing contracts. Current figures indicate that around 73% by value of DCTA clothing contracts for 1998/99 were awarded to UK firms, leaving 27% to overseas firms. As required by Government Accounting, DCTA must advertise all potential contracts valued greater than &#163;160,670 in the European Journal, which certainly attracts overseas contractors. There can, therefore, be no "buy British" policy for Defence Textiles. The only contractual stipulation regarding the country of manufacture is that 10% of garments must be made at the main contractor's accredited facilities.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Of paramount importance is to ensure that fabrics meet the MOD's demanding specification, such as fibre content, wear quality and fire retardancy and the country of manufacture is secondary. All firms, from UK and abroad, utilise cloth manufactured overseas and whilst DCTA could certainly provide examples of countries supplying textiles, this information is considered nugatory as it would not give the comprehensive answer that you seek.</FONT></UL>

<P>
<P>
<a name="90608w02.htm_wqn1"><B> Mr. Malins: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how many civilians were seconded to the armed forces during the Gulf Crisis; and, of those, how many are known to be suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder.  [84952]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90608w02.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson: </B> 
 Civilians, including foreign nationals, based in the UK and overseas, played a vital role in supporting British Forces during the 1990-1991 Gulf conflict, but the precise number seconded (that is attached to British Forces) has not been determined.
<P>

<a name="90608w02.htm_para0">However, a review of Ministry of Defence (MOD) records shows that on 22 February 1991, 931 MOD civilian staff were reported as being in the Gulf theatre, but not all were working in direct support of British Forces. Of these, 785 were members of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary. In addition, there were a significant number of civilian contractors' employees working in direct support of British Forces in the Gulf theatre. My Department conservatively estimates that the number of civilian contractors' employees involved would have been in excess of 1,000 people.
<P>

<a name="90608w02.htm_para1">MOD is aware of two civilians who claim to have post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as a result of their time in the Gulf during the conflict. MOD has no mechanisms in place for routinely monitoring the health of its employees, ex-employees, contractors' employees or foreign nationals. However, civilians who provided direct support to British Forces in theatre during the Gulf conflict can be referred by their GP for examination at the MOD's Medical Assessment Programme (MAP). As at 26 May 1999, 14 civilians had been seen by MAP physicians.

<P>
<a name="90608w02.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. George Robertson: </B> 
 I was unable to attend the WEU Council meeting on 10 May because of Defence Questions in the House and was therefore represented by a Senior official from my Department. I was present at the session on 11 May.
<P>

<a name="90608w02.htm_para2">One of the major points of business was continuing the process of informal reflection on European security and defence issues, initiated at the WEU meeting in Rome last November. Particular points emphasised in the discussion included: the need to rectify shortfalls in European military capability; the need to strengthen the EU's Common Foreign and Security Policy, including by giving the EU the means to decide on military matters and take political control of crisis management operations; the importance of involving the non-EU European Allies, and the Associate Partners, in future arrangements; and the continuing importance of NATO as the cornerstone of European security and defence policy. No documents were considered or decisions taken on these matters. A number of papers relating to other aspects of WEU business were noted or endorsed by Ministers at their meetings.

<P>
<a name="90608w02.htm_spnew6"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 No MOD funded gyro-stabilised satellite television dishes have been fitted to RN frigates. However, this type of dish has been fitted to two aircraft carriers, HMS Invincible and HMS Illustrious, and will be fitted to the third, HMS Ark Royal, during her current refit. The estimated cost of each dish is &#163;36,000, excluding installation costs, which are included in the refit costs and are not separately identifiable. The majority of the RN's major warships are currently fitted with conventional domestic satellite equipment which provides reception whilst in harbour in European waters. We are planning to enhance this facility by providing reception whilst the ships are at sea. Under the revised arrangements, ships' crews would be able to see broadcasts within about 12 hours of transmission.

 The qualifying criteria for the award of clasps to the General Service Medal and General Service Medal 1962 are laid down in the appropriate Command Paper. Ministers have no responsibilities in the process of determining eligibility for these awards. Officials in the appropriate medal office are responsible for determining individual eligibility by comparing a person's Record of Service against the criteria published for the award of the medal and the relevant clasp.

<a name="90608w03.htm_para0">Discipline procedures in all three of the Armed Forces are kept under review at all times and amended as necessary.

Where there is a need, however, changes can be made by other legislative means. It is my Department's policy to preserve consistency as far as appropriate, practical and sensible, between civilian and military law; this applies equally to measures concerning those under the age of 18.

The repayment of tax is being processed in three stages: the first stage, the repayment of the current year's tax, has been completed; the second stage covers the period 1994-95 to 1997-98 for which records are held and repayments for this period will be made shortly. The final stage, which covers the period from the individual's discharge date to 1994, is more difficult to calculate as records of pension and tax paid are not held and therefore need to be recreated. This work is under-way and repayment will be made as soon as possible.

It should be noted that authorities with high levels of debt are generally those which have undertaken capital investment and that longer term borrowing to finance capital expenditure is regulated by Government through the issue of credit approvals, for which support is provided through the Standard Spending Assessment mechanism.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what plans Her Majesty's Government have to secure the provision of extra runway space in the South-East of England.  [85876]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90608w05.htm_spnew2"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 On 11 March 1999, <i>Official Report,</i> columns <i>360-61</i>, we announced our decision to undertake a study of airport issues in the South-East and East of England. That study will consider future policies for these airports within the framework of the Government's sustainable development principles. It will, among other things, consider whether new runway capacity in the region might be justified, having regard to social, environmental and economic considerations.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90608w05.htm_wqn3"><B> Mrs. Dunwoody: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will ask the airport co-ordinator with responsibility for Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted to make a statement on runway constraints.  [85878]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90608w05.htm_spnew3"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The Airport Co-ordinator is not the appropriate person to make such a statement. The capacity of Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted is assessed twice a year, for the summer and winter operating seasons, by the airport operator, in consultation with airport users, air traffic control and the airport co-ordinator. Maximising use of runway capacity may be constrained by airspace availability, terminal capacity, and aircraft stand availability. The assessment is then used by the airport co-ordinator when he comes to allocate take off and landing slots for the season.

<a name="90608w05.htm_para3"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That the slots concerned were being used for a particular route at the time of entry into force of the Regulation (1993), only one air carrier is operating on the route, and no other mode of transport can provide an adequate service.

<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="90608w05.htm_para6">No slots are currently protected on either ground. The Government said in <i>A New Deal for Transport</i> (Cmnd 3950) that they would press for recognition in any revision of the Regulation of the case for maintaining access from regional airports into major hubs such as Heathrow and Gatwick. Proposals for revision are still awaited from the Commission.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what safeguards exist to ensure that airspace management by NATS of airports and air traffic, where NATS does not provide the services, is impartial.  [85841]<P>

<a name="90608w05.htm_spnew5"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The Directions to the CAA under section 72 of the Civil Aviation Act 1982 state that NATS must provide air navigation services
<P>

<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"without according preferential treatment to either civil or military users ".
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="90608w05.htm_para8">If an airport or user has a complaint about the management of airspace by NATS, it could refer to, for instance, the Directorate of Airspace Policy or the Economic Regulation Group, depending on the circumstances. If they were not happy with the outcome, they would have the right to appeal to the Chairman of the CAA.
<P>

<a name="90608w05.htm_para9">The ability of NATS to unfairly influence access to airspace from airports is limited. The allocation of slots in NATS airspace for aircraft leaving airports is beyond NATS' control--in fact it is decided by the Central Flow Management Unit in Brussels. The only legitimate circumstances under which NATS could restrict access to airspace would be for reasons of safety.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what discussions his Department has held with the British airlines holding slots at South-East airports about their re-allocation.  [85837]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90608w05.htm_spnew7"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 None. The current regulation permits slots to be freely exchanged between carriers, or transferred by a carrier from one route or type of service to another. But British airlines should be aware of the Government's view, as set out in A New Deal for Transport, that any revision of the EC Regulation that governs the slot allocation process at congested airports should recognise the case for maintaining access from regional airports into congested hubs such as Heathrow and Gatwick.
<P>

<a name="90608w05.htm_wqn8"><B> Mrs. Dunwoody: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will set out the Public Service Obligation rules to protect air services for those airports to which they apply.  [85925]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90608w05.htm_spnew8"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The conditions under which a Public Service Obligation (PSO) can be established on an air route are set out in European Council Regulation 2408-92. The European Court of Justice found (Case T--260/94 Air Inter v The Commission) that a "route" should be defined as a transport link between two cities or regions, and is not airport specific.
<P>

<a name="90608w05.htm_para10">A PSO on a regional service to London could therefore be fulfilled by services from any airport in the London airport system. A PSO may be imposed by a Member State in respect of scheduled air services to an airport serving a peripheral or development region in its territory, or on a thin route to any regional airport in its territory. The criterion is that the route must be vital to the economic development of the region in which the airport is situated. PSOs may be used to the extent necessary to ensure on a route the adequate provision of scheduled air services satisfying fixed standards of continuity, regularity, capacity and pricing, which standards air carriers would not assume if they were solely considering their commercial interest. There is provision for the carrier fulfilling the PSO to be reimbursed as appropriate for meeting the specified standards.
<P>

<a name="90608w05.htm_para11">"Adequacy" is assessed with regard to: the public interest; the availability of other forms of transport; air fares and conditions; and the combined effect of all air carriers operating or intending to operate on the route.

 All reported airprox incidents are fully investigated by the independent UK Airprox Board (UKAB). In 1998, UKAB investigated 202 airprox incidents, a figure slightly lower than at any time in the past decade, despite significant increases in traffic over that period. Of these, only 7 were assessed as being risk-bearing and attributable to National Air Traffic Services (NATS). This is the lowest figure in the 1990s despite record traffic levels. However, there is no cause for complacency and Ministers and NATS continue to ensure that the highest priority is given to maintaining and, where practicable, improving on the UK's outstanding safety record.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90608w07.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions does not routinely collect information on the number of homeless people who are former members of the armed forces. However, research on single homeless people and rough sleepers commissioned by the Department provides some information on the proportion of these groups which have a service background. <i>Single Homeless People (HMSO, 1993)</i> found that a fifth of a sample of single homeless people living in hostels or bed and breakfast hotels had been in the armed forces or merchant navy (not counting national service or the territorials). <i>From Street to Home: An Evaluation of Phase 2 of the Rough Sleepers Initiative (TSO, 1996)</i> found that a quarter of rough sleepers had been in the armed forces or merchant navy.
<P>

<a name="90608w07.htm_para1">As part of the Social Exclusion Unit review of <i>Rough Sleeping</i> (Cm 4008) the Department reviewed key research on rough sleeping. The review covered a number of studies dealing with rough sleepers with service backgrounds, including the two DETR studies described above, plus research commissioned by voluntary sector organisations including <i>Falling Out: a research study of

 Transport operators may offer discounted travel for young people commercially if they wish to do so.

It is for individual local authorities to decide whether to do so, what the size of any discount should be, and whether it should apply to train as well as bus travel. In addition, it is for Local Education Authorities to decide whether a child qualifies for free or assisted travel to school.

<a name="90608w07.htm_para3">Provision of reduced fares varies, and my Department is currently undertaking a survey of local authorities and operators. The results will be available to the School Travel Advisory Group, which comprises representatives of the relevant Government Departments and of parents, teachers, local authorities and other interested parties, so that the Group can identify and promulgate best practice.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90608w07.htm_spnew8"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The Fishing Vessel (Safety Provisions) Rules 1975 specified the carriage requirements for safety equipment on all UK registered fishing vessels. Since then, changes to those requirements have been developed within the context of the Fishing Industry Safety Group (FISG), in which representatives of the fishing industry have themselves influenced the standards being required. For smaller vessels (under 12 metres in length) we hope soon to introduce a new Code of Practice. This Code will specify safety equipment which should be carried. The list of safety equipment to be carried results from consultation with the industry and the benefits of each item have already been fully considered. A special assessment of cost and risk effectiveness of safety equipment is not necessary as requirements are kept under continuous review by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency and the industry through the mechanism of the FISG.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90608w07.htm_spnew9"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 Draft guidance on land use planning and electromagnetic fields (EMFs) was issued for consultation by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Health on 8 December 1998. Copies were placed in the Library. We have received 147 responses to the consultation draft. Since issuing the draft circular, my Department has received four Parliamentary Questions and some 70 letters related to the possible health effects of telecommunications apparatus.
<P>

<a name="90608w07.htm_para4">The draft guidance reflects the advice to Government of the National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB) that there is no convincing evidence of a causal link between exposure to EMFs and cancer. The Board's advice is based upon a review and assessment of published scientific studies covering the fields of epidemiology, biology and dosimetry. In continuing to review the science, the NRPB takes into account the range of reported biological effects, including those of a non-thermal nature. We shall continue to take NRPB advice into consideration in developing policy on land use planning and electromagnetic fields.

 The Government have asked members of the National Museum Directors' Conference to examine their collections with a view to finding out whether any items may have been looted during World War II and the Nazi period. Any claims will need to be considered on their merits on a case-by-case basis.
<P>

<a name="90608w08.htm_para1">Some works have been identified which have gaps in their provenance, but this does not necessarily mean that they are the result of spoliation during the Holocaust and World War II. Research is continuing and it is hoped that updated information about the progress of this research will be published later this year.
<P>

<a name="90608w08.htm_para2">The National Museum Directors' Conference has published Action Plans for 23 national museums, galleries and libraries, and I have deposited a copy of these in the Library. The Museums and Galleries Commission has recently issued a Statement of Principles to all Registered Museums. This recommends action to be taken by non-national institutions. The Museums and Galleries Commission will also be having discussions with those non-national institutions which have major art collections about how they might approach the issue of research into provenance. I have deposited a copy of this Statement of Principles in the Library.
<P>

<a name="90608w08.htm_para3">The possibility of a time limit on claims is an issue which will need to be discussed with museums and galleries and other interests. However, the Statement of Principles published by the National Museums Directors' Conference last November suggests that an institution which has fully publicised the details of a work which it believes might have been the result of spoliation during the Nazi period and World War II would normally expect to receive a claim within six years. I have deposited a copy of this Statement of Principles in the Library. The question of de-accessioning will be considered on a case by case basis if, and when, there are successful claims for objects to be returned.

 The BBC Charter and Agreement provide a framework for ensuring that the Corporation's commercial activities are funded, operated and accounted for separately from its public service activities. It is for the BBC's Board of Governors to ensure that the BBC meets its obligations in this area. Any commercial activities undertaken by the BBC are subject to the same UK and EU competition law as its competitors. The BBC publishes separate annual reports and accounts for its commercial subsidiaries BBC Worldwide Ltd. and BBC Resources Ltd. These are submitted to the Secretary of State and presented to Parliament.

In the course of these informal discussions which took place during 1998, it became clear that it would not be possible for BNFL and Maine Yankee to conclude a contract which would be consistent with both UK Government policy on the importation of radioactive waste and US Government policy on reprocessing. The discussions were, therefore, brought to an end and this Department was so informed.

 We notified the DAC of the OECD of the status (tied or untied) of all of our o.d.a., excluding technical cooperation and administrative costs. In 1997, 28 per cent. of such commitments were tied. In the same year, we awarded technical cooperation, management, and consultancy contracts in the UK totalling &#163;241 million, mostly to UK companies. Contracts for goods totalling &#163;14.5 million, were again mostly from the UK. awarded by our procurement agents.

 As our White Paper makes clear, a thriving private sector is essential for sustainable and equitable economic growth. Since 1997, we have strengthened our collaboration with business to tackle the constraints faced by the private sector. We seek to promote a stable and attractive operating environment for business, both domestic and foreign. We seek, often through work with business intermediary organisations, to improve the capacity of local companies by improving access to sustainable financial services, training, market information and appropriate technology. And by bringing forward the Commonwealth Development Corporation Bill, we seek to enable CDC to mobilise higher levels of investment, which will help create and develop viable long term businesses in the poorer countries.

 The overall pupil/teacher ratio in maintained schools in England fell from 18.9 to 18.8 between January 1998 and January 1999. Over the same period, the ratio in primary schools changed from 23.7 to 23.5 and that in secondary schools from 16.9 to 17.0. As a result of our policy to reduce the size of infant classes, the number of children in large infant classes fell by some 130,000 from 485,000 in January 1998 to 356,000 in January 1999.

This made clear that the fishing vessel safety equipment grants scheme was being closed to new applicants from that day. Thus, no further grants will be available for fishing safety measures from the Department. Neither will EU grants be available as these require national co-funding. However, all grant approvals in respect of applications received before 21 May will be honoured.

[85854]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90608w12.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The legislative authority for nationally funded fishing vessel safety equipment grants is the Fishing Vessels (Safety Improvements) (Grants) Scheme 1995 (SI 1995 No 1609) made under section 15 of the Fisheries Act 1981. The legislative authority for EU grants and the necessary national back-up grant is the Fisheries and Aquaculture Structures (Grants) Regulations 1995 (SI 1995 No 1576).

<P>
<a name="90608w12.htm_spnew6"><B> Mr. Nick Brown: </B> 
 The Government believe that observance of best agriculture practice, including the SCIMAC "Guidelines for growing newly developed herbicide tolerant crops" will ensure that the risk of cross pollination of non-GM crops, and hence compromise to neighbouring farmers' businesses, is minimised.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what protection from cross-pollination of genetically modified crops and non-genetically modified crops exists for <i>(a)</i> organic farmers and <i>(b)</i> conventional farmers.  [86129]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90608w12.htm_spnew7"><B> Mr. Nick Brown: </B> 
 When evaluating applications for the release of genetically modified crops the Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment (ACRE) considers the risks associated with cross pollination and would recommend conditions on the release consent if this was believed to be necessary. Additionally, the SCIMAC "Guidelines for growing newly developed herbicide tolerant crops" include separation distances between GM and non-GM (conventional and organic) crops to ensure that the risk of cross pollination is minimised.

<a name="90608w12.htm_spnew8"><B> Mr. Nick Brown: </B> 
 The SCIMAC stewardship programme for the introduction of genetically modified crops launched on 21 May includes the key principle of preserving the identity of GM crops up to the point that they leave the farm gate. This will enable food processors and manufacturers to distinguish between GM and non-GM products and provide consumers with a choice if that is what they want.

<P>
<a name="90608w12.htm_spnew9"><B> Mr. Nick Brown: </B> 
 The statement by my right hon.

 Two Animal Test Certificates (ATCs) were issued in 1985 under the terms of the Medicines Act 1968 to Monsanto Europe SA and Lilly Industries Ltd respectively. A total of 38 farms and agricultural institutes were used in the tests at sites across the country. The timing of trials and the location of the farms and institutes concerned are confidential to the manufacturers but all trials took place before the imposition of the EU moratorium. No conditions were applied to the disposal of milk from treated cows. The normal concentration of BST in milk is not affected by the treatment of cows with BST.

 Any potential health risks that could arise as a result of the transfer of transgenes from genetically modified (GM) foods to human gut flora and gut cells are considered by the Advisory Committee on Novel Foods and Processes (ACNFP) as part of its rigorous safety assessment of such products. All the GM foods which have been approved for use in the UK to date have been assessed as safe for human consumption.
<P>

<a name="90608w13.htm_para0">The project in question is being funded to provide further background data to quantify the very low probability of such transfer occurring, by examining some model systems. The majority of the work involves looking at <i>in vitro</i> systems for possible transfer of genes from GM micro-organisms to human gut flora and to isolated gut cells. It will also investigate the survival of GM material derived from plants in the human small intestine, firstly by looking at a model, <i>in vitro</i>, system which mimics the conditions in the small intestine. This will then be followed up by human volunteer studies to evaluate the applicability of the model to the <i>in vivo</i> situation.

 In order to calculate the productivity charges payable to Siemens Business Services under the terms of the Casework Contract, the Immigration and Nationality Directorate (IND) calculated the cost of a range of types of case over the baseline period October 1995 to September 1996. For this baseline period, costs, which exclude some overheads, were calculated for individual types of immigration casework, including an asylum case and a general or settlement immigration case, and for a standard unit of IND casework. IND no longer calculates the unit cost for individual types of cases. The available unit costs of IND casework for the baseline period, November 1997, November 1998 and April 1999 are shown in the table:

<a name="90608w15.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 All arriving passengers, including children, are liable to be examined by an immigration officer in order to determine identity and nationality. No particular distinction is made between the examination of adults' and children's passports.
<P>

<a name="90608w15.htm_para2">The previous Administration had already removed, in 1994, embarkation controls for passengers travelling from ferry ports and small airports to destinations within the European Union/European Economic Area, with the consequence that some 40 per cent. of all departing passengers were not seen by an immigration officer. There has never been an embarkation control for channel tunnel services. What was left of the control was, therefore, ineffective in providing a reliable record of a person's departure, and we have since introduced new arrangements following my reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Wythenshawe and Sale, East (Mr. Goggins), <i>Official Report,</i> columns <i>506-07</i> on 16 March 1998.
<P>

<a name="90608w15.htm_para3">The new system involves a close partnership between the control authorities and port operators based on intelligence and target led embarkation checks, including the increased use of closed circuit television. There are no plans to reinstate routine embarkation controls, although immigration officers will continue to retain their powers to examine the passports of departing passengers if circumstances require.
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many children's passports have been issued within the last 12 months.  [85326]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90608w15.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 In the period 1 May 1998 to 30 April 1999, 889,180 passports were issued to applicants who were children under the age of 16.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90608w15.htm_wqn5"><B> Mr. Olner: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what steps have been taken in respect of the endorsement of children's passports with relevant court orders.  [85328]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90608w15.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 No steps have yet been taken in respect of the endorsement of children's passports. This important issue will be looked at by the Parent/Carer Child Abduction Co-ordinating Group of officials in the light of the arrangements for embarkation controls introduced in March 1998.
<P>

<a name="90608w15.htm_para4">However, there are a number of measures in place to ensure compliance with court orders in relation to the issuing of children's passports. Where it is known that a child is a ward of court, or subject to a prohibited steps order requiring the leave of the court before removal from the United Kingdom, passport facilities are not granted unless the court's permission is obtained.
<P>

<a name="90608w15.htm_para5">The Passport Agency also operates a scheme whereby a parent or other objector, where there is a court order in their favour, can ask the Agency not to issue a passport for a child. The Passport Agency ensures that the terms of the court order, about removal of the child from the jurisdiction, are met before issuing a passport. Where a child is already in possession of a valid passport, the court is able to order its surrender where there is in force an order prohibiting or otherwise restricting the removal of the child from the United Kingdom.
<P>

<a name="90608w15.htm_para6">A requirement for children to hold separate passports was introduced in October 1998, one of the main aims of this policy being to make child abduction more difficult.

 It was not the general practice of the Government to report to Parliament on the business of the K4 Committee, in view of that Committee's role as an interim, problem-solving body whose members were responsible to their respective Ministers.

<P>
<a name="90608w16.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 Birth certificates are routinely requested as an optional form of identification for recruitment and pension purposes.

<P>
<a name="90608w16.htm_spnew8"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 The information requested on the proportion of indictable offences being drug-related is not available for the country as a whole. As I stated in my reply on 27 April 1999, <i>Official Report,</i> column <i>110</i>, a report was published last year on preliminary research carried out on behalf of the Home Office by the University of Cambridge, which shed light on the links between drugs and crime. Further work is currently being conducted within this programme. The results will be published later this year. This additional work is intended to pave the way for a larger, regular programme.
<P>

<a name="90608w16.htm_para1">The research undertaken so far on drug testing of arrestees, based in five locations, indicates that over 60 per cent. of arrestees had recently taken at least one illegal drug prior to arrest. Cannabis was found most often (46 per cent. of cases); heroin/opiates (18 per cent.) and cocaine/crack (10 per cent.) featured quite prominently. These findings confirm the supposition that offenders tend to be heavy consumers of drugs.
<P>

<a name="90608w16.htm_para2">Nearly half the arrestees who reported taking drugs within the last year said that their drug misuse was connected with their offending. Among various factors, they emphasised the need for the money to buy drugs. The illegal income of arrestees who said that they had taken heroin and/or crack cocaine during the last three days was particularly high--within a range of &#163;10,000 to &#163;20,000 annually. This compared with &#163;4,000 for other arrestees. Illegal income mainly resulted from acquisitive crimes against property. An estimated 32 per cent. of all illegal income was spent on purchasing heroin and/or crack cocaine.
<P>

<a name="90608w16.htm_para3">Whilst this study considerably advances knowledge of drugs-crime links, it will always be difficult to calculate a single percentage figure reflecting precisely what proportion of all crime is drug-related.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what discussions he expects to take place in the Council of Ministers relating to judicial and police co-operation in respect of the use of joint teams of police officers to investigate fraudulent transactions within the United Kingdom arising from the receipt of funds from the European Union.  [85674]<P>

<a name="90608w17.htm_spnew5"><B> Kate Hoey: </B> 
 The draft Convention on mutual assistance on criminal matters between the Member States of the European Union includes a provision on joint investigation teams. This would provide for co-operation between the competent authorities of the Member States, including judicial, police and customs authorities, in the use of joint investigation teams to carry out criminal investigations in one or more Member States. The provision applies to criminal activities in general, and does not refer specifically to financial fraud affecting European Union funds. The detail of this provision is subject to further negotiation.

In 1999-2000 over &#163;2 million will be spent on organic R&D in England and Wales. Most of this is aimed at studying the economic and practical problems of converting to, and maintaining, organic systems. It thus supports the overall objective of expanding production.

 From 1 July, the National Assembly will assume a range of functions under both planning and environmental legislation.

The Assembly will also be responsible for guidance to local planning authorities and the Environment Agency, and will have power to issue directions to either. The Environment Agency will be under a statutory duty to consult the National Assembly before granting any authorisation to dispose of radioactive waste on or from a nuclear site in Wales.

 Our agenda for improving the health of the population recognises the need to focus attention on children's mental, physical and emotional health care needs. The school medical services will have a major role to play. We are introducing many important policy initiatives which will depend on effective health service input to schools and nurseries; these include the "Healthy Schools" initiative, "Sure Start" and "Quality Protects". Health authorities and other key players will, of course, be consulted.

 The Department does not specify what proportion of health authorities' funding allocations is to be spent on services to tackle osteoporosis. It is for health authorities, in partnership with National Health Service trusts, primary care groups, local authorities and local stakeholders, to determine how best to use their funds to meet national and local priorities for improving health and modernising services. The additional resources of at least 5.45 per cent. cash increase to all health authorities for 1999-2000 will help them in this.

 The forthcoming guidance to health authorities on the use of HIV and AIDS special allocations re-emphasises the need to match funding to local epidemiology. The guidance also highlights the latest supporting epidemiological data on HIV prevalence nationally, which reinforces the target groups identified in the current HIV Health promotion strategy, which are: gay men, bisexual men, and other men who have sex with men; men and women who travel to, or have family links with, high prevalence countries where the predominant mode of transmission is sex between men and women, currently in sub-Saharan Africa, people diagnosed with HIV and AIDS and injecting drug users.
<P>

<a name="90608w19.htm_para4">The Department is developing a new strategy on HIV/AIDS, which will also address the issue of targeting of HIV prevention activity towards the most vulnerable groups. Authorities are required to submit end-of-year reports on the use of HIV prevention funds in advance of their full annual AIDS (Control) Act Reports. The format of these reports is also due to be reviewed as part of the strategy development work.

 At 31 March 1998, there were 31,600 children and young people on child protection registers in England. At 31 March 1998, 8,000 (25 per cent. of those on the register) were looked after by local authorities. The purpose of the register is to provide a record of all children in the area who are considered to be suffering from or likely to suffer significant harm and who are currently the subject of an inter-agency protection plan.

 There are about 15,000 cases and 8,000 deaths each year from prostate cancer. Over the latest five-year period for which data is available (1987-92), incidence rates for prostate cancer for men of all ages increased by 25 per cent. in England.

An assessment was made by the working party of all licensed medicinal products using bovine material, including vaccines. No risk to human health has been established from use of bovine material in the manufacture of medicinal products, but as a precautionary measure, manufacturers were required to switch to use of bovine material sourced from outside the United Kingdom, and to comply with guidelines on the sourcing and processing of bovine material for use in the manufacture of medicinal products.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will list those purposes for which his Department and its executive agencies require a birth certificate to be furnished by (i) employees, contractors or those applying for employment of contracts, and (ii) other persons.  [85823]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90608w23.htm_spnew3"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 Each of the Chancellor's departments and agencies (HM Treasury, HM Customs and Excise, Inland Revenue, National Savings, Office for National Statistics, Royal Mint, Government Actuary, Debt Management Office and Valuation Office Agency) requires, as part of the Basic Check on new employees, some evidence of identity, age (for pensions purposes), and of the right to work in the UK. Such evidence depends upon whether or not the applicant is a UK or EC national but might be provided from a combination of different documents including a full British passport, P45, valid British driving licence, birth certificate, proof of residence at a given address, etc., or (where relevant) a full EC or other national passport; an identity card issued by an EC country; or other proof of immigration status and/or the right to work. Employees are also required to produce their birth certificate when undergoing Developed Vetting procedures (required when they will have constant access to Top Secret information and assets). Most departments also require contractors to make checks similar to the Basic Check on their employees. Birth certificates, as a means of identity, are not required to be furnished by other persons.

<P>
<UL>(2) what requirements to report to the Inland Revenue will be placed on companies utilising personal service companies <i>(a)</i> via a certified agency and <i>(b)</i> independent of a certified agency;  [86177]
<P>
(3) if the tax affairs of certified agencies for personal service companies will be handled through a central office;  [86179]
<P>
(4) when the Inland Revenue plans to withdraw Decision 4 of February 1992 which makes it unnecessary for an agency to operate PAYE when a limited company is contracting with an agency to provide personal services;  [86185]

(8) how the retained profits of personal service companies will be treated by the Inland Revenue after April 2000;  [86181]

<a name="90608w23.htm_spnew4"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 The rules will not be finalised until consultation on the proposals is complete. The Inland Revenue will meet with representative bodies in June and are considering written representations from individuals. I have asked the Inland Revenue to publish details of the new rules in as near final form as possible, along with comprehensive guidance on the application of the rules, at the earliest possible stage.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90608w23.htm_spnew5"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 The VAT position of non-certified agencies will not be affected by the Inland Revenue proposals. VAT will continue to be due on the full value of the supplies made by the agencies, including income tax and national insurance deducted by the client.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what plans he has to make regulations to amend the duty of marriage registrars to report suspicious marriages; and if he will make a statement.  [86031]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90608w24.htm_spnew0"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 The Immigration and Asylum Bill places a duty on registrars to report to the Home Office marriages which they reasonably suspect to be sham marriages, and for reports to be made in such form and manner, and within a time period as may be set out in regulations. The Bill provides for these regulations to be made by the Registrar General with the approval of the Chancellor of the Exchequer.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90608w24.htm_spnew2"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 The written answer of 11 December 1996 was given by the previous Government. It would be inappropriate for me to seek to explain the assumptions on which it was based, beyond what was said at the time by the Minister concerned.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90608w24.htm_wqn3"><B> Mr. Healey: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if a training allowance paid to a trainee, who is not receiving an unemployment-related benefit whilst on a European Social Fund course of training, is subject to <i>(a)</i> income tax and <i>(b)</i> national insurance contributions.  [85749]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90608w24.htm_spnew3"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 Where a training allowance funded by the European Social Fund is paid to a trainee who is not an employee the allowance will not normally be chargeable to income tax or National Insurance contributions.

 After discussing an initial draft with Ministers, the Chief Medical Officer and the Chief Scientific Adviser revised the report in order to ensure that it was more easily comprehensible for the lay reader and to include specific recommendations for action. The only amendment to the report made by the Biotechnology Presentation Group was to suggest an expansion of the heading before paragraph 41.

 The information is set out in the following tables. The data in respect of each Health and Social Services Board area have not specifically been broken down by exposure category as this would undermine the principle of preserving the anonymity of those who come forward for examination etc. It should also be noted that information broken down by Health and Social Services Board area relates to the Board in which diagnosis was first made. It does not necessarily reflect the Board of residence.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland if she will list the cumulative number of people who had been diagnosed HIV positive (i) broken down by probable means of transmission and (ii) in total in <i>(a)</i> Northern Ireland and <i>(b)</i> each health authority area of Northern Ireland, for each year from 1981 to 1998, and for 1999 to date.  [84816]<P>

<a name="90608w25.htm_spnew10"><B> Mr. McFall: </B> 
 The information is set out in the following tables. The data in respect of each Health and Social Services Board area have not specifically been broken down by exposure category as this would undermine the principle of preserving the anonymity of those who come forward for examination etc. It should also be noted that information broken down by health and Social Services Board area relates to the Board in which diagnosis was first made. It does not necessarily reflect the Board of residence.

 The Department of the Environment Water Service incinerator at Duncrue, Belfast, has a capacity of three tonnes dry solids per hour and is currently operating at this throughput. There is therefore no spare capacity in the incinerator to accommodate the incineration of meat and bone meal and tallow from the Over Thirty Months Scheme.

The attached table shows the number of patients within each Trust and Board area who were ready for discharge on that date, and where lack of funding for appropriate community care services was said to be the reason for their remaining in hospital.

 The Department's statisticians expect to publish revised figures for 1996-97 and new figures for 1997-98 as a single document in the late summer, probably early September.
It has taken longer than expected to complete extensive investigation and testing of the routines used in calculating take-up to ensure the quality of take-up estimates. This phase is now complete and production of estimates is under way.
We have taken the opportunity to look again at the possibility of publishing 1996-97 estimates of take-up for Job Seekers Allowance (income based JSA). Informed judgments on this and the other benefits are assisted by considering 1996-97 and 1997-98 data in parallel. 



<P>
<P><I>8 Jun 1999 : Column: 302</I><P>
Statisticians therefore judge that the early production of quality-assured estimates is best served by publishing 1996-97 and 1997-98 statistics together.
Statisticians advise that they expect the final estimate, of the average number of pensioners entitled to but not receiving Income Support in 1996-97, to be close to the provisional revised estimate of 400,000-700,000 given in DSS Press notice 98/300 of 11 December, a copy of which is in the Library.

<P>
<a name="90608w27.htm_spnew0"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 Section 19 of the Social Security Administration (Fraud) Act 1997 requires individuals to provide, as a qualifying condition of benefit, a National Insurance number in respect of themselves and their partner. Since 12 April, the extension of this provision to Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit has been piloted in seven local authorities. This provides an opportunity to test procedures and information about volumes and costs to prepare for national implementation on 6 September.
Early indications from the pilot are that virtually all claimants have been able, and are willing, to produce satisfactory evidence of their identity and proof of their National Insurance number. Consequently, there has been very little call on the Benefits Agency to trace or allocate National Insurance numbers. Of the few DCI1LA forms sent some relate to people from abroad but none have so far been sent in respect of children leaving care. There are no undue delays in DCI1LA forms being processed. However, this would have no adverse effect on claimants anyway as Section 19 will have been satisfied, and benefit paid, once sufficient information or evidence has been provided to enable a National Insurance number to be traced or allocated. Any individual who does not yet have a National Insurance number will be allocated one once he has furnished this information or evidence.
The procedures used by local authorities to establish identity will apply the same standards to those currently operated by the Benefits Agency. Where an individual is unable to provide satisfactory documentary evidence of

<P>
<P>
<a name="90608w27.htm_spnew1"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 The majority of Housing Benefit overpayments are recoverable, although it is for local authorities to choose whether to do so. The Department pays differing levels of direct subsidy to local authorities, from nil to 95 per cent., depending on the cause of the overpayment. If the error is due to this Department or to a Department for Education and Employment (DfEE) official error, full subsidy is paid on any unrecovered benefit. However, if the overpayment arises due to an official error by the local authority, nil subsidy is payable and the local authority has to bear the cost of any unrecovered benefit. In all other cases, including fraud, some subsidy is paid and the local authority can retain any monies recovered. With the exception of monies recovered in respect of this Department or DfEE official error, no adjustment to subsidy is made to reflect any amount recovered.
Different subsidy arrangements apply in England and Wales where Housing Benefit is paid to local authorities' own tenants, and are the responsibility of the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions and the Secretary of State for Wales.

 Since the start of the 1990-91 academic year, full-time students have not been entitled to benefits as a means of supporting themselves whilst studying. Financial support provided to the vast majority of full-time students by the taxpayer now comes through one source--the education system. Nevertheless, certain students in vulnerable groups, e.g. lone parents, disabled students etc., continue to have access to Income Support, income-based Jobseeker's Allowance and Housing Benefit on the same basis as before.
We do not hold sufficient information about students' housing and income circumstances to be able to estimate the costs of allowing all students to claim Housing Benefit and Income Support.

 Disabled people with a low income may be eligible to claim Income Support or income based Jobseeker's Allowance. The overall weekly amount of benefit payable will depend on the individual's circumstances, such as their age, the severity of their disability and other factors. If they satisfy all the conditions for entitlement to the full IS/JSA personal allowance, a single person aged 18 to 24 would currently receive a personal allowance of &#163;40.70. A single person aged 25 or over would receive a personal allowance of &#163;51.40. If they qualified for the disability premium they would receive a further &#163;21.90. The same rates of benefit apply to both Income Support and Jobseeker's Allowance.
<P>

<a name="90608w28.htm_para0">Our proposals on welfare reform for disabled people were set out in our consultation document "A new contract for welfare: SUPPORT FOR DISABLED PEOPLE" published last October. Under the proposals, a new Disability Income Guarantee will be introduced in April 2001 and will provide extra help and security for those with the highest care needs. It will provide help through the income-related benefits to severely disabled adults and families with disabled children who get the highest rate care component of Disability Living Allowance. The overall amount of benefit will depend on individual circumstances. The increase in support builds on the help that is already available because of disability. This extra support will be paid through a new higher rate of disability premium. At April 1998 rates, it will be worth an extra &#163;5.75 for a single adult or child, and &#163;8.30 for a couple.

 The Sudanese demand last August that we remove both the Ambassador and his Deputy from Khartoum made it impossible for us to sustain a fully operational Embassy. The Foreign Secretary therefore ordered the temporary withdrawal of all British staff from Khartoum on 27 August.
<P>

<a name="90608w28.htm_para1">Since that time, we have been in regular contact with the Sudanese with the objective of normalising relations. I am hopeful that we shall soon have British staff back in Khartoum on a permanent basis so that we can pursue the important work that is to be done there.

The impact of New Deal is being addressed through a comprehensive evaluation programme. All final reports from the evaluation will be published and copies placed in the Library.

<a name="90608w29.htm_spnew8"><B> Mr. Andrew Smith </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 25 May 1999]:</i> If on receiving an invitation to take part in the New Deal a young unemployed person terminates their Jobseeker's Allowance claim, the Employment Service will often not know whether it is because they have got a job or because they are refusing to participate.
<P>

<a name="90608w29.htm_para3">If sanctions for refusing to comply with New Deal requirements are taken as an indicator, the position in the last six months is as follows: over 7,000 young people had a benefit sanction imposed or were disallowed from claiming Jobseeker's Allowance as part of the New Deal. Of these, 530 were in Scotland, 800 in the Northern region, 1,200 in the North West, 1,120 in Yorkshire and the Humber, 340 in Wales, 910 in the West Midlands, 630 in the East Midlands and Eastern region, 350 in the South West and 1,310 in London and the South East.

 The number of pupils aged 5, 6 and 7 in classes over 30 have fallen by almost 130,000, from 485,000 in January 1998 to 356,000 in January 1999. In March, &#163;150 million of allocations were announced for 1999-2000, enabling over 4,000 extra teachers to be employed from September and over 1,000 additional classrooms to be built. As a result, fewer than 200,000 pupils will be in large infant classes from September 1999. The implementation of the class size pledge will mean that there will be a net gain of 12,000 places at popular schools, significantly enhancing parental preference.

These figures, which exclude entrants to Open University courses, indicate that recruitment has been steady over the period when the new tuition fee arrangements were introduced.
