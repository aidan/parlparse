 The Department collects anonymised statistical profiles of a one-third sample of all children who are looked after by local authorities in England, including those placed in children's homes. This information includes details of each child's placements, legal status, and reason for being looked after. A copy of the form on which these data are reported was published as an appendix to "Children Looked After by Local Authorities, Year Ending 31 March 1997, England", copies of which are available in the Library.

Funds are not allocated to health authorities for the general dental services where the vast majority of dentists work, instead dentists claim fees from a nationally set fee

There are some categories of dental service--personal dental services and salaried dentists--where health authorities must apply to the Department.

 In response to advice from the National Screening Committee (NSC), we advised the National Health Service in Executive Letter (97)12 that screening for prostate cancer should not be offered routinely, based on the existing evidence available. This remains the current policy. The NSC is actively keeping this question under review in the light of emerging evidence.

 The Chancellor announced in the July 1997 Budget a commitment to annual increases in road fuel duties averaging at least 6 per cent. in real terms. HM Customs and Excise estimates that this will raise an additional &#163;4.4 billion over the three financial years 1998-99 to 2000-01 compared with increasing fuel duties only in line with inflation. The White Paper announced our intention to legislate to enable local authorities to introduce road user charges and workplace parking levies in their areas, and to enable the Secretary of State to introduce charges on trunk roads and motorways. The revenue raised once the legislation is in place will depend on decisions by the authorities concerned as to whether or not to introduce the new charges, and if they do, at what level to do so.

<P>
<P>
<a name="81217w02.html_spnew10"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The UK is subject to a number of international obligations and conventions in respect of airport charges which embody the principle that charges are based on the cost of providing facilities and services, even if there is excess demand to use these. Landing fees account for only a small proportion of airline costs. Given the extent to which demand for slots exceeds supply at Heathrow and (to a lesser degree) Gatwick, it is logical to expect that a several fold increase would be necessary to reach the market clearing level. But the Government have not undertaken precise calculations.

 The Government have no plans to do so. The Boeing 747 is widely used for trans- continental scheduled air services, including for arrivals before 7 am. Most such services operate on the basis of a minimum daily frequency.

No formal papers have yet been submitted to the OSPAR Commission or the Heads of Delegation meeting on this issue.

 We plan to issue a consultation document on proposals for a licensing scheme for houses in multiple occupation (HMOs) early in the New Year. In that paper, we will also seek views on changes to Part XI of the Housing Act 1985, including the HMO definition. However, we would be reluctant to remove from the definition any premises which provide accommodation for people who have no other home. We would also need to consider the effect on the existing powers for local authorities to make HMO registration schemes containing special control provisions.

 As outlined in the response to the hon.

 There were five instances in 1998 where, in the opinion of the Health and Safety Executive Inspector, the release of genetically modified organisms was not being carried out as specified in the consent document regarding the measures taken to restrict pollination of adjacent plants. In each case the consent was varied to include additional precautions to minimise any possible risk to the environment. In all cases the risks arising from pollination of adjacent plants by the genetically modified oilseed rape were assessed to be low.

 Recognition of Canadian licences is made complicated by the fact that the 12 Canadian Provinces are separate licensing authorities and the licences generally do not strictly conform to the UK requirements. Nevertheless legislation to allow holders of Canadian car driving licences to exchange them for the British equivalent is in hand. The aim is to have the necessary arrangement in place early in 1999.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he intends to approve the revised master plan for the Northern Development Area, Newcastle, and its links to the strategic highway network before the outcome of the Tyneside multimodel transport study is made available.  [64438]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81217w05.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The Master Plan for the Northern Development Area has been referred to the Secretary of State in support of an application for outline planning permission and they will be considered together to determine the extent to which there might be conflict with national planning policy. Since the Tyneside multimodel transport study is not expected to be available for another 12 to 18 months, it would not seem reasonable to delay consideration of the application and Master Plan.

<P>
<P>
<a name="81217w05.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 We have no plans to establish such a commission. Our policy statement, "Modernising Planning", published in January, set out a series of proposals for improving the responsiveness and efficiency of the planning system. During this year, we have announced new proposals for a stronger regional planning framework, improved arrangements for delivering development plans and better procedures for handling appeals. As part of this initiative, we will be putting forward further detailed suggestions for improving the planning system during 1999.

Emissions of carbon dioxide are available for 1997 and show a 7.8 per cent. reduction from 1990 levels.

 In 1998/99, the standard spending assessment for personal social services in Worcestershire was &#163;66.9 million. An additional amount of &#163;3.2 million was also provided, amongst other special and specific grants, as a special transitional grant for community care clients. In 1999-2000, the standard spending assessment for personal social services is &#163;70.7 million. An additional programme of specific and special grant funding will also be provided in 1999-2000.

<P>
<a name="81217w07.html_wqn3"><B> Ms Moran: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if, following the consultation paper Limiting Fair Rent Increases, published in the summer, he intends to introduce measures to help tenants facing exceptionally high fair rent increases.  [64788]




<P>
<P><I>17 Dec 1998 : Column: 639</I><P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81217w07.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Armstrong: </B> 
 Tenants have been facing exceptionally high fair rent increases, following recent court cases. We received more than 500 responses to the consultation paper we issued in the summer which proposed limiting fair rent increases by applying a formula linked to the Retail Prices Index (RPI). There was overwhelming support for this from individual tenants and tenants' organisations. They considered our proposed limits were too high, however, and we have responded to this.
<P>

<a name="81217w07.html_para5">We propose, therefore, to go ahead and introduce new limits by making an Order under Section 31 of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985.
<P>

<a name="81217w07.html_para6">Rent officers and rent assessment committees will continue to determine fair rents as they do now. Where applications for re-registration are made to the rent officer after the Order comes into effect, however, fair rent increases will be limited to RPI + 7.5 per cent. for the first re-registration (rather than RPI + 10 per cent. as originally proposed) and RPI + 5 per cent. for subsequent re- registrations. This will ease the anxiety faced now by thousands of tenants, many of whom are elderly or on fixed incomes. It will give them certainty that their rents cannot be increased by more than these limits.
<P>

<a name="81217w07.html_para7">If there is no existing fair rent registration for the property, these limits will not apply. Nor will they apply if the rent officer or rent assessment committee considers that repairs or improvements carried out by the landlord have changed the condition of the property or common parts so much that the new rent should be at least 15 per cent. more than the existing registered rent. I believe that, in these limited circumstances only, it is fair for landlords to charge the full fair rent increase.
<P>

<a name="81217w07.html_para8">The new limits will apply to private tenants and secure tenants of registered social landlords who have a fair rent registered under the Rent (Agriculture) Act 1976 or the Rent Act 1977. They will not apply to rent increases for assured or assured shorthold tenancies under the Housing Act 1988. We have no plans to change the legislative framework for these tenancies.
<P>

<a name="81217w07.html_para9">The Order will be laid immediately after the Parliamentary Recess and will come into force shortly afterwards. My Department will make a further announcement when the Order is laid. We will issue a leaflet for landlords and tenants explaining in detail when the limits apply and how rent officers and rent assessment committees will calculate them, and details will appear on our internet site.

<P>
<P>
<a name="81217w07.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Armstrong: </B> 
 The Audit Commission has a key role to play in our agenda for modernising local government particularly in implementing our proposals for best value.
<P>

<a name="81217w07.html_para10">We are to give new audit and inspection powers to the Commission as part of our proposals for best value. The Local Government Bill, currently before Parliament, provides for this. The Commission will arrange for 



<P>
<P><I>17 Dec 1998 : Column: 640</I><P>
the annual audit of Local Performance Plans, and for the inspection of local authorities' activities in areas other than those which are the responsibility of the existing specialist Inspectorates such as OFSTED, SSI and HMIC. The Commission will, however, work closely with these Inspectorates, as they do now, to ensure that all the necessary skills are brought to bear in securing best value.
<P>

<a name="81217w07.html_para11">The Commission will also be given powers to recommend action by the Secretary of State where an authority fails to achieve best value.
<P>

<a name="81217w07.html_para12">To ensure that these new functions are fully co-ordinated with the work of the other Inspectorates, I confirm both our commitment to establish an Inspectorate Forum to discuss common inspection interests, and our intention to take a power in the Local Government Bill to enable arrangements to be made where necessary to ensure the smooth and efficient operation of the inspection process.
<P>

<a name="81217w07.html_para13">Our work on ensuring proper co-ordination between the Commission and other Inspectorates in relation to best value and local government will fulfil the principal recommendation of the Prior Options Study of the Financial Management and Policy Review (FMPR) of the Audit Commission, which I am publishing today. Copies of the Report have been placed in the House Library.
<P>

<a name="81217w07.html_para14">This study, concluding that the functions of the Commission are necessary and best carried out by that body, proposed a study linked with best value to put in place a framework of working arrangements to provide a means of resolving differences between the various audit and inspection bodies involved. Our proposals for the Forum and new power will ensure such arrangements are in place.
<P>

<a name="81217w07.html_para15">We will now also be proceeding with the second stage of the FMPR. This looks at the detailed organisation and procedures which will be best suited to the Commission as it continues its traditional audit functions and embraces its new roles within best value. To lead the Audit Commission through this period of significant change, my right hon. Friends the Deputy Prime Minister and the Secretaries of State for Health and for Wales, have today appointed Helena Shovelton as its new Chairman. It will be for her and her fellow Commissioners to ensure that the highest standards of professionalism and objectivity--for which the Commission has been known--are continued, not only in its traditional audit roles, but also in its new tasks in the best value framework.

<P>
<a name="81217w08.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 We have decided that the EC's recommendation for a standard design of blue parking badge for disabled people will be implemented in the UK. In reaching our decision we consulted with our statutory advisers, the Disabled Persons Transport Advisory Committee (DPTAC).
<P>

<a name="81217w08.html_para2">The aim of this Recommendation is, of course, to have a standard design of blue parking badge to replace the parking cards or badges which are currently on issue in Member States, and to ensure that there is reciprocity across Member States in recognising the new badge. The EC's intention is to have these arrangements introduced by 1 January 2000.
<P>

 We do not wish to see an expansion of Tacis activity until its effectiveness is improved. Tacis has been widely criticised for its slow procedures and cumbersome bureaucracy. We are in dialogue with the European Commission to address these problems, including the new Tacis Regulation which will be agreed during 1999.

 The Government are initiating a thorough review of the framework for overseeing developments in biotechnology, focusing particularly on the range of committees that have been established to provide the Government with expert advice and to regulate in this area. The Government are already engaged in a public consultation on developments in the biosciences which is due to report in Spring 1999. The review of the framework for overseeing developments in biotechnology, to be carried out by officials, will take place on the same timescale.
<P>

<a name="81217w09.html_para0">The Government believe that the protection of human health must be the first priority in regulating biotechnology. The impact on the environment and on biodiversity must also be thoroughly assessed, and the ethical issues raised by biotechnology fully taken into account. At the same time, the Government believe that this technology has the potential to offer enormous opportunities for improving the competitiveness of the economy and the quality of life in terms of health, agriculture, food and environmental protection, and that regulation should facilitate technological development by not imposing unjustified burdens on the biotechnology industry.
<P>

<a name="81217w09.html_para1">The Government seek to have in place a system that provides sound advice and proportionate regulation and is at the same time as simple and transparent as possible; that has the flexibility to respond to the fast moving developments in the technology and to public concerns; and that commands the respect of users and the public.

<P>
<P>
<a name="81217w09.html_wqn5"><B> Ann Keen: </B> 
To ask the Prime Minister what has been achieved by the G7/8 during the United Kingdom presidency this year.  [64793]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81217w09.html_spmin4"><B>The Prime Minister:</B> 
 During the United Kingdom's Presidency of the G7/8 this year, we have made progress on international action in a wide range of areas.
<P>

<a name="81217w09.html_para14">The successful G8 Summit in Birmingham in May marked a departure from tradition. Leaders were able to have a more businesslike and focused discussion in an informal atmosphere, and agreed a shorter, more action-oriented communique. The new format worked well and will be followed next year under the German Presidency.
<P>

<a name="81217w09.html_para15">One of the most challenging responsibilities was the turbulent world economy and the need to modernise international financial architecture. The Birmingham Summit endorsed G7 Finance Ministers' proposals on strengthening the global financial system. This was followed up by wider-ranging recommendations in statements issued by G7 leaders and by G7 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors on 30 October. This includes enhanced financing arrangements for dealing with financial market contagion: codes of good practice for greater transparency and openness in economic policy-making and in private sector financial institutions; better processes for monitoring and regulating global financial stability; and reforms to improve the effectiveness of the international financial institutions. We hope to see good progress in these areas by the IMF/World Bank meetings in April 1999.
<P>

<a name="81217w09.html_para16">The G8 has renewed, at Birmingham and since, its commitment to resisting protectionism and continuing trade liberalisation in the framework of the WTO.
<P>

<a name="81217w09.html_para17">At Birmingham, G8 leaders discussed national action plans which set out practical measures to promote employability. These were based on the seven principles agreed at the G8 conference on employability, growth and inclusion in February to generate new employment opportunities and tackle unemployment and exclusion.
<P>

<a name="81217w09.html_para18">Development was a key theme of our Presidency. At Birmingham, G8 members committed themselves to the internationally agreed targets for economic and social development. They recognised the importance of substantial levels of development assistance and undertook to work towards untying it wherever possible. They supported the WHO's roll-back malaria initiative, to which the UK has pledged &#163;60 million, and which is now being actively implemented by Mrs. Brundtland, the new Director General.
<P>

<a name="81217w09.html_para19">The UK was keen to use our Presidency to press ahead with debt relief for the heavily indebted poor countries (HIPC) initiative. The Birmingham Summit agreed that all eligible countries should be in the debt relief process by the year 2000, and should receive interim relief where necessary. The IMF/World Bank annual meetings in October took this forward by agreeing to extend the HIPC initiative to the end of 2000; to allow IMF post-conflict assistance programmes to count towards a country's track record under the HIPC initiative; to carry out a comprehensive review of the initiative as early as 1999; and to undertake further work on what the international 



<P>
<P><I>17 Dec 1998 : Column: 648</I><P>
financial institutions can do to help post-conflict countries. Following UK proposals, the World Bank has set up a trust fund to help meet the multilateral debt service obligations of Nicaragua and Honduras, and the Paris Club of official bilateral creditors has agreed a three-year moratorium for these countries.
<P>

<a name="81217w09.html_para20">Leaders set in train further G8 action against trans-national organised crime. They endorsed a 10-point plan to combat high-tech crime and agreed the need for further action against money laundering and financial crime, official corruption, trafficking in human beings and the illegal firearms trade. Since Birmingham, officials have taken this work forward and G8 Interior Ministers reviewed progress in a video conference on 15 December.
<P>

<a name="81217w09.html_para21">With the end of the century fast approaching, leaders recognised the challenge posed by the millennium bug. G8 officials have, since the Summit, co-ordinated G8 preparations and contingency planning, worked actively to raise global awareness, and started to identify vulnerable areas in which international organisations have a key role to play. The United Kingdom is contributing &#163;10 million to the World Bank trust fund to help developing countries.
<P>

<a name="81217w09.html_para22">After agreement at Birmingham for urgent work to take forward the Kyoto Protocol on climate change, G8 members all negotiated constructively at the conference of the parties in Buenos Aires in November and secured agreement on a workplan to bring into effect the international mechanisms such as emissions trading. G8 Foreign Ministers in May endorsed an action programme to protect the world's forests. In April, G8 Environment Ministers agreed a package of measures to fight against environmental crime.
<P>

<a name="81217w09.html_para23">In May, G8 Foreign Ministers agreed to focus G8 efforts against terrorism on terrorist financing, improving co-ordination on hostage-taking, and export controls on explosives and other terrorist-related items. A conference of senior officials on 7-8 December agreed shared principles and points for further action to tackle terrorist support mechanisms.
<P>

<a name="81217w09.html_para24">G8 leaders and Foreign Ministers discussed international action in various regions, for example the Middle East and Kosovo. After Birmingham condemned India's nuclear tests, G8 Foreign Ministers met in June and established a senior officials task force of G8 and other countries to take forward the international response to the tests in India and Pakistan.
<P>

<a name="81217w09.html_para25">We are working closely with the German government on the hand over to their G7/8 Presidency on 1 January 1999 and are preparing for the next G8 Summit in Holn on 18-20 June 1999.

<a name="81217w10.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. McFall: </B> 
 Present expenditure plans do not include provision for the introduction of the Sure Start programme in Northern Ireland. However, the Government are already doing a great deal in Northern Ireland to develop improved support systems for families with young children and a consultation exercise early next year on the Northern Ireland Childcare Strategy will seek views from a wide range of interests about how programmes for families with young children might best be further developed here. It will then be for the Northern Ireland Assembly to decide on the way forward.

 The IT system referred to was selected in July 1988 following a detailed requirements survey. No off-the-shelf system was available which could meet the requirement and the rigorous security standards which were necessary. The system was abandoned in November 1996 because delays in implementing the contract and rapid changes in IT technology meant that it no longer met either the developing business needs of the Department or current health and safety standards.

We are also planning to second a Colonel to The Geneva International Centre for Humanitarian Demining next year and are examining the possibility of providing personnel to support a further five UN sponsored mine programmes world-wide. My Department continues to explore areas, in conjunction with the FCO and DFID, where the UK Armed Forces' expertise can make a meaningful contribution to humanitarian demining activity.

<a name="81217w12.html_para0">CR was authorised to be held in readiness for use in Northern Ireland in October 1973. Its possible use has also been authorised on a small number of occasions where the armed forces have responded to a request for assistance for law enforcement purposes from the civil power. CR is only authorised as a non-lethal self-defence option where the risk to the safety of military personnel is considered particularly high.

<a name="81217w12.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Nick Brown: </B> 
 Local operating authorities, including the Environment Agency, are responsible for flood defence. The Agency is responsible for flood warning systems and has published an Action Plan for implementing the recommendations of the independent review of last Easter's flooding.

<P>
<P>
<a name="81217w12.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 It is the responsibility of local operating authorities (primarily the Environment Agency (EA) and local authorities) to identify the need for flood defence measures and to decide which projects should be promoted. Therefore the Government cannot direct authorities to protect farm land. However the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions has notified local authorities that the flood defence element of their Standard Spending Assessments for 1999-2000 will be 6.3 per cent. higher than actual expenditure (on EA levies, Internal Drainage Board special levies and own revenue expenditure) in 1998-99. This Department will shortly announce funding for the Environment Agency's core capital programme for 1999-2000 in the South West; in addition the South West will benefit from further funding for flood warning improvements being provided to the Agency on a national basis.

 Since 1991, samples of cows' milk have been taken from dairy farms in the Bolsover and Staveley areas for analysis for dioxins. The results are routinely published and show that the levels of dioxins in cows' milk from both areas are now similar to those found in other parts of the UK. For this reason, the Ministry has no plans to carry out further sampling.

 I am working hard to create a level playing field for standards across the European Union.

 My Department announced on 1 December that Total Income from Farming is forecast to be 33 per cent. lower in 1998 compared to 1997. The main reason for the fall in prices in 1998 has been the oversupply of commodity markets, although the strength of the "green pound" has also been a factor.

<a name="81217w13.html_para1">For the future, Government and all those associated with food production in the UK need to work together towards a sustainable, competitive and profitable industry and an attractive and viable countryside.

 Local authorities are generally responsible for enforcing the Beef Bones Regulations 1997 and I am not aware that any prosecutions have been completed though at least three are in progress. I would expect prosecutions to be taken if other enforcement action fails. I understand that such action has included reminding traders that the retail sale of bone-in beef is not permitted, the issuing of warnings and the formal cautioning of traders who admit to retailing bone-in beef. Details of prosecutions brought to my Department's attention are included in the BSE Enforcement Bulletin which is published monthly by my Department.

<P>
<a name="81217w14.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 World Trade Organisation negotiations on agriculture are due to start in January 2000. We expect them to cover the same broad framework as the last negotiations (in the Uruguay Round), focusing on further improvements in import access for agricultural products; further cuts in subsidised exports; and reductions in domestic support to agriculture. We want these negotiations to be part of a comprehensive, time-limited round of trade liberalisation negotiations.
<P>

<a name="81217w14.html_para0">The European Commission will participate in the negotiations on behalf of the EU. We will therefore work to ensure that UK interests are properly taken into account. The negotiations will be an important opportunity for further liberalisation of agricultural trade in line with the UK's objectives on reform of the CAP. These are to phase out productions support over a period in order to reduce substantially the costs of the CAP to consumers and taxpayers, to encourage the development of a viable and sustainable farming industry which is capable of competing without ongoing production support, and to conserve and enhance the rural environment and promote the rural economy through targeted measures.

<P>

<a name="81217w14.html_para3">Neither CEFAS nor ICES provides a forecast of stock size or catches over the next few years.

 The consultation paper on the regulation of early education and day care, issued earlier this year by the Department of Health and the Department for Education and Employment, asked whether there should be regulation of day care for children over 8-years-old and, if so, in what form. The Government are considering the responses and will announce their intentions in due course, mindful of the need to ensure children in day care are suitably protected from harm. The cost of any extension to current arrangements will be considered along with all other factors.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment by what means the National Child Care Strategy will be targeted, with particular reference to the City of Coventry.  [63503]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81217w15.html_spnew11"><B> Ms Hodge </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 14 December 1998]:</i> To date, a total of &#163;470 million has been committed to the National Child Care Strategy in England over five years. Planning and implementation of the Strategy in England is being taken forward at local level by the new Early Years Development and Child Care Partnerships which have been set up in each local authority area.
<P>

<a name="81217w15.html_para3">Key elements of funding are as follows:
<P>

<a name="81217w15.html_para4">In 1998-99, &#163;12 million has been allocated to Partnerships to carry out local child care audits, consult on demand and draw up plans for the delivery of increased provision next year. This has been allocated on the basis of the number of 0-14 year olds in each Partnership area. The City of Coventry allocation for this work is &#163;81,000. Over the same period, some &#163;22.1 million has been made available to fund the Out of School Child Care Initiative (OSCI), of which &#163;378,000 has been allocated to Coventry and Warwickshire through the local Training and Enterprise Council. In addition, Coventry Local Education Authority has received &#163;87,000 this year through Nursery Education Grant.
<P>

<a name="81217w15.html_para5">For 1999-2000, my Department has allocated &#163;44 million to the Partnerships for child care activities, which includes &#163;6.7 million to safeguard existing good quality services in disadvantaged areas, which are at risk of closure. These funds have again been allocated on the basis of the number of 0-14 year olds in each area, adjusted to take account of the levels of deprivation in each area as reflected by the proportion of children receiving free school meals. For 1999-2000, the City of Coventry Partnership has been allocated a total of 



<P>
<P><I>17 Dec 1998 : Column: 670</I><P>
&#163;309,700. Nursery Education Grant will again be available to support additional places for 4 year olds, and we shall be announcing support for 3 year olds shortly. Next year's Revenue Support Grant allocation also includes substantial funds to support additional registration and inspection of child care services and the requirement to set up a local Children's Information Service in each Partnership area. A further &#163;7 million is also being made available to TECs next year for training for child care workers: &#163;776,500 of this has been allocated to the West Midlands, but a breakdown at local level is not yet available.
<P>

<a name="81217w15.html_para6">Coventry's education Standard Spending Assessment (SSA) represents an increase of &#163;6.1 million, or 4.1 per cent. over the comparable figure for 1998-99. Part of this may be used to support the National Child Care Strategy.
<P>

<a name="81217w15.html_para7">In addition there is a range of other potential sources of funding which Early Years Development and Child Care Partnerships, local authorities, individuals and other groups can bid for to support National Child Care Strategy objectives. This includes the New Opportunities Fund, which will allocate some &#163;220 million across the UK by 2003 to create new out of school child care places, the Single Regeneration Budget and the European Social Fund.

In that statement I indicated that we proposed two pay ranges for classroom teachers, separated by a new performance threshold. Up to the threshold, we would expect teachers normally to progress through annual salary increments, as now. To cross the threshold, we would expect teachers to demonstrate high and sustained levels of achievement and commitment. Further steps on the higher pay scale would be based on appraisal of performance.

<a name="81217w16.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Willis: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment how much of the additional expenditure for education announced in the July Comprehensive Spending Review for England has already been allocated to <i>(a)</i> local authority expenditure, <i>(b)</i> class size reduction, <i>(c)</i> school buildings and repairs, <i>(d)</i> standards fund grants, <i>(e)</i> early years education, <i>(f)</i> further education, <i>(g)</i> higher education and <i>(h)</i> other spending by his Department; and how much has been allocated to no specific purposes as yet.

 <i>(a)</i> The additional provision for local authority Education Standard Spending over the three years 1999-2000 to 2001-02 is &#163;6,831 million.
<P>

<a name="81217w16.html_para3"><i>(b)</i> The additional provision for class size reduction over the three years is &#163;320 million. This is in addition to &#163;300 million previously committed to the programme.

This is in addition to the extra &#163;1.1 billion of capital investment we are making available through the New Deal for Schools. Taken with existing provision this means that there will be a &#163;5.4 billion investment programme in school buildings over the period.
<P>

<a name="81217w16.html_para5"><i>(d)</i> The Standards Fund programme will be over &#163;900 million in 1999-2000. This includes the DfEE grant and the local education authority contribution.

<P>
<a name="81217w17.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. MacShane: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what percentage of GNP was spent on <i>(a)</i> education and <i>(b)</i> secondary schools in (i) Germany, (ii) France, (iii) the Netherlands, (iv) Sweden, (v) Switzerland, (vi) the US and (vii) the UK in each year since 1968.  [62085]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81217w17.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Mudie: </B> 
 Information on expenditure on all levels of education as a percentage of GDP has, for the countries mentioned, been collected by the OECD for the period 1970 to 1995 (the latest year for which such collated data are available). Information about secondary school expenditure has not been collected by the OECD separately from other forms of educational expenditure.
<P>

<a name="81217w17.html_para0">This information on all educational expenditure is given in the table. Any comparisons should be cautious, since the expenditure definitions used are not always fully comparable, (particularly in their treatment of research and development expenditure) and definitions, as indicated in the table, have sometimes changed over time. In addition, the special OECD definitions mean that the OECD figures for the UK may differ from those published in "Public Expenditure Statistical Analyses".
<P>

<a name="81217w17.html_para1">Public expenditure on education as a proportion of GDP fell between 1994-95 and 1997-98. However, as a result of the investment in education announced in the Comprehensive Spending Review, expenditure on education as a proportion of GDP will rise from 4.6 per cent. in 1998-99 to 5.0 per cent. in 2001-02.

<a name="81217w18.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Banks: </B> 
 Since 1 May 1997, I have received about 80 letters about sport in schools and the physical education National Curriculum. These have come from professional organisations such as the CCPR and BAALPE, University lecturers, head teachers and members of the public. Almost all of these have been about the importance of the teaching of physical education and sport in schools and support my view that physical education and sport is an essential part of youth development. While fully supporting the current emphasis on numeracy and literacy, I know how important sport and PE are; not only as subjects in their own right, but as having a positive impact on cognitive development and on classroom and academic performance. That is why I am delighted that sport and PE still have to be taught in primary schools, while allowing flexibility by relaxing the detailed programmes of study. We are working closely with the Department for Education and Employment to ensure that PE and sport remain an important part of the curriculum.
<P>

<a name="81217w18.html_para7">There are of course a number of initiatives underway to promote sport in schools, many of which are co-ordinated by the English Sports Council (ESC) under its National Junior Sports Programme (NJSP).

It is intended to reinforce and build on good practice, to support teachers and to provide an important profile for the work they are doing. ESC initiatives include the Sportsmark award scheme, the Sporting Ambassadors scheme, the development of an Activity award for primary schools and proposals for Community Sports Co-ordinators.

 I am arranging for the working group's report to be placed in the Libraries of both Houses of Parliament and published on both my Department's web site and that of the British Library.
<P>

<a name="81217w19.html_para0">The report recommends that there should be a single national published archive of non-print material.

<a name="81217w19.html_para2">It concludes that it would not be feasible to include on-line publications and databases, although it suggests that provision be made to bring them into a statutory system in the future, subject to full consideration and consultation in each case.
<P>

<a name="81217w19.html_para3">For print publications, the report recommends that while the six existing legal deposit libraries be retained, in the light of the increasing move towards devolution and regional Government, more work should be done to reduce the number of copies claimed by the libraries, especially in the area of local magazines and periodicals. I regard this as important.
<P>

<a name="81217w19.html_para4">On the issue of improved access to deposited material in Northern Ireland, the report suggests that if an acceptable way can be found to allow secure networking of deposited electronic material, an access point in Northern Ireland could be included in a secure network.
<P>

<a name="81217w19.html_para5">Because the Government believe it is important to plug the growing gap in the national published archive, I have asked Sir Anthony Kenny to draw up, through a group of technical experts from the legal deposit libraries and 



<P>
<P><I>17 Dec 1998 : Column: 682</I><P>
publishers, detailed guidelines for a voluntary code of practice. I have asked Sir Anthony to examine the scope for this to include a basis for the secure ring-fenced networking of CD-roms between the deposit libraries in a way that will satisfy the publishers that there would be no undue risk for licence holders.
<P>

<a name="81217w19.html_para6">However, I agree with the report's conclusion that a voluntary code will not be viable in the longer term and I believe the report makes a convincing case for moving towards legislation for the legal deposit of non-print publications on the basis of minimum burden on publishers and minimum loss of sales. It will be necessary to do further work on definitions and the impact on business and I have asked Sir Anthony Kenny to take this forward through the medium of the technical group of library and publishing experts. Once that is done, we shall move towards legislation.

 There is no national classification of a step-down bed. Information on numbers of rehabilitation medicine beds in the seven years to 31 March 1997 is shown in Table 1. A more detailed bed classification system was introduced in 1997-98, and information on numbers of rehabilitation, convalescent and geriatric orthopaedic rehabilitation beds for the year ending 31 March 1998 is shown in Table 2.

Following the usual consultation with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities over the proposals for the distribution of Aggregate External Finance (AEF), I intend to lay the necessary Local Government Finance (Scotland) Order in early February 1999 for approval by this House. I will ensure that the details of my proposals, which will be issued as a Circular to all Scottish local authorities, will be made available in the House Library at the same time as my announcement.

<a name="81217w20.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. McAllion: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland what conclusions he has reached on the Tay River Protection Order; and if he will make a statement.  [64791]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81217w20.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Macdonald: </B> 
 On 5 June the Government announced in the Edinburgh Gazette its intention to revoke the Tay Protection Order made under the Freshwater and Salmon Fisheries (Scotland) Act 1976 and invited comments. This followed concerns that access for public angling had been withdrawn in a number of areas.
<P>

<a name="81217w20.html_para0">Seven hundred and seventy-four responses were received. 766 supported retention of the Order. Eight advocated revocation. A full report on the operation of the Order has since been submitted on behalf of the new Protection Order Liaison Committee. A copy of that report, which has been endorsed by 18 groups associated with angling and riparian ownership in the area, will be placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="81217w20.html_para1">My noble Friend Lord Sewel, the Minister with responsibility for Fisheries in Scotland, has considered the comments received and the contents of the report very carefully. He has noted with satisfaction that as a result of the efforts of the Committee the access lost has been reinstated and furthermore that 86 per cent. of the river and loch are now open to public access compared with the 81 per cent. promised at the time the Order was originally approved. My noble Friend also welcomes the steps announced to ensure the effectiveness of the future operation and monitoring of the Order.
<P>

<a name="81217w20.html_para2">In the light of the remedial action taken to improve and guarantee public access to angling and the generally enhanced arrangements for its operation, my noble Friend has decided that the Order should be retained. However, close monitoring will continue.

<P>
<P>
<a name="81217w20.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Galbraith: </B> 
 The Government have already taken a number of measures to enhance our response to drug misuse, including heroin.
<P>

<a name="81217w20.html_para3">In October my hon. Friend the Minister for Home Affairs and Devolution and I announced an additional &#163;5 million package of measures between now and March 2000. This included &#163;2 million backing for new initiatives to cut drug crime, such as drug treatment and testing orders and more intensive probation; a &#163;2 million boost to NHS drug treatment funding; a multi-agency blitz to reclaim communities in the grip of drug dealers; and the establishment of a new national drug prevention team to work with Drug Action Teams. Specifically on heroin, we have made &#163;300,000 available to the Health Education Board for Scotland for new work to combat the threat to young people from cheap heroin.
<P>

<a name="81217w20.html_para4">In addition, we expect to issue an enhanced drug strategy framework for Scotland in the first part of 1999 and this will take account of the current concerns about increased heroin misuse.

<P>
<P>
<a name="81217w20.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Galbraith: </B> 
 Additional resources of &#163;300,000 have already been made available to the Health Education Board for Scotland for new work to combat the threat to young people from heroin. That work is now at an advanced stage and a decision will be taken shortly on how and when it can be taken forward.

<P>
<P>
<a name="81217w20.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. McLeish: </B> 
 The Government's strategy for tackling drug misuse in Scotland focuses on the key areas of education, treatment and enforcement. Police operations like Operation Foil carried out recently by Lothian and Borders Police against heroin use are a vital contribution to the Government's overall drugs strategy.
<P>
<P>
<a name="81217w20.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Kirkwood: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland what assessment he has made of the level of resources available to the police in the Lothian and Borders Police Board area to combat heroin abuse.  [64317]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81217w20.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. McLeish: </B> 
 The level of resources deployed by the Lothian and Borders Police on drugs issues is an operational matter for the Chief Constable within the funding level set by the Police Board. During the period 1996-97 to 1998-99 Lothian and Borders Police GAE funding has increased by 9.2 per cent. This has enabled the Force to sustain high profile operations such as the recent highly successful Operation Foil directed against heroin use.

<P>
<P>
<a name="81217w20.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. McLeish: </B> 
 It is not a function of my right hon. Friend to give guidance to the courts on sentencing. The Appeal Court gives guidance to other courts through its appeal decisions, and in disposing of appeals it has the power under Section 118 of the Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995 to pronounce an opinion on the sentence which is appropriate in any similar case. The courts can and do make use of a wide range of penalties provided for drugs offenders, depending on the varying circumstances of each case. Heroin is a Class A drug in terms of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 and as such its possession and supply are subject to tough maximum penalties, including life imprisonment in the case of supply. In the case of drug traffickers there is a mandatory <i>minimum</i> sentence of seven years on conviction of a third offence.

<P>
<P>
<a name="81217w21.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Macdonald: </B> 
 The statutory responsibility for dealing with homelessness in any area and for deciding whether any emergency shelters are required over the Christmas period or at other times of year rests with the relevant local authorities. The Scottish Office provides them with financial support that can be used for such purposes.
<P>

<a name="81217w21.html_para0">The Rough Sleepers Initiative was established by The Scottish Office to provide financial assistance to local authorities to help them develop accommodation and services for rough sleepers. This can include assistance, where appropriate, for emergency shelters and other direct access accommodation. &#163;16m was allocated for this Initiative over the 3 years from 1997-98 to 1999-2000 and I recently announced additional funding of &#163;14m to allow the Initiative to be extended to 2002. Heriot Watt and Stirling universities have been commissioned by the Department to undertake a preliminary evaluation of the Rough Sleepers Initiative and are due to report by September 1999.

 The legal position that compensation is not payable in such cases is well established but, in view of the difficulties that the closures will cause in this particular instance, the option of providing a temporarily enhanced ferry service is being considered.

<P>
<a name="81217w23.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Ian McCartney: </B> 
 The Redundancy Payments Service has considerably simplified the process of handling claims with a new computer system. This has enabled claims to be sent direct to the Service rather than through insolvency practitioners, cutting out delays and also saving about &#163;1 million a year in administrative expenditure, while allowing for a small increase in the number of staff handling claims. It has also enabled claims for different types of payment to be combined, which were previously made separately. Improvements to the new system are still being made in the light of subsequent operational experience. An officer has also been nominated in each office to ensure that complaints from customers are addressed quickly and any necessary lessons learned. Their direct telephone numbers will be published in the Service's Charter leaflet in the New Year and issued with every redundancy claim form.

<a name="81217w23.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 Responsibility for ensuring safety at nuclear installations, and for dealing with any emergencies which might arise at those installations, rests with the state in which the installation is situated. At the international level, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in Vienna and the Nuclear Energy Agency in Paris are acting as co-ordinators of millennium information for the nuclear sector worldwide, and have already held sessions on millennium preparedness, with further major workshops planned. Other nuclear organisations are contributing as appropriate.

<a name="81217w23.html_para7">In multilateral and bilateral contacts with overseas nuclear safety regulatory authorities, the United Kingdom's Health and Safety Executive--which for some years has been overseeing the preparations of the UK's nuclear installations for the millennium--has been encouraging other states to take appropriate action to address this issue. Mr. Laurence Williams, the UK's Chief Inspector of Nuclear Installations, presented a well received paper on millennium preparedness to the IAEA Senior Regulator's meeting in Vienna in September 1998. A copy of that paper will be placed in the Library of the House shortly.

 All UK nuclear operators have initiated major programmes of work to identify and address potential problems associated with the century date change issue. Those aspects of these programmes that address potential safety concerns are being monitored closely by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE). The HSE is satisfied with the actions being taken. If the HSE were not satisfied it would take robust enforcement action if it were appropriate, but if the licencees continue to make good progress in tackling the issue, the HSE anticipate this will not be necessary.
<P>

<a name="81217w23.html_para9">Operators anticipate that all essential work will be completed by mid-1999. This includes a re-testing of systems to provide confirmation that remedial action taken to rectify any safety problems that are identified has been effective. Contingency plans and business continuity plans will also be in place for the critical dates as a precaution against unforeseen threats to safety. Contingency plans against the possibility of a nuclear emergency are maintained and available for activation at any time.

However, the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council has provided the following information based on an evaluation, last year, of the research students supported by the Council and by the former Science and Engineering Research Council and whose funding expired in the period between October 1991 and 1996. 53 students are known to have obtained PhDs in nuclear physics; of those 9 per cent. took posts overseas in their first jobs.

There is no internationally-agreed definition of "small arms". It is possible that some weapons controlled under other ratings could be called small arms; for instance, a 12-bore shotgun with a calibre greater than 12.7mm would be controlled under entry ML2.<P>

Certain Open General Export Licences cover the return to specified countries of weapons controlled under entries ML1 and PL5018, subject to the conditions of the licence in each case: the Open General Export Licence (Export After Repair: Military Goods) and the Open General Export Licence (Export After Exhibition: Military Goods). In addition, the Open General Export Licence (Accompanied Personal Effects: Sporting Firearms) permits temporary exports for sporting or recreational purposes to Tanzania and Uganda. Copies of all Open General Export Licences valid at any time during the period are in the Library of the House.<P>

 As a self-financing public corporation the Post Office is outside my Departmental Expenditure Limit. Capital expenditure by the PO contributes to Annually Managed Expenditure. The impact on the Public Sector Net Cash Requirement is broadly equivalent to the Post Office's External Finance Requirement, which will depend on a number of factors including the level of profits in future years and any borrowing. As I announced on 7 December 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 21-39, an External Financing Requirement (EFR) of minus &#163;207 million has been set for 1999-2000 and in following years the EFR will be equivalent to 40 per cent. of post tax profits.

 Under the Post Office Act 1969 the Post Office can make acquisitions, including overseas acquisitions, that are "requisite, advantageous or convenient" for the purpose of its business. The increase in retained net profits I announced on 7 December 1998, <i>Official Report,</i> columns <i>21-24</i>, will enable the Post Office to finance an increased level of investment. However the Government recognise that larger growth, including acquisitions and joint ventures, may require prudent borrowing.

 The Government recognise the enormous potential of the UK environmental industry to develop new green technologies which both provide solutions to environmental problems and boost the UK economy. Support in promoting the activities of this sector is provided through a number of activities.
<P>

<a name="81217w26.html_para0">DTI plays an important role in supporting the science and engineering base and business to develop and exploit sustainable technologies and processes. Science and engineering research received a major boost of &#163;1.1 billion as a result of the Comprehensive Spending Review.
<P>

<a name="81217w26.html_para1">The Foresight Steering Group has identified sustainable technologies as a top priority. Specific initiatives under the Foresight programme include the Vehicle Link programme (which has recently received a further &#163;5 million) and sustainable technologies for a cleaner world. Foresight is currently being developed to make it more effective and will be underpinned by the theme of sustainable development. Earlier this month eighteen projects received Foresight LINK Awards, which bring together business and the science base to work in areas identified by the Foresight programme as important to the future prosperity and quality of life of the UK.
<P>

<a name="81217w26.html_para2">The Cleaner Vehicles Task Force was launched last year to provide a partnership between government, manufacturers, users and pressure groups to identify practical measures to reduce the environmental impact of vehicles.
<P>

<a name="81217w26.html_para3">The LINK scheme also plays an important part in developing and transferring knowledge on new sustainable technologies. Research ranges from the development of biotechnologies to remove pollutants from streams and soils, to using earth observation satellites for monitoring the natural environment.
<P>

<a name="81217w26.html_para4">The renewables industry received a boost last September with the announcement of the largest ever obligation on the Public Electricity Suppliers to secure 1177 MW of new electricity generating capacity from renewable sources of energy.
<P>

<a name="81217w26.html_para5">The Environment Technology Best Practice Programme (ETBPP) produces high quality technical advice in relation to specific industrial sectors including examples of businesses which have established good practice procedures and made use of new technologies.

The Government's consultation document "Sustainable Business" published in June, set out some ideas on how this can be best achieved. The responses from business--over 500 were received--were generally positive, and will be reflected in our new national Sustainable Development Strategy which is due to be published early in the New Year.

[63479]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81217w26.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Mandelson: </B> 
 The Government of Wales Act 1998 provided for a Transfer of Functions Order to be made to transfer Ministerial functions to the National Assembly for Wales. This Order was published in draft for public consultation on 12 November. Work is continuing within Government to finalise the text of the Order and until the content of the Order has been finalised, it is not possible to state with certainty what functions will transfer. It is therefore too early to say to what extent programme expenditure which is currently administered by my Department may relate to functions which will transfer to the National Assembly for Wales. Work is taking place to establish the extent of any such expenditure and to assess the need for any consequential transfer of funds to the Assembly.
<P>

<a name="81217w26.html_para8">My Department does not make forecasts of how much of its expenditure will be incurred in each country of the United Kingdom, although such information is published on a retrospective basis in the Public Expenditure Statistical Analyses (PESA).

<P>
<P>
<a name="81217w26.html_spnew7"><B> Dr. Howells </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 14 December 1998]:</i> The Trade Marks Act 1994 contains provisions to protect against the fraudulent use of a registered trade mark. The common law tort of passing-off protects against false representation, where a company attempts to take unfair advantage or their action is detrimental to reputation of another.
<P>

<a name="81217w26.html_para9">These provisions can be applied to fraudulent use of domain names. In a recent case (British Telecommunications Plc et al. <i>v</i>.

<a name="81217w27.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 The Benefit Integrity Project will be replaced by a new, even-handed system of review, sensitive to people's circumstances and fair because it will provide for awards to be increased as well as decreased in line with entitlement. We will introduce the new process as soon as possible and aim to have it in place by April 1999 but our primary concern is to get it right rather than to introduce it quickly. We are discussing the way forward with the Disability Benefits Forum.

 If the supplier were to process anticipated volumes, the NIRS2 budget for the financial year to 1 April 1999 would be &#163;5.301 million.

 The original contract allowed for the delivery of the National Insurance Recording System over three releases between February 1997 and April 1999.

<P>
<P>
<a name="81217w28.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 The Contributions Agency National Insurance Recording System (NIRS2) is designed to hold over 65 million individual contribution records, calculate contributory benefits, provide data to many other Government Agencies. It also pays age-related contribution rebates to Occupational and Personal Pension Schemes in respect of individual scheme members and collects National Insurance Contributions from both the employed and the self-employed. To date, over &#163;300 million has been collected from the self-employed through the monthly direct debit facility and the quarterly collection method.

<a name="81217w28.html_para0">Since its introduction on the 13 July 1998, the NIRS2 system has never become inoperable. Some facilities within the system have not yet been fully implemented.

[64565]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81217w28.html_spnew4"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 We are aware that, under existing rules, if money is owed from an insolvent employer, full benefit cannot always be paid immediately to ex-employees claiming Jobseeker's Allowance or Income Support, although payments can be made to avoid hardship.

<P>
<P>
<a name="81217w28.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 There are currently 1,038,729 amendments as at the 6 December requiring input to the Contributions Agency National Insurance Recording System (NIRS2). Although an exact figure is not known, the number of cases affected by the delayed input of these amendments is a very small percentage of the overall

<P>

<a name="81217w28.html_para3">If an individual benefit claim is affected, compensation will be considered under the normal rules of the Departmental Compensation Scheme.

<P>
<P>
<a name="81217w28.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 The estimated number of applications for maternity benefit from the self-employed, which are outstanding for November 1998, is 830. This is 60 more than the estimated figure for November 1997. The number that have been paid late because of delays attributable to the NIRS2 system is not available as information for the reason for any delay in payment is not recorded.

 The Contributions Agency is able to use the new National Insurance Recording system (NIRS2) to answer all inquiries concerning information held on individual National Insurance Accounts.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security if he will amend the advice given to doctors on when to make a report on form DS1500 so that they can take the initiative in informing patients or their representatives of the special benefit rules for the terminally ill.  [64305]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81217w29.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 Each pad of DS1500 forms already contains a set of guidance notes for the doctors who will complete the forms. This sets out the purpose of the form and the circumstances in which it should be used. In addition, a Bulletin was issued by the Department's Chief Medical Adviser in March 1997 to all general practitioners which explained the special rules for Disability Living Allowance for those people suffering from a terminal illness. This also explained the purpose of this form and the general practitioner's role in the process.
<P>

<a name="81217w29.html_para0">Consequently, we believe that sufficient guidance is already available to enable doctors to fulfil their part in this important benefit for a particularly vulnerable group of claimants.

 Since 3 April 1982 the UK has maintained a national arms embargo on Argentina. It has been the policy of the UK to deny all applications for licences to export goods specified in Part III of Schedule I to the Export of Goods (Control) Order 1994, commonly

<P>

<a name="81217w30.html_para2">Licences will only be granted for exports that we are satisfied would not, now or in the foreseeable future, put at risk the security of our Overseas Territories in the South Atlantic or our forces operating there. We will assess all applications for licences to export goods to Argentina on a case-by-case basis against our national export licensing criteria and those in the EU Code of Conduct on Arms Exports. This will also be the case with applications for advance approvals for promotion prior to formal application for an export licence.

<a name="81217w30.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Fatchett: </B> 
 We are concerned about the environmental threat from the nuclear waste from nuclear powered vessels in North West Russia, and welcomes all initiatives which address the issue. The size of the problem is such that a multilateral approach offers the best chance of making an impact. The Government are working with international partners on tackling the problem, for example helping the Russian nuclear regulators with technical expertise to license waste storage casks. We also organised a seminar on 3 December to bring together all the interested parties, from Russia and other countries, from across Whitehall, and from British industry, to discuss the way forward.

<P>
<a name="81217w30.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Fatchett: </B> 
 We have already taken steps to promote what British industry can offer in nuclear waste management by holding a seminar on nuclear waste on 3 December, focusing on North-West Russia and the Urals. The seminar was attended by the relevant Russian authorities, other Whitehall Departments, representatives from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the European Commission and international partners as well as a specialist cross-section of British industry. It looked at how to take forward nuclear environmental clean-up, an area where the experience and expertise of the UK nuclear industry has much to offer.

<a name="81217w31.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what is the Government's response to the recommendations of the Law Commission report No. 245: Evidence in Criminal Proceedings: Hearsay and Related Topics; and if he will make a statement.  [64785]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81217w31.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 The Government consider the Law Commission's report No. 245, published in June 1997, a thorough and comprehensive review of the law on hearsay evidence. It contains 50 recommendations and a draft bill which are intended to modernise and codify the law.
<P>

<a name="81217w31.html_para6">The Government have given careful consideration to the recommendations in the report, in consultation with the Law Commission. They have concluded that the proposals will simplify the law and enable more evidence to be deemed admissible, whilst maintaining proper safeguards to protect the interests of the defendant.
<P>

<a name="81217w31.html_para7">The Government have decided to accept all the recommendations in the report.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will seek powers to allow a judge discretion not to abandon criminal trials where a defendant's criminal record is revealed, prior to verdict, by a co-defendant or witness; and if he will make a statement.  [63022]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81217w31.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The law on previous misconduct, which includes the admissibility in criminal proceedings of a defendant's criminal record, is currently under consideration by the Law Commission. The Law Commission issued a consultation paper on this subject in July 1996 and we will await their final report, which is expected next year, before reaching a decision on this matter.

<P>
<P>
<a name="81217w31.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 I have today published, jointly with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, a consultation document containing proposals to replace the current temporary framework of legislation against terrorism with permanent United Kingdom-wide provisions.
<P>

<a name="81217w31.html_para8">The document sets out the Government's proposals for police powers and other measures which would apply throughout the United Kingdom to deal with the threat

<P><I>17 Dec 1998 : Column: 726</I><P>
from all forms of terrorism, including those which might develop in the future. The proposals take proper account of the peace process and the security situation in Northern Ireland. They also introduce measures to combat domestic terrorism and strengthen our response to the continuing threat from international terrorism.
<P>

<a name="81217w31.html_para9">The proposals in the consultation document are designed to be both effective and proportionate in responding to terrorism whilst ensuring that individual rights are protected and that the United Kingdom's international commitments are fulfilled.
<P>

<a name="81217w31.html_para10">Views are invited on all of the proposals discussed in the document, and the consultation period will last until 16 March 1999. Following this, proposals will be drawn up for new counter-terrorist legislation, to be introduced at a suitable opportunity.

 334 comments have been received on the White Paper 'Fairer, Faster and Firmer--A Modern Approach to Immigration and Asylum'.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, pursuant to his answer of 8 December 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, columns <i>107-08</i>, what plans he has to require courts to notify the Immigration and Nationality Directorate when someone subject to immigration control is convicted of an offence resulting in a sentence of <i>(a)</i> imprisonment of less than 12 months and <i>(b)</i> a community service order.  [64688]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81217w31.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 Asylum seekers who declare their application in-country may be eligible for support under the terms of the National Assistance Act 1948 or the Children Act 1989. In both cases, this support is provided by local authority social services departments. It is for the local authorities concerned to decide how best to discharge their responsibilities. Under current legislation, the Home Office has no role in those decisions.

<P>
<P>
<a name="81217w31.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 The Government's policy towards co-operation between member states of the European Union on interception of communications remains as reported to the House of Lords Select Committee on the European Communities and recorded in their Report Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters (14th Report, 



<P>
<P><I>17 Dec 1998 : Column: 727</I><P>
Session 1997-98). Justice and Home Affairs Ministers meeting in Brussels on 3 and 4 December addressed a number of questions relating to the latest text of the draft Convention. We have reached agreement on much of the interception provisions. We are now seeking to ensure that the text accommodates important features of our own interception law and policy as well as that of other member states. In particular, differences in national legislation should not have the effect that operations carried out in relation to the United Kingdom's security and intelligence agencies would fall within the scope of the Convention when it will clearly not apply in relation to their equivalents in other member states. The Government's position on the latest text is under consideration by the European Scrutiny Committees.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what animal welfare organisations have been asked to advise police forces in the United Kingdom as to the training procedures that should be followed in police dog training; and if he will make a statement. [64521]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81217w32.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 Guidance on the training of police dogs is contained in the Police Dog Training and Care Manual which was issued in 1996 by the Home Office Standing Advisory Committee on Police Dogs. The revision of the Manual is now the responsibility of the Association of Chief Police Officers' (ACPO) Police Dog Sub-Committee.
<P>

<a name="81217w32.html_para0">The Chairman of the ACPO Police Dog Sub-Committee, Mrs. Pauline Clare, has contacted Essex Police, the RSPCA, the National Canine Defence League, and Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary with a view to developing a scheme for inspection of force dog training centres by a team comprising of representatives of these organisations and the ACPO Sub-Committee. A pilot scheme is to be initiated within Essex involving inspection by two members of the Sub-Committee, a representative of the RSPCA, and a member of the Essex Police Authority. The ACPO Police Dog Sub-Committee will evaluate the pilot scheme in due course.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what assessment he has made of the effect on prison inmates of the education programmes provided; and what estimate he has made of the re-offending rate of former inmates who have done well on the courses.  [64478]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81217w32.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 Information on the re-offending rate of former inmates who have done well on courses is not available.
<P>

<a name="81217w32.html_para2">A pilot study on the effectiveness of regimes was undertaken by the Prison Service in 1995-96. This showed that participation on educational/vocational courses reduced the rates of re-conviction provided that they were undertaken by offenders who had a need in that area. The study showed that education may lead to improved attitudes in respect of criminal lifestyle with the offender developing a new perspective on his or her behaviour.
<P>

<a name="81217w32.html_para3">Education and work programmes in prisons are increasingly being offered as an integrated package with priority given to improving basic skills. As specific basic educational standards are a pre-requisite to obtaining employment after release, these programmes are seen as potentially extremely valuable to offenders when they are seeking employment.

<P>
<a name="81217w32.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 We have no present plans to introduce a needle exchange scheme in prisons in England and Wales. The arguments in favour are counter-balanced by the risk of increasing the number of needles in circulation and undermining the need to deter and prevent drug misuse. The Prison Service, however, continues to monitor developments in the field, both at home and abroad.

 Information about police personnel numbers for individual forces in England and Wales is collected twice a year, at the end of March and September.

The additional resources to be provided by the Government, totalling up to &#163;1,24 billion over the next three years, coupled with the two per cent. efficiency targets which have been set for police authorities, will help to release more resources for front line policing.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many applications for political asylum have been made to date in 1998; how many were made in the same period in 1997; and if he will make a statement.  [64326]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81217w32.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The numbers of applications for asylum from January to October 1998 was 36,625 as compared to 27,035 in the same period in 1997. The rate of applications has varied widely over recent years.
<P>

<a name="81217w32.html_para6">There was a temporary fall in the number of asylum seekers after the Asylum and Immigration Appeals Act 1993 and numbers then peaked again in 1995. It may be that we are seeing a similar pattern after the Asylum and Immigration Act.
<P>

<a name="81217w32.html_para7">The current legislative base is inadequate and the asylum system which this Government inherited has been described as shambolic. We set out our proposals for a firmer, faster and fairer system in our White Paper in July. Legislation will be forthcoming shortly to implement these proposals.

basis, and Secretaries of State in successive Governments have dealt with cases accordingly. For example, in the first quarter of 1993, 57 per cent. of asylum applicants whose cases were decided were not granted asylum but were granted leave to enter or remain on exceptional grounds with an avenue to settlement in due course.
<P>
<P>
<a name="81217w32.html_wqn8"><B> Dr. Cable: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what standards he has specified for the accommodation of asylum seekers; and if he will make a statement.  [63934]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81217w32.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The Home Office is not currently responsible for accommodating asylum seekers and, therefore, has made no specification for their accommodation. Asylum seekers who are able to support themselves or those who qualify for income support and housing benefit can choose their own accommodation. Others may qualify for support provided by local authority social services departments under the terms of the National Assistance Act 1948 or the Children Act 1989.
<P>

<a name="81217w32.html_para8">The White Paper "Fairer, faster and firmer--a modern approach to immigration and asylum" (Cm 4018) set out proposals for a new asylum seekers support scheme. This scheme (which will require statutory underpinning), will be included in the forthcoming Immigration and Asylum Bill. It is not expected to become operational until April 2000. A project team has been set up to take forward the proposals. They will be developing specifications for the support arrangements, including accommodation, but no firm proposals have yet been developed.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many persons were granted political asylum in the years <i>(a)</i> 1970 to 1979, <i>(b)</i> 1980 to 1989 and <i>(c)</i> 1990 to date.  [64235]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81217w32.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 In the period January 1990 to October 1998, a total of 17,780 persons were recognised as refugees and granted asylum in the United Kingdom under the criteria set out in the 1951 United National Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, and the 1967 Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees. This figure excludes dependants and subsequent decisions following appeal or further representations.

Figures on the numbers of persons granted asylum in the United Kingdom are only separately identifiable from 1984 onward. Between January 1984 and December 1989, 4,480 persons were granted asylum in the United Kingdom.

<a name="81217w33.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 The number of reported cases of bullying of prisoners by other prisoners is not recorded centrally.

However, the Prison Service intends to make it a requirement for establishments to monitor the number of prisoners identified as being bullies on a monthly basis in the coming.

<P>
<P>
<a name="81217w33.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B>

 The decision to return Mr. Horne to York District Hospital was taken on clinical grounds by the senior medical officer at Full Sutton prison in consultation with consultants at the hospital, following Mr. Horne's decision to resume eating and to accept medical treatment.

<a name="81217w33.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 The direct costs to the Prison Service of Mr. Horne's recent hunger strike have been estimated to be approximately &#163;1,000 for the hire of agency nurses while he was held in Prison.
<P>

<a name="81217w33.html_para0">Whilst Mr. Horne was located in hospital, the Prison Service provided three escort staff. However, there is no additional cost related to these staff, as additional hours accrued by them during this time will be taken off during less busy periods in the future.

no clinical need for him to remain at the hospital as he could be equally well cared for in the health care centre at Full Sutton Prison.

<a name="81217w33.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 We have published two consultation papers this year about jury trials. The first paper, on use of juries in serious fraud trials, invited views on the principle of whether the system is likely to operate better and with a greater degree of public confidence if, in a small number of complex fraud trials, a traditional jury were to be replaced by another method of determining the facts. The consultation paper on determining the mode of trial considered whether defendants should be able to choose to be tried by a jury in cases which magistrates have indicated that they would be content to hear. We are currently considering the responses to these two consultation exercises.

<a name="81217w33.html_para1">In the 12 months to March 1998, police in Staffordshire recorded 89,820 offences. This represents a decrease of 3.1 per cent. (2,866 offences) over the previous 12 months.

 My right hon. Friend announced on 2 December 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, columns <i>194-97</i>, the revenue funding proposals for each police authority for 1999-2000. The table shows the real terms changes between these and comparative funding allocations in 1998-99, and between 1998-99 and 1997-98. In actual terms, the national increase in Total Standard Spending on the police is 2.67 per cent. or &#163;186 million over 1998-99.
<P>

<a name="81217w33.html_para2">In addition, the Government have announced the abolition of crude and universal capping of local authority spending from April 1999. This will provide some flexibility at local level to enable police authorities to increase their spending power. Nevertheless, police authorities are expected to set budgets which are prudent and reasonable, and which do not impose an excessive increase in council tax next year.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what representations he has received about the length of delays for transferring individuals from young offenders institutions who have been assessed as requiring psychiatric assistance; and if he will make a statement.  [63675]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81217w35.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 I am not aware of any representations. Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons has, in his Inspection Reports, drawn attention to problems about the availability of hospital places for prisoners needing that level of psychiatric care. The Government's plans for addressing these problems are set out in the Department of Health White Paper "Modernising Mental Health Services--Safe, fair and supportive".

However, it was always expected that the Act would be used only as a last resort where a country will not prosecute an alleged offender or where the United Kingdom cannot extradite that person. Prosecutions under Part II of the Act will always be difficult because of the problems of obtaining evidence from abroad to present to a court in this country in relation to offences committed abroad.

<a name="81217w36.html_para7">Illegal immigrants who do not claim asylum and who have no special needs are not eligible for support from public funds. Asylum seekers and other illegal immigrants (who are given temporary leave to enter) who are not otherwise detained and who are able to support themselves are free to live within the United Kingdom in a place of their own choosing. Asylum seekers who register their application for asylum at their port of entry may be eligible for Income Support and Housing Benefit and can then find their own accommodation. Asylum seekers who do not qualify for benefits but who may be supported under the terms of the National Assistance Act 1948 or the Children Act 1989 are supported by local authorities under the terms of that legislation. The Home Office currently has no direct role in providing support and is consequently not aware of the information sought.

<a name="81217w37.html_wqn3"><B> Ms Lawrence: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will make a statement about National Savings. [64790]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81217w37.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 National Savings has been carrying out a wide ranging programme to modernise the organisation against the background of a fast moving and highly competitive retail savings market. This has included the evaluation of a service contract in the form of a public private partnership for operational services delivery. After detailed consideration and discussion with those involved I can announce that I have accepted the recommendation of the National Savings Management Board and given it the authority to sign a contract with Siemens Business Services. The contract will be awarded for 15 years (with a break of 10 years) and there are considerable safeguards to ensure it will serve the public interest, including rigorous standards for customer service.
<P>

<a name="81217w37.html_para6">This contract between National Savings and Siemens Business Services is a milestone in the Government's policy of public private partnership. It will create a new Public Service Partnership, bringing together the strengths of the two organisations to deliver real benefits to all the stakeholders involved. The public interest will be served through better service to National Savings customers, savings to the taxpayer and wider opportunities for staff. And Siemens Business Services will benefit by taking on first-rate staff who will help them build their business in the growing field of business service.
<P>

<a name="81217w37.html_para7">Key features of the deal are the introduction of private sector capital and expertise which will help National Savings modernise its systems and processes, and so provide more choice to customers; a commitment by Siemens Business Services to a continual programme of customer improvements; a reduction in National Savings ongoing running costs. To offset the reduction in National Savings' operational jobs stemming from the Agency's ongoing programme of investment in new technology Siemens Business Services plans to introduce new work to each of the National Savings' sites in Blackpool, Durham and Glasgow. The outlook therefore is for a materially greater number of jobs than would have been the case without the appointment of a private sector partner. Amongst the safeguards we have negotiated are a significant commitment to job creation, with an undertaking in any event to maintain a National Savings presence in each of the three locations for at least the next five years.
<P>

<a name="81217w37.html_para8">National Savings staff, most of whom are employed in operational services, are being told of my decision today. The operational staff will transfer employment to Siemens

Business Services on 1 April 1999. Under TUPE, staff terms and conditions of employment are guaranteed and cannot be changed without negotiation between Siemens Business Services and the staff through their appointed Trade Unions.
<P>

<a name="81217w37.html_para9">National Savings' products will continue to be guaranteed by the Government who remain responsible for key decisions, including setting interest rates and terms and conditions of new products. National Savings remain in control over all key processes relating to the management of its market leading business--including policy, product design and delivering and pricing. The Chief Executive of the National Savings Executive Agency, who is also the Director of National Savings, will remain fully accountable to Ministers and to Parliament for National Savings.
<P>

<a name="81217w37.html_para10">This contract is in keeping with the Government's policy for public private partnerships and for modernising public services so they serve the interests of all stakeholders. This Public Service Partnership offers significant benefits to National Savings' customers and staff, and to the taxpayer, as well as to the local economies concerned.

<a name="81217w39.html_spnew6"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 Since 1993 the normal retirement age for everyone in the Inland Revenue has been 60 and this applies to both men and women. The Department's policy is that a decision to retain someone to work beyond 60 would be based on a business need, not on any personal consideration. So, only where there is an exceptional operational need, for example when a particular skill cannot quickly be replaced, is an exception allowed.

(30) See note below on Belgium and Luxembourg net contribution.<P>

<P>

<i>Note:</i><P>

A negative figure indicates that the Member State is a net recipient.<P>

The table above has been compiled from the annual reports of the European Court of Auditors. These reports do not attribute all EC spending between Member States, and so do not provide a full picture of net contributions. In particular the effects of administration spending are understated. Before 1995 the Court took account of part of administration spending. Since that date their reports have adopted a revised format which excludes administration spending completely. This change means that the figures for 1995-97 are not wholly comparable with those for 1988-94.<P>

Most EC administration spending is disbursed in Belgium or Luxembourg. The figures above for those countries must therefore be treated with considerable caution (and are shown in italics). Figures for 1992-97 only have been published by the Commission in their report on the Operation of the Own Resources System (ref 11666/98). These figures which do not take account of all administration spending, show that, for instance, in 1997 the net receipts from the EC Budget on Belgium and Luxembourg were 1,080 mecus and 725 mecus respectively.<P>

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what is the latest estimate of the total EU budget for the current year; and what percentage of it he estimates will be allocated to CAP expenditure.  [63104]<P>

<P>
<a name="81217w39.html_spnew15"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 The EC budget for 1998 was set at 83.53 billion ecus, of which 40.44 billion ecus, or 48.4 per cent. was allocated for CAP expenditure. Latest estimates suggest that the final outturn for the overall budget will be very close to budget, although expenditure on the CAP may be some 1 billion ecus below plans. CAP expenditure would therefore account for around 47 per cent. of all expenditure.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if it is his policy to seek to increase co-ordination of budgetary and economic policies within EMU in order to promote growth and high employment; and if he will make a statement.  [61067]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81217w40.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Hewitt </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 30 November 1998]:</i> High levels of growth and employment depend on macroeconomic stability and reform of capital, labour and product markets. The Stability and Growth Pact and Articles 103 and 104c of the Maastricht Treaty provide the basis for co-ordination and surveillance of budgetary and economic policies.
