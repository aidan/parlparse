 All authorised bee medicines in the UK are available as general sale products. There are no plans to put the supply of medicines for bees under the control of veterinary surgeons and licensed pharmacists. Changes in European legislation, implemented by the Veterinary Medicines Regulations 2005, require medicines for food producing animals to be POM. This change will take effect on 1 January 2007 before which the Commission are due to produce a list of exemption criteria for the POM requirement. The UK has proposed to the Commission that bee medicines should be in the exempt list.

The UK has asked for bee medicines to be exempted from the POM requirement. If this is not agreed, a beekeeper will have to be registered as a suitably qualified person (SQP) if they wish to supply these products. My officials have discussed the SQP requirements with the British Beekeepers Association and are aware of their wish to progress the provision of training for beekeepers as SQPs who are able to prescribe and supply products to treat diseases in bees. The British Beekeepers Association will be meeting the Animal Medicines Training Regulatory Authority early in 2006 to discuss this. If the exemption is agreed, the current sales arrangements for bee medicines will continue.

2. It is not possible to determine the cost of lap top and desktop computers in 2004&#150;05 as VOSA pay Atos Origin on a managed service basis, rather than for just the supply of equipment. Therefore, the equipment costs are wrapped up into a monthly charge for service provision (including all network costs, software, hardware, the helpdesk etc.).<br>

 The interdepartmental scheme to offset carbon emissions from UK official air travel will come into effect from April 2006. The scheme is currently being developed by an interdepartmental working group led by DEFRA but the formula for calculating the level of contributions required to be made by Departments has yet to be agreed. My Department does not yet have firm forecasts of the level of carbon dioxide emissions to be used in order to calculate the expenditure required.

 Consultation to the White Paper on Company Law Reform published in March this year revealed broad support for the Government&#039;s proposals to facilitate greater use of electronic communications. Initial estimates prepared with the help of interested stakeholders suggest cost-savings in the region of &#163;47 million per annum for FTSE-listed companies and a likely take-up of hard copy information by 0.3 per cent. to 5 per cent. of shareholders.

<a name="stpa_68">The Government recognise that shareholders should be able to receive company communications in a form which is convenient to them.

<p><a name="st_65"><a name="51121w07.html_spnew6"><b> Alun Michael  </b> 
<i>[holding answer 10 November 2005]:</i> The Company Law Reform Bill will allow companies to use electronic communications with their members. This will enable companies and their members to benefit from the immediacy of electronic dialogue. However, the Government recognise that electronic communications will not suit everyone. A change to the use of electronic communications will need to be approved by a resolution of the members of the company. In addition, a member, that is the legal titleholder to shares, will have the right to require the company to send a hard copy version of documents or information.

<a name="stpa_69">The Bill also provides a power for the Secretary of State to make regulations to require companies to send documents or information to a person or persons nominated by the member. Such persons could, for example, be those investing in shares through intermediaries. The regulations may require documents or information to be supplied to nominated persons in hard copy form, if the Secretary of State is satisfied that the additional benefits to nominated persons would outweigh the likely costs resulting from such an obligation.

<i>[holding answer 15 November 2005]:</i> The Government have received a number of representations from different parts of industry, including the packaging sector, as well as from many other stakeholders on all aspects of the proposed REACH Regulation (Registration, Evaluation and Authorisation of Chemicals). These included responses to the UK&#039;s public consultation last year.

<a name="stpa_76">Within the UK, REACH was subject to a regulatory impact assessment in 2004, and a further impact assessment was carried out this year, which examined the implications of the regulation for some downstream sectors, including can coatings, taking into account information supplied by metal packaging manufacturers.

<p>
<a name="51121w08.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_77">Across the EU, REACH has been subject to over 50 regulatory impact assessments. This includes the European Commission&#039;s extended impact assessment of October 2003, which estimated that changes made to its draft proposals could save up to &#8364;10.6 billion. The Commission also carried out a further impact assessment this year in partnership with industry, trade union, consumer and environmental organisations. That assessment considered the impact of REACH on certain downstream users of chemical substances, including flexible packaging manufacturers.

 All the Ministry of Defence contracts are placed on the basis of providing best value for money. In many cases consultancy contracts are awarded through framework arrangements which have been agreed with consultancy suppliers. To get themselves onto the framework agreements the consultants will have taken part in a competitive tender and the agreed charging rates and expenses will accordingly have been subject to competitive pressure. Where MOD teams place contracts outside of the framework agreements they must be able to demonstrate value for money and that prices, including arrangements for payment of expenses, are fair and reasonable.

 Most consultants used by the Ministry of Defence are engaged to support projects, not to lead them.

FCO performance for Standard Individual Export Licences currently exceeds targets (e.g. 93 per cent. of FCO recommendations are made within 10 working days, against a target of 70 per cent.). Audits of recommendations confirm that they are fully consistent with the Consolidated EU and National Arms Export Licensing Criteria. The FCO is continuing to improve processing to ensure that performance for all licence types remains high.

This approach is at the heart of our support for the UN Programme of Action on small arms and light weapons, and for a treaty on the international arms trade.

 The BBC World Service (BBCWS) contributes to Britain&#039;s international standing and reputation by being the world&#039;s best-known and most respected voice in international broadcasting. To maintain its position, BBCWS must continually take into account shifting global priorities, new technologies and changing audience preferences. Failure to do so would inevitably reduce the impact and value for money.

While continuing to provide global services in English, the BBCWS, in response to the Government&#039;s Green Paper, has reprioritised its vernacular services to focus on the countries where they can have most impact and where there is the greatest need. It was right to do so. Further reprioritisation will be necessary in the future. The closure of low impact services has released resources for investment in new media services, including the launch of a 12-hour Arabic TV service.

This service comprises the national learndirect telephone and on-line advice service, and a network of 47 local nextstep information and advice providers, and is available to adults in each local authority area.

 The Department&#039;s policy is that every adult in England should have access to a free, integrated information and advice service on learning and work delivered through the national learndirect telephone and on-line advice service and local nextstep information and advice services. Priority is given within this service to those adults who do not have a qualification at Level 2, since they are more likely to lack the skills foundation for employability and lifelong learning, and are less likely to get a secure, well paid job. In addition, adults participating in any LSC funded learning can also access information and advice services through their learning provider.

<a name="stpa_194">The White Paper Skills: getting on in business, getting on at work&quot; sets out a long-term ambition: that everyone should be able to get help if and when they want it to take stock of where they are in their lives and their careers; to review where they would like to get to; and assess what steps they can take to get there. We are jointly conducting a review with the Department for Work and Pensions, the DTI, the LSC, Ufi learndirect, Jobcentre Plus, and the Sector Skills Development Agency to help determine how best to achieve this goal, which will be concluded by the end of 2006. We are extending the learndirect telephone service on a trial basis from January 2006 to provide more intensive personal guidance to inform the review. Adults throughout England seeking to progress in their careers; wanting to gain the skills for jobs typically requiring a Level 3 qualification; and returning to work from career breaks, will benefit from the new service.

The Common Core sets out the areas of expertise that everyone working with children, young people and families (including those who work as volunteers) should be able to demonstrate.

We estimate that this, together with other measures to correct technical anomalies, will reduce the gap from 13 per cent. to 8 per cent. by 2006/07.

Employer Training Pilots (ETP) will influence the development of a quality National Employer Training Programme.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51121w30.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_222">The evidence from the pilots shows that the skills brokers are a tried and tested method of engaging employers in the development of their businesses and employees and is a key element of the success of the pilots. For example, the ETP Year 2 Evaluation carried out by the Institute for Employment Studies and published alongside the White Paper, shows that brokers have been very successful in helping to engage hard to reach employers. The evaluation showed these employers found the role of brokers in carrying out a training needs analysis a major attraction. 63 per cent. of hard to reach employers cited the help of brokers linking training to business needs as an attraction of ETP (as did 55 per cent. of easy to reach employers) and thus helping to maximise the added value of the programme. Employers saw the support given to help them access flexible and responsive provision that meets their needs as a major attraction of the pilots (76 per cent. of employers cited flexibly delivered training as an attraction of ETP and 19 per cent. said it was the most attractive feature). Helping to broker the right learning for the employers and learners helps to reduce dropout and ensure high success rates.

<p><a name="st_298"><a name="51121w30.html_spnew7"><b> Phil Hope: </b> 
 The White Paper Skills: Getting on in business, getting on at work&quot; published in March this year clearly states that at the heart of the National Employer Training Programme is a brokerage service that will work on behalf of the employer.&quot; Skills brokers will provide independent and impartial advice to employers on the best type of training available and then source its delivery, to meet employer needs. Brokers will help employers find their way through the often complex world of skills training and help them develop relationships with training providers which will give them the best return on their investment. Brokers are there to make the employer&#039;s search for suitable training simpler and cost-effective. Once a training relationship to meet employer&#039;s needs is in place, it is for the employer and training provider to work directly together. So long as the employer is satisfied with the quality of training they are getting, the training provider can carry on supplying it.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51121w30.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_223">Brokers will particularly focus on reaching employers who may otherwise not invest in training, particularly small and medium-sized employers. The White Paper clearly states that raising the skill levels of this group is a fundamental aim.

 An overall figure for the number of people stopped is not available as the Police Service of Northern Ireland does not maintain a record of those who were warned or given advice. Enforcement activity in respect of failure to wear seatbelts is largely by way of non-endorsable fixed penalty notices and figures in relation to this have been placed in the Library. Figures relating to prosecutions for failure to wear a seatbelt are not available for 2000&#150;03, however I can confirm that the number of prosecutions in 2004 was 1,756.

or, for example, a flick knife. The police have a number of stop-and-search powers do deal with persons suspected of carrying knives. Under the Police and Criminal Evidence (Northern Ireland) Order 1989 (PACE) police have powers to stop and search a person or vehicle where they have reasonable grounds for suspecting that they will find any article in relation to an offence of having an article with a blade or sharp point&#151;with the exception of certain folding pocket knives&#151;in a public place. The Public Order (Northern Ireland) Order 1987 allows police to stop and search any person or vehicle for offensive weapons or dangerous instruments whether or not they have reasonable grounds for suspicion in order to prevent serious violence in a locality. It is also an offence to have a knife or offensive weapon in a school, and the police may enter a school to search for such items. My Officials have been in contact with the Police Service of Northern Ireland in relation to knife crime and legislation and following consultation with the Home Office I have decided to extend to Northern Ireland those provisions in the Violent Crime Reduction Bill which will raise the age at which a person may lawfully be sold a knife from 16 to 18 years of age. I have no immediate plans for further change but I will keep the law in this sensitive and difficult area under review.

1. For the purposes of new deal for disabled people, a job is regarded as sustained when a person, placed into work through an NDDP job broker, remains in work for 13 out of 39 weeks. Prior to October 2003, an NDDP job was regarded as sustained when a person, placed into work through an NDDP job broker, remained in work for 26 out of 39 weeks.
2. NDDP jobs data relates only to the number of individuals gaining a job through an NDDP job broker. A measure of sustainability is not available for non-job broker jobs.
3. Although data are now available on people into jobs through NDDP up to the end of August 2005, data provided is up to the end of May 2005, to allow three months for the job to be recorded as sustained.
4. Figures are rounded to the nearest 10.

<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_105">CMS is the IT system that has been implemented to support a number of changes in the way our customers claim Jobcentre Plus benefits. These changes are part of a wider programme of service delivery modernisation in Jobcentre Plus that also includes, for example, greater use of telephone based contact with our customers and the adoption of standard operating processes.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_106">CMS was first introduced in Livingston in July 2003 and rollout to other sites commenced in October 2003. A second release was introduced on 13 December 2004, which made a number of improvements. This included electronic data transfer of information gathered in CMS directly into the Income Support Computer and Jobseeker&#039;s Allowance Payment Systems.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_107">With any major change, there is often a period of &#039;settling in&#039; and this has been the case for the introduction of CMS and the new processes that it supports. Initially we encountered some difficulties in terms of speed, capacity and reliability of the system, although, not entirely to do with CMS itself but related to complementary systems that CMS relies upon. A series of technical releases have largely addressed these issues and the computer system itself is now performing as expected.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_108">As with all IT systems CMS has meant a significant change in the way staff in Jobcentre Plus do their job. They require a good understanding of how the whole process links together, including the importance of gathering information on behalf of Local Authorities (LA) and of getting it right at each stage. To support this we have developed in consultation with practitioners, a toolkit&quot; of advice and guidance aimed at all relevant staff and managers designed to explain and reinforce correct practice and allow managers to monitor consistently. Key messages have also been enhanced in the learning and development material being delivered to our staff.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_109">Despite this programme of improvement work, we know from feedback from LAs that there is further work to be done to ensure that the operation of CMS is successful. The process works best in those LAs where there are effective liaison arrangements between Jobcentre Plus and the LA. Ongoing improvement work is overseen by a joint DWP/Local Authority Association (LAA) steering group. The introduction of CMS Release 3 on 31st October 2005 addressed many of the issues around the amount of clerical documentation associated with the initial releases. The removal of these clerical workarounds through this release will lead to further improvements and will be evaluated by the LAA in early 2006.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_110">Jobcentre Plus is undergoing a massive change programme and is making considerable investment in improved information technology. However change on this scale does create challenges in maintaining levels of customer service for some parts of the business during this period of transition and transformation. As a result, some customers claiming working age benefits have, of late, experienced difficulties getting through to some of our contact centres. We have put measures in place to address this, including temporary adjustments to streamline business processes in order to maintain customer service whilst we go through this transition period.

 Government remain strongly committed to the principle that infrastructure must be sufficient to support growth and is an essential element in achieving more sustainable communities. For example, between 1998&#150;99 and 2002&#150;03 public spending in the South East and Eastern Regions increased by over 17 per cent. in real terms per head of population.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51121w46.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_324">The Government&#039;s approach is to ensure that infrastructure, including public services, is provided in step with growth, as plans for individual growth locations are developed. The main elements of this approach are ensuring that mainstream funding reflects the needs of growth, maximising the potential for private sector contributions and making available selective additional grant funding to unlock major growth schemes and locations.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51121w46.html_para7">
<a name="stpa_325">Assessing the infrastructure requirements for particular localities is a complex and lengthy process. It needs to assess the detailed layout of a development as it evolves and to allow for changing approaches to service provision affecting what is needed and when. The Government are encouraging local delivery partners to focus on identifying, prioritising and sourcing investment in their locations&#151;based on their individual circumstances and priorities, and using a mix of public and private funding. This approach is being taken forward in the Milton Keynes Prospectus and is being developed in other growth location business plans.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51121w46.html_para8">
<a name="stpa_326">The Government&#039;s aim is to provide as much information as it can on likely future levels of support but this needs to be made within the context of the public expenditure cycle.

 The Government have introduced a wide range of measures to ensure that elderly people who live in the privately rented sector can enjoy decent homes that are warm and free of hazards. The provisions in the Housing Act 2004 to enable local authorities to assess properties against a range of health and safety criteria will tackle the worst conditions&#151;cold, damp, and the risk of falls. These will be reinforced by provisions which require many of the higher risk properties in the sector to be licensed in order to improve management standards.

 The statutory responsibilities of the Listing Officers employed by the Valuation Office Agency (VOA) to compile and maintain valuation lists for council tax purposes in England continue. For the current (1993) lists this means banding new properties, amending the banding of existing properties and deleting entries from the lists where properties are demolished or converted to non-domestic use. (Amendments to bandings may occur where there are physical changes that would result in a lower band, or where an improvement has been made that would take the property into a higher band and there has been a subsequent sale.) These activities will now be undertaken with the benefit of the newly digitised database of property records, which the VOA will ensure is comprehensive and up to date. This means that the VOA can introduce improved processes for handling data internally&#151;as it will no longer be reliant on paper records&#151;and can also provide a better service to council tax payers and to billing authorities in relation to the 1993 lists. In particular it will be better placed to deal quickly with enquiries or appeals from tax payers about their current bandings. Additionally, to secure the investment made to date in the automated valuation model technology, the VOA will complete the necessary work to ensure that the model is available for use in all its locations. Although introduced to support the 2007 revaluation, the VOA plans to use the model&#039;s capability to support the 1993 lists and also for other valuation work on domestic property which it undertakes within its statutory remit.

Notes:<br>

1. Expenditure pre 1999&#150;2000 is on a cash basis.<br>

2. Expenditure figures from 1999&#150;2000 to 2002&#150;03 are on a stage one resource budgeting basis.<br>

3. Expenditure figures from 2003&#150;04 to 2004&#150;05 are on a stage two resource budgeting basis.<br>

4. The resource budgeting stage two actual net expenditure figures shown for 2003&#150;04 to 2004&#150;05 are consistent with the 2005 departmental report.<br>

5. Figures are not consistent over the period (1971&#150;72 to 2004&#150;05), hence no comparisons should be made across different periods.<br>

6. Table is based on 2004&#150;05 prices using the gross domestic product deflator series as at 28 September 2005.<br>

7. Hospital and Community Health Services (HCHS) pay and price inflation is a weighted aveage of two separate inflation indices, the pay cost index (PCI) and the health service cost indes (HSCI). Up to and including 1984&#150;85, pay inflation was calculated using the pay settlements. From 1985&#150;86 the PCI measures pay inflation in the HCHS. The PCI is itself a weighted average of increases in unit staff costs for each of the staff groups within the HCHS sector. Pay cost inflation tends to be higher than pay settlement inflation, because of an element of pay drift within each staff group. Pay drift is the tendency for there to be a gradual shift up the incremental scales, and is additional to settlement inflation.<br>

8. The HSCI is calculated monthly to measure the price change for each of 41 sub-indices of goods and services purchased by the HCHS. The sub-indices are weighted together according to the proportion of total expenditure which they represent to give the overall HSCI value. The pay cost index and the health service cost index are weighted together according to the proportion of HCHS expenditure on each. This provides an HCHS combined pay and prices inflation figure.<br>

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what his policy is on the replacement of retiring police chief constables.  [24748]</p>








<p><a name="st_557"><a name="51121w59.html_spnew1"><b> Hazel Blears: </b> 
 The general policy for the replacement of retiring police chief constables is in line with section four of the Home Office guidance on the appointment process of chief police officers (available on the Home Office Police website at http://police.homeoffice.gov.uk/trainingandcareerdevelopment/index.html/chiefofficer recruit.html/) and section 11 Police Act 1996.

<a name="stpa_404">In his capacity as chair of the Senior Appointments Panel (a tri-partite body which advises me in the exercise of my role in approving chief police officer appointments) Sir Ronnie Flanagan, Her Majesty&#039;s Chief Inspector of Constabulary, recently wrote to police authorities addressing the implications of Her Majesty&#039;s Inspectorate of Constabulary&#039;s &#039;Closing the Gap&#039; report on the current structure of policing. The 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>21 Nov 2005 : Column 1737W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
letter presented the panel&#039;s view that, except where specific approval had already been granted, the common sense approach would be to advise police authorities not to proceed with existing or future plans to recruit new chief constables and accordingly sought their support in maintaining a consistent approach in these exceptional circumstances. I am placing a copy of this letter in the Library.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what steps he is taking to reduce the number of child deaths in custody.  [24291]</p>








<p><a name="st_558"><a name="51121w59.html_spnew2"><b> Fiona Mactaggart: </b> 
 The Home Office and the Youth Justice Board (YJB) are working closely together to prevent the deaths of young people held in their care. The YJB has funded a dedicated juvenile outreach team to assist juvenile establishments further develop and maintain their local suicide and self-harm prevention strategies. Nationally, there is a specific suicide prevention strategy for juvenile prisoners. This focuses on promotion of peer support through insider schemes; counselling, support groups and specialised psychological intervention for those who self-harm; vulnerability recognition; and child protection training. We continue to learn lessons from previous incidents to inform our strategies for the future. Suicide prevention work is also increasingly linked with the wider Safeguards Development Programme, as part of which safeguards managers and local authority social workers have been appointed at juvenile establishments, and there has been a programme of minor works across establishments to improve provision of safer and reduced risk accommodation and other built-environment improvements.

 The Government firmly believe that young people should only be sent to custody as a last resort. We have made available to the courts strong community penalties, with more young offenders being intensively supervised in the community to help reduce re-offending. The Youth Justice Board is also committed to lowering the number of young people in custody and has a target to reduce the population of those remanded and sentenced to secure facilities by 10 per cent. by March 2008.

These show the following drugs were indicated as present in the following frequencies: Cannabis 72 per cent; Benzodiazepines 35 per cent; Opiates 30 per cent; Cocaine 30 per cent; Amphetamines 17 per cent; and Methadone 9 per cent.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department pursuant to the statement of 18 October 2005, <i>Official Report,</i> column 765, on the Identity Cards Bill, when his Department will publish the Gateway Reviews that have been undertaken with regard to identity cards; which Gateway Reviews have been completed; and if he will publish their <i>(a)</i> red, amber, green status and <i>(b)</i> recommendations.

 The ID cards programme has undergone two OGC Gateway Zero Reviews and one Gateway One Review. The Government have no plans for publishing Gateway Reviews. Publishing the traffic light status awarded by these reviews or their recommendations would be likely to prejudice both the ability of the Office of Government Commerce to examine the effectiveness, efficiency and economy with which other Government Departments exercise their functions and also the formulation and development of Government policy. However the most recent review covering business justification did confirm that the programme was ready to proceed to the next phase.

 The Youth Justice Board does not set a target for the completion rate of the Intensive Supervision and Surveillance Programme. The completion rate is, however, one of the benchmarks by which it monitors the programme&#039;s performance. The benchmark rate for completion is 60 per cent. and the current completion rate is 56 per cent. The shortfall of 4 per cent. is being addressed through the sharing of good practice, the imaginative application of incentive schemes, the use of varied and stimulating programmes to encourage young people to participate fully, and a concentration on enforcement of national standards.

<a name="stpa_431">For example, in certain areas where alcohol-related violence is particularly prevalent, local police are more likely to police city centres on Friday and Saturday nights thus recording more incidents of violent offences committed in connection with licensed premises. If football-related violence is a problem, the choice to send police officers to the match will undoubtedly lead to more violent crime being recorded than if they did not attend. There are other examples, such as the pro-active policing of antisocial behaviour which can increase recorded crime.

<sup>(91)</sup> The figures for the first two years of counting include offenders both in custody and in the community. The figures for the later years include only offenders in the community. This counting rule was changed to reflect the fact that the MAPPA were established specifically to help improve the protection of the public from sexual and violent offenders in the community.<br>

 No firm decision to hold 13 items of biometric data (facial image, 10 fingerprints and two irises) per person has been taken. The assumption that these 13 items of biometric data will be stored is a working assumption used in our modelling of enrolment processes and in the costing of the business case. Final decisions on the type and quantity of biometric data held will be informed by the procurement process within the constraints imposed by the Identity Cards Bill.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will introduce measures to prevent the disclosure without the consent of the individual of information held on the proposed National Identity Register.  [24395]</p>








<p><a name="st_614"><a name="51121w64.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 We expect most of the checks on the register to be done with the consent of the individual. Under Clause 14 of the Bill, regulations may be made prescribing how the individual&#039;s authority for the provision of information is to be given. This clause limits the information that may be provided to accredited organisations as part of a verification check. This includes information within paragraphs one, three and four of Schedule one, the photograph, signature, information concerning whether the ID card is valid, voluntary information and confirmation of the answers to security questions. The organisation will only be told that the information provided by the individual coincides with that which is held on the register. The organisation themselves will not be given the answers to the security questions. This limitation on the information that may be checked means that information falling in other parts of Schedule one, for example the records of provision of information (paragraph nine of Schedule 1), may not be provided to organisations verifying identity under the powers in this clause.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51121w64.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_432">One of the purposes of the Identity Cards Scheme, as set out in the Bill at Clause one (3) is the provision of a secure and reliable method for registrable facts about individuals to be verified wherever it is necessary in the public interest. There will be occasions when it is in the public interest for information held on the register to be disclosed without the individual&#039;s consent. However, the provision of such information is strictly limited in the Bill. The Identity Cards Bill includes measures to regulate the provision of information without consent and to prevent unauthorised disclosure. Information 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>21 Nov 2005 : Column 1758W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
may be disclosed without consent to security and intelligence agencies to ensure that the scheme benefits the work of those organisations by supporting their stated statutory purposes. The police and Her Majesty&#039;s Revenue and Customs may also be provided with the registrable facts held for law enforcement and related purposes, minus the audit log of card use and information about other occasions when a person&#039;s record has been checked. Provision of this information to these bodies would only apply in cases of serious crime. The Bill ensures that provision of information without consent will be properly regulated and subject to independent oversight. The Bill also includes regulation making powers that would allow specified information to be provided without consent to other Government Departments or public authorities with the consent of Parliament. The Bill which was introduced to the House of Commons in May 2005 differed from that which was debated in the previous Parliament in that under the current Bill information cannot be disclosed without an individual&#039;s consent to organisations which are not public authorities.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51121w64.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_433">Clause 29 of the Bill creates a new offence, that of unauthorised disclosure of information. This offence will apply to persons who hold an office or employment in which the duties relate to the establishment or maintenance of the register, the issue, manufacture, modification, cancellation or surrender of ID cards or the carrying out of the Commissioner&#039;s functions. A person guilty of an offence under this section may be liable to two years imprisonment, a fine or both.

I will await the outcome of that review before considering further involvement. All police use of firearms is subject to the usual law on the use of force.

 Savings to the Exchequer from introducing new pension allowance (NPA) 65 from 2025 have not been estimated and could be supplied only at disproportionate cost. It is, however, likely that delaying the introduction of NPA 65 until 2025 for those who are not police officers would absorb a substantial part of the expected &#163;13 billion savings that will arise from the implementation of scheme reform within the framework of the principles agreed at the Public Services Forum.

<a name="stpa_440">In the case of police officers we are introducing a pension age of 55 for new entrants to the service from April 2006. This is in line with the Government&#039;s recognition that services like the police and the armed forces have specific needs which make a lower pension age appropriate for their members. If a calculation of the savings of introducing a pension age of 65 were carried out for the police it is arguable that the cost implications for operational effectiveness should also be taken into account

 The PACE Code of Practice on detention, treatment and questioning Code C) requires that as far as is practicable, not more than one person should be detained in each cell; and that a juvenile is not placed in a cell with an adult. The use of police cells is an operational matter for the chief officer of the force concerned. When one person to a cell is not practicable, consideration would be given to moving a detainee to another designated police station. A risk assessment would be carried out in relation to the options available including any risk associated with individual suspects sharing cell accommodation and the impact on the overall safety and security of the custody suite.

 The Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000 extended the provisions of the Race Relations Act to most public authorities by making racial discrimination unlawful in carrying out their functions. It also placed a positive duty on many public authorities to have due regard to the need to eliminate unlawful racial discrimination and to promote equality of opportunity and good relations between persons of different racial groups. The Commission for Racial Equality (CRE) is responsible for enforcing and monitoring the Act.
</p>


<p>

<a name="stpa_461">The CRE has issued more than 200 &#039;minded letters&#039;, indicating its willingness to take enforcement action against specific public authorities. In all cases this has resulted in the authorities concerned taking the necessary remedial action required to ensure that they are meeting their responsibilities in relation to race equality. Building on this work, the CRE is drawing up proposals on what it, in partnership with others, could do further to monitor public bodies&#039; progress on meeting their equality targets and obligations under the Race Relations (Amendment) Act. For example, the CRE is currently targeting a range of public authorities to determine their progress in conducting Race Equality Impact Assessments. This will focus on both the number of new policies being assessed and the rigor of individual assessments. A specific focus for the CRE over the coming 12 months will be to ensure that all new policies, including legislation, are subject to Race Equality Impact Assessments. To support this work, the Home Office is working with the Interdepartmental Group on Race Equality to drive this work at a departmental level.

 Staff in Youth Offending Teams (YOTs) are employed locally and not by the Youth Justice Board. The board supports recruitment and retention of front-line YOT staff, for example through its bespoke National Qualifications Framework for practitioners in the overall context of the Government Workforce strategy. It is also consulting on a Human Resources and Learning strategy 2006&#150;08 and will be issuing guidance on workforce planning to support YOT managers. The vacancies for front-line practitioners in April 2004 was 5.9 per cent., a reduction from 6.5 per cent. in September 2003.

 There are no plans to treat Zimbabwean applicants for naturalisation differently from those of any other nationality. Any individual request for priority treatment will be considered on its merits.
