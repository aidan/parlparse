<P>
<P>
<a name="80506w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Mitchell: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what has been the impact on the public finances of <i>(a)</i> the introduction of self-assessment and the six month advance in payments by the self-employed and <i>(b)</i> the moving forward of corporation tax.  [39561]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80506w01.html_spnew0"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 Self-assessment has not led to an advance in payment dates for the self-employed. The payment dates for the tax due for any year were previously the 1 January of that year and the 1 July immediately following. The position is much the same under self-assessment, with payments on account due on the 31 January and 31 July. The balance of the tax due for the year is then payable on the following 31 January. The overall effect on tax yield of self-assessment compared to the old system is very much a matter of speculation because of changes in taxpayer behaviour. However, it seems likely that the main behavioural effect of self-assessment has been to encourage taxpayers to bring their tax affairs up to date, and has led to some previously undeclared income being declared to the Inland Revenue.
<P>

<a name="80506w01.html_para0">The changes to payment arrangements for corporation tax will first take effect in 1999. The estimated revenue effects of the abolition of ACT and the introduction of quarterly payments of corporation tax are set out in Table C.1. and paragraph C.87 of The Financial Statement and Budget Report March 1998.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80506w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Gordon Prentice: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will raise the issue of the proposed abolition of duty free sales at the meeting of Ecofin on 19 May.  [39887]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80506w01.html_spnew1"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 There are no plans at present to raise this issue at the 19 May Ecofin. However, in the light of the comments made in the Transport Council on 17 March, consideration is currently being given to how best to progress the issue bearing in mind the heavy anticipated agendas of future Ecofin meetings and the fact that this matter was discussed over lunch in Ecofin as recently as 9 March where there was no enthusiasm for reopening the issue.
<P>
<P>
<a name="80506w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Gordon Prentice: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what assessment he has made of the European Parliament's resolution on the abolition of duty free sales.  [39886]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80506w01.html_spnew2"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 I have noted the European Parliament's resolution on the abolition of intra-EU duty free sales.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what is the total value of H. M. Tax Inspector's Estates; and what percentage of the accommodation is not presently occupied.  [40126]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80506w01.html_spnew3"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 The total value of the Inland Revenue's estate is &#163;225 million. Some 2.7 per cent. of available space is vacant.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80506w01.html_wqn4"><B> Miss McIntosh: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer for what reasons he has not applied to the EU for the discretion to apply a reduced rate of value-added tax for selected labour-intensive industries in respect of restoration and repairs of <i>(a)</i> churches and <i>(b)</i> historic buildings.  [39872]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80506w01.html_spnew4"><B> Dawn Primarolo </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 29 April 1998]:</i> There is currently no provision in the relevant EC legislation for an optional reduced rate for labour- intensive services. The European Commission has floated the idea of such an experimental reduced rate for a limited range of such services, which would not include restoration and churches or most historic buildings. Adoption of this proposal would require unanimity and Member States remain divided as to the merits of this initiative, so there is little prospect of it being pursued.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will introduce exemptions in respect of VAT for students in sixth form colleges when purchasing musical instruments.  [40576]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80506w01.html_spnew5"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 Musical instruments when supplied by a VI form college to its own students for use in a course of instruction are outside the scope of VAT when provided at or below cost.

<P>
<P>

 <i>[holding answer 5 May 1998]:</i> It is the Government's policy to maintain the current zero rate on international passenger transport.

<a name="80506w01.html_sbhd8"><H4><center>Financial Services (Regulation)</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="80506w01.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Caplin: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will make a statement about the measures to be included in the proposed Bill reforming the regulation of financial services which are aimed at sustaining confidence in United Kingdom financial markets.  [41214]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80506w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Darling: </B> 
 The financial markets play a pivotal role in ensuring the efficient allocation of resources within the economy. This is at the heart of growth and continued prosperity--resources going where they are best employed. It is vital that these markets are a fair and clean place to do business. The Financial Services Authority's (FSA) objectives will include sustaining confidence in the UK financial sector and markets and assisting in the detection and prevention of financial crime.
<P>

<a name="80506w01.html_para1">I intend that the new bill will equip the FSA with all the necessary powers to enable them to fulfil these objectives. As the Economic Secretary said in answer to a question by my hon. Friend on 7 April 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, columns <i>152-53</i>, the new legislation will enable the FSA to make rules binding on authorised firms for the protection of investors, depositors and policyholders. The FSA will also be able to make rules requiring firms to have appropriate anti-money laundering systems and controls in place. Breach of these rules will potentially trigger an array of intervention and disciplinary actions among which will be a power to levy fines on regulated institutions.
<P>

<a name="80506w01.html_para2">The new legislation on which we plan to consult in the Summer will also greatly enhance the FSA's ability to combat market abuse. I intend to introduce a new civil fines regime which will allow the FSA to impose fines on any person or firm, whether part of the regulated community or not, who engages in market abuse, for example market manipulation or misuse of privileged information. The intention is to deter abusive behaviour which undermines confidence in the UK financial markets and which, if unchecked, would ultimately damage the integrity of those markets. The legislation will give the Treasury the power to prescribe markets, and instruments traded on those markets, to be covered by the new regime. We are planning to consult on the basis that the initial coverage will be abuse, on or off-market, which affects investments traded on recognised investment exchanges.
<P>

<a name="80506w01.html_para3">The legislation providing for the new civil fines regime will also require the FSA to produce a Code of Market Conduct to supplement the basic provisions defining the abuses. The aim of this Code, which the Courts and Appeals Tribunal will have to have regard to, is to give guidance in general terms to market participants as to what kinds of behaviour are likely to be acceptable and what unacceptable. The FSA will be consulting on a draft of this Code shortly.
<P>

<a name="80506w01.html_para4">This new regime will complement, not replace, the existing criminal offences of market manipulation and insider dealing. Where criminal offences have been committed, criminal proceedings, as now, will be the appropriate course to take. As the FSA will have the 



<P>
<P><I>6 May 1998 : Column: 384</I><P>
relevant knowledge and expertise, I intend that the bill will allow the FSA to take criminal prosecutions of insider dealing and market manipulation offences itself. The DTI, SFO and CPS will retain concurrent powers. The FSA will also be able to prosecute criminal breaches of the Money Laundering Regulations.
<P>

<a name="80506w01.html_para5">It is right to provide the regulator with an effective array of sanctions, but these must be balanced by a satisfactory appeals mechanism. We are proposing to create a new single tribunal to consider appeals against the FSA's exercise of its regulatory powers. The tribunal will be entirely independent of the FSA, and will be managed as part of the Court Service.
<P>

<a name="80506w01.html_para6">I also intend to improve the range of sanctions available to the Competent Authority for listing (currently the London Stock Exchange) to deal with breaches of the listing rules by those admitted to the Official List. The bill will therefore give the Competent Authority the power to impose fines for breaches of the listing rules by issuers or by directors.
<P>

<a name="80506w01.html_para7">In addition, I propose to make a number of changes to improve the regulatory regime for investment exchanges and clearing houses. The UK has a wide range of respected and internationally competitive recognised investment exchanges and clearing houses which have played a large part in ensuring that the UK markets are, and are perceived to be, fair and well-regulated.
<P>

<a name="80506w01.html_para8">I intend that the draft legislation to be published for consultation in the Summer will build on the existing exemption regime under which investment exchanges and clearing houses will fulfil certain regulatory criteria can be recognised by the FSA and be exempted from the need to be authorised. The new Bill will incorporate improvements to this regime. These will include a power for the FSA to issue directions to recognised investment exchanges and clearing houses to take necessary steps to meet the recognition criteria. Recognised investment exchanges and clearing houses will also be given immunity from suit by their members for regulatory actions.
<P>

<a name="80506w01.html_para9">Taken together with the other changes to be introduced in the new bill, these measures will further enhance the UK's position as one of the best-regulated, and thus most attractive, financial markets in the world.

<P>
<a name="80506w02.html_spnew0"><B> Angela Eagle </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 29 April 1998]:</i> Information relating to transnational shipments of waste into and out of England and Wales is collected on behalf of my Department and the Welsh Office by the Environment Agency. Information on such shipments into and out of Scotland and Northern Ireland is collected annually by my Department from the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and the Environment and Heritage Service respectively.

<a name="80506w02.html_para0">The tables show the statistics that are available on the quantities of waste imported into the United Kingdom for disposal, broken down by type and by origin, since 1989-90. Figures from the calendar year 1994 onwards are not comparable with those for previous years because of a change in the regulations governing the supervision

and control of transnational shipments of waste. Under the previous regulations, only hazardous waste needed to be notified, whereas all wastes shipped are now notifiable under the new regulations. The information relating to the calendar year 1994 relates only to the period after 6 May 1994 when the new regulations came into effect.

 We have given local authorities flexibility to apply the additional resources made available under the Capital Receipts Initiative to meet local priorities for investment in housing and housing related regeneration. The works they undertake may include improving accessibility as part of renovations and refurbishments of existing stock where that is a local priority.

[40858]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80506w03.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 We have estimated that the Government may need to spent up to &#163;20 million on preparing for the GLA. We have also estimated that the Mayor and Assembly and new central GLA services would cost around &#163;20 million a year. We expect this cost to be offset over time through savings in the Government Office for London, other Government Departments, and the London Boroughs from eliminating wasteful duplication and conflicting activities across London, and efficiencies within the GLA and the bodies and authorities which will come within its remit.

 The Government are committed to providing equality of opportunity to all members of our society. Ethnic minorities occupy some 3.6% of the appointments to the boards of public bodies many of which are based in London. Appointments to these bodies are made in accordance with the guidance issued by the Commissioner for Public Appointments. This emphasises appointments on merit using fair selection procedures. But it is equally clear that ethnic minorities are not applying for these posts in sufficient numbers. To redress this as part of a general awareness-raising exercise, the Government Office for London recently wrote out to all the Single Regeneration Budget funded partnerships

 No central record is maintained of the age of current appointees to non-departmental bodies sponsored by my Department. I regret, therefore, that the information cannot be provided in the form requested.
<P>

<a name="80506w03.html_para1">The Government are committed to encouraging a wide range of candidates to apply for positions on the boards of public bodies, reflecting the diverse society in which we live. This includes encouraging more young people to put themselves forward as potential candidates for public appointments. All appointments are made on merit, and candidates must demonstrate that they have the necessary skills and experience to match the needs of the public body on which they wish to serve.

 The Department has received a number of representations about a regional chamber in the West Midlands following publication of the Government's White Paper "Building Partnership for Prosperity" in December last year. The West Midlands Local Government Association has now produced a consultation paper on a regional chamber and is currently seeking the views of regional organisations. I look forward to receiving a final proposal later this year.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he has completed his review of the implications of the failed prosecution of South West Water in relation to the outbreak of cryptosporidium in the Torbay area in 1995; and if he will make a statement.  [41216]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80506w04.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 I have concluded that there is a case for increased monitoring at water treatment plants that are most at risk of releasing Cryptosporidium into drinking water supplies. I propose therefore to begin consultations on amendments to the Regulations on drinking water quality to require continuous monitoring of the treated water to detect Cryptosporidium at such plants. If this monitoring detects the presence of the organism at an unacceptable level, the Drinking Water Inspectorate will consider prosecution of the company. There would be a new criminal offence of failing to treat water to adequately remove Cryptosporidium oocysts. On conviction in a Crown Court, the offence would carry a penalty of an unlimited fine. The intention is to encourage the operation of water treatment plants in line with best practice, which should prevent Cryptosporidium in drinking water causing illness. I have arranged for a copy of the consultation paper on my proposals to be placed in the Library of the House.

 The Magistrates' Association has proposed a change in the sentencing powers of magistrates' courts to allow them to impose up to 12 months' imprisonment, instead of the current six months' maximum. We are considering whether there are some circumstances in which such a change might be appropriate, but any change of this type would need very careful consideration of its effect on the prison population and on the rest of the criminal justice system.

We intend to replace the existing custodial sentences of Detention in a Young Offenders Institution (15-17 year olds) and the Secure Training Order with a new Detention and Training Order. The Detention and Training Order will be available to all criminal courts on a similar basis and sentences of up to two years will be possible; half the term of the Order will normally be spent in custody while the remainder will be spent in the community under supervision. The Detention and Training Order is being introduced in the Crime and Disorder Bill.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80506w05.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 In immigration appeals, the appellate authorities may take into account only those facts which were in existence at the time the decision was taken or which could have reasonably been expected to happen. In asylum appeals, the appellate authorities may take into account any facts in existence at the time of the hearing of the appeal.

 The available information is that, for non-asylum immigration cases decided in 1997, the average length of time between the request for leave to remain in the United Kingdom and being refused in which there was a right of appeal was 246 days. To this is added the time taken to lodge an appeal, which is a maximum of 14 days.

 Arrangements to compensate special constables who are injured on duty are contained in the Special Constables Regulations. The courts have held that, where a statutory scheme exists, supplementary payments are unlawful because the statutory scheme is exhaustive. The Police (Insurance of Voluntary Assistants) Act 1997, which came into effect on 21 March last year, specifically excluded special constables for this reason.
<P>

<a name="80506w05.html_para4">The 1995-96 Special Constabulary Working Group reviewed the compensation arrangements and recommended a number of changes to the regulations.

 None, since to do so would be incompatible with the philosophy behind Local Management of Schools (LMS). Under LMS, the governing body of a school with a delegated budget may deploy the resources provided by the Local Education Authority as it thinks fit.

 UK policy towards elimination of barriers to trade for Least Developed Countries (LDC) is set out in the Government's White Paper on International Development published in November 1997. The UK has agreed strongly within Europe and internationally (including through the G8) in pushing for the elimination of tariffs on imports from the LDCs and for eventual agreement to eliminate tariffs within a bound WTO scheme.
<P>

<a name="80506w07.html_para1">Some progress has been made towards this end: a number of member states made commitments to extend their market access for LDCs at the WTO hosted High Level Meeting for LDCs in October last year. Progress will be reviewed at the WTO Ministerial in May this year.

<a name="80506w07.html_para2">Under the UK Presidency, agreement has been reached within the EU to extend market access to the imports of the nine non-African, Caribbean and Pacific LDCs on terms similar to those available under the Lome Convention. The UK see this as a first step and will continue to press for duty-free access to the EU market for all Least Developed Countries. In addition, the UK recognises that complex rules of origin can act as a constraint on taking up preferential access. The UK is therefore pressing for an EU commitment to simplify and harmonise the EU preferential origin rules.

 It is Government's intention that the financial arrangements governing the National Lottery should be as transparent as possible. I have therefore tabled an amendment to the National Lottery Bill to allow the Comptroller and Auditor General access to those records of the National Lottery operator that are necessary for the purpose of his office's audit of the National Lottery Distribution Fund under section 33 of the National Lottery etc. Act 1993. This will deal with the concerns of the Public Accounts Committee as set out in their 20th Report in 1996-97. In exercising this access, the C&AG will have to take account of the work carried out by the Director General. This change does not provide a wider right of access for the purposes of value for money reviews of the private sector operator.

 The Government take very seriously the need to protect the United Kingdom against the threat or use of weapons of mass destruction, including biological warfare. We remain alert to any threat, and the UK retains a spectrum of military, scientific and other capabilities, which complement diplomatic and non-proliferation efforts intended to raise the political and economic costs of acquisition of these weapons and deter their use.

 The total amount of structural funds paid by the European Union to Wales in 1997-98 in respect of a wide range of programmes and community initiatives operating in the Principality was &#163;111.4 million. The effect on the UK's rebate is to reduce it by some &#163;73.5 million (66 per cent. of the value of the receipts)--compared, that is, to the position whereby the UK had not had this level of receipt within the same total community spending. Matching funding to secure these funds comes from a wide range of public and private sources and it is not possible to provide a separate figure on those from central government funds, which are not ring fenced for this purpose.

 As part of the agreement, I am proposing to take separate 25 year leases on the 3 blocks of Crickhowell House, to replace the existing two 20 year leases, in order to give the National Assembly greater flexibility and security. A 5 year rent review was due in September, but I have negotiated for the rent to be fixed at the current level for the next 5 years. I will also be looking to increase future flexibility over the car parking arrangements.

<a name="80506w10.html_para7">There will be a range of other routine conditions which will apply to the site for the new building, which it would not be appropriate to disclose at present while the legal agreement is being prepared, but which are typical of commercial property transactions.

 Provisional figures are provided in the table. The reserves consist of funds which have already been used to acquire assets, or funds required to meet day-to-day needs, or funds which are committed to be spent over a reasonable period.

 Effective enforcement is a top priority for this Government. We are currently spending some &#163;25 million a year on fisheries enforcement in the interests of conserving fish stocks and ensuring the long-term viability of the fishing industry. Progress has been made on a number of fronts including measures to prohibit the discarding of stowed fish, the checking of vessel safety and crewing certificates by British Sea Fishery Officers, the introduction of satellite monitoring and the issue of proposals for a system of designated ports for landings of fish made by vessels over 20 metres. We have also promoted wide ranging debate in Europe and at the March Fisheries Council secured agreement to the development of an action plan by the Commission to strengthen standards of enforcement across the Community.

<P>
<a name="80506w11.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 We estimate that currently there are some 150 UK registered and licensed fishing vessels which have a significant foreign interest in their ownership. Of these, about one third were registered prior to the application of restrictive licensing arrangements in 1984.

 My meeting with the National Federation of Fishermen's Organisations on 18 February concerned salmon net fisheries; neither coastal zonal committees nor the future of the Common Fisheries Policy after 2002 was discussed.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80506w11.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The basic Regulation on the Common Fisheries Policy, Council Regulation (EEC) No. 3760/92, defines Community fishing waters as the waters under the sovereignty or jurisdiction of the Member States. The same Regulation defines restrictions on access to waters and the fish resources in those waters. These include the rules applicable within 6 and 12 mile limits and the system of quotas and relative stability. The Government do not support repeal of any of these provisions.

The product information for prescribers states that benzodiazepines should not be given during pregnancy unless there are compelling medical reasons. There are however some medical conditions in pregnancy where the use of these drugs can be life saving to mother and child, for example when used to control fits in eclampsia.

 The decision not to renew Government funding of the central administrative costs of the Access Committee for England (ACE) from April this year was reached only after very careful consideration, and was taken jointly by Ministers from the Department for Education and Employment, the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions and the Department of Health. The decision followed a recent inter-Departmental review which concluded that future funding of ACE by the Government should be for specific projects, and not towards their central administrative costs. This is in accordance with the policy of time-limiting grants for central administrative costs, of which voluntary organisations in receipt of Government funding under both this and the previous Government have been aware for some years.

<a name="80506w13.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 Winter Fuel payments are one of a number of initiatives the Government have taken to help vulnerable people, especially the elderly, keep warm in the winter. A total of &#163;400 million has been committed for two years (1997-98 and 1998-99), to help pensioners with fuel bills to pay. This is the first time any Government have provided additional help with heating costs to all pensioners living in the United Kingdom who receive a retirement pension or one of a number of other qualifying benefits.
<P>

<a name="80506w13.html_para0">The making of last winter's payments was an enormous and unprecedented exercise. In order to establish all eligible pensioners, correctly identify pensioner households, and determine the amount each should receive, it was necessary to correlate data in around 15 million computer records, involving 15 qualifying benefits, across nine computer systems. Overall, almost ten million pensioners, in over seven million households, received a payment.

 One of our key aims for the Child Support Agency is to ensure that more absent parents pay the maintenance they owe. The regular payment of maintenance is central to our strategy as recognition of fathers' continuing responsibilities to their children; to help lone mothers move off income support into work; and to get more money to children in low income working families.

 The Benefit Integrity Project aims to ensure that those in receipt of Disability Living Allowance are entitled to it. While it is right to check that people are receiving the correct amount of benefit, we are determined that those checks should be undertaken as sensitively as possible. Also, we must ensure that all decisions taken as a result of the project are right. We have, therefore, acted to introduce an extra safeguard to improve the quality of, and the confidence in, benefit decisions made by the project.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Secretary of State for Social Security has asked me to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question asking how many individual cases have been reviewed under the Benefit Integrity Project, how many of these cases have now been concluded: of the cases concluded, in how many instances benefit has been (a) terminated and (b) reduced, and if she will make a statement.</FONT></UL>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The BIP is looking again at designated DLA beneficiaries' current care and mobility needs. Information is collected through a programme of visits and postal enquiries. Selection of customers to receive either a visit or a postal enquiry is done monthly, on a random basis, by computer scan. The customers involved are those with awards of the higher rate of the mobility component combined with either the highest or the middle rate of the care component. During the period covered by the BIP, some time restricted awards in the above categories have expired and fallen due for renewal. They would have been subject to re-examination in the normal way.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>As at 31 January 1998, under the Benefit Integrity Project, a total of 159,846 cases (including 25,365 renewal cases) have been selected to receive either a visit or a postal questionnaire or, in the case of renewal cases, have been identified as requiring further evidence. As at 31 January 1998, 54,839 cases have been concluded. Of these, 1,299 have resulted in an increase in benefit, 42,730 have remained unchanged, 6,884 have resulted in a reduction in benefit and 3,926 have resulted in benefit being stopped. The total included 10,811 renewal cases of which 334 resulted in an increase in benefit, 5,601 remained unchanged, 2,907 resulted in a reduction in benefit and 1,969 resulted in benefit being stopped.</FONT></UL>

<P>
<P>
<a name="80506w13.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Field: </B> 
 The Payment Card is a magnetic stripe card and not a smart card. It holds very little personal data and provides a key to enable the post office staff to access the payment data. It is therefore highly secure. All benefits, pensions and allowances administered by this Department and its agencies will be payable by the Payment Card for those customers who wish to collect their money at the post office.
<P>

<a name="80506w13.html_para8">The contract to automate post offices and develop a benefit Payment Card was awarded to ICL Pathway in May 1996 following an extensive competitive procurement in accordance with EC regulations and Government good practice. Since the award of the contract no other major computer services company has approached the Department to install the computer systems to enable the payment of benefits at post offices. Neither has the Department approached any computer services company to install computer systems to enable the payment of benefits at post offices.
<P>

<a name="80506w13.html_para9">Presently 205 post offices in the North East and South West of England have been automated and are paying Child Benefit by Payment Card as part of a limited trial.
