From the statistics available it is not possible to state specifically how many applications are for lost licences only.

<P>
<a name="30514w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The Strategic Rail Authority (SRA) has not yet awarded the Greater Anglia franchise.

That followed a process of "Qualification to receive an ITT document", in which applicants were ranked on their responses to a questionnaire.

 The Strategic Rail Authority is currently undertaking a feasibility study on the proposal to re-open the Matlock to Buxton line. The study is expected to be completed in two stages. The first stage will look at options to re-instate the link that formerly existed. This is expected to be completed in September 2003. If the partners agree to continue, stage two would develop the preferred option in detail. Stage two will be completed in April 2004. The Strategic Rail Authority is also currently examining the case for reopening the section of line between Bicester and Bletchley for freight and diversionary purposes. This would potentially enable the introduction of passenger services on the

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what steps his Department is taking to address the issue of age discrimination.  [109440]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30514w01.html_spnew7"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 The Home Office has continued to integrate age into its equal opportunity policies and to apply its commitments that there should be no unfair discrimination on the basis of age and that staff of all ages and backgrounds should be provided with opportunities to maximise their skills and achieve their potential. Action on diversity will continue to tackle any negative attitudes towards older staff, particularly through the training and development of managers and through the monitoring of recruitment, selection and appraisal statistics.
<P>

<a name="30514w01.html_para5">Since 1 April 2002, following a review of the Department's age retirement policy, Home Office staff in all grades below the Senior Civil Service have been allowed to retire at any point between the ages of 60 and 65. From the same date, the Home Office changed its recruitment policy to allow the recruitment of staff up to the age of 64 subject to their meeting normal standards of health and provided that there is an expectation of a reasonable period of employment and return on recruitment and training.
<P>

<a name="30514w01.html_para6">The Prison Service is carrying out a separate review of its age retirement policy. However, on 16 December 2002 a temporary relaxation of its policy was issued, applicable to all non-operational staff below the Senior Civil Service, effective until 1 July 2004. This allows staff covered by the policy to apply for an extension of service beyond 60, subject to health and efficiency considerations.
<P>

<a name="30514w01.html_para7">In making these various changes, the Home Office has been implementing recommendations of the Performance and Innovation Unit (PIU) report 'Winning the Generation Game'.

<a name="30514w02.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Bob Ainsworth: </B> 
 From 1 April 1999 to 31 May 2000 data on the number of antisocial Behaviour Orders (ASBOs) issued was collected by police force area. From 1 June 2000 official statistics on the number of ASBOs issued are based on quarterly returns from Magistrates' Courts Committees (MCCs).
<P>

<a name="30514w02.html_para3">Available information shows the number of notifications received by the Home Office of ASBOs issued from 1 April 1999 up to 31 December 2001 was 532. The number of notifications received from 1 January 2002 up to 30 November 2002 (latest available) was 253. Data are not collected centrally on the number of ASBOs in force at any given time.
<P>

<a name="30514w02.html_para4">We are aware that the number of ASBOs made nationally have been consistently under-reported in returns made by magistrates courts and are considering how reporting can be improved. 66 persons had breaches of their ASBOs proved to the satisfaction of the court and notified to the Home Office in 2000 and a

<P><I>14 May 2003 : Column 248W</I><P>
further 258 in 2001 (persons breaching an ASBO more than once and dealt with on separate occasions will be counted more than once in these figures).
<P>

<a name="30514w02.html_para5">However, as the number of ASBOs made is known to be under-reported and breaches of ASBOs count persons every time they appear in court, these figures cannot be used to calculate a breach rate. For this reason a special exercise was undertaken, covering the period 1 June 2000 to 31 December 2001, to match persons convicted of breaching their ASBOs on at least one occasion (as notified by the police and the courts) with ASBOs made (as notified by the MCC). This showed that during this period 125 persons had breached their ASBOs out of 428 for whom ASBOs had been made and notified to the Home Office, a breach rate of 20 per cent.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department pursuant to his answer to the hon. Member for Croydon South (Richard Ottaway), of 12 December 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 480W, on the Immigration and Nationality Directorate, how many letters were sent to members of the public where a passport could not be traced in <i>(a)</i> 1997, <i>(b)</i> 1998, <i>(c)</i> 1999 and <i>(d)</i> to date in 2003.

 The information requested is not held centrally and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost. However, the Integrated Casework Directorate's (ICD) Return of Passport Unit, which was set up in October 1999, issued 97 lost passport letters in the year 2000, 103 in 2001, 390 in 2002 and 251 so far this calendar year.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30514w05.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Luff: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills if he will make it his policy to bring funding per pupil in Worcestershire closer to the national average.  [112661]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30514w05.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 In introducing the new funding system in 2003&#150;04, our aim has been to produce the best possible match between the distribution of funds and the differing circumstances and needs of pupils, schools and Local Education Authorities. It is our policy to ensure that the funding each authority receives reflects the needs of its pupils, and the cost of providing an education service.
<P>

<a name="30514w05.html_para0">The new funding system comprises of a basic entitlement per pupil&#151;the same everywhere, and a top ups for each pupil with additional educational needs&#151;again the same everywhere. There are also top ups to reflect the higher costs of recruiting and retaining staff in some areas, and the higher costs of providing an education service in sparse areas. The top up for additional educational needs was informed by research conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers into the costs of providing for pupils with additional needs. The top ups for area costs are based on earning differentials from the labour force survey.
<P>

<a name="30514w05.html_para1">These top ups mean that there are differences in what individual authorities receive. Those which have more deprived pupils and/or receive extra funding to take account of the high costs of recruiting and retaining staff in their area, receive a higher level of funding overall than those which have comparatively low levels of deprivation and/or do not receive additional funding for area costs.
<P>

<a name="30514w05.html_para2">All LEAs have seen an increase in their Education Formula Spending Share of at least 3.2 per cent. per pupil in 2003&#150;04, in addition to compensation for the bulk of the pension contribution increase and the transfer into EPS of nursery grant and class size grant. The increase for Worcestershire is somewhat more substantial at 4.1 per cent. This translates into an increase in Worcestershire's Education Formula Spending Share of 6.0 per cent. when pupil number changes are taken into account.

 On 10 April 2003 the Veterinary Medicines Directorate (VMD) published the fourth in a series of reports designed to provide information about the sales of veterinary antimicrobial products in the UK. This covered sales of these products in the calendar year 2001. This report, entitled "Sales of Antimicrobial Products Authorised for Use as Veterinary Medicines, Growth Promoters, Coccidiostats and Antiprotozoals

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what recent representations and discussions she has had with <i>(a)</i> small abattoirs, <i>(b)</i> slaughterhouses and <i>(c)</i> independent butchers regarding the Animal By-Products Regulation.  [111111]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30514w06.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Department has undertaken extensive consultation during the negotiations on the Animal By-Products Regulation. This has included discussions with representatives of the abattoir and butchery industries.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30514w06.html_wqn7"><B> Andrew George: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what measures she is taking to <i>(a)</i> maintain and <i>(b)</i> encourage the development of new (i) small abattoirs, (ii) slaughterhouses and (iii) butchers under the Animal By-Products Regulation.  [111119]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30514w06.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The purpose of the Animal By-Products Regulation is to ensure that animal by-products are used or disposed of safely. The Department has, however, taken steps where possible to minimise the impact on these industries. We are encouraging our regional partners to deploy the schemes within the England Rural Development Programme to support the network of small and medium abattoirs where a regional need is identified.

[111395]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30514w06.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 These controls are in place to maintain existing controls on the trade and import of game trophies under the Balai Directive (92/118/EEC).

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will make a statement on the level of cetacean by-catch within the UK 200-mile limit in the last 12 months.  [112496]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30514w06.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Since 2000 the Sea Mammal Research Unit (SMRU), under contract to Defra, has carried out a number of surveys to estimate the level of by-catch in UK fisheries. These surveys recorded for the offshore bass fishery 53 common dolphins caught in 116 hauls in 2001 and eight common dolphins caught in 66 hauls in 2002. However, by-catch information from other member states whose vessels operate in this fishery and elsewhere in UK waters is not available so it is not possible to produce reliable estimates of dolphin by-catch deaths in within the UK 200-mile limit. It is for this reason that I have been pressing the Commission for urgent action to widen observer coverage of EU fisheries and to bring forward proposals for positive action to reduce by-catch.

 The Department's expenditure on newspapers, periodicals and magazines in the financial year 2002&#151;2003 was &#163;91,095. This figure covers central purchasing through Defra's library services. This excludes the cost of newspapers, periodicals and magazines purchased in Defra local offices and in the Department's Executive Agencies. These figures could only be compiled at disproportionate cost.

<P>
<a name="30514w07.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Under the current CAP reform proposals, published on 22 January, eligibility for the dairy premium, which is planned as compensation for the price cuts, would be based on quota held on 31 March 2004. We, and some other member states, have expressed concern that the current proposal to base eligibility on quota held at a date in the future has already given rise to speculation on the quota market. We have suggested that it should instead be based on quota held on 31 March 2003, and confined to active producers as at 31 March 2004.
<P>

<a name="30514w07.html_para4">No formal assessment has been made of the economic impact on the dairy industry, including the effects of quota speculation, of any delay in coming to a decision on the eligibility criteria for the premium.

 None. The nature of dry cleaning operations makes it difficult to capture 100 per cent. of the various solvent waste streams for recycling. The Solvent Emissions Directive (1999/13/EC) which aims at reducing emissions of volatile organic compounds due to the use of organic solvents from certain activities and installations, including dry cleaning operations, does not include specific requirements to ensure that a certain 



<P>
<P><I>14 May 2003 : Column 267W</I><P>
amount of the solvent waste stream should be recycled. Instead it controls releases from the operation of the dry cleaning process as a whole by controlling the maximum amount of solvent that can be emitted per unit mass of cleaned garments, that is emissions of waste gases and fugitive emissions to air, soil and water and solvents contained in any products.
<P>

<a name="30514w07.html_para6">We intend to consult separately on proposals to include requirements on the operators to ensure that waste contaminated with solvents are recycled or disposed of by waste licensed contracts. This will be in line with existing waste management regimes. There are incentives within these proposals to encourage recovery of any residual solvent contained within the waste from dry cleaning operations.

 The Ministry of Defence's latest guidance on the reporting of incidents of domestic violence within the Armed Forces was published in a "Defence Council Instruction" on 1 February 2002 and is being incorporated into appropriate single-service regulations. The policy takes account of Home Office directives on the subject and with the underlying principle that domestic violence by Service personnel is not to be tolerated under any circumstances. MOD Ministers have not had cause to discuss this policy with other ministerial colleagues.

<P>
<a name="30514w09.html_spnew5"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 There are two aspects of instructor to trainee ratios: formal training class size and pastoral care out of working hours. The requirement for supervision varies accordingly. The Ministry of Defence does not currently recommend precise supervisory ratios, but work is in hand to develop policy guidance for Commanding Officers of training establishments.

 None. Under Service regulations, maintenance of morale, personal development and recreation are command functions policy responsibility for which lies with the individual Service Principal Personnel Officers. At a local level, development of the arts, music and cultural expression rests with the individual commanders of training establishments, as part of their command function. Many units have voluntary bands and encourage trainees to join. Many also have theatre and music clubs, which often stage productions. Training establishments support music and the arts in a recreational and developmental context and encourage participation as an adjunct to training in operational skills.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30514w09.html_spnew7"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The Army Training and Recruiting Agency, of which the schools at Bordon and Leconfield are a part, has undertaken a comprehensive review of military establishments at all of its schools. In the case of Bordon and Leconfield, urgent action has been taken to amend the establishments. The Assistant Chief of the General Staff has directed the Army's manning authorities to arrange for suitably qualified personnel to be posted there as a matter of priority in the short term.

[112619]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30514w09.html_spnew8"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 Within the Army Training and Recruiting Agency (ATRA), empowered officers are normally of the rank of either Major or Captain and, dependent on the establishment, will either be the Unit Welfare Officer, the Second in Command, the Unit Educational Officer or the Unit Resettlement Officer. At each school, the name and contact details of the officer will be publicised widely using a combination of briefings, Unit Orders, flyers and/or posters. A "credit card" showing useful contact numbers is issued to recruits/trainees at some ATRA establishments and consideration is being given to the issue of a card of standard, robust, design for use by all ATRA establishments.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30514w09.html_spnew10"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The Services have already introduced measures to ensure that welfare presentations and training are now included at Initial Training establishments. The Army have ensured that all new recruits receive instruction on welfare services available, access to WRVS, Service Padres and confidential support telephone lines. The RN and RAF have also adopted similar measures and included organisations like The Soldiers, Sailors and Air Forces Association (Forces Help) (SSAFA (FH)) and the Benevolent and Dependants Funds, who have traditionally provided welfare support to the Services and their families. In addition, all three Services have successfully developed Welfare websites that have proved popular with Servicemen and their families. An action plan for continued spreading of good practice is being prepared; a copy of this action plan will be placed in the Library of the House when complete.

[112630]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30514w09.html_spnew11"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The Principal Personnel Officers strongly encourage recruits and trainees to sustain links with their parents during initial training. The Naval Service considers that these links are strong, but samples of parents/guardians are to be surveyed on a regular and routine basis to confirm this. Commanding Officers of Army initial training units have for some considerable time now written to, or kept in telephone contact with, parents of recruits aged under 18 years. All Army recruits are also encouraged to maintain contact with parents themselves.
<P>

<a name="30514w09.html_para5">Following a recent review of the legal position, RAF guidelines to disseminate best practice are expected to be published shortly. A copy of these guidelines will be placed in the Library of the House.

In the Regulatory Impact Assessment published in October 2001 to accompany the latest amendment to Part L of the Building Regulations, which came into effect in April 2002, it was estimated that the changes would lead to a reduction in carbon emissions of 1.4 million tonnes of carbon (equivalent to about 5 million tonnes of carbon dioxide) per year in 2010.

<a name="30514w11.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Don Foster: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister pursuant to his answer of 10 April 2003, <i>Official Report,</i> column 355W, on heating systems, what the nature is of the research referred to; what stage the research is at; whether there is a mechanism for people to submit comments or evidence to that research; and when the results will be known.  [113225]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30514w11.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Leslie: </B> 
 The research underlying SEDBUK, the UK's database of domestic boiler seasonal efficiency indices, which was developed to facilitate SAP energy ratings, was carried out as a collaborative venture by industry and Government in 1997 to 1999. Collaboration has continued since then and this has focused on improvements and rectifying anomalies.
<P>

<a name="30514w11.html_para1">Research into the evaluation of the energy performance of micro-combined heated and power (micro-CHP) units is at an early stage. A laboratory test procedure is being developed through consultations that have been commissioned by a group set up by the Energy Saving Trust. The procedure is close to completion and it is anticipated that the next stage will be to turn it into a 'Publicly Available Specification' (PAS) through the offices of BSI. It is akin to the standards in the Boiler Efficiency Directive, used to evaluate full and part load performance for boilers, and aims to establish similar performance parameters for microCHP systems. The results obtained could be used to determine a seasonal performance index for microCHP systems. However, while this index would be similar to the SEDBUK for boilers it would be inappropriate to make direct comparisons between these products on an efficiency basis. Consideration is therefore being given to the development of a comparison system based on total carbon emissions, total energy or total energy costs.




<P>
<P><I>14 May 2003 : Column 281W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="30514w11.html_para2">As the rating development will be reliant upon microCHP field trials, it is not possible to say precisely when the further research results will be known, but the aim is to have the SEDBUK equivalent in place in time for inclusion in the next major revision of the Building Regulations Part L in 2005. There will, of course, be consultation with the interested parties on these initiatives during the intervening period.

<P>
<a name="30514w12.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Alexander: </B> 
 The UK has made considerable progress in recent years in terms of the proportion of the population regularly accessing the internet. The UK online programme drives forward work across Government, helping to meet the Prime Minister's commitment of internet access for all who want it by 2005. In 1998, 10 per cent. of UK households (8 per cent. in Scotland) had internet access, compared to 45 per cent. by April 2003. Virtually all schools across the UK are now connected to the internet. All schools in England will have broadband connections by the end of 2006.
<P>

<a name="30514w12.html_para0">In total, 62 per cent. of the UK adult population&#151;some 28.7 million people&#151;have now used the internet (October 2002 National Statistics Omnibus Survey); 38 per cent. of the UK adult population, 17.6 million people have yet to get online; and 50 per cent. of the adult population, 23.1 million people, log on regularly. The survey currently provides six-monthly breakdowns of results for the devolved administrations, so 2003 results for Scotland are not yet available.

<a name="30514w12.html_para1">In November 2002 the Prime Minister announced that we had successfully achieved our target of setting up 6,000 UK online centres in England, enabling thousands of individuals to enjoy the benefits of the internet by providing free or low cost internet access and offering support for first time users. Many of the centres are located in the 2,000 most deprived wards in England. They are located in libraries, community centres, village halls, football clubs, mobile facilities and other community venues. UK online centres have a proven track record of helping to support and engage harder to reach groups, including the long-term unemployed, in the provision of access to ICT learning and skills. So far 16.9 per cent. of users have been unemployed.
<P>

<a name="30514w12.html_para2">The Scottish Executive's Public Internet Access Points initiative aims to create over 1,000 new internet access points in a wide range of venues throughout Scotland where people already go as part of their everyday lives&#151;e.g. shops, post offices, community centres, pubs, sports facilities etc. Over 500 venues are now up and running. In addition over 550 libraries in Scotland now provide free public access to the internet.
<P>

<a name="30514w12.html_para3">To enable people to find their nearest internet access point the UK online helpline, in association with the Scottish Executive, provides contact/location information of public internet access facilities across the UK, including in Scotland.
<P>

<a name="30514w12.html_para4">During the forthcoming 'Get Started' (formerly 'Online Nation') publicity campaign, the UK online helpline will also provide information on events and activities (including taster sessions) in Scotland and Scottish callers will receive the Internet Made Easy CDROM (a joint development with Scottish University for Industry) covering basic skills and outlining the benefits of the web.
<P>

<a name="30514w12.html_para5">The 'Get Started' campaign will seek to explain to those currently not using the internet how the internet can benefit their daily lives, and will encourage them to access the internet at their nearest public internet access point. We are especially keen to encourage elderly people and those in low income households to get online as it is these people who are least likely to be aware of what the internet can do for them. This campaign will run simultaneously with a campaign in the Scottish Executive with similar objectives.
<P>

<a name="30514w12.html_para6">The 6,000 UK online centres will offer a free introductory session to the internet to anyone who wants it. In addition, we have commissioned regional TV programmes and community service announcements to demonstrate how people have benefited from using the internet.
<P>

<a name="30514w12.html_para7">To help get our message across we are working with a number of companies and voluntary organisations to deliver the campaign. These include the BBC, Arriva Group, BT pic, Dixons Stores, the Prince's Trust, the National Library for the Blind, and Citizens Advice. We hope that working with these partners will enable even more people to understand the benefits that the internet can bring.

 Individual Government Departments and agencies have responsibility for external recruitment, with the exception of the Fast Stream. The recruitment process for jobs in the Civil Service, including advertising, must be consistent with the principle of selection on merit on the basis of fair and open competition, in accordance with the requirements of the Civil Service Commissioners' Recruitment Code. Decisions about advertising have to take into account, subject to the details of the vacancy or vacancies, how best to ensure that information is widely available in the areas where the target candidate market is to be found.
<P>

<a name="30514w12.html_para9">We have set targets to improve the diversity of Government Departments at senior levels, and therefore recruitment advertising at every level includes trying to reach those who might not traditionally consider the civil service as a career.

Mr. Chaplin replied on 4 February stating that the letter had been passed to the relevant Government Departments, as requested, and offered the Middle East Department as a future contact point.

<P>

<a name="30514w12.html_para12">The Government shares the concerns of the group about the importance of protecting and preserving archaeological sites and museums in Iraq. Before the conflict started, the Ministry of Defence consulted widely with the archaeological fraternity, who provided lists of key sites of cultural and historical interest in Iraq. Troops were briefed accordingly and avoided key sites of cultural and historical interest as far as possible during the conflict.
<P>

<a name="30514w12.html_para13">We could not prevent damage inflicted by Iraqi forces. Most of the looting by criminal elements occurred whilst the fighting was continuing. The aim of the Coalition forces at this stage was to suppress Saddam Hussein's forces with minimal loss of Coalition lives and Iraqi civilians.
<P>

<a name="30514w12.html_para14">Troops guarded cultural sites where they could, but this was not always possible due to the security situation. It also now appears that organised groups had access to Baghdad Museum and planned the looting well in advance of military action.

 The Foreign and Commonwealth Office had 157 incidents of mental health absence in the last financial year. An incident is defined as one continuous absence period. We are unable to provide a full breakdown of days lost to mental health absence without incurring disproportionate costs. Our definition of mental health illness includes depression/mental illness and stress.

<a name="30514w17.html_para0">Exercising its powers under the Gas Safety (Installation and Use) Regulations 1998, the HSE issued, on 1 April 2002, a certificate temporarily suspending the requirement on Transco to be registered with CORGI until such time as the new national vocational qualification, referred to in my previous answer, had been aligned with the nationally accredited certification scheme for individual gas fitting operatives. The certificate was issued in order to enable the national gas emergency service to continue without interuption, in the interests of public safety. The alignment and assessment processes were successfully completed by the certificate's expiry date of 31 October 2002.

This does not take account of other costs arising from the postponement of the election including reimbursing political parties and candidates.

Patients who experience difficulty in registering should contact their primary care trust, which is under a duty to help its local population to register with a GP or personal medical service (PMS) provider and, if necessary, has a reserve power to allocate patients to a GP or PMS provider.

<a name="30514w18.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 An association between long-term use of oral contraceptives (OCs) and a slightly increased risk of cervical cancer has been recognised for many years. However, it has not been possible to demonstrate a direct causal relationship as the presence of other factors, such as persistent infection with human papilloma virus (HPV), that are believed to have an important role in the development of cervical cancer, are also associated with long-term use of OCs.
<P>

<a name="30514w18.html_para8">A review of all eligible research on the long-term use of OCs and risk of cervical cancer has recently been published (<i>The Lancet</i>&#151;5 April 2003&#151;361:1159). This review took into consideration many other relevant factors, such as HPV infection and still found that use of OCs for many years is associated with a slight increase in the risk of cervical cancer compared with 'never-use'. A copy is available in the Library.
<P>

<a name="30514w18.html_para9">The Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) has kept the issue under review and has considered the latest evidence. CSM has advised that, as it is not possible to be certain that all relevant factors, such as duration of HPV infection, have been fully taken into account in the review, a definite causal relationship has yet to be established. Nonetheless, the new study strengthens the evidence for a causal link between long-term OC use and cervical cancer and research is ongoing.
<P>

<a name="30514w18.html_para10">Warnings about the risk of cervical cancer with long-term use have been included in the summary of product characteristics for health professionals and the patient information leaflet for women for many years. In addition, women are advised to regularly attend for a cervical smear in accordance with Guidelines. In the United Kingdom, the introduction of a highly effective screening programme means that the total number of cases of cervical cancer is low and mortality has fallen.

 The Food Standards Agency (FSA) has responsibility for food law enforcement matters, as this area falls within its remit to protect public health and consumers' interests in relation to food. The FSA advises and keeps Health Ministers regularly informed, through frequent discussions and briefings, about relevant developments and issues. The FSA works very closely with local authorities and their representative bodies and receives regular representations from them regarding food law enforcement issues. These are made informally through day-to-day contact between FSA officials and local authority enforcement officers and more formally by means of written representations, through the enforcement liaison group (a joint FSA/local authority committee that was set up to strengthen and develop links with local authorities) and at regular meetings of the FSA's chairman, chief executive and other senior officials with representatives of the local authorities co-ordinator of regulatory services and with the Local Government Association. These representations relate to a wide range of issues including, for example, the FSA's local authority monitoring and audit programmes, levels and consistency of food law enforcement activity, recruitment and retention of enforcement professionals and licensing of food premises.

 The national health service locally is responsible for providing medical practitioners to undertake public health functions at ports, airports and railway stations handling international trains. These medical practitioners would be expected to know about relevant clinical aspects of communicable diseases as part of their normal professional learning, and the NHS would be responsible for ensuring that they are suitably equipped. Warnings of future threats from outbreaks of communicable disease in other countries and guidance on dealing with them will be cascaded through the NHS if the need arises.

 This aspect of the primary care trusts' accountability for control of infectious diseases is discharged by the Health Protection Agency (HPA), which is responsible for the investigation and management of suspected communicable disease incidents affecting the community, including outbreaks of infection. The HPA's responsibility includes the preparation of multi-agency contingency plans, leading and co-ordinating the public health response, undertaking appropriate epidemiological investigation, providing advice to the public and professionals and convening multi-agency incident/outbreak control teams.

 The term 'integrated medicine' is usually applied generically to the use of complementary therapies to supplement orthodox treatment. At the present time, no projects have been commissioned with a specific remit to assess the interaction between a complementary therapy and an orthodox treatment. Questions of this sort can best be considered once the efficacy of individual complementary therapies, acting on their own, is better understood.

<UL>(2) pursuant to his oral statement of 28 April 2003, <i>Official Report,</i> column 38, on Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, if he will make a statement on the action to be taken against people returning to the United Kingdom from SARS-affected areas, who are unable or unwilling to sign a declaration;  [110961]
<P>
(3) what <i>(a)</i> scientific and <i>(b)</i> medical advice he has received in support of a policy of screening for SARS at airports using a declaration for passengers to sign.  [110923]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30514w21.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 Travellers returning from severe acute respiratory syndrome affected areas are not currently required to sign declarations. The statement my right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State made on 28 April, referred to this course of action being considered should the need arise.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30514w21.html_wqn9"><B> Dr. Harris: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he has received advice from <i>(a)</i> the World Health Organisation and <i>(b)</i> the Chief Medical Officer on the transmissibility of SARS through (i) aerosol routes and (ii) fomites.  [110963]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30514w21.html_spnew9"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 The World Health Organization (WHO) has on-going research (from members of WHO laboratory network) on the exact mechanism of transmission based on the stability of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus. From the information to date the WHO continues to advise the need for personal protective equipment appropriate for standard, contact, and airborne precautions&#151;for example, hand hygiene, gown, gloves, a face mask providing appropriate respiratory protection, eye protection, footwear that can be decontaminated&#151;for health care workers to prevent transmission of SARS in the health care settings. They have also issued advice on decontamination and disinfection of potential fomites to reduce the spread of infection.
<P>

<a name="30514w21.html_para4">The Chief Medical Officer emphasised in his letter to Chief Executives of national health service trusts and primary care trust of 29 April, of the need to maintain absolute rigour in reducing the risk of cross infection through effective respiratory precautions, high quality sterile practice by staff caring for the patient concerned, exceptional standards of environmental hygiene&#151;for

example, walls, floors, surfaces&#151;in the clinical areas where patients have been cared for even temporarily, such as walk-in centres, and absolutely no inappropriate re-use of medical devices and equipment.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30514w21.html_wqn10"><B> Dr. Evan Harris: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will list hospitals and primary care trusts where suspected SARS cases are being observed or treated as inpatients.  [110964]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30514w21.html_spnew10"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 There have been a number of cases where people fit the suspect definition of severe acute respiratory syndrome which have been investigated. However from these only four probable cases have emerged. Indeed two previous probable cases have been removed following confirmation of alternative diagnoses. The last case in the United Kingdom was admitted to hospital on 10 April, and all those diagnosed as probable cases have now recovered.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30514w21.html_wqn11"><B> Dr. Harris: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health how many <i>(a)</i> suspected and <i>(b)</i> probable SARS cases there were in the UK on the most recent day for which information is available.  [110966]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30514w21.html_spnew11"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 As of 12 May, there were four probable cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in the United Kingdom.
<P>

<a name="30514w21.html_para5">There have been a number of cases where people fit the suspect definition of SARS which have also been investigated. We will only be reporting cases that fit the probable case definition issued by the World Health Organisation. At this time of year in south-east Asia influenza activity is high and we would therefore expect travellers to this area to be returning with flu-like

symptoms, which are unrelated to the current outbreaks of SARS. Each suspected case is carefully evaluated on the clinical presentation of its symptoms.
<P>

<a name="30514w21.html_para6">The situation is changing daily, and it would not be beneficial to report suspected cases as there will be many who after investigation do not fit the WHO case definition. We therefore only report on probable cases, as required by WHO.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what advice and assistance he is giving to people of Chinese origin regarding concerns over the SARS issue; and if he will make a statement.  [111782]<P>

 Information on the number of new cases (diagnoses) and new cases per 100,000 population by disease, for the years 1997&#150;2001 is shown in the table. This is taken from the statutory reporting of diagnoses made at genito-urinary medicine (GUM) clinics on form KC60. Data on sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are only collected centrally from GUM clinics where most STIs are diagnosed and treated. STIs diagnosed and treated by general practitioners or in other settings are not available.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what legislation regulates the description of food as smoked.  [111472]<P>

<a name="30514w22.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 European rules on food labelling are implemented in the United Kingdom by the general provisions of the Food Safety Act 1990 and the Food Labelling Regulation 1996. These make it an offence to describe food in a way that is false, or likely to mislead a purchaser about its nature, substance or quality. Guidance notes accompanying this legislation make clear that terms like "smoked" can easily be abused and suggest that products that have been immersed in, or sprayed with, a solution which imparts flavour and colour should be described as "smoke flavoured" rather than "smoked".
