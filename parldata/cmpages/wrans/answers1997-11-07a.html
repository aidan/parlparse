<a name="71107w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Chris Smith: </B> 
 Sir Richard has already begun work and hopes to finalise the membership of the working group shortly. He plans that the working group should meet later this month. On 6 November, Sir Richard issued an open consultation letter inviting views from all those with an interest, and who wish to contribute to this debate. The text of the letter, and of my letter to Sir Richard setting out in full the terms of reference for the review I have asked him to conduct, have been placed in the Libraries of the House.

These figures are provided under the Voluntary Agreement on Sponsorship of Sport by Tobacco Companies in the UK. Tobacco companies do not operate under similar arrangements with regard to arts sponsorship. However, the Association for Business Sponsorship of the Arts (ABSA) has recently estimated the total spread of tobacco companies' support for the arts in the UK to be around &#163;1-1&#189; million per annum.<P>

 My Department will conduct a review of the Scottish Consultative Council on the Curriculum during 1997-98 under the programme of 5-yearly non-departmental public body reviews. This review will examine the justification for the Scottish Consultative Council on the Curriculum on policy grounds and the system of financial management control within the Council.
<P>

<a name="71107w01.html_para0">The first stage of the review will take the form of a "prior options" study. This will assess the extent to which the functions that the Scottish Consultative Council on the Curriculum perform are necessary for the achievement of the Government's policies, and will examine thoroughly the scope for abolition, transferring part or all of the functions to another body, rationalisation, privatisation and continuation as an NDPB. The results of this prior options study will inform a detailed review of the Council's financial management and control systems.
<P>

<a name="71107w01.html_para1">The review will also examine the scope for co-ordination of the activities of the Scottish Consultative Council on the Curriculum with other bodies to ensure maximum value for money from the central government resources available for education in Scotland.

<a name="71107w01.html_para2">The prior options study will commence in December 1997. In order to help ensure that all options are considered fully, comments are invited from interested parties.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland if she will list the concluding observations pertaining to Northern Ireland made by the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child following examination of the United Kingdom periodic report in January 1995; and if she will list the progress made in addressing each of the committee's concerns.

<P>
<a name="71107w02.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Worthington </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 6 November 1997]:</i> The concluding observations made in respect of Northern Ireland relate to a range of issues: the impact on children of emergency legislation; juvenile justice; children in training schools; race relations legislation; and integrated and Irish medium education. I shall deal with each in turn.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>Emergency legislation</i>
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Committee expressed concern about the lack of information on the difficulties experienced by children living in Northern Ireland and the effect on children of the operation of emergency legislation.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The legislation to enable the security forces and the criminal justice system in Northern Ireland to deal effectively with terrorism seeks to combine operational utility and public acceptability by providing measures which are appropriate and proportionate to the threat of terrorism, while at the same time 



<P>
</UL></FONT><P><I>7 Nov 1997 : Column: 359</I><P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>protecting the rights of individuals. While there has been no official assessment of the particular impact on children of the emergency legislation in Northern Ireland, special safeguards have been introduced into the statutory codes of practice governing the detention, treatment and questioning of people under the terrorism provisions. These ensure that in the rare event of the police having to interview anyone who appears to be under 17, the well-being and rights of the interviewee are given the highest priority. Among the special safeguards is a requirement that they must be accompanied by an appropriate adult.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The emergency legislation permits a constable or member of the security forces to stop and search any person in specific circumstances laid down in legislation. If it is necessary to search a child under 14 this is normally done by a female police officer or a female soldier. For a juvenile older than this, the search is carried out by a police officer or soldier of the same sex. Any allegation of unprofessional behaviour by a member of the security forces is treated very seriously. Procedures exist for dealing with such complaints and are widely publicised, although allegations of harassment against children have been very rare.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The emergency legislation is independently reviewed and renewed annually following debates in Parliament. The Government has recently launched a major review of counter-terrorism legislation in the United Kingdom. The aim is to end the present temporary arrangements and produce permanent legislation which will deal with all kinds of terrorism, including international terrorism.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>Juvenile justice</i>
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Committee concerned that the Training School ethos appeared to lay emphasis on imprisonment and punishment. A proposal for a draft Criminal Justice (Children) (Northern Ireland) Order was published in February this year. The draft legislation has been prepared as part of a developing juvenile justice strategy. An important part of that strategy is to reduce the number of young people in custody. Custody will be restricted to those who have committed a serious offence or who pose a serious danger to the public. In all criminal proceedings the court will be required to have regard to the welfare of the child before ordering any disposal. At present the only custodial disposal available to the courts for all but the most serious offences is the training school order, which authorises detention for an indeterminate period of up to two years--the indeterminate nature of the sentence was another of the Committee's concerns. The proposed legislation will abolish the training school order and replace it with a new juvenile justice centre order. This would be for a determinate period between six months and two years, only half of which would be spent in custody, with the lower end of the range being the norm. It is intended that while in custody children will be given education and training to help them adapt to a return to the community and to reduce the risk of re-offending. They will be supported in this by a period of supervision.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>Children in care</i>
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Committee was also concerned that children in care could be held in training schools. Following the commencement of the Children (Northern Ireland) Order in November 1996 it is no longer possible for a child in Northern Ireland to be placed in a training school on care grounds.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>Race relations</i>
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Committee recommended that race relations legislation be introduced in Northern Ireland. The Race Relations (Northern Ireland) Order 1997 came fully into operation on 4 August 1997. The legislation replicates the GB Act and makes discrimination on racial grounds unlawful in employment, training, education, the provision of goods, facilities and services, and the disposal and management of premises. The Irish Traveller community is defined as a racial group for the purposes of the Order. A Commission for Racial Equality for Northern Ireland has been established to help enforce the legislation and to promote equality of opportunity and good relations between people of different racial groups.

</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>Education</i>
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Committee advocated further support for teaching the Irish language in schools and for integrated education.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In order to meet the statutory requirements of the Language Studies area of the study of Northern Ireland Curriculum, pupils must study one of the following: French, German, Italian, Spanish or Irish. It is for schools to make provision in response to demand from pupils.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>A growing number of parents in Northern Ireland are choosing to have their children educated through the Irish language. Irish-medium schools may achieve grant-aided status under the same procedures as other school sectors. Since 1995 four primary schools and one secondary school have been given grant-aided status. There are now eight grant-aided Irish-medium schools with a combined enrolment of over 1,100 pupils, 95 per cent. of all pupils in Irish-medium schools are attending grant-aided schools.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Education Reform (Northern Ireland) Order places a statutory duty on the Department of Education to encourage and facilitate the development of integrated education, which it defines as "the education together at school of Protestant and Roman Catholic pupils". Under this legislation new integrated schools qualify for Government grants immediately provided they meet a number of criteria including minimum viability levels. In addition procedures are in place for transforming existing schools to integrated status; these may be initiated directly by parents.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>When the Order became law in 1990 there were only seven grant-aided integrated schools; five primary and two secondary. Today there are 33, of which 11 are secondary schools. Their combined enrolment is just over 7,000 pupils, which represents around two per cent. of total pupil numbers. The rate of growth in the sector will be determined by parental demand; there will be no question of Government imposing integration.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Department of Education will issue guidelines on transformation to integrated status to all schools later this year. These should provide a further stimulus to the growth of the sector.

<P>
<a name="71107w03.html_spnew0"><B> Marjorie Mowlam: </B> 
 A review of Information Services in Northern Ireland was presented to me on Wednesday 5 November. A copy has been placed in the Library of the House.
<P>

<a name="71107w03.html_para0">The review recommends that the role and approach of the Northern Ireland Information Service should continue to be consistent with the traditional core principles and approach of government information work. I agree. It is important that the professional reputation of the Northern Ireland Information Service for accuracy, impartiality and objective presentation of the Government's policies be maintained. Its staff have provided loyal, committed and professional service to successive Governments through some of the most difficult and traumatic events.
<P>

<a name="71107w03.html_para1">At the same time, the review sets out a vision for the Information Service: centrally placed at the heart of the Government in Northern Ireland, taking a strategic approach, active in promoting the Government's policies as well as reactive, and delivering an up-to-date service to the media, consistent with the professional requirements for accuracy, impartiality and objectivity.

<P>
<a name="71107w03.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 At the time of the sale 46 houses at Colchester were transferred freehold to Annington Homes. The price for individual properties was not separately negotiated but was part of the total sale and leasing package, the receipt for which was &#163;1.662 billion. Once properties are released to Annington Homes, questions relating to resale prices are a matter for that company, but the contract between Annington Homes and MOD provides for a share of the profits obtained from resale to be paid to the Exchequer. Over &#163;1 million from the profit share arrangements within the Annington Homes contract has already been received.

We are seeking to ensure that all assets are used with maximum efficiency, and that any surplus is identified and disposed of. The work is being undertaken mainly through existing structures. Some extra costs will be incurred, for example in the process of outside consultation, but it is too early to predict the total.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what provisions he is making for cattle slaughtered for human consumption after 1 January 1998, if they were born before 1 July 1996 and have no passport. [14773]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71107w04.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 Cattle born before 1 July 1996 are not required to have a passport. Cattle passports were only introduced for cattle born or imported into Great Britain from 1 July 1996; therefore cattle born before this date and presented for slaughter within 30 months are eligible to enter the human food chain.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what criteria are used by the Environment Agency to decide whether a sewage outlet is high risk. [14039]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71107w04.html_spnew1"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 Criteria to decide whether an effluent should be considered "critical" are set out in the Environment Agency Discharge Consent Manual. These include cases where the effluent is contributing to non-achievement of a water quality objective (including those implementing EC Directives); where it may adversely affect water quality at an abstraction point for potable supply; and where it may adversely affect Sites of Special Scientific Interest or substantial fisheries.
<P>
<P>
<a name="71107w04.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Brake: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions how many sewage outlets were not sampled by the Environment Agency because they were not deemed high risk in each year since the Agency's establishment. [14038]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71107w04.html_spnew2"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 Relevant information is not yet available for the period since the establishment in April 1996 of the Environment Agency. However, in 1995 the National Rivers Authority sampled 6,408 out of 7,429 sewage discharges with numeric consents and monitored 1,532 out of 1,786 water company sewage treatment works with descriptive consents. Intermittent discharges from combined sewer overflows, of which there are estimated to be some 25,000, are considerably diluted by rainwater and are routinely monitored by the Agency only in areas of exceptionally high amenity value. However, the design and construction of new and refurbished storm water overflows is controlled on a site specific basis by the Agency on the principle that the frequency of discharge should be related to the dilution available and the uses made of the receiving water.

 The Government is concerned about the impact of noise pollution generally and is aware of the increasing public concern about both road traffic noise and, to a lesser extent, rail noise. It is exploring a range of policy options to mitigate the impact of noise on the environment, and will take the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution's report into account in its work towards a White Paper on integrated transport.

 This is a matter for the Franchising Director. The franchise agreements require franchise operators to carry out regular surveys of customer satisfaction and to seek an overall improvement in satisfaction during the franchise term. The aspects monitored vary from franchise to franchise and the Franchising Director may require other aspects to be added to the surveys during the franchise. The majority of franchise operators currently monitor certain aspects of train cleanliness. None specifically monitor hygiene of on-board catering services, though normal health and safety requirements apply.

We will ensure that the public subsidy serves the public interest, and will establish a new rail authority combining the functions currently carried out by the Franchising Director and the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions to provide a clear, coherent and strategic programme for the development of the railways, so that passenger expectations are met. As a first step we have announced several new measures including new Objectives, Instructions and Guidance for the Franchising Director and a voluntary Concordat with the Rail Regulator. The Franchising Director's new Objectives make it his principal aim to win more passengers on to the railway, secure improvements in the quality of rail services and manage franchise contracts tightly in the public interest.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, pursuant to his answers and those of the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, of 27 October <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>572</i>, which articles of the Dublin convention 1991 <i>(a)</i> negate the terms of the Asylum Act 1996 and <i>(b) </i>make it more complex and more difficult to implement the bi-lateral agreement that allows the United Kingdom to return economic migrants to France. [13702]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71107w05.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The Dublin Convention provides criteria for determining which member state should consider an asylum application made in the European Union and procedures for transferring applicants between member states. Where another member state accepts that it is responsible for an application made in the United Kingdom, the Secretary of State can refuse and remove the applicant to that State, making use, where appropriate, of the provisions of the Asylum and Immigration Act 1996 concerning safe third country asylum cases. As a matter of international law, we are unable to remove asylum seekers to European Union member states on safe third country grounds other than in accordance with the Dublin Convention.
<P>

<a name="71107w05.html_para0">The readmission agreement we have with France explicitly provides for its provisions to be superseded by the Dublin Convention in so far as they apply to asylum seekers. It remains possible to return persons to France under the readmission agreement where they are not asylum seekers and do not meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules.

<a name="71107w05.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 It is not a requirement of the Immigration Act 1971 for immigration officers to be present at an airport terminal building. The Act provides for the Secretary of State to designate control areas for the embarkation and disembarkation of passengers in any port and for the port operator to take all reasonable steps to secure that notified conditions and restrictions which apply to a designated area are observed.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what criteria are used to determine the number of Her Majesty's immigration staff employed at each of the United Kingdom's airports. [14249]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71107w05.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The deployment of Immigration Service operational staff at airports is determined by a number of factors. These include the pattern and timing of flight movements, the volume and nature of passenger traffic together with other control demands such as clandestine entry and asylum casework.
<P>
<P>
<a name="71107w05.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Goggins: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what proportion of Her Majesty's immigration service costs arising from duties undertaken at United Kingdom airports is charged to airports; and what proportion is borne by public funds. [14248]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71107w05.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The cost of staffing the immigration control at both ports and airports in the United Kingdom, in accordance with the requirements laid down by the Secretary of State, is met entirely from public funds.
<P>

<a name="71107w05.html_para2">The Immigration Service charges for the provision of additional immigration services under section 9(4) of the Immigration Act 1988. The total receipts generated by these services for 1997-98 are expected to make up about 3.5 per cent. of the resources available to the Immigration Service Ports Directorate. I am unable to provide a disaggregation of the proportion of receipts between airports and other locations because to do so would risk breaching commercial confidentiality.

<P>
<a name="71107w05.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Vaz: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will take steps to improve the out-of-hours service of the immigration office at East Midlands airport. [13928]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71107w05.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The immigration office at East Midlands airport is staffed 24 hours a day. The uneven pattern of passenger arrivals means that there are times when only one immigration officer is required on duty. However, when that officer is unable to answer telephone calls immediately because of operational duties away from the office an answerphone service is provided. I do not have any plans to change this arrangement, which generally works well.

The UK has contributed to ESA's Huygens probe which will land and make measurements on one of Saturn's moons. It is a fundamental priority for the UK that space activities are undertaken in a safe and responsible way. Neither NASA nor ESA underestimate the care required in handling plutonium and have gone to great lengths to ensure the safety of the power sources. I understand these safety measures include: the form of the plutonium--a type of ceramic, the way it is stored--divided into 18 independent units, and the multiple layers of materials preventing accidental release. Her Majesty's Government was satisfied the risk of environmental impact was reduced to an absolute minimum and sufficiently balanced by the valuable scientific data that will be gathered by the mission about the evolution of planets in the solar system and ultimately the Earth itself.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health to what extent it is his policy that there should be a presumption that appointments of non-executive directors to NHS directorships should be made from candidates living within the trust's area; in what circumstances candidates from outside the area may be <i>(a)</i> shortlisted and <i>(b)</i> appointed; and if he will make a statement.

<P>
<a name="71107w07.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Milburn: </B> 
 Under the Government's new procedures candidates are expected to live in the area served by the trust involved. This will apply to all current postholders seeking reappointment as well as new candidates. Only in exceptional circumstances would we be prepared to depart from this stipulation. For example,

where there are severe local recruitment problems; when a particularly strong candidate has demonstrated in some other way their commitment to the local community; or where there is someone living only just outside the core area served by the trust whom it might be sensible to appoint.

 The Government have no plans to establish an office of Children's Rights Commissioner. During 1998 the Government will be preparing the Second United Kingdom Report to the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child in accordance with the requirements of Article 44 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, 1989. We will take into account possible advantages of such an Office and seek to assess progress in other countries where such an Office has been established.

Excess winter deaths are defined as the number of deaths in the four months from December to March less the average of the numbers during the preceding autumn (August to November) and the following summer (April to July). The table gives the percentage of the excess attributable to each of the given age groups.<P>

The mortality data collected by the ONS do not include information on whether the deceased was a single parent, in receipt of income support or disabled. It is therefore not possible to calculate the percentage of excess winter deaths among these groups.<P>

<a name="71107w08.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Blunkett: </B> 
 I have today laid before the House the Employment Service's Annual Report and Accounts for 1996-97 which give full details of performance in that operational year.
<P>

<a name="71107w08.html_para3">The Report notes that the Employment Service achieved some very significant successes in 1996-97. Most notably, the Service rose to the major challenges of successfully introducing the Jobseeker's Allowance and implementing the Labour Market System in the same operational year. Both were very large undertakings which required effective management and considerable investment in infrastructure, training and systems. The intensive effort which the ES had to devote to these two initiatives did result, however, in the Service not meeting a number of its job placing and other targets.
<P>

<a name="71107w08.html_para4">The Report notes that there has in addition been some misrecording of job placings and that performance for 1996-97 has been over-stated as a result. The causes lie in inconsistent application of ES job broking instructions and weaknesses in the performance validation process which are being tackled as a matter of priority. The ES Chief Executive has provided me with details of the urgent steps he has taken in this respect including issuing fresh and comprehensive instructions on the definitions of a submission and a placing, and the introduction of a new 



<P>
<P><I>7 Nov 1997 : Column: 384</I><P>
and more thorough performance validation system. Alleged cases of deliberate misrecording of placings are being investigated and appropriate disciplinary action will be considered against anyone found deliberately to have contravened the procedures.
<P>

<a name="71107w08.html_para5">The Comptroller and Auditor General in his comments on the Report notes that the Employment Service has taken swift and robust action to address this issue. The NAO and the Service have agreed that the NAO will undertake an annual validation of the Agency's performance measures and performance achieved, beginning in this current operational year. Further details of the action taken by the Employment Service are contained within the report.
<P>

<a name="71107w08.html_para6">It is important to note that the misrecording of placings has no effect on the unemployment count which is taken from the records of people claiming Jobseeker's Allowance as shown by the Benefits Agency computer system.
<P>

<a name="71107w08.html_para7">The current review of the Employment Service targets which I announced to the House on 30 July will take these matters into account. I expect the Review to recommend by the end of the year a series of targets which reflect our new priorities, are fully achievable and which can be measured accurately.
