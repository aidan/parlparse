<p><a name="st_0"><a name="50209w01.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Bradshaw  </b> 
<i>[holding answer 1 February 2005]:</i> The fourth report of the Independent Scientific Group on Cattle TB is being finalised. Publication is expected in early February.

<p><a name="qn_1"><a name="50209w01.html_wqn1"><b> Mr. Paterson: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what research her Department has conducted on whether species of wildlife other than the badger are a significant reservoir for bovine tuberculosis.  [214114]</p>








<p><a name="st_1"><a name="50209w01.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 Defra-funded research carried out by the Central Science Laboratory, on the risk to cattle from wildlife species other than badgers in areas of high herd breakdown risk, was published on 9 July 2004. Researchers isolated <i>Mycobacterium bovis</i> (the prime causative agent for TB in cattle) in a number of mammalian species, some for first time e.g. muntjac deer. Infection was also found in foxes, stoats, polecats, common shrews, yellow-necked mice, wood mice, field voles, grey squirrels, roe deer, red deer and fallow deer. While isolations from deer are a concern, it is not clear what, if any, contribution any of the species examined in the study make to the problem of TB in cattle.

<p>
<a name="50209w01.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_0">Further research into the role of wild deer in the perpetuation of TB in cattle is planned.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment she has made of whether the availability of rapid assay methods for bovine tuberculosis would assist in the detection of infection in badgers.  [214118]</p>








<p><a name="st_2"><a name="50209w01.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 A rapid assay method for detection of bovine tuberculosis (TB) infection in badgers is not likely to be available for field use in the short term.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209w01.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_2">The current TB diagnostic test for badgers, the indirect ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) test, is not sufficiently sensitive to provide reliable estimates of TB prevalence in badgers. The sensitivity of the test is 40.7 per cent. and the specificity is 94.3 per cent. when used as a single test.

<a name="50209w01.html_para3">
Defra is funding research into the development of immunological assays for the detection of <i>Mycobacterium bovis</i> (<i>M. bovis</i>) infection in badgers at the Veterinary Laboratories Agency. The project aims to provide Defra with both improved and new diagnostic tools for the identification of <i>M. bovis</i> in badgers. Research is due to end in March 2005.

<p><a name="qn_3"><a name="50209w01.html_wqn3"><b> Mr. Paterson: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what percentage of tuberculosis outbreaks in cattle over the past five years has been attributed by her officials to badger-to-cattle transmission; and what the percentage was in the previous 10 years.  [214119]</p>








<p><a name="st_3"><a name="50209w01.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 It is not possible at present to give a valid estimate. Research designed to inform the Government on the relative importance of cattle and badgers as vectors of the disease is continuing.


</p>







<p><a name="qn_4"><a name="50209w01.html_wqn4"><b> Mr. Paterson: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (1) what assessment she has made of the likely effects of the loss of tuberculosis-free status in the UK on <i>(a)</i> intra-Community trade, <i>(b)</i> trade with Russia and <i>(c)</i> trade with the rest of the world in all UK cattle products, including milk and dairy products;  [214128]



</p>



<p><a name="qnpa_1">(2) whether the change in the number of tuberculosis outbreaks continues at the rate experienced over the last five years; and whether she expects the tuberculosis-free status of the national herd to be lost.  [214129]</p>








<p><a name="st_4"><a name="50209w01.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 The increasing rate in the number of tuberculosis (TB) breakdowns (an average increase of 18 per cent. per annum over the period 1986&#150;2003) will not affect the status of the national herd, because Great Britain, as a whole, does not qualify for officially TB free status according to the criteria set by the EC and the Organisation Internationale des Epizooties. However, individual herds not subjected to TB movement restrictions can be considered Officially TB Free (OTB) for the purposes of international trade in cattle products, including milk and dairy products.


</p>







<p><a name="qn_5"><a name="50209w01.html_wqn5"><b> Mr. Paterson: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs whether the results of the four counties study on bovine tuberculosis in Ireland are consistent with results recorded from the study at East Offaly.  [214138]</p>








<p><a name="st_5"><a name="50209w01.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 In the East Offaly study the evidence of cattle infection was measured by reactor animals per 1,000 tests, whereas the main method in the Four Area Study was the odds of new herd restrictions. There was a marked decline over time in the badger removal areas compared to the reference areas in both studies. By the nature of both studies, however, it is difficult to ascribe this reduction definitely to badger removal.

This partnership is made up of a group of organisations from across the region whose role is to assist food producers to develop their business and market their products. The partnership is pursuing a five-year project (from November 2002 to March 2007) covering a range of activities including support for farmers markets. Funding for these activities (totalling some &#163;5.3 million) comes from the North West Regional Development Agency, Defra&#039;s Rural Enterprise Scheme and from the Merseyside Objective One programme.

The meeting included a discussion on FARMA&#039;s priorities and how these might be supported under various grant schemes&#151;in particular the Rural Enterprise Scheme (RES) and the Agriculture Development Scheme (ADS). Farmers markets at both regional and national level have received funding under those schemes in the past. The meeting also covered how FARMA could raise its profile with the regional development agencies (RDAs).

 The premises in England and Wales which are authorised under the Radioactive Substances Act 1993 to dispose of radioactive wastes by incineration are listed. Each authorisation includes limits on the quantity of radioactivity that can be incinerated, as this determines the public radiological impact. Copies of the authorisations are placed on the Environment Agency&#039;s public registers and are sent to local authorities so that they may be made available for public access. The authorisations generally do not specify the associated quantities of material (in terms of the volume or weight of the waste), and records of those quantities are not collated centrally. Details of releases of radioactivity from authorised premises in England and Wales, including sites where radioactive waste may be incinerated, are published in the Pollution Inventory section of the Environment Agency&#039;s website, www.environment-agency.gov.uk.

<i>[holding answer 8 February 2005]:</i> The United States 800th Military Police brigade has subordinate elements consisting of some 25 units, none of them currently based in the British area of responsibility. Until early 2004, a unit from 800th Brigade was based at Camp Bucca, which is a US camp within MND(SE). It would have been necessary for members of British units regularly to liaise with the US units based at Camp Bucca.

The Campbell Review, published in 2002, provides the latest data on the cost of obtaining an ASBO. It quoted an average cost of &#163;4,800 for an ASBO but this figure was based on a small sample of orders in the early period of their introduction and was skewed by one abnormally complicated and unrepresentative expensive application. Practitioners advise that applications usually cost much less than this and that costs decrease with experience of using the orders. New research, due to be published shortly, shows that costs have reduced significantly since the Campbell Review.

 On 1 February my right hon.

 Supportive parents are vitally important in achieving and maintaining good behaviour in schools. We want parents to be prepared to support the behaviour policy in their child&#039;s school, and to take responsibility for their child&#039;s behaviour.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209w11.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_84">A Pastoral Support Programme is an option schools may use to help pupils to improve their behaviour. Parents of disruptive pupils are involved in the setting up and operation of individual Pastoral Support Programmes for those pupils. The teacher responsible for arranging the programme will discuss with the parents and an LEA representative the causes of concern and what is required of the pupil to put the situation right. Parents should be informed regularly about their child&#039;s progress. In some cases, a managed move to another school may be appropriate and parental agreement would be required for this.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209w11.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_85">When a pupil is reintegrated back into school following a fixed period exclusion, the parents will normally be invited to a reintegration meeting; this provides an opportunity to discuss how best the pupil can return to school and any behavioural problems can be addressed. Where a pupil has been permanently excluded, LEAs should involve parents at an early stage in making arrangements for continuing the child&#039;s education and in discussions about alternative school places. LEAs may, through a parenting contract, offer additional help to parents in this situation such as a resource room or parenting skills training.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209w11.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_86">For some parents, managing their children&#039;s behaviour is not easy, and there is help available to help parents do this more effectively. We are encouraging schools and local authorities to engage more with parents, especially at an early stage, in guiding them towards these sources of help when their children persistently misbehave in school, using the parenting contracts that we have introduced as a framework for such agreements. Where parents are unwilling to engage then it is right that we take action to ensure that they do&#151;through parenting orders administered by the courts.

She also asked that local authorities should hold discussions with their school funding forums about the adequacy of provision for persistently disruptive pupils, including those who have been excluded from school. This will entail a discussion of how much funding should be retained by the LEA and how much should be devolved to schools. Devolution of funds for behaviour support and out-of-school provision to groups of secondary schools should help improve the quality of alternative provision. Officials in the Department will be monitoring progress on these new arrangements.

<p><a name="st_103"><a name="50209w11.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Stephen Twigg: </b> 
 Lancashire has benefited from the significant increases in funding that this Government have committed to education. In 2005&#150;06 all schools will see an increase in their School Formula Spending Share, which includes an element of central funding, of at least 5.5 per cent. per pupil. Lancashire&#039;s increase is significantly higher at 7.0 per cent. per pupil.

<br>

<sup>(6)</sup> The combined LEA and school based expenditure includes all expenditure on the education of children in LEA maintained establishments and pupils educated by the LEA other than in maintained establishments. This includes both school based expenditure and all elements of central LEA expenditure except youth and community and capital expenditure from revenue (CERA).<br>

<sup>(7)</sup> 1997&#150;96 financial data are taken from (pre local government reorganisation) Cheshire LEA&#039;s Revenue Outturn spending return submitted to the ODPM. 2003&#150;04 financial data are taken from Warrington LEA&#039;s Section 52 Outturn Statement (Table A) submitted to the Department for Education and Skills. 2003&#150;04 is as reported by the LEA and is subject to change<br>

<sup>(8)</sup> Pupil figures include all pre-primary pupils, including those under 5s funded by the LEA and being educated in private settings, pupils educated in maintained mainstream schools and other LEA maintained pupils. The pupil data for pupils attending maintained nursery, primary, secondary and special schools are taken from the DfES Annual Schools Census. Private voluntary and independent (PVI) under 5 pupil numbers are taken from the Early Years census but are only included in the 2003&#150;04 pupil count. Other LEA maintained pupils include all pupils attending schools not maintained by the Authority for whom the Authority is paying full tuition fees, or educated otherwise than in schools and pupil referral units under arrangements made by the Authority drawn from the Form 8b submitted to the DfES. Also inducted as other LEA maintained pupils are all pupils attending pupil referral units who are not registered at a maintained mainstream school drawn from the DfES Annual Schools Census. All pupil numbers are adjusted to be on a financial year basis.<br>

<sup>(9)</sup> Local government reorganisation (LGR) took place on the 1 April 1998 where pre-LGR Cheshire LEA was split into Cheshire LEA Halton LEA and Warrington LEA. As a result, the 1997&#150;98 data is for pre-LGR Cheshire LEA and the 2003&#150;04 data is for Warrington LEA These two sets of figures are not comparable as Halton and Cheshire LEAs have higher unit cost 



than Warrington LEA which has the effect of inflating the 1997&#150;98 unit cost. In 1998&#150;99 (the first year a breakdown is available) the unit cost was &#163;2,700 in Cheshire, &#163;2,730 in Halton and &#163;2,310 in Warrington.<br>

<sup>(10)</sup> Spending in 1997&#150;96 reflects the transfer of monies from local government to central Government for the nursery vouchers scheme. These were returned to local government from 1998&#150;99.<br>

Note:<br>

Figures are rounded to the nearest &#163;10 as reported by the LEA at 7 February 2005. <br>

<i>[holding answer 8 February 2005]:</i> Schools are not required to make a baseline assessment. The Foundation Stage Profile replaced baseline assessment in 2003. It is the statutory instrument for assessing children at the end of Reception Year against progress towards the Early Learning Goals within the Foundation Stage Curriculum. The Foundation Stage Profile Handbook gives practitioners guidance on completing the assessment. The QCA Foundation Stage and Key Stage 1 Assessment and Reporting Arrangements give guidance to schools on meeting the statutory requirements.

<sup>(21)</sup> Financial data used to determine budget is taken to the nearest pound.<br>

<sup>(22)</sup> Due to changes in data items recorded on Section 52, school level balance data is now reported as the combination of any unspent allocations (including unspent Standards Fund grants) and the cumulative balance of income less expenditure from revenue funding sources during the financial year and any balances carried forward from previous years. Previously unspent allocations were excluded from the calculation of school balances but from 2003&#150;04 onwards we are not able to split these out and as a result these figures for 1999&#150;2000 to 2002&#150;03 may differ from figures released previously by the department.<br>

<sup>(23)</sup> School level data has only been collected by the DfES since the inception of Section 52 in 1999&#150;2000.<br>

<sup>(24)</sup> Figures for 1999&#150;2000 to 2002&#150;03 are for LEA maintained primary, secondary and special schools. 2003&#150;04 figures also include those LEA maintained nursery schools with delegated budgets.<br>

<sup>(25)</sup> 2003&#150;04 data is still undergoing data cleaning and is therefore subject to charges by the LEA which may after the results for that period.<br>

 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has had no such discussions since the June 2003 pay and modernisation agreement was signed, other than to discuss the UK-wide approach to any use of the powers contained in sections 32 and 33 of the Fire and Rescue Services Act 2004.

 The current Area Cost Adjustment has been in place since 2003&#150;04. While it is generally recognised to be an improvement on the previous arrangements for reflecting additional costs to local government arising from wage differentials, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is aware of the concerns about its impact expressed by some authorities. We will therefore be ready to discuss with local government the case for a review of the ACA alongside other priorities for the forthcoming formulae review.

Note:<br>

The figures for 2003&#150;04 and 2004&#150;05 differ from those for the earlier years in that they are budget, rather than outturn, figures, and because they also include: (a) non-domestic rates collection costs in excess of the allowance made against contributions to the pool; (b) the costs of collection of domestic and non-domestic rates due for the period up to 31 March 1990; and (c) the costs of collection of community charges. Outturn figures for 2002&#150;03 indicate however, that council tax collection costs accounted for almost 97 per cent. of the combined total nationally.<br>

 what the reasons were for the decision not to make negotiation compulsory in disputes between divorced or separated parents.  [210230]</p>








<p><a name="st_263"><a name="50209w30.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Leslie: </b> 
<i> [pursuant to the reply, 27 January 2005, Official Report, c.459W]:</i> The Government published &#039;Parental Separation: Children&#039;s Needs and Parents&#039; Responsibilities, Next Steps&#039; on 18 January, which sets out plans to implement a range of measures to help separating parents in dispute about future parenting arrangements, reach agreement.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209w30.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_205">The Government&#039;s plans include improvements in the information available to parents and greater use of methods such as the Collaborative Law Model, Mediation, In-Court Conciliation and the Family Resolutions Pilot Project. The Government intends strongly to promote these methods as better ways to 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>9 Feb 2005 : Column 1608W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
reach agreement than through contested court hearings. All publicly funded clients will have to show that they have considered mediation. Lawyers undertaking collaborative law work in the proposed pilot will be publicly funded, if their clients are eligible. Those same lawyers would not be funded by legal aid for any subsequent litigation if an out of court settlement is not reached under the Collaborative Law Scheme and the case proceeded to court. New lawyers would need to be instructed for the court proceedings and they would be funded separately, subject to their clients&#039; eligibility. In addition, the Government, Senior Judiciary and Rules Committee plan to review court rules and practice directions so that the strongest possible encouragement is given to parties to participate in forms of dispute resolution.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209w30.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_206">We do not plan to make these schemes compulsory in every case, as an essential part of the process is that people come to them voluntarily and are therefore willing to participate. Further, in some cases, including those where domestic violence has been an issue, it would not always be appropriate to impose mediation on separating parents.

 As a result of provisions in the Representation of the People Act 2000, service personnel have been entitled to register to vote by completing a service declaration, as previously, or alternatively as either ordinary or overseas voters.

<p><a name="st_265"><a name="50209w30.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Leslie: </b> 
 Regulation 23 of the Representation of the People (England and Wales) Regulations 2001 provides that an electoral registration officer may require any person to give information required for the purposes of that officer&#039;s duties in maintaining electoral registers.

 Regulation 25(2) of the Representation of the People (England and Wales) Regulations 2001 requires electoral registration officers to send annually a written reminder to service personnel who are registered by way of a service declaration of the need to make a fresh declaration if they wish to remain registered under this method. The reminder is sent to the address at which such personnel are recorded as being most recently resident. Service personnel who are registered as ordinary voters in respect of an address in the United Kingdom will be sent an annual canvass form to be completed and returned to the relevant electoral registration officer.
