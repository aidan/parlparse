To ask the Solicitor-General what request the Spanish authorities have made to the Crown Prosecution Service to seek leave for judicial review of the Home Secretary's decision in respect of Senator Pinochet; and if he will make a statement.  [106408]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00124w01.html_spmin0"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 The Crown Prosecution Service is acting as the agent of the Kingdom of Spain in relation to the conduct of the Spanish request for the extradition of Senator Pinochet. It would therefore be inappropriate to reveal details of any instructions received in relation to this matter since The Crown Prosecution Service is under a duty to preserve solicitor-client confidentiality. It is for the Kingdom of Spain to release any details of their instructions to the Crown Prosecution Service.

<P>
<a name="00124w01.html_spmin10"><B>The Prime Minister:</B> 
 The Government are clear about the benefits to the United Kingdom of its membership of the European Union. Membership of the European Union brings significant benefits to the British economy. Over half our trade in goods is with the EU, with eight of our top 10 trade partners in Europe. In 1998 trade in goods was worth some &#163;95.4 billion. Membership gives us access to a single market of 372 million people--the largest and richest market in the world. Over three and a half million jobs are directly linked to trade with the EU with thousands of jobs being created as a result of Britain's position as the gateway to countries outside the Union. The UK is now the top location in the EU for foreign direct inward investment. At the same time we benefit as consumers, with Single Market competition bringing lower prices and greater choice, and the Single Market rules ensuring proper protection for consumers. In addition, we have secured European Structural funding worth &#163;10 billion for 2000-06 for regeneration and economic development in the UK regions. Our farmers also benefit from the &#163;5 billion a year in aid under the Common Agricultural Policy.

 Iran and her neighbouring countries represent an area of strategic importance to the United Kingdom for a number of reasons. Among these are the region's history of political instability and conflict, the importance of the region for world energy resources, and its position across important global communications routes. Iran also straddles the major route by which heroin reaches the United Kingdom from Afghanistan.

 Businesses specialising in head de-boning were severely affected when tighter restrictions on cattle heads were introduced in March 1996 in line with advice from the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee.

 The Government are aware of the serious flooding that occurred over the Christmas period. We sympathise with all those affected and pay tribute to the work done by the Environment Agency and others to mitigate the effects. Apart from grants towards approved capital works, the Ministry does not contribute to the cost of the Environment Agency's flood defence work. The great majority of this work is funded by levies on local authorities, for which funding is provided through the Revenue Support Grant and Standard Spending Assessments arrangements. The cost of any emergency

flood prevention measures in the South-West will need to be met through these existing mechanisms. If studies identify the need for future capital works, MAFF funding will be considered against the normal criteria and national priority assessments.

 Under the Breeding and Sale of Dogs (Welfare) Act 1999, which came into force on 30 December 1999, the keeper of a licensed dog breeding establishment can only lawfully sell a dog either from his or her own premises direct to a person who it is believed will not be selling it on, or to the keeper of a licensed pet shop or a Scottish rearing establishment.

The permitted sales outlets are, however, subject to stringent local authority licensing controls aimed at safeguarding the health and welfare of the animals involved. In addition, dogs sold through licensed pet shops/rearing establishments must wear a collar and identifying tag, to ensure that the originating breeder can be traced in all cases and not least by prospective purchasers wishing to make checks on a dog's provenance.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what plans the Government have to combat domestic violence suffered by men.  [105844]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00124w05.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The Government regard all forms of domestic violence as unacceptable, whether it is perpetrated by men on women, women on men or within same-sex relationships. The position of men who experience abuse is recognised in, for example, our 'Break the Chain' leaflet for domestic violence survivors and those such as family, friends and neighbours who might be able to help them. The evidence is, however, that, by comparison with men, women are more likely to experience domestic violence over a lifetime, more likely to experience repeat victimisation, more likely to be injured and to seek medical help, more likely to experience frightening threats, and more likely to be frightened and upset.

<a name="00124w05.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The most reliable figures available are from the 1996 British Crime Survey, which estimated that 650,000 men aged 16 to 59 had been assaulted by a current or former partner in 1995, of which 170,000 suffered some injury. 95 per cent. of the men assaulted had been assaulted by a female on the most recent occasion. 180,000 men said they had experienced frightening threats from a female or male partner (figures not available separately).

 The Association of Police Authorities estimated that the cost to the police service in England and Wales of changes in national insurance contributions could be around &#163;23 million in 1999-2000. These additional costs were taken into account when police authorities set their budgets for 1999-2000.

 Yes. The intention is to provide a statutory framework to regulate the disclosure of communications data to investigating agencies. The grounds upon which disclosure of communications data may be required will be consistent with those contained in existing data protection legislation, and use of this power will be audited by an independent Commissioner, to ensure it is used only where necessary and proportionate to the matter under investigation.

Out-turn for 1999-2000 is likely to be slightly lower; and estimates for 2000-01 are likely to be reduced in the light of the levies I decided for the two organisations on 10 January.

In 1994-95 and 1995-96 asylum support costs were met by the Department of Social Security. These costs were &#163;360 million and &#163;420 million respectively. Changes to the Department of Social Security benefits in 1996 removed support to those asylum seekers who applied for support "in country". Support for asylum seekers was made available under the terms of the National Assistance Act 1948.

 The available information relates to decisions taken on applications for indefinite leave to enter or remain in the United Kingdom, excluding those cases where indefinite leave to remain is refused but limited leave is granted in some capacity. Data for 1995 to the end of the first half of 1999 are given in the table, together with an estimated average time which such decisions took in 1995-98. Following reorganisation of caseworking practices at the beginning of 1999, the time taken to process applications for variation of leave, which includes applications for indefinite leave to remain, is affected by a number of factors, including the complexity of individual cases. More than half of applications for variation of leave can be processed under "fast track" procedures. Such cases are currently being determined within about a week of receipt, but applications where further inquiries are needed may take considerably longer. Streamlined procedures have, however, been introduced throughout the Integrated Casework Directorate to speed up consideration of all applications.

 The Department does not hold figures on the numbers of secondary school pupils receiving lessons in entrepreneurship. Entrepreneurship does not currently form part of the National Curriculum, and thus it is up to individual schools to decide whether, and how, to teach it.

<a name="00124w07.html_para1">However the revised National Curriculum--most of which will come into force from September 2000--will encourage pupils to think creatively and critically, and will encourage innovation and enterprise.

 The DfEE has already provided a significant amount of support for the work of Life Education Centres (LECs).

We are providing a further &#163;7.5 million of support this year and in 2000-01, through the Standards Fund, to assist all schools to deliver effective drug education. It is for individual schools to decide on the detailed content and organisation of drug education programmes in schools; Life Education Centres is one of a number of possible programmes they may adopt.

 The Department is unable to compile a list of local education authorities who operate a single and two point of entry to infant and primary school reception classes. The timing of admission to reception classes may vary from school to school because in some cases responsibility for admission arrangements rest with the individual schools' governing bodies.

[105836]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00124w08.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Wills: </B> 
 The &#163;15 million made available for the 'Computers Within Reach' initiative is entirely focused on maximising the subsidy on the recycling process, to enable computers to be made available at the lowest personal cost to those who could not otherwise afford it. The Department recognises that recipients' needs, circumstances and priorities will change during the lifetime of the scheme--for example, a job-seeker may initially wish to work off-line to produce a CV and develop word-processing, database and spreadsheet skills in order to improve employability. In order to meet this range of need, the computers will all be of a high minimum specification, including 56k modem, enabling recipients to control costs in using them on or off-line as they prefer. As usage will vary, subsidised funding will not be made available to cover telephone lines or calls. Electricity and paper costs are likely to be minimal, and the cost of the bureaucracy to administer them would not represent value for money.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what is the procedure which must be followed by local education authorities before closing special needs schools; who makes the final decision in such instances; and if he will make a statement.  [105577]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00124w08.html_spnew6"><B> Jacqui Smith </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 19 January 2000]:</i> A local education authority wishing to close a special school must first consult all interested parties, including the school itself, parents who have children at the school and any other local education authorities placing children at the school. If, after consultation, the local education authority decide to proceed with closure they must publish notices advising of their intention and providing information about alternative provision to be made for pupils who would be displaced by the closure. The notice must also be sent to whomever will be deciding the proposals. Usually, this will be the local School Organisation Committee; exceptionally, where a local School Organisation Plan has not been agreed, the decision will fall to the Secretary of State.
<P>

<a name="00124w08.html_para1">Following publication of a proposal there is a statutory period during which anyone can send objections to the proposal to the local education authority. The authority then have a further statutory period in which to send their comments on the objections to the School Organisation Committee (or the Secretary of State).
<P>

<a name="00124w08.html_para2">The School Organisation Committee's decision on statutory proposals, or that of the Secretary of State, is final. However, in cases where the School Organisation Committee cannot reach a unanimous view, the proposal must be referred to an independent adjudicator for decision.

<a name="00124w08.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Boswell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment how many students with special educational needs receive an assessment and have a plan prepared for their transition from school to further education, as a proportion of those so entitled; and what action he is taking to ensure that local authorities carry out their statutory obligations in this area.  [106039]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00124w08.html_spnew7"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 This information is not collected centrally. We would however expect LEAs and schools to have regard to their statutory duty to carry out a transitional review of a young person's statement of special educational needs following his or her 14th birthday; and to produce a transition plan covering all aspects of the young person's future development. The evidence is that LEAs and schools are meeting their obligations in this area. My Department is however ready to investigate any cases brought to its attention in which a school or LEA is not so complying.

 There is no Wilton Park paper with that exact title. However two papers on the subject of EMU, summarising conferences held in October 1998 and May 1999, are available on Wilton Park website www.wiltonpark.org.uk.

<a name="00124w10.html_para0">Wilton Park brings together people of all viewpoints to discuss topical issues. Although its finances are underwritten by my Department, its academic independence is guaranteed. Its reports on EMU as on other subjects reflect the personal accounts of the chairman and rapporteur of the range of views expressed at its conferences. Government policy on EMU is clear. The determining factor underpinning any Government decision on EMU membership is whether the economic benefits from joining are clear and unambiguous.

<a name="00124w12.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 Financial Assistance to companies in non-Assisted Areas is restricted to SMEs. The Secretary of State announced on 10 November 1999, <i>Official Report,</i> column 629W, proposals for a new Enterprise Grant scheme for SMEs which will be available in certain specified non-Assisted Areas, as well as the Assisted Areas. This is a discretionary scheme offering a grant of up to 15 per cent. of fixed capital costs on projects of less than &#163;500,000 (7&#189; per cent. in the case of medium sized firms in the specified non-Assisted Areas), with a maximum grant of &#163;75,000. Both new businesses and existing companies seeking to expand are eligible to apply. Further details of the scheme can be found in the scheme brochure, copies of which have been placed in the Library of the House. In addition, the Small Firms Loan Guarantee Scheme continues to support small firms nationally by providing a Government Guarantee, against default by borrowers, to high street banks and other financial bodies. Loans under the Scheme can be between &#163;5,000 and &#163;250,000 to both new and existing businesses which are looking to expand.

 Measuring the effect of hypothetical levels of the national minimum wage on employment, price levels and Government expenditure is a highly complex task and the impacts would be difficult to quantify. For the last nine months the Low Pay Commission has carried out a thorough empirical study of the impact of the actual minimum wage since its introduction, and that report will be published soon. Neither the Government nor the Low Pay Commission

 The automation of the post office network, which is due for completion by the spring of 2001, will enable the Post Office to extend its arrangements with the high street banks to offer a range of banking facilities at post offices. This will mean that benefit recipients who wish to access their benefits in cash at post offices will continue to be able to do so, both before and after the migration of benefit payments to automated credit transfer from 2003, while other bank customers will benefit from the wider availability of banking facilities, particularly in rural areas.

 The Department's Unit charged with promoting science, engineering and technology (SET) for women, which was set up in response to one of "The Rising Tide" recommendations, continues to monitor progress on the other recommendations in that report.
<P>

<a name="00124w13.html_para2">There is a continuing problem with the under-representation of women in SET, especially in the physical sciences and engineering, and the Unit works with other organisations in the field to seek to redress this. Recent initiatives include the ATHENA project, a joint project with the Higher Education Funding Councils and the Committee of Vice Chancellors and Principals, targeted at addressing barriers to progression in higher education, and promoting a positive image for women in SET careers through the recent poster campaign targeted at 13-year-old girls. Further information and links to other relevant organisations are available via the Unit's website at www.set4women.gov.uk.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry how much debt service he estimates will be received from each of the heavily-indebted poor countries in the financial years <i>(a)</i> 1999-2000 and <i>(b)</i> 2000-01. [105745]<P>

<a name="00124w13.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 The UK has debt agreements with 32 heavily indebted poor countries (HIPCs). The table shows payments due to ECGD under these agreements together with an estimate of amounts likely to be received by the end of each year, assuming the schedules remain unchanged. However a number of these HIPCs will benefit from further debt reduction and rescheduling in the current year under the enhanced HIPC Initiative. This provides for up to 90 per cent. debt reduction multilaterally, or more in the case of need. Additionally some will benefit from the Chancellor's recent announcement that the UK will unilaterally write off 100 per cent. of the debt in certain circumstances. The extent of further debt reduction and the timing thereof for each country depends on a number of factors. Consequently it is not yet possible to gauge with any accuracy the effect on the current estimates.

 <i>[holding answer 20 January 2000]:</i> We will continue to work with Oftel and the European Commission to ensure that the regulatory framework promotes competition and investment in communications infrastructure and services. This year will see the grant of licences for third generation mobile and broadband fixed wireless services which will give a major boost to competition in broadband services. BT is also investing heavily in upgrading its local loop so that competing service providers can provide new broadband services from this Spring. Competing telecoms operators will also be able to provide such services over unbundled local loop from July 2001.

In subsequent disclosure on its annual return, a company is required either to give its Standard Industrial Classification code, which indicates its main activities, or to give a verbal description of them. Those companies that are obliged to file a directors' report as part of their annual accounts must include a description of their main activities in that report. All these documents are available for public inspection.

 None of the seven nations involved in the A400M project has made a contractual commitment to purchase the aircraft although two nations have declared a preference for the A400M. Each of the nations is addressing, within their national assessment programmes, the issue of the number of aircraft needed to fulfil their national air transport requirements but have not yet made firm decisions. We expect the aircraft selected to fulfil our Future Transport Aircraft requirement to enter service with the RAF in the latter half of this decade.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how many of his Department's <i>(a)</i> civil servants by grade and <i>(b)</i> service men and women by rank are (i) currently on gardening leave and (ii) have been on gardening leave for two months or more; and at what cost to his budget. [104468]<P>

<P>
<a name="00124w16.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Kilfoyle: </B> 
 Civilian staff on gardening leave are individuals who are genuinely surplus because there is no suitable employment for them, or because their circumstances prevent them from taking up that employment. My Department monitors the position routinely and the latest available figures, excluding the Meteorological Office and Defence Evaluation and Research Agency are set out as follows:

<a name="00124w16.html_para1">The approximate cost of these staff to the MOD budget this financial year, calculated on the basis of the length of time on gardening leave, is &#163;314,000.
<P>

<a name="00124w16.html_para2">Although these figures represent a tiny proportion of the 100,000 civilian staff employed by the Ministry of Defence, my Department takes the matter very seriously. Individuals are placed on gardening leave only as a last resort and the aim, wherever possible, is to find work for staff in between appointments.
<P>

<a name="00124w16.html_para3">Although not recognised across all three Services, the term "gardening leave" (or "Wait Appointment" in the Royal Navy) is understood to apply to those who are fit and available for duty but for whom no post is currently available, and who are awaiting appointment. The amount of time involved for individuals is usually very short, and personnel move in and out of this category on a daily basis.

 Requests for licensable back-up support for existing military hardware overseas are considered case by case in line with the criteria which the Foreign Secretary announced to the House on 28 July 1997, <i>Official Report,</i> columns 26-29W and the EU Code of Conduct on Arms Exports.

Funding for the recent refurbishment of the Hurricane was raised privately. Similar funding for the Spitfire is in the process of being raised.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if a modification programme for the SA80 weapon system was implemented following the proposals from Heckler and Koch referred to in the letter from the Minister for Defence Procurement to the Defence Committee of 2 June 1997; what estimate was submitted by Heckler and Koch of the cost of their proposals; and if the SA80s used in the Kosovo campaign were modified as a result of these proposals.  [106173]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00124w19.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Kilfoyle: </B> 
 The Design Authority for SA80, formerly Royal Ordnance but now Heckler and Koch UK (Ltd.), was tasked in 1996 to investigate the reliability of the SA80 weapon system. Heckler and Koch reported in 1998 that there might be underlying problems with the reliability of the system and presented their proposals for modifications. A contract was placed in mid-1998 with Heckler and Koch for the modification of 200 weapons to be used for trials to determine the effectiveness of these modifications. Deliveries of these modified weapons were made in January 1999. The MOD conducted user trials in hot and cold climatic conditions with a range of NATO ammunition types. The trials were completed in July 1999 and the formal Design Authority report was delivered to the MOD in late December 1999. The trials confirmed that, after modification, there were significant improvements in the reliability of both the SA80 rifle and Light Support Weapon. Urgent work is in hand to assess the wider implications of the Design Authority report, including the cost, and we expect to make a decision on any modification programme by the end of March 2000.

 Prior to the closure at Nancekuke, the chemical plant was decontaminated and dismantled.

As part of a regular land quality assessment, recent surface soil and water samples were analysed and showed no signs of contamination from toxic agents. We are currently consulting with representatives of local authorities, the Environment Agency for England and Wales and other interested parties, how to take forward the land quality assessment work.

the implementation of trade agreements which it fulfils with resources from its core budget. My Department has committed &#163;16 million of trade related technical assistance to developing countries, of which details have been placed in the House of Commons Library. This includes payments to a trust fund at the WTO to develop the capacity of developing countries to fulfil their responsibilities as WTO members and implement agreements. It also includes support for the capacity building programmes in UNCTAD and the ITC, and research to assess aspects of the effect of trade liberalisation on developing countries, for example, the effects of trade liberalisation on poverty, and the impact of WTO agreements such as the Sanitary and Phytosanitary Agreement. Studies on the impact of the Uruguay Round trade agreements by the World Bank and other bodies show that developing countries should benefit, relative to their GDP, as much as, if not more than, developed countries. Similar studies in advance of the expected new Round by the European Commission and others, offer a similar prognosis.

<P>
<a name="00124w20.html_spnew6"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 The WTO, World Bank and the academic community have completed many reports on the economic impact of the World Trade Organisation trading regime. Ex-post assessment of the impact of changes to the world trade rules agreed under the Uruguay Round presents problems as it is almost impossible to disentangle the ex-post impact of multilateral trade liberalisation from the many other factors that have an impact on world trade and developing country economies. However, economic modelling can help to give some indication of the possible benefits which have been estimated to be between $13 billion and $125 billion for developing countries.
<P>

<a name="00124w20.html_para6">This research work also suggests that developing countries stand to gain at least as much as developed countries from the Uruguay Round as a proportion of GDP, although, the distribution of benefits among developing countries is not evenly spread. South East Asia does well, there are also benefits for South Asia, but sub-Saharan Africa may face a small welfare loss.

 My Department has committed &#163;100 million to the humanitarian and rehabilitation programme in Kosovo since March 1999.

 The overriding criterion in the field of development is the contribution which the UN and its funds, programmes and specialised agencies make to achieving the International Development Targets for poverty eradication, agreed by the entire UN membership. Better UN performance will require continuing efforts to focus the work of UN development agencies where they can be most effective in helping meet the Targets, to link resources more closely to objectives and outputs, and to strengthen co-ordination within the UN family and between the UN and other development institutions, particularly the World Bank. The UN must also improve its response to conflict, which threatens poverty reduction in many poor countries and continue to work with others to develop and implement the statistical systems needed to measure year-on-year progress towards the Targets. The UK will continue to support the UN and its development agencies in improving their effectiveness on all these fronts.

 In the field of Development the process of institutional modernisation started by the UN Secretary General in 1997 has improved the impact of the UN, though much remains to be done. New and improved strategic co-ordinating mechanisms have been established to enhance the UN's development policy cohesion. The pilot UN Development Assistance Framework has begun to increase co-ordination between UN agencies and between the UN and other development institutions at country level and will be extended rapidly to more countries. Agencies such as the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the UN Industrial Development Organisation (UNIDO) have established clearer objectives, a sharper focus on clearly defined core activities, sound finances and better management. UNDP and UNICEF have made progress in developing management systems that link resources more closely to objectives and results. We are encouraging all UN development agencies to modernise their management and organisation to increase their effectiveness in helping meet the International Development Targets.

 No such assessment has been made as liability for child support is not linked to whether a non-resident parent has contact with his child(ren).
<P>

<a name="00124w22.html_para12">However, research <sup>1</sup> Shows that there is a consistent relationship between contact and the payment of child maintenance, although it is difficult to establish causality. Those who are currently paying maintenance tend to have a greater level of contact with their children than those who do not. Additionally, research <sup>2</sup> suggests that non-resident parents would be less likely to pay the full amount of their maintenance assessment if they lost contact with their children.

<a name="00124w23.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Bayley: </B> 
 The benefit rules permit limited work to be undertaken by people in certain circumstances without affecting their right to claim incapacity benefits. Work undertaken as a councillor is disregarded for the purposes of determining whether a person is incapable of work. However, Incapacity Benefit is reduced pound for pound where the net amount of the councillor's allowance exceeds a set limit, currently &#163;49.50. In assessing the net amount of the councillor's allowance to be taken into account any expenses incurred in connection with the person's membership of the council are ignored. Such expenses are not specified in regulations but may include items such as clothes, travel costs and telephone calls.
<P>

<a name="00124w23.html_para2">We propose to bring forward regulations in April as part of the annual up-rating exercise to increase the councillor's allowance limit from &#163;49.50 to &#163;58.50. This significant increase will align it with the therapeutic earnings limit in Incapacity Benefit.

 The purpose of the habitual residence test is to ensure that the income related benefits are paid to people with reasonably close ties to the United Kingdom and an intention to settle here. Each case is considered on its own merits. Guidance to decision makers and caselaw stresses the need to consider a wide range of factors, including the reason for a person coming (or returning) to the United Kingdom, the length of their stay, a settled intention to reside and any previous links with the country. The weight given to each factor will depend upon the individual's circumstances. Guidance to decision makers is contained in the Decision Makers Guide Volume 2 at paragraph 070719.

 <i>[holding answer 17 January 2000]:</i> Sport England have proposed a facilities plan for the provision of Olympic sized swimming pools, in association with the Amateur Swimming Association. In which the assessment of the most appropriate location and geographical coverage are central to decisions being made on final location. Sport England ensure that the key factors needed to sustain a pool of Olympic size are taken into account, including: a critical mass of population to sustain its use; whether the configuration of the pool to Olympic scale best meets the needs for the local population; and the location and needs of high performance swimmers.
<P>

<a name="00124w25.html_para0">There are currently 11 50m pools in England (including two under construction).

Sport England's facilities plan identifies the need for new 50m pools in the North East, Merseyside, Birmingham, Portsmouth, London and Leeds. The demand for a high performance swimming centre at Sheffield is also under consideration.

 The Government's review of the statutory targets on the subtitling, signing and audio description of programmes on digital terrestrial television will begin in early summer this year. We will be consulting the Independent Television Commission, the broadcasters, those who provide subtitling, signing and audio description services and consumer groups representing viewers with sensory disabilities. Once the review is completed in November 2000, we will publish the results.
<P>

<a name="00124w25.html_para1">The review will not include analogue television to which different arrangements apply. The Broadcasting Act 1990 set a target of 50 per cent. of subtitling of programmes by 1998 (for Channel 3) and by the fifth anniversary of its launch (for Channel 5). Thereafter it is for the Independent Television Commission (ITC) to set targets which are reasonably practicable. The Commission has set a target of 80 per cent. of subtitling of programmes by 2004 for Channel 3 and it will review this target in 2001.

 <i>[holding answer 17 January 2000]:</i> I have had no recent discussions with train and coach operators in the North West. However, I have started a regular dialogue with rail and coach operators at a national level through the English Tourism Council's Transport Task Force. This was set up recently as part of the Government's national strategy for tourism, Tomorrow's Tourism.

 The 1980 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction came into force between the United Kingdom and Greece in 1993. From 1993 to the end of 1999 there were 25 cases of abduction from England and Wales to Greece with 11 returns (44 per cent. of applications made) and 48 cases of abduction to England and Wales with 22 returns (46 per cent. of applications received. Cases may involve more than one child.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department when the next international review by member state signatories of the Hague Convention on child abduction will take place; and if he will press for common procedures to be enforced in signatory countries.  [105845]<P>

<P>
<a name="00124w26.html_spnew3"><B> Jane Kennedy: </B> 
 The next Special Commission of the Hague Conference to review the 1980 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction will be held in the spring of 2001. Contracting states of the Hague Convention have committed themselves to operate the provisions of the Convention and to do so in accordance with the terms under which it has been incorporated into their national law. The Government recognise that the operation of international conventions involves the alignment of different jurisdictions and different traditions of law and society.

<a name="00124w26.html_wqn4"><B> Ms Oona King: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department how many children have been abducted to each of the signatory states of the Hague Convention since the United Kingdom's accession; and what proportion of such children has been returned by each of those states.  [105846]<P>

<P>
<a name="00124w26.html_spnew4"><B> Jane Kennedy: </B> 
 Figures for the number of cases of abduction from England and Wales dealt with under the 1980 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction since the Convention came into force between the United Kingdom and each contracting state, and the percentage of returns, are set out in the table. Cases may involve more than one child. Cases may be resolved satisfactorily between the parents otherwise than by a return.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00124w26.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="00124w26.html_para0">The sale of Gammahydroxybutyrate (GHB) is governed by the Medicines Act 1968 and prohibited except under licence. GHB is not currently controlled under international drugs conventions or the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971, and so possession does not constitute an offence.
<P>

<a name="00124w26.html_para1">The Government keep drug misuse under review and the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs has a statutory responsibility to advise the Government on such matters. The Council has considered the misuse of GHB on several occasions, most recently in May 1998. It decided against recommending that GHB be controlled under the Misuse of Drugs Act. At present, the World Health Organisation are looking at GHB and the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction is considering its misuse within the European Union. The possible use of GHB in cases of drug rape is being considered within a Home Office sponsored Metropolitan Police research initiative into drug-assisted rape. The findings of these various pieces of research will be considered as part of the ongoing review process to which I have referred.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00124w26.html_spnew8"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 The Emerging Findings report on the National Service Framework for Coronary Heart Disease, published in November 1998, proposes a national standard for 'call-to-needle time' of 60 minutes for thrombolysis. This covers the total National Health Service response time from the point when the patient seeks professional help to the time when treatment is started if it is indicated.
<P>

<a name="00124w26.html_para2">There is no national audit of thrombolytic therapy in place at present. An audit undertaken in 15 hospitals in 1997, the latest year for which data are available, found that 14 per cent. of eligible patients received thrombolytic therapy within 60 minutes of calling for help, and the proportion treated within 30 minutes of hospital arrival ('door-to-needle' time) was 33.2 per cent.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00124w27.html_spnew2"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 The number of admissions to National Health Service hospitals in England with a diagnosis of malnutrition was 3,581 for the financial year 1989-90 and 6,293 for the financial year 1997-98. Figures are not available on a comparable basis for the earlier years.
<P>

<a name="00124w27.html_para1">Research studies have shown that 40 per cent. of adults patients and 15 per cent. of children are malnourished on admission to hospital, indicating that prevalence in the general population may be higher than the admissions figures suggest.
<P>

<a name="00124w27.html_para2">The Government's National Diet and Nutrition Survey programme monitors the diet and nutritional status of the population of Great Britain and has shown that while most people are adequately nourished, there has been a persistent rise in obesity. In 1997, the Health Survey for England showed that 17 per cent. of men and 20 per cent. of women in England were obese compared to 6 per cent. and 8 per cent. of those studied in the earliest previous study in 1980.

 We are fully committed to the promotion of breastfeeding, which is uniformly accepted as the best form of nutrition for infants. We also firmly believe that it is important that women and their partners are able to make a fully informed choice on how to feed their babies based on accurate and consistent information. This means that women should have access to information about all infant feeding practices through the relevant health care professional.

In particular, their expertise will be utilised to increase the incidence of breastfeeding among groups where breastfeeding rates are lowest, for example, those on low income, and to ensure that all mothers have the information and support they need to make informed infant feeding choices.
<P>

<a name="00124w27.html_para4">The infant feeding advisers are also managing a substantial project budget that will include taking forward developmental work on a model questionnaire for collecting information locally on monitoring breastfeeding rates, administer a small grant scheme to help evaluate projects which provide best practice on increasing breastfeeding rates among mothers on low incomes, take forward initiatives on a parent friendly approach to infant feeding and develop educational resources and promotional materials to promote breastfeeding that would appeal to varying groups in the population.
<P>

<a name="00124w27.html_para5">We also promote breastfeeding in the following ways. The National Network of Breastfeeding Co-ordinators has been established to promote breastfeeding at a local level and to share ideas nationally with a view to increasing both the number of mothers breastfeeding and the length of time they continue to breastfeed. Each year the four UK Health Departments support National Breastfeeding Awareness Week to increase public awareness of the benefits of breastfeeding, which will this year take place between 14-20 May.
<P>

<a name="00124w27.html_para6">The Department provides financial support to the four main voluntary organisations in this area, the National Childbirth Trust, La Leche League, Breastfeeding Network and the Association of Breastfeeding Mothers. Close links are also kept with UNICEF's Baby Friendly Initiative (BFI) which includes a Departmental observer sitting on the Steering Committee of the UK BFI. The Department offers support for research into breastfeeding through the Quinquennial Surveys of Infant Feeding Practice; a new survey will be undertaken this year. The Department also receives and publishes expert advice on breastfeeding through its advisory committees, such as COMA's Panel on Child and Maternal Nutrition.
<P>

<a name="00124w27.html_para7">Also, as part of the Department's research initiative on health inequalities, we are supporting a study aimed at identifying the barriers to breastfeeding in low income groups. This should also help us to understand what influences a woman's decision whether to breastfeed or not. In turn, this will help us to develop and test new policies to promote and improve the health of babies from low income families. This research will report in late 2001.

This is from a total of &#163;12 million allocated to health authorities for the development of new drug treatment services. Announcements on the allocation of funding in 2000-01 and 2001-02 for the development of new drug treatment services are yet to be made. Three priority areas have currently been identified: development of primary care based treatment services and support for drug misusers; an increase in the provision of treatment services for young people who misuse drugs, particularly the under-18s, and prevention services for vulnerable young people (among the under 25s); and implementation of a hepatitis B immunisation programme targeted at drug misusers most at risk of the infection.

 It is not possible to give a total figure for the cost of immunisation for the purpose of travel abroad each year. Records are not kept of the numbers of people immunised and data on prescription items are limited as they do not differentiate between vaccine given for travel or for other reasons and they do not differentiate between primary courses (usually consisting of several doses of vaccine) and booster doses. The number of prescription items dispensed in England and the net ingredient costs for vaccines that may be given for the purposes of travel are given in the table.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

Please note that the data up to 1990 are not strictly consistent with data from 1991 onwards. Figures for 1989 and 1990 are based on fees and on a sample of 1 in 200 prescriptions dispensed by community pharmacists and appliance contractors only. Figures for 1991 onwards are based on items and cover all prescriptions dispensed by community pharmacists, appliance contractors, dispensing doctors and prescriptions submitted by prescribing doctors for items personally administered.<P>

The net ingredient cost is the basic cost of a drug and does not take account of discounts, dispensing costs, fees or prescription charges income. <P>

 Available information is the average daily number of available and occupied beds by ward type for each National Health Service trust. This is published annually in "Bed Availability and Occupancy, England" and is available in the Library. However, this was an intensive care ward-based count. As wards classified as intensive care can also contain other types of beds, we have piloted a new census focusing specifically on adult intensive care and high dependency beds.

I have arranged for a Petition for leave to appeal to be lodged at the judicial office of the House of Lords. We shall also continue to consider the complex legal issues raised by the judgment, and, in particular, the implications for the use of data on prescription forms.

 <i>[holding answer 20 January 2000]:</i> MRSA is the antibiotic resistant form of <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>, a bacterium which is carried harmlessly on the skin by at least a third of the population. About 80 per cent. of people who acquire MRSA similarly carry it harmlessly on the skin and do not suffer from any infection. Action is in

<P>

<a name="00124w30.html_para0">Official notifications of tuberculosis gradually fell to an all time low of 5,086 in England and Wales in 1987 from about 50,000 cases a year in the 1950s. Since the early 1990s there have been overall small year on year increases in total notified cases which are continuing. Provisional notifications for 1998 were just over 6,000. While some of this may be due to better ascertainment of cases, it has occurred against the backdrop of a worldwide resurgence of this disease that will, inevitably, continue to have some impact on tuberculosis in the United Kingdom through travel and immigration.

<a name="00124w30.html_para1">We are working to minimise the effect of worldwide developments and have taken steps to strengthen the surveillance, prevention and control of tuberculosis, including drug resistant tuberculosis.

Currently, the most frequent route of transmission of hepatitis C is through sharing of blood-contaminated equipment by injecting drug misusers. Preliminary evidence suggests that the prevalence of hepatitis C infection in newer injectors may be lower than in the past. We are continuing to promote harm minimisation measures to try to accelerate any downward trend.
<P>

<a name="00124w30.html_para3">However, there is likely to be an increase in the diagnosis of hepatitis C in the next 10 years as individuals who have carried the virus for some time are identified through wider testing of groups who have been at risk.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00124w30.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hutton </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 20 January 2000]:</i> The decline in the recorded number of registrations since December 1993 is due to a variety of reasons, including improved systems which remove duplicate registrations, the change in the adult registration period from 24 to 15 months, and some dentists withdrawing from the General Dental Service or reducing their level of commitment to the National Health Service. There will also be some patients who may choose not to register with a dentist, but seek dental treatment only when a problem occurs. The establishment of Dental Access Centres in various parts of the country, announced by my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister last September, will enable people not registered with a dentist but who want to see one, to access high quality NHS care. The Government are committed to ensuring that, within two years, anyone wanting to see a NHS dentist would be able to do so by ringing NHS Direct.

 <i>[holding answer 20 January 2000]:</i> The Government are satisfied that the conditions of debt relief applied under HIPC are sufficient to guarantee that moneys freed up will be spent on social programmes and poverty reduction. The revised HIPC framework not only provides faster, wider and deeper debt relief, it also increases the impact which this relief has on poverty, through the development and implementation of national Poverty Reduction Strategies, the implementation of which will be an essential pre-condition of qualification for HIPC debt relief.
<P>

<a name="00124w31.html_para5">The transformation of the IMF's Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility into the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility means that the Poverty Reduction Strategy will become the key instrument in the country's relations with the donor community.

 The costs of reduction of debt by the heavily indebted poor countries will be divided between those amounts due to the relief provided under traditional multilateral debt mechanisms i.e. due to the UK's participation in the HIPC initiative and those amounts due to the extra bilateral relief that the UK is providing in order to relieve 100 per cent. of the debt burden of these countries. The current value of the total amount of debt owed to ECGD by the heavily indebted poor countries is approximately &#163;1.9 billion.
<P>

<a name="00124w31.html_para7">The cost of the debt reduction in any one year will depend on the number of countries who are eligible for relief, the amount of debt relief required to bring their debt stock to a sustainable level as defined by the terms of the enhanced HIPC initiative and the terms of their Paris Club debt rescheduling agreement.

<a name="00124w31.html_para8">All debt held by ECGD is recorded in their own Accounts, which are managed on a commercial basis and separate from the Government's own accounts.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what assessment has been made <i>(a)</i> by his Department and <i>(b)</i> by the Air Accident Investigation Board, of the environmental implications of the dispersal of the depleted uranium ballast from the wings of the Korean Airlines aircraft which crashed at Stansted on 22 December 1999.  [104703]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00124w34.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 I understand from the Environment Agency and the Air Accidents Investigation Board that the depleted uranium was part of the structure of the aircraft and was incorporated as solid weights in the tail section. Sixteen of the 20 weights have been recovered and none of these shows signs of damage such that dispersal would have occurred. A radiological survey of the crash site is being conducted and it is expected this will lead to the recovery of the others. The facts already established about the nature of the fire that occurred after the crash mean that it is extremely unlikely that any dispersal of the uranium will have taken place.
<P>

<a name="00124w34.html_para0">The aircraft was carrying a very small amount of radioactive material used for medical diagnosis. This was contained in 220 vials of iodine-125 bound for China. The quantity of material involved is too small to cause any damage to local people or the environment. This material is of such limited potential risk that it is not required to be notified to the pilot in command among the list of dangerous goods carried. The recovery of residual material from the accident site is in hand and its disposal is regulated by the Environment Agency.

 Guidelines for signing on motorways in England specify that an attraction should be within 20 miles of the junction from which it is to be signed. Stricter criteria relating to driving time rather than distance apply on the M25 and roads within it. Signs not meeting the criteria may exceptionally be permitted if justified by special local circumstances.

 Our policy, as set out in "Modern Local Government"--In Touch with the People" (Cm 4014), is that financial support for councillors must reinforce the culture of the modern council and address, as far as possible, any disincentives to serving in local politics. Basic allowance is intended to recognise the time commitment expected of all councillors, including such inevitable calls on their time as meetings with officers and attendance at political group meetings.

<P>
<a name="00124w34.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 The Department seeks to create a non-smoking work environment. This is primarily through the creation of smoking rooms, or smoking areas where the size or configuration of the building does not make this feasible, although in some buildings staff have voted for a total ban on smoking. Health promotion activities have complemented this approach with displays, in-house magazine articles and proactive events. When lifestyle screening programmes are run an individual's smoking habits are one of the areas discussed with the screening nurse.

 Telecommunications operators are licensed by the Department of Trade and Industry under the Telecommunications Act 1984. These licensed telecommunications code system operators are authorised under Part 24 of Schedule 2 to the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995 (GPDO) to install specified telecommunications apparatus without the need to make a planning application to the local authority, ie they have permitted development rights.

<P>

<a name="00124w34.html_para2">Under the operator licensing arrangements, SI 1999 No. 2450 harmonises the conditions attached to operators' licences and came into force on 27 September 1999. These permit a maximum cabinet size of 1.8 m high by 2.0 m long by 0.8 m wide.
<P>

<a name="00124w34.html_para3">Under the GPDO, operators have permitted development rights for cabinets with a base area of up to 1.5 sq m. However, in areas such as National Parks, Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty, Conservation Areas and the Broads and Sites of Special Scientific Interest the permitted development right is subject to a prior approval procedure. Under this procedure the local planning authority has the opportunity to say whether it wishes to approve, within 28-days, details of a cabinet's siting and appearance. It can refuse approval if it considers this justified.
<P>

<a name="00124w34.html_para4">In all cases, the installation of cabinets with a base size exceeding 1.5 sq m would need a full planning application to the local planning authority.

 Various estimates have been made of the value road users place on the total amount of time lost to congestion on the road network for different years and using different methods. They agree that taking all road users together and the British network as a whole the total runs to billions of pounds every year, and has been rising.
<P>

<a name="00124w35.html_para2">Although motorways account for a significant proportion of traffic--nearly 20 per cent. of all vehicle kilometres in England in 1996--analysis undertaken for the Government's report "Tackling Congestion and Pollution", published yesterday, suggests that they account for only about 5 per cent. of the total amount of vehicle time lost.

For the boroughs that are waste collection authorities, the percentage of municipal waste recycled is shown. Landfill and incineration data are not available for individual waste collection authorities, as this is the responsibility of the waste disposal authority.

In conducting his periodic review of water price limits the Director General expects companies to improve on efficiency savings that they have already achieved. It will be for water and sewerage undertakers to ensure that they maintain the necessary staff and other resources to meet these obligations in full.
<P>

<a name="00124w35.html_para4">In deciding how to meet price limits set by the Director General, companies will need to consider the range of measures open to them, including factors such as dividend policy, as well as the option of making staff redundant.

<a name="00124w36.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 In September 1999, at Cuba's request, a delegation from the EU Scientific Review Group of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) conducted a fact finding mission to Cuba regarding the exploitation of <i>Eretmochelys imbricata</i> (hawksbill turtles). The mission met representatives of the Agencia de Medio Ambiente (AMA) of the Ministerio de Ciencia, Technologia y Medio Ambiente, the Cuban CITES Management Authority, and the Cuban Fisheries Research Center. It visited a traditional fishing site, an experimental ranching centre and turtle shell stockpiles. Issues discussed related to a draft proposal by Cuba on hawksbill turtles for the next CITES Conference of Parties (April 2000). The delegation looked at the implications of the proposal for both the Cuban and the wider Caribbean populations of hawksbill turtles, the quality of Cuba's captive rearing facilities, techniques for marketing shells, and conservation benefits arising from the proposal.
<P>

<a name="00124w36.html_para0">The delegation was impressed with the stringency of Cuban controls, but was unable to see key data on population or monitoring of nesting beaches, and so could not reach any firm conclusions.

 The recent MAFF report "Rodent Infestations in domestic properties in England" covers this issue. MAFF's report tentatively suggests that there is a relationship between the incidence of blocked drains and outdoor rat infestation but this has not been supported with statistically significant analysis of the data so the conclusion needs to be treated with caution. Moreover, faults that might be expected to reflect a direct link with sewers, such as cracked or defective drains covers, were not found to be related to rat infestation. A copy of the MAFF report is in the House of Commons Library.

<P>

<a name="00124w36.html_para2">Some support to sub post offices is currently provided through the non-domestic rating system. The sole post office or shop in a designated rural area is entitled to 50 per cent. mandatory relief from non-domestic rates, provided its rateable value is less than &#163;5,000. Local authorities have discretionary powers to provide further relief up to 100 per cent. of the full rates bill for these and other properties in designated rural areas, with rateable values less than &#163;10,000.
<P>

<a name="00124w36.html_para3">We are also considering the suggestion in the Report of the Urban Task Force, "Towards an Urban Renaissance", that there should be rate reductions for small retailers in designated urban priority areas.
<P>

<a name="00124w36.html_para4">In the 1998 White Paper "Modernising Local Government: In Touch With The People" we announced a general rate relief scheme for all small non-domestic properties, which will include small post offices in urban and rural areas. We aim to consult shortly on the details of this scheme.

<a name="00124w36.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 In 1995 the then Department of Transport commissioned NATS Ltd. to advise on the scope for detailed modelling of the size and shape of risk contours around airports, in connection with its review of Public Safety Zone policy. In preparing its advice NATS used the CASE (Client Aviation System Enquiry) database of aircraft accidents maintained by Airclaims Ltd. to identify 



<P>
<P><I>24 Jan 2000 : Column: 132W</I><P>
information on crashes between 1979 and 1995 involving western-built airliner jets and turboprops. It used this information, in conjunction with data about aircraft movements, to calculate crash rates which would be relevant to the UK. From this information NATS used its own location model to determine the statistical distribution of crash locations in the vicinity of an airport. NATS also developed a consequence model to determine the size of the areas on the ground destroyed by aircraft accidents.
<P>

<a name="00124w36.html_para6">The crashes used for the purpose of this work were not limited to those which resulted in ground fatalities. The most useful approach was considered to be to draw upon the most reliable data available to calculate crash rates and model crash location and consequences, and then to apply those results in defining new boundaries for Public Safety Zones at airports.

 <i>[holding answer 20 January 2000]:</i> The United Kingdom played a leading role in the development of the European Union's position on how the relationship between trade and the environment should be addressed in the proposed new Round of multilateral trade negotiations. This position was set out in the conclusions of the General Affairs Council prior to the third World Trade Organisation Ministerial in Seattle in December 1999. The conclusions of the General Affairs Council are consistent with the Government's priorities for action in this area. They include commitments to clarifying the legal relationship between the rules of the WTO and trade measures taken pursuant to Multilateral Environmental Agreements, and to taking environmental considerations into account throughout the negotiations. I attended the Seattle Ministerial, where I was able to discuss trade and environment issues directly with representatives of the European Commission.

The representations expressed concern that Severn Trent Water might make some staff redundant following the decisions of the Director General of Water Services on price limits for water companies, to apply from April 2000.
<P>

<a name="00124w37.html_para11">Setting price limits, at the price review, is a matter for the Director General of Water Services. He has a statutory duty to secure that water companies properly carry out their functions and are able to finance them. These functions must be carried out in full compliance with all legal requirements, including drinking water quality (regulated by the Drinking Water Inspectorate), health and safety (regulated by the Health and Safety Executive), environmental standards (regulated by the Environment Agency) and customer service and continuity of supply (regulated by the Director General himself). The Director General expects companies to improve on efficiency savings that they have already achieved. It will be for water and sewerage undertakers to ensure that they maintain the necessary staff and other resources to meet these obligations in full.
<P>

<a name="00124w37.html_para12">In deciding how to meet price limits set by the Director General, companies will need to consider the range of measures open to them, including factors such as dividend policy, as well as the option of making staff redundant.

 The main aim of our policy on motor insurance is to ensure that any driver who uses a vehicle on the road will be covered for their liabilities to third parties. To that end the motor insurance industry have agreed informally that they will always find a policy for anybody who holds a valid driving licence and is legally entitled to use a vehicle on the road. The premium charged reflects the risk attached to the driver and this includes driving history and any relevant convictions. This practice applies to both individual and company insurance policies. Seeking to prevent insurers from issuing any cover for valid licence holders would be likely to lead to an increase in uninsured driving.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will make a statement on his plans for a public inquiry in respect of the proposed incinerator at Allington.  [106406]<P>

<P>
<a name="00124w39.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend decided on 21 December 1999, after very careful consideration, not to call in the planning application for the Allington incinerator for his own decision, but to leave the decision to be taken by the planning authority. The Government's policy on call-ins is to be very selective. It is right that in almost all cases the decision on whether a development should proceed should be taken by the local planning authority.
<P>

<a name="00124w39.html_para0">Therefore, planning applications are in general only called in if planning issues of much more than local importance are involved, and if those issues need to be decided by the Secretary of State rather than at local level. We have given as examples of cases where the Secretary of State might consider call-in appropriate those which may conflict with national policy on important matters; those which could have significant effects beyond their immediate locality; those which give rise to substantial regional or national controversy; those which raise significant architectural and urban design issues; and those where the interests of national security or a foreign government may be involved, 16 June 1999, <i>Official Report,</i> column 138W.
