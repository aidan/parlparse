<sup>(4)</sup>Passenger figures for the Skegness Line include all passengers on the Nottingham&#151;Grantham&#151;Skegness service.<br>





Notes:<br>

1. The date of the Easter holidays can impact on the carryings of lines dependent on tourist traffic and in some financial years, there is no Easter (e.g. financial year 2005&#150;06).<br>

2. Data based on ticketing system supplied by the train operator. All such data may be subject to adjustment.<br>

3. The Esk Valley line was used by passengers on trains run by the North Yorkshire Moors Railway during the summer of 2005 this adds approximately 5,000 to the total passengers shown in the table).<br>

4. The St. Ives line figures as presented have been adjusted to account for a ticketing system error which led to an under-reporting of journeys in financial years 2003&#150;04 and 2004&#150;05.<br>

5. Several lines have had periods of closure for engineering work. These include closures of a week or more on the Esk Valley and West Country branches and a closure to allow the commissioning of the new link between the Skegness Line and the East Coast Main Line last Autumn. These closures can reduce loadings significantly.<br>

6. The number of trains used to calculate the average number of passengers per train is based on an analysis of the public timetable and generally reflects trains running the whole length of the line with the following exceptions:<br>

St. Ives includes trains terminating at Lelant Saltings<br>

Tamar Valley includes trains terminating at Calstock<br>

Skegness is based on all trains on the section of line east of Grantham (some start/terminate at Boston or Sleaford) (as the Middlesbrough&#151;Nunthorpe services do not run the whole length of the Esk Valley these are also excluded).<br>

7. No allowance is made for engineering closures or other similar disruption. Where buses are included in the public timetable rail tickets are valid on the bus, these are included trains for the purposes of calculating the averages.<br>

 Based on the UK&#039;s experience of the recent accession of eight countries in May 2004, the accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the European Union is likely to make a positive contribution to growth of the UK labour force and employment.

more difficult to estimate these impacts at the sub-regional level. However, some assessment can be made based on UK experience, particularly from the accession of the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Poland, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia, and Slovenia in May 2004.

<a name="stpa_29">With respect to the labour market, since May 2004 employment levels in the UK have risen to record highs, in part due to the expansion of the work force from immigration.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry when the Government will announce the findings of its consultation on the proposed content of companies&#039; business reviews.  [67492]</p>








<p><a name="st_64"><a name="60504w07.html_spnew9"><b> Alun Michael  </b> 
<i>[holding answer 2 May 2006]:</i> Yesterday we laid amendments to Chapter 6, Part 15 of the Bill in order to give effect to changes to the content of companies&#039; business reviews. As part of our proposals, we also intend to clarify the position on liability for disclosures under the Companies Act and for implementation of the EU Transparency Obligations Directive. Draft clauses on a proposed regime for liability have been published via the DTI website (at http://www.dti.gov.uk/cld/facts/clr.htm) for a short period for public comment. This package of proposals represents consistent and balanced policy after considering carefully the responses to the consultation and engaging in discussion with interested parties on the whole range of options for narrative reporting.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60504w07.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_36">The requirements for narrative reporting have been streamlined so that the requirements for quoted companies are closely aligned to those for unquoted companies. The proposed new narrative reporting arrangements include the requirement that all companies will need to produce a business review, as required by the EU Accounts Modernisation Directive. The amendments make clear that the purpose of the review is to inform shareholders of the company and help them assess how the directors have performed their duty under section 156 (duty to promote the success of the company). Quoted companies will need to ensure that, to the extent necessary for an understanding of the development, performance or position of the company&#039;s business, their business review includes:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2"><i>(a)</i> the main trends and factors likely to affect the future development, performance and position of the company&#039;s business; and</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3"><i>(b)</i> information about:</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4">(i) environmental matters (including the impact of the company&#039;s business on the environment),</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5">(ii) the company&#039;s employees, and (iii) social and community issues, including information about any policies of the company in relation to those matters and the effectiveness of those policies.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6">Directors will need to state in their Review if they do not think it necessary to include information about (i), (ii) or (iii) above.</p>
</ul>
<p>





<br>&nbsp;<br><i>4 May 2006 : Column 1749W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="60504w07.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_37">The new system will also mean that for all companies:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7">Auditors will continue to be required to report on the consistency of the directors&#039; report with the annual accounts (as is required by the Accounts Modernisation Directive) but there will not be any additional requirement to check for other inconsistencies;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8">All companies will be exempted from disclosing in the business review information which is seriously prejudicial to the company&#039;s interests. This exemption was previously only provided for companies that had to produce an OFR; and</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9">There will be no statutory reporting standards for the Business Review.</p>
</ul>
<p>

</p>


<p>
<a name="60504w07.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_38">The draft clauses on liability cover:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10">Provision for liability under Part 15 of the Bill for directors&#039; reports, directors&#039; remuneration reports or summary financial statements derived from them;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11">Provision for liability for disclosures under Transparency Obligations Directive implementation;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12">Liability for untrue or misleading statements or omissions made in bad faith or recklessly or where there is deliberate and dishonest concealment.</p>
</ul>
<p>

</p>


<p>
<a name="60504w07.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_39">The Government&#039;s aim has always been to encourage meaningful strategic, forward-looking information to assist shareholder engagement, while avoiding disproportionate burdens on business. The Government have decided that the additional burden imposed by the statutory OFR requirement is not justified in light of the competitiveness of UK businesses. The changes to narrative reporting requirements announced yesterday will add value to the quality of reporting without imposing unnecessary costs.

However, on 27 February the Department published a report, &#039;Self-Sufficiency in Blood Products in England and Wales&#039;. This report was the result of an internal review of papers on self-sufficiency in blood products.

<a name="stpa_83">The review was commissioned following suggestions that the policy of self-sufficiency in blood products during the 1970&#039;s and early 1980&#039;s might have prevented haemophilia patients being treated with infected blood products. The report makes clear that self-sufficiency in blood products would not have prevented the infection of haemophilia patients.

 The Government believe that care homes provide an important part of the social care service. They are one of a range of options that should be available for supporting people with long-term care needs. The Government recognise that most people want to live in their own home for as long as possible, but that there will always be some whose needs are such that care in a care home will be best for them.

When used for the treatment or prevention of gastrointestinal ulcers, the recognised adverse effects of misoprostol include diarrhoea, abdominal pain, dyspepsia (indigestion), flatulence, nausea and vomiting, skin rashes and dizziness. As prostaglandin hormones also have effects on the lining of the uterus in women, misoprostol can also lead to vaginal bleeding.

This is in line with the advice of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists in its evidence based clinical guideline. Side effects of misoprostol in unlicensed indications have been documented to include abnormal uterine contractions and haemorrhage, retained placenta, release of amniotic fluid into the circulation (embolism), incomplete abortion and premature birth.

Security Council resolution 1612 also reaffirms the Security Council&#039;s intention to consider imposing multilateral sanctions against parties to situations of armed conflict which are on its agenda and are in violation of applicable international law relating to the rights and protection of children in armed conflict. Multilateral sanctions are usually applied taking into account a broad range of factors and have already been applied in relation to several conflict situations where the recruitment of child soldiers is a serious concern, such as those arising in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Sudan and Cote d&#039;Ivoire. Relevant Security Council resolutions also call for those responsible for violations of international humanitarian law to be brought to justice, including where appropriate by the International Criminal Court (ICC). I welcome the transfer of the first individual indicted by the ICC, Thomas Lubanga Dyilo, a national of the DRC, to The Hague on 17 March.

Although progress has been slow, mainly due to lengthy procurement procedures, approximately &#8364;230 million is now committed to co-fund 97 projects in ACP countries, which are valued at &#8364;412 million. An initial analysis of these selected proposals by the EUWF has found that by 2010 approximately 10 million people will benefit from access to drinking water and approximately 5 million people will benefit from access to basic sanitation. A second call for proposals has been launched this year and the full &#8364;500 million of the EUWF will be committed by 2007.

 Since 2003, DFID and other donors have worked hard to restore water supplies in Iraq. We estimate that 4 million more Iraqis have access to safe drinking water than before the conflict. In most cases, the main barrier to access to safe drinking water is the condition of the pipelines, rather than the water supply itself. This is partly due to the tendency for insurgents to target water, electricity and oil pipelines, as well as the reconstruction staff working to repair them. However, the poor condition of many pipelines is primarily the result of decades of underinvestment under Saddam&#039;s regime, which has left Iraq with crumbling infrastructure in desperate need of maintenance, and a shortage of trained engineers who know how to carry out repairs.

<a name="60504w20.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_175">There are two main reasons why progress on interrupting transmission of the polio virus in Nigeria is so slow. First, over decades of military rule the routine immunisation services, which should be a central component of the primary health care system, were allowed to collapse. The polio eradication effort has therefore had to depend on supplementary immunisation activities alone, with door-to-door campaigns repeated five or six times every year. However, the second reason for slow progress is that these door-to-door campaigns are not well accepted by the general population in northern Nigeria and so large numbers of children are missed by every campaign as their parents refuse to allow them to be immunised.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60504w20.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_176">The Government of Nigeria is firmly committed to eradicating polio and DFID is working intensely with the WHO, UNICEF and other international partners to help Nigeria address the current problems. DFID lobbied successfully for a greater emphasis to be placed on rebuilding routine immunisation services that address several childhood diseases, instead of the exclusive emphasis on polio campaigns. Routine services provided from fixed sites are much more acceptable to the general public than single- disease door-to-door campaigns. DFID Nigeria has designed a &#163;20 million project to support the reviving of routine immunisation in several low-coverage northern states. This project is expected to go live later this year.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60504w20.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_177">DFID also financed a consultative workshop in Kano in January this year which was very successful in getting key opinion leaders from across northern Nigeria to give their full support to polio eradication activities in the context of greater attention being paid to other childhood diseases at the same time.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60504w20.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_178">Another recent development is the decision to convert polio-only national immunisation days into what are being termed immunization plus days&quot;. DFID and other international partners, especially the European Commission, the US Government and UNICEF, had been pressing for this for some time. During immunization plus days&quot; BCG <sup>1</sup> , DPT <sup>2</sup>  and measles vaccines will be provided alongside the polio vaccine, and children will also be given vitamin A and anthelmintic <sup>3</sup>  tablets.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60504w20.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_179">These tactics are necessary in order to increase the acceptability of the polio vaccine among the general population, especially in northern states where the transmission of the wild virus has not been checked. Children cannot be immunised against their parents&#039; will and so it is necessary to win over people&#039;s hearts and minds so that they accept the polio vaccine. DFID is financing various advocacy initiatives in this regard, and has also funded anthropological research by the Institute of Development Studies in Sussex into the reasons for non-acceptance of the oral polio vaccine in northern Nigeria. The results of this research are now informing Nigerian government strategy at national, state and local levels.

<a name="stpa_183">The EU Water Facility (EUWF), in contrast to the EUWI, is a funding mechanism. It was established in 2004 in response to the clear need for more money in the water sector. Although progress has been slow, mainly due to lengthy procurement procedures, approximately &#8364;230 million is now committed to co-fund 97 projects, which are overall valued at &#8364;412 million. A second call for proposals has been launched this year and the full &#8364;500 million of the EUWF will be committed by 2007.

[66637]</p>








<p><a name="st_178"><a name="60504w20.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Thomas: </b> 
 Chad is one of the poorest countries in Africa. UK development aid is provided indirectly through multilateral organisations. When oil reserves were discovered in the 1990s, the industry asked the World Bank to invest in the building of a 1,070 km pipeline to carry Chad&#039;s petroleum to the Atlantic coast for export. The World Bank saw this as a unique opportunity for Chad to climb out of extreme poverty. Before it became involved, the World Bank obtained assurances that the new revenues would be used to lift the population out of deprivation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60504w20.html_para10">
<a name="stpa_184">On 6 January 2006, the World Bank announced that it would withhold new loans and grants to the Government of Chad and suspend disbursement of International Development Association (IDA) funds allocated to the country. The value of funds suspended was approximately $124 million. This action followed passage of amendments to the country&#039;s Petroleum Revenue Management Law by the National Assembly. These changes substantially weakened programmes to improve the lives of poor people, which the World Bank had been supporting.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60504w20.html_para11">
<a name="stpa_185">The World Bank offered to assist the Government to address their financial difficulties by analysing and helping to address them, including how public finances had been managed. It had also proposed a review of how the Petroleum Revenue Management Law had been implemented to identify which, if any, amendments to the law might be warranted. The World Bank has remained open to dialogue with the Government on the best ways to address their current financial crisis while protecting poverty reduction programmes. On 26 April, the World Bank and the Government announced that they had completed a third round of discussions and reached an interim agreement. Based on this, the World Bank has agreed to resume some loan disbursements for education, health, community development, HIV/AIDS, agriculture, electricity, water and infrastructure.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60504w20.html_para12">
<a name="stpa_186">The Government of Chad have agreed to pass a 2006 budget law specifying that 70 per cent. of the oil revenues will be used for priority poverty programmes. This allocation excludes security spending, which is to be funded from general revenues. If the Bill does achieve this, as soon as the oil consortium submits payments owed, the World Bank will release one third of the total amount on deposit in the escrow account over each of the next three months, with the understanding that the World Bank and the Chad Government will work on a further, more permanent agreement during that period. The Chad authorities have also agreed to parallel actions to strengthen the monitoring, transparency and accountability of direct and indirect oil revenues and development aid.

 On 12 January 2006 in Sydney, Australia and East Timor concluded the terms of a Treaty on Certain Maritime Arrangements in the Timor Sea&quot; (CMATS Treaty) which provides for an interim agreement to allow exploitation of the Greater Sunrise gas reservoirs to proceed while suspending maritime boundary claims for 50 years and maintaining the current treaty arrangements in place. Under this creative solution, Australia has agreed to share equally (50:50) the upstream revenues from the resource.

The revenue will be paid to East Timor&#039;s Petroleum Fund, the balance of which is already around $330 million derived from the 90 per cent. share of production East Timor receives from the Joint Petroleum Development Area (JPDA). The exact benefit to East Timor will depend on the economics of the project but we hope that it will assist in securing East Timor&#039;s development and economic stability.

<a name="stpa_189">From the outset the Government of East Timor has pursued a rigorous approach to transparency with revenues and contracts in the public domain. The Government have conducted thorough public consultations on several initiatives on transparency and management of oil and gas revenues. Prime Minister Mari Alkatiri stated Timor&#039;s official support for the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) at the Lancaster House conference in June 2003. He also set out a policy to ensure transparency. We encourage this approach which will help promote poverty reduction along with good governance and transparency.

 The United Kingdom ratified the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in 1993. The United Kingdom ratified the Kyoto protocol in 2002. It is open to the Government to extend the ratification of the convention and the protocol to include overseas territories. In practice the Government would do so only at the request and with the consent of the territory concerned.

<a name="60504w24.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_208">The Kyoto protocol&#039;s flexible mechanisms, international emissions trading, clean development mechanism (CDM) and joint implementation (JI), would be available to an overseas territory (OT) that had the UK&#039;s instrument of ratification extended to it and would therefore become part of an Annex I Party. As part of an Annex I Party it cannot host CDM projects and therefore be eligible for carbon credits since these are only available to non Annex I Parties, generally developing countries. However, it may invest in non Annex I countries and purchase credits that it could sell on the international carbon market.

<p>
<a name="60504w24.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_209">There is also the possibility that an OT could take part in JI projects between two Annex I Parties, but the detailed arrangements to provide for this would peed to be agreed between the Government and relevant OT.

 UKvisas is mandated by HM Treasury guidelines to recover its costs without burdening the UK taxpayer. Therefore, the applicant must meet the full cost of processing an entry clearance application. The visa application fee for each category of entry clearance is the same, wherever in the world an individual applies. The application fee is payable in local currency at the consular rate of exchange, which is within 10 per cent. of the commercial rate. The visa application fees in the Middle East, in local currencies and Pound Sterling, are as follows.

 The West Belfast and Greater Shankill (WBGS) Task Forces produced a joint report in February 2002 detailing over 150 recommendations covering a wide range of issues. Early progress was made in a number of areas including work by Invest NI to regenerate the Forth River (former Mackies) complex. The Department for Employment and Learning also piloted the Targeted Initiatives programme in the task force areas, working closely with a local stakeholders&#039; forum, the Employment Services Board.

<p><a name="st_260"><a name="60504w29.html_spnew8"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 The Charity Commission has not closed any charitable schools in the last five years for inadequate performance and neither is it competent to do so. The Commission is concerned with the governors&#039; compliance with their legal obligations in exercising control and management of the school under charity law. It is not competent to judge the quality and standard of education and care. The Commission has made recommendations on relevant matters to school governors in the course of visits it has undertaken to schools and has taken other action to secure compliance with governors&#039; duty to provide the Commission with their annual accounts in appropriate cases.

 Charity Commission staff have visited nine charitable schools in the past 12 months as part of the Commission&#039;s structured visits programme. The Commission does not keep information on the number of visits that it undertakes in the course of its general regulatory case work but it estimates that it has made about four such visits to schools.

<a name="stpa_251">Between March 1997 and March 2005 the number of police officers in the Metropolitan Police area increased by 4,396 from 26,677 to 31,073. The Government&#039;s introduction of community support officers (CSOs) in 2002 has put 2,053 CSOs on the streets in the Metropolitan Police Service area to tackle crime and antisocial behaviour. Metropolitan Police will receive &#163;1,818 million in general grants for 2006&#150;07, an increase of 3.1 per cent. (&#163;54.7 million) over the comparable figure for 2005&#150;06. General grants funding to Metropolitan Police has increased by 20.8 per cent. between 1997&#150;98 and 2006&#150;7 (Figures are not directly comparable, due to boundary changes, adjustments to pay centrally for NCS and NCIS, and the transfer of pensions and security funding from general grant to specific in 2006&#150;07. All have reduced general grant for Metropolitan Police Authority compared with 1997). In addition to general grants, Metropolitan Police will also receive an estimated &#163;394.5 million in specific grants funding for targeted initiatives and capital provision in 2006&#150;07. The Metropolitan also gains &#163;5.3 million from the amending reports for 2004&#150;05 and 2005&#150;06. The distribution of resources locally is a matter for the Police Authority and the Chief Officer.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what assessment he has made of the likelihood of chance matches of DNA samples from degraded or limited samples; and if he will make a statement.  [63146]</p>








<p><a name="st_270"><a name="60504w32.html_spnew0"><b> Andy Burnham: </b> 
 The National DNA Database (NDNAD) currently uses SGM Plus profiling technology which tests for 10 areas of DNA (known as short tandem repeats or STRS) at each of which there are two markers (i.e. a total of 20 markers). The Government have every confidence in the SGM Plus profiling system but recognises that it should keep its reliability and level of discrimination under review.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60504w32.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_263">The NDNAD contains the profiles of over 3 million individuals. We are not aware of any chance match between two full SGM Plus profiles for unrelated individuals having been obtained to date. However, as the size of the NDNAD grows and as more international comparisons are made with other countries&#039; DNA profiles, the probability, although remaining very small, will increase.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60504w32.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_264">Subject samples taken from persons on arrest are very unlikely to be degraded or limited in quantity. The probability of a chance match between full SGM Plus profiles from samples from two unrelated subjects is less than one in a thousand million. If the subjects are related, the likelihood of a match by chance is higher; for siblings it is of the order of one in 10,000.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60504w32.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_265">Approximately half of all crime scene samples yield a partial profile i.e. a profile with less than 10 STR areas. This is because the DNA collected at crime scenes is either limited in quantity or degraded. Developments inDNA technology now allow DNA profiles to be obtained from small amounts of DNA although these may often prove to be partial profiles. The probability of a chance match of a partial crime scene sample profile with a profile from someone other than the true offender will vary, depending on how many markers are present in the partial crime scene profile and whether the innocent person involved in the chance match is related to the offender.




<br>&nbsp;<br><i>4 May 2006 : Column 1843W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>


<p>
<a name="60504w32.html_para3">
Recent research studies by the European DNA Profiling Group (EDNAP) and the European Network of Forensic Science Institutes (ENFSI) have demonstrated that the success rate for analysis of degraded samples (which yield partial profiles) improved by using recently developed tests for markers based on shorter lengths of DNA (mini STRs).
</p>


<p>
<a name="60504w32.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_266">The international scientific community have agreed that the best way forward would be to develop a new test system using 13 or 16 STR areas, including some mini STRs. This would also need to take account of the divergent requirements of the different European countries. The time scale for the development and introduction of a new test system would be a commercial decision by the companies that make the new test system and it is estimated that this development could take around two years. Home Office officials are actively involved in taking forward this work which will help in obtaining fuller profiles from limited or degraded samples, hence reducing the probability of chance matches occurring.

 All European economic area (EEA) nationals have a right of free movement and residence in the United Kingdom.

As such there are no reliable estimates of the numbers of accession state nationals who have worked for less than 28 days.

<p>
<a name="60504w32.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_268">The WRS does not measure net migration (inflows minus outflows). Rather, it gives gross figures for the number of workers applying to the scheme. An individual who has registered to work and who leaves employment is not required to de-register, so some of those counted will have left employment and some are likely to have left the UK.

 Under the Extradition Act 2003, and the Extradition Act 2003 (Designation of Part two Territories) Order 2003, extradition requests by the United States are not required to be accompanied by prima facie evidence.

 IND does not have a central record of the number of people detained and removed from the UK as part of a family unit. However, given the sensitive nature of family cases, all family removals are handled carefully. Since 23 November 2005, the Immigration Service has sought ministerial authority on every case when the removal of a family or individuals would result in a family unit being separated. Since that date we have sought ministerial authority on five occasions.

 The current policy for replacing lost or damaged passports is that the customer makes a fresh application and pays the full cost for renewing the passport unless the document was clearly faulty at issue, there are no plans to change this policy for biometric passports. Every biometric passport goes through a vigorous quality assurance process before issuing to the public which ensures the passport reaches the public in full working order. Broadly comparable arrangements will be put in place for identity cards in due course.

 We envisage that any order made under section 32 of the Police Act 1996 amalgamating the Humberside, North Yorkshire, South Yorkshire and West Yorkshire police areas would provide for each of the four precursor police authorities to appoint a specified number of their members to be members of the combined police authority. As such, there would be no role for the Home Secretary. The precise terms of the order are the subject of ongoing discussions with the police authorities concerned. The making of such an order is subject to our consideration of any objections received in response to the notice given by the Home Secretary of his intention to amalgamate the four forces.

Of the 10 published scenarios, scenario one has been the closest to the observed total prison population over the 11 months since the projections were made.

 Data in the specific format requested are not available. The proportion of prisoner time undertaking education and training compared with overall purposeful activity is therefore given. According to provisional data for 2005&#150;06, prisoners spent 25.2 hours per prisoner per week undertaking purposeful activity. Time spent in education and training was 5.1 hours per prisoner per week representing 20.1 per cent. of the total purposeful hours.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60504w34.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_277">Data relating to purposeful activity is reported on a weekly basis. The weekly purposeful hours figure is based on the total hours prisoners have spent undertaking each of the 30 activities listed as purposeful divided by the average prisoner population and converting to a weekly average. Education and training hours are calculated in the same way based on five education and training activities.

 When HMYOI Ashfield opened in 1999 it held both young offenders and juveniles. In February 2004 the establishment was re-roled to hold juveniles only. The increased cost per place since that time is a reflection of the more intensive regime and level of intervention that juveniles receive.
