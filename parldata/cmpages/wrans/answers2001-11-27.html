 There will be no third round of NDC but the existing 39 partnerships will continue piloting many of the ideas in the National Strategy for Neighbourhood Renewal. The Government are committed to learning as much as possible from them over the next 10 years and spreading best practice.
<P>

<a name="11127w01.html_para0">Real delivery in turning round deprived areas requires high-quality public services in all neighbourhoods, rather than specific programmes shoring up poor public services in only a few areas. The main focus of Neighbourhood Renewal is to reshape the way mainstream resources are used and the lessons learned from NDC will help identify ways to achieve this.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11127w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 A working group representing DTLR and representatives from local government and industry was set up in September to take forward these issues. The need for a comprehensive inventory has been recognised as an important step and proposals in draft form are being produced in a form which could be readily adopted by local authorities.
<P>

<a name="11127w01.html_para1">Research into a street lighting risk management strategy is being considered. This will be dependent on the collection of accurate information on street lighting stock and condition which is one of the aims of the street lighting inventory.
<P>

<a name="11127w01.html_para2">When inventories are in place showing sufficient information on street lighting stock at a local and national level, DTLR will consider ways in which this information could be used to allocate funding to highway authorities that would allow them to deal with their street lighting backlog.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11127w01.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 The Government are committed in the 10-year plan for transport to tackling the local road maintenance backlog, including the backlog for street lighting. Over &#163;30 billion is being provided for local road maintenance over the next 10 years, and extra &#163;9 billion above the funding levels in the previous 10 years.

[16096]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11127w01.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Keeble </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 19 November 2001]:</i> Information reported to the Department by local authorities about expenditure on accommodation provided under homelessness legislation does not identify average unit costs. Available information derived from the report "Homelessness Statistics 1999&#150;2000 Actuals", published by the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy (CIPFA) is as follows:

<P>
<P>
<a name="11127w01.html_wqn12"><B> Mr. Swire: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions if he will list the methodology changes made since 1997 to the formulae for calculating the standard lending assessment and aggregate external finance figures for <i>(a)</i> Devon county council and <i>(b)</i> east Devon district council; and if he will make an assessment of the net financial effect of these changes.  [17272]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11127w01.html_spnew9"><B> Dr. Whitehead: </B> 
 There were 15 changes in the method of determining Standard Spending Assessments (SSAs) for the 1998&#150;99 Local Government Finance Settlement; and 20 changes for the 1999&#150;2000 Local Government Finance Settlement.
<P>

<a name="11127w01.html_para4">In 1999&#150;2000 the Government introduced a new damping grant, Central Support Protection Grant (CSPG), to ensure that no authority received less grant than the year before, and that authorities which had education and personal social services responsibilities received at least 1.5 per cent. more than the year before.
<P>

<a name="11127w01.html_para5">The July 1998 Local Government White Paper announced a three-year review of Revenue Grant Distribution. It said that the Government did not expect to make fresh changes to the method of calculation of SSAs except where there are changes in the functions of councils, or the funding of particular services.
<P>

<a name="11127w01.html_para6">In 2000&#150;01 there were therefore only limited adjustments to SSAs to accommodate the establishment of the Greater London Authority and related changes, most notably those arising from the alterations to the boundary of the Metropolitan Police District and the Essex Hertfordshire and Surrey police areas. CSPG was retained in 2000&#150;01.
<P>

<a name="11127w01.html_para7">In 2001&#150;02 there was only one change in the method of determining SSAs to reflect the transfer of funding for nursery education for four-year-olds. CSPG was replaced for those authorities with education and personal social services responsibilities by floors and ceilings, which guaranteed that no authority would receive less than a 3.2 per cent. increase and that no authority could get more than a 6.5 per cent. increase.
<P>

<a name="11127w01.html_para8">Changes in the method of determining SSAs are contained in circular letters to local authorities, dated 2 December 1997, 2 December 1998, 25 November 1999 and 27 November 2000, copies of which are in the Library. For convenience, copies of the relevant extracts have been placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="11127w01.html_para9">The following table shows the net percentage change in SSAs against adjusted SSAs for the previous year for Devon and east Devon over the period, together with the percentage change due to changes in methodology. It is inappropriate to compare actual SSA between years because of changes to the services financed by grants allocated using SSAs. Adjusted SSAs enable a like-for- like comparison between years.

 Discussions on the options for taking forward the west coast main line upgrade are still under way between the Government and stakeholders.

The protection system for the Pendolino trains will be subject to an acceptance procedure under the aegis of Railway Safety, which will ensure that it meets the requirements of HSE.

 My policy is to take intervention action based on clear evidence of a local authority's failure to comply with the best value requirements in Part I of the Local Government Act 1999. Such evidence would usually be identified in a best value inspection conducted by the Audit Commission and I would expect the Commission to make recommendations to me about the use of intervention powers. I have received no recommendations from the Audit Commission regarding any of these authorities.

 The Greater London Authority Act 1999 created the Greater London Authority and its five functional bodies: the London Development Agency, the London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority, the Metropolitan Police Authority, Transport for London and the London Transport Users' Committee. As far as I am aware, there are no other bodies at local level, created under primary legislation which has been introduced since 1997 and is the responsibility of my Department.

 'Public Bodies 2000' sets out information on non-departmental public bodies (NDPBs), certain public corporations (including nationalised industries) and NHS bodies. There are four types of NDPB: executive NDPBs; advisory NDPBs; tribunal NDPBs; and boards of visitors to penal establishments. The next edition will be published around the end of the year. Information about task forces, annual reviews and ad hoc advisory groups is set out in an annual report, published by Cabinet Office. Copies of Public Bodies 2000 are in the Library of the House and this publication may be accessed via Cabinet Office's website: http://www.official-documents.co.uk/ document/caboff/pb00/pb00.htm.

Brigades focus their efforts mainly on those households deemed to be at high risk from fire. The implementation of such work is down to individual brigades to determine, using local data and statistics to highlight where within their brigade area fires are most likely to occur.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11127w03.html_spnew5"><B> Dr. Whitehead: </B> 
 The overall level of formula grant that Government make available to local government, including that for social services, is decided as part of our spending review process. Decisions are based on an assessment at the national level of pressures on services, the scope for greater cost-effectiveness, and what is affordable. We have not made an assessment specific to seaside resort authorities. The SSA formulae are the means by which we allocate this total level of grant between authorities. The grant distribution formulae are currently being reviewed in order to develop a system that is more transparent and fairer to all authorities. To date, the review has not made an assessment of the fairness of the current children's social services SSA formula as it relates specifically to seaside resort authorities. As part of the review, the Department of Health are commissioning research on the children's formula. Such an assessment would be difficult to make until further progress has been made.

<P>
<a name="11127w03.html_spnew6"><B> Dr. Whitehead: </B> 
 Local authorities are independent and autonomous and responsible within the law for making their own decisions on procurement matters. It is for them to decide whether or not to procure timber and timber products which have been independently certified as originating from well-managed forests. In doing so they will need to have regard to the need to achieve value for money.
<P>

<a name="11127w03.html_para0">Central Government Departments were formally reminded of the Government's policy to procure timber and timber related products from sustainable and legal sources in a note dated 2 January 2001 issued jointly by HM Treasury and the then Department for the Environment, Transport and the Regions. Central Government have not given advice on this subject directly to other parts of the public sector but the Government's advice is widely available and can be adapted or adopted by other organisations.

 The Highways Agency is currently trialling variable speed limits on sections of the M25. The Controlled Motorway Project automatically adjusts the speed limit to reflect prevailing conditions, and is enforced with speed cameras.
<P>

<a name="11127w04.html_para0">Independent monitoring and assessment of the scheme by TRL during the first year of operation confirmed its success. The monitoring indicated that traffic flow had improved, with drivers reporting more "comfortable", less aggressive driving conditions, with fewer very short, dangerous spaces between vehicles and fewer long (inefficient) spaces and more even use of the carriageway. There were also indications of improved road safety, and shorter and more reliable journey times.

 In my answer on 11 May 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 447W, to my hon. Friend the Member for Dunfermline, West (Rachel Squire), I announced that we would be investigating the options for the land storage of decommissioned nuclear-powered submarines. I also informed the House that we had separately received an unsolicited commercial proposal from Babcock Rosyth Defence Ltd. (BRDL), the owners of Rosyth Royal Dockyard, to dismantle the reactor compartment of the decommissioned nuclear-powered submarine, HMS Renown, and store the components. At that time we had agreed that planning and feasibility work could proceed, but I assured the House that the proposals would not be implemented until Ministers and the relevant regulatory authorities were entirely satisfied and that I would make a further statement.
<P>

<a name="11127w04.html_para5">Since May 2000, much valuable work has been undertaken by BRDL to demonstrate the feasibility of their proposals. While I am satisfied on the matter of feasibility, it is clear that the necessary regulatory approvals to commence dismantling Renown will not be in place until next year. Even if the approvals are granted, and that is a matter for the independent regulators, it would be many months before the work to dismantle Renown could be completed. We have already begun the process of inviting industry proposals on the best solution for the land storage of decommissioned nuclear submarines generally and it would therefore be too late for the knowledge gained from dismantling Renown to inform this process. As a result, I have decided that there would be no advantage in proceeding with the dismantling of Renown ahead of the other decommissioned submarines stored at Devonport and Rosyth.
<P>

<a name="11127w04.html_para6">Renown will continue to be stored afloat at Rosyth until such time as the final decisions on land storage are implemented. These decisions are unlikely to be taken for some two to three years and will be subject to full and open consultation.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11127w05.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Differences between the guidelines for the police and the Army on the use of baton rounds stem entirely from the differences in their respective operational structures and practices. In the case of the Army the guidelines have worldwide applicability. There are therefore no plans to bring the guidelines exactly into line with the regime governing the use of those weapons by the police.
<P>

<a name="11127w05.html_para0">If a member of the public had cause to complain about the Army firing a baton round, for example if they were injured, it should be reported to the police so that they can conduct an investigation. They would receive the full co-operation of the Army and would be able to confiscate any items (ie a baton gun) that they deemed necessary for them to conduct their inquiries effectively. If a member of the public wishes to complain on other aspects of the use of baton rounds by the Army then they can write to headquarters Northern Ireland.

 Cost-plus contracts are the contracting method of last resort. They now account for less than 1 per cent. of the Ministry of Defence's business (both by value and number). Within a stated limit of liability the contractor is paid all costs reasonably and properly incurred, together with a sum for profit, calculated by applying either a percentage profit or a fixed fee to the costs so incurred. The rate of profit applied to cost-plus work is calculated by reference to the Government Profit Formula which includes a "Non Risk" rate, which is set below that used for prices agreed before work commences; thus the MOD recognises the reduced risk to the contractor.

 We are not planning on the basis of 'preferred' or 'minimum' runway lengths. The requirement is to support operations at the aircraft's Maximum All Up Weight. Our preliminary assessment is that this will mean a runway length of around 8,000 feet. However, runway length requirements for A400M operations will not be confirmed until the aircraft's Performance and Flying Qualities test programme is completed, on current plans, in 2008. The Secretary of State for Defence has not discussed the issue of A400M runway lengths with his French and German counterparts.

<P>
<a name="11127w08.html_spnew7"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 There have been two application rounds since November 1998. In the first round, the Department received a total of 66 applications from 60 local education authorities (with six authorities applying for funding for

<P>

<a name="11127w08.html_para4">Local authorities receive the benefit of PFI Credits through Revenue Support Grant. All applications to the Department are therefore submitted by local authorities, even if they relate to individual schools.
<P>

<a name="11127w08.html_para5">Further education colleges can apply to the Learning and Skills Council for a contribution to the cost of capital projects, including PPP/PFI projects.

 The table shows the proportion of central Government investment in school buildings from PPP/PFI sources for 2001&#150;02, 2002&#150;03 and 2003&#150;04. For 2004&#150;05 and beyond, the amount of schools capital that will be available, and the proportion of PPP/PFI funding within it, will depend on the outcome of the Spending Review in 2002.

 In 1998&#150;99 38 schools in special measures were closed, representing 8 per cent. of the total number of schools in special measures at the end of that year. In 1999&#150;2000 the equivalent figures were 40 and 9 per cent., and in 2000&#150;01 16 and 5 per cent.

<P>
<a name="11127w09.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 The Government are committed to continuing to reduce the number of schools found to require special measures year-on-year, and to ensuring that no school is allowed to remain in special measures for longer than two years.
<P>

<a name="11127w09.html_para0">Where a school is found to require special measures, the Department writes to the governing body and the local education authority, and where appropriate the relevant Diocesan authority, to offer guidance on the action required. The governing body, in consultation with the LEA, must draw up an action plan to address the key issues identified.
<P>

<a name="11127w09.html_para1">The LEA must also submit its own commentary and statement of action, which should include an assessment of the scope for the school to be closed. If an LEA concludes that the school should be closed, it must consult on the proposal in the normal way.
<P>

<a name="11127w09.html_para2">Under Section 19 of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State may at any time direct an LEA that a school subject to special measures should be closed. The Secretary of State must consult the LEA and the governing body, and if appropriate the Diocese, before giving such a direction. It may do so at any stage of the process.
<P>

<a name="11127w09.html_para3">Under Section 17 of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998, LEAs may suspend a governing body's right to a delegated budget where the school is found to require special measures.
<P>

<a name="11127w09.html_para4">The Department's Circular 6/99, "Schools Causing Concern", offers schools, LEAs and Diocesan authorities guidance on all these issues. A copy is in the Library of the House.

 A school requires special measures when it is judged to be failing or likely to fail to give its pupils an acceptable standard of education. The criteria used in reaching this decision are a matter for HM Chief Inspector of Schools. I have therefore asked Mike Tomlinson to write to the hon.

 The Department's Circular 6/99 "Schools Causing Concern", which advises local education authorities on dealing with schools in special measures, does not specifically cover staff retention. However, the circular does make clear that, where an LEA withdraws a school's delegated budget because it is subject to special measures, it automatically takes over responsibility for most personnel issues, including the appointment and dismissal of staff.

<P>
<a name="11127w10.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 Schools are required by law to have anti-bullying policies covering all their pupils, and in December 2000 we launched a new anti-bullying pack for schools entitled "Bullying: don't suffer in silence" with an accompanying video aimed at pupils.

<P>

<a name="11127w10.html_para0">The Learning and Skills Council (LSC) is responsible for the remaining post-16 learning other than in higher education. I have therefore asked John Harwood, the Council's Chief Executive, to write to my hon. Friend with the information requested and to place a copy of his reply in the Library.
<P>

<a name="11127w10.html_para1">Following the tragic events of 11 September and subsequently we have placed some new guidance for all educational establishments on our departmental website. This reminds establishments to be vigilant for any name calling, racial abuse or bullying and deal with any incidents promptly and sensitively. A copy of the guidance has been sent to the LSC.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what advice she gives to local authorities on acceptable time limits for pupils to spend out of school following permanent exclusion for <i>(a)</i> primary and <i>(b)</i> secondary schools; what information she has by local authority on (i) numbers and (ii) length of exclusion in the latest year for which figures are available; and if she will make a statement.  [17914]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11127w10.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 The advice given to local education authorities is that ideally many permanently excluded pupils should rejoin a mainstream or special school within days or weeks, or exclusion. Rapid re-integration is particularly important for excluded primary pupils and I expect that most of them would be re-integrated within one term. Conversely, for pupils approaching the end of compulsory schooling, a return to school may be unrealistic.
<P>

<a name="11127w10.html_para2">Reintegration Panels are responsible for co-ordinating services for excluded pupils. They must draw up an individual re-integration plan for each excluded child. This plan should be in place within a month of the governors upholding the exclusion and it is reviewed on a monthly basis.

This is roughly equivalent to the output of one mid-range CCGT power station. However, since many of these appliances would not be in standby at peak times there is still a need for this power station.
<P>

<a name="11127w12.html_para9">While I am not aware of any plans for a directive governing the power consumption of electronic equipment in standby mode, there are already a number of voluntary agreements in place which seek to establish minimum standards for the power consumption of electronic equipment in standby mode. These include voluntary agreements with industry in respect of TVs, VCRs, digital TV services and external power supplies.
<P>

<a name="11127w12.html_para10">In addition, the recent EU/US agreement will extend into Europe the use of voluntary energy labelling of office equipment via the US EPA's Energy Star scheme which requires minimum standards for computers and other office equipment in standby mode before the label can be used.
<P>

<a name="11127w12.html_para11">The European Commission will also shortly be making proposals for a Framework Directive for Minimum Energy Efficiency Requirements for End-Use Equipment which may cover this area too.

 All European Union funding is channelled towards precise objectives and priorities under the various common policies, which, in turn, are based on provisions of the EU Treaties. The European Union does not have a legal base for sport in its Treaties. As such, there are no funding programmes designated specifically to sport.
<P>

<a name="11127w13.html_para4">However, sports clubs in the United Kingdom may be eligible for funding under other European Union programmes which integrate sport into such actions as regional development or training and education. These programmes include:

These programmes tend to focus on the development of small and medium enterprises to encourage job creation and social inclusion and require applicants to identify the specific economic and local benefits their scheme will achieve.

Vocational Training/Education for young people/Youth Programmes&#151;initiatives such as Leonardo and Socrates support vocational training and cultural exchange programmes for young people. There is a clear emphasis on any Europe-wide dimension to the activities.

 The Government fully recognises the contribution of volunteers to the running of sport and the need to continue to invest in their training, recruitment and support. The Government's Plan for Sport provides that Sport England should be the national advocate of volunteering in sport in England and to provide support to national governing bodies of sport in the development and implementation of volunteering strategies. Key to these strategies will be the appointment by governing bodies of National Volunteer Managers to implement the strategies and Volunteer Co-ordinators at Regional and county level to provide support and raise the profile of volunteering.

 DCMS is currently engaged in the second stage of the quinquennial review of Sport England, in which we are looking at its strategic management function, its regional role, and the way in which it carries out partnership working and forges alliances. I expect the review to be completed early in the New Year, at which point I will discuss its findings with the new Chief Executive of Sport England and with Sport England's Council members, with a view to implementing the recommendations as promptly as possible.

 My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary and I welcome the new UN Security Council Resolution 1378 (2001), adopted unanimously on 14 November, which sets out the international community's vision for the future of Afghanistan. The resolution outlines the principles that should govern the formation of a new Administration and affirms that the UN should play a central role in supporting the efforts of the Afghan people to establish their new Government.
<P>

<a name="11127w15.html_para4">We also welcome the UN Secretary-General's nomination of the Administrator of UNDP, Mark Malloch Brown, to lead the early recovery effort in Afghanistan. We will continue to work closely with the UK on rebuilding Afghanistan.

 While we have received no specific representations from Afghani women, we are working closely with the UN Special Representative for Afghanistan, Lakhdar Brahimi, and a wide range of other interested Governments and parties to help the Afghan people establish a broad-based government representative of all Afghans, including women.

 Subsidiarity is not about returning powers to the member states.

Article 5 TEC and the Subsidiarity Protocol to the Amsterdam Treaty spell out how the principle is to be applied in practice.

 <i>[holding answer 19 November 2001]:</i> Such requests are made by members states' Customs authorities in respect of individual cases of imports from a third country. Since April 2001 the UK has received 13 responses from Israel to requests for verification that the goods in question qualified for preferential treatment under the terms of the EU-Israel Association Agreement. In all but one of the cases Israel responded that the goods were originating products under the terms of the Agreement and thus qualified in Israel's view for preferential treatment. In the other case, the Israeli authorities were unable to validate the exporter's claim that the goods in question qualified for preferential treatment. The EU has made it clear, most recently at the 20 November association council, that it wants to pursue discussions with Israel to resolve this issue.

 <i>[holding answer 19 November 2001]:</i> The EU-Israel Association Agreement provides for regular review by the Ministerial-level Association Council, to which either party may refer disputes over its application or interpretation.

 Requests for verification of goods are made by member states' Customs authorities in respect of individual cases of imports from a third country. According to the terms of the EU-Israel Association Agreement, the country requesting the verification should be informed of the results within a maximum period of 10 months. In the event of full responses not being received, further information may be requested, and if this does not satisfactorily resolve the issues, it may be referred to the Association Council under the terms of the Agreement.

<P>
<a name="11127w17.html_spnew6"><B> Peter Hain: </B> 
 The 19 November General Affairs Council agreed that the EU should make it clear to Israel at the 20 November EU-Israel Association Council that it attached great importance to correct application of the Association Agreement and that it would do its best to find a sustainable solution to the rules of origin issue. It noted that, if the Association Council process was not able to find a solution, the EU would have to review its position, in accordance with the provisions of the Agreement.

 Such requests are made by member states' Customs authorities in respect of individual cases of imports from a third country. Since April 2001 the UK has received thirteen responses from Israel to requests for verification that the goods in question qualified for preferential treatment under the terms of the EU-Israel Association Agreement. In all but one of the cases Israel provided a standard response that the goods were originating products under the terms of the Agreement and thus qualified in Israel's view for preferential treatment. In the other case the Israeli authorities were unable to validate the exporter's claim that the goods in question qualified for preferential treatment. Of the twelve responses which verified the origin of the goods, one was received on 4 April; three on 22 April; one on 24 April; three on 24 May; one on 5 June; one on 12 June; one on 15 August and one on 14 September. The other response was received on 5 June.

 The Chemical Weapons Convention contains comprehensive compliance measures. These include the requirement to declare activities with scheduled chemicals, and of past chemical weapons production facilities and stockpiles; consultations; routine inspections of industrial and military facilities; and challenge inspections for alleged breaches of the Convention. The UK supports the implementation of these measures in the Executive Council of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) and on a bilateral basis. The UK reviews declarations by other State Parties and, where appropriate, has bilateral consultations to clarify possible ambiguities and omissions with the country concerned in order to ensure full transparency. The UK also undertakes practice

<P>
<P>
<a name="11127w18.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Colombia remains the world's principal source of cocaine. The international community and the Government of Colombia are committed to tackling the drugs trade and reducing the violence and instability with which it is linked. We support the Colombian Government's aim of reducing the cultivation, processing and distribution of drugs by 50 per cent. over the next six years. The UK has also been at the forefront of international efforts to support the peace process in Colombia.
<P>

<a name="11127w18.html_para0">We welcome the considerable progress being made in tackling the drugs trade in Bolivia. The United Nations International Drug Control Programme estimates that illicit coca cultivation in Bolivia has been reduced from 48,600 hectares in 1995 to 14,800 hectares in 2000. This reduction is due to the Bolivian Government's own efforts and international support.

<P>
<a name="11127w18.html_spnew3"><B> Peter Hain: </B> 
 Since the passage of the International Criminal Court Act on 11 May 2001, the United Kingdom has continued regularly to use our wide bilateral contacts with the United States to explain that we believe US reservations about the ICC are unfounded, and to encourage the US to ratify the Rome Statute. In addition we have participated in European Union action to the same end. The presidency of the European Union wrote to the Secretary of State Powell on 30 October 2001, drawing his attention to the EU Common Position of full support for the early entry into the force of the ICC Statute.

 The UK currently contributes 140 civilian police officers, mainly on secondment from the Police Service for Northern Ireland and the Ministry of Defence Police, to the United Nations Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) international civilian police force. These officers are engaged in both operational duties to maintain civil law and order in Kosovo, and in duties related to the work of UNMIK's Criminal Investigation Unit in Pristina. UNMIK police officers, including those seconded from the UK, played a key role in ensuring that the Kosovo elections on 17 November were conducted peacefully.
<P>

<a name="11127w18.html_para6">On 6 December the UK will deploy 18 recently retired British police officers to Kosovo. The secondment of recently retired British police officers is a new initiative and will increase our commitment in Kosovo to 158 officers. This figure excludes Mr. Chris Albiston, the Police Commissioner in Kosovo, who is a serving Assistant Chief Constable on secondment from the Police Service for Northern Ireland. If this initial deployment of retired police officers proves successful there might be scope for the deployment of increased numbers of retired policemen to peacekeeping duties with the UN in Kosovo and elsewhere.

I issued a joint statement on 7 August with the Czech Foreign Minister expressing the commitment of both Governments to the highest standard of human rights for all our citizens and our shared concern that substantial numbers of Czech citizens continue to make unfounded asylum applications in the UK. The text of the statement is available on the FCO website at www.fco.gov.uk/news/newstext.asp?5215.
<P>

<a name="11127w19.html_para1">While there can be no justification for citizens of a NATO ally and strong EU applicant to seek protection in the UK, the two Governments recognise that the position of the Roma minority is a problem in the Czech Republic. The UK fully supports the efforts of the Czech Government to address this problem.

<a name="11127w19.html_spnew2"><B> Peter Hain: </B> 
 Bulgaria has opened 23, and closed 12, of the 31 chapters of the EU acquis under negotiation. The European Commission judged, in its progress report published on November 13, that Bulgaria had made some good progress on alignment with the acquis in key areas. But work was still needed on administrative and judicial reform, and in combating corruption. The UK will continue to provide advice and support to Bulgaria in meeting the accession criteria in these and other areas.

<P>
<a name="11127w19.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Bob Ainsworth: </B> 
 The Home Department does not have a public service agreement (PSA) target for drug action teams to name comprehensive programmes involving lifeskills in schools, the youth service, further education and the community. The PSA relating to young people is to reduce the proportion of people under the age of 25 reporting the use of Class A drugs by 25 per cent. by 2005 and 50 per cent. by 2008.
<P>

<a name="11127w19.html_para6">However, the Government do believe that drug, alcohol and tobacco education is best delivered within a framework of personal, social and health education (PSHE). Good personal social and health education and citizenship education, when well delivered in schools, provides a vital foundation for the personal development of young people and prepares them for adult life. It can help to give pupils the knowledge, skills and understanding they need to lead confident, healthy, independent lives and to become informed, active and responsible citizens. Currently 93 per cent. of secondary schools and 75 per cent. of primaries now have a drug education policy compared with 86 per cent. of secondary schools and 61 per cent. of primaries in 1997. The target for 2002 is for all secondary schools and 80 per cent. of primaries to have effective programmes in place.

 The 2002 drugs strategy target, as set out in the United Kingdom Anti-Drugs Co-ordinator's First and Second National Plans, that all police services operate face-to-face arrest referral schemes covering all custody suites, was taken forward in the Spending Review 2000 Service Delivery Agreement commitment to make proactive arrest referral schemes available for all custody suites by 31 March 2002. This is one of several measures contributing towards delivery of the public service agreement (PSA) target to reduce levels of repeat offending among drug misusing offenders by 25 per cent. by 2005 and by 50 per cent. by 2008. As at the end of March 2001, 41 police forces were operating arrest referral schemes, with 330 arrest referral workers covering 86 per cent. of custody suites across England and Wales. The recently published Home Office Arrest Referral Statistical Update for the period October 2000 to March 2001 shows that arrest referral workers held 21,329 interviews in that period involving 19,190 individuals, 56 per cent. of whom were referred to a specialist treatment service. Of those referred to drug treatment, preliminary analyses based upon a sample of regions, suggest 15&#150;25 per cent. make a treatment demand. This figure is provisional and subject to further validation.

 In July 1999 the Home Secretary set recruitment targets for the Home Office and its agencies (Police, Prison, Probation and Fire services <sup>1</sup> ). Most of the targets have to be met by 2009. All service areas showed progress from April 2000 to March 2001. The percentage of minority ethnic staff in the core Home Office and Immigration and Nationality Directorate in London and Croydon has risen from 24 per cent. in 2000 to 28.2 per cent. this year, against a target of 25 per cent. set for 2009. The Police, Prison and Fire services are all working towards a target of 7 per cent. minority ethnic staff by 2009. So far they have progressed as follows: (2000 figures in brackets): Police 3.1 per cent. (3 per cent.), Prison 3.7 per cent. (3.2 per cent.), Fire 1.6 per cent. (1.6 per cent.). The Probation Service has increased the percentage of minority ethnic staff in the organisation from 9.3 per cent. to 9.8 per cent. since 2000. Its target for 2009 is 8.3 per cent.
<P>

<a name="11127w19.html_para14">The Home Office and its services are working to achieve equal retention rates for white and minority ethnic staff. There is still work to be done, however and some key initiatives are being developed, for example exit interviews, support networks for minority ethnic staff and comprehensive diversity awareness training for management and staff.
<P>

<a name="11127w19.html_para15">The Home Secretary's progression targets are expressed in different ways for the different services. Essentially they require that, by 2009, the percentage of minority ethnic staff in each grade is the same as for white staff. For example, the percentage of Senior Probation Officers who are from minority ethnic groups rose from 5.6 per cent. to 8.0 per cent. last year. The first minority ethnic Chief Officer in the Probation Service was appointed.

 The relevant public service agreement target is to reduce the rate of reconviction of all young offenders by 5 per cent. against the predicted rate by 2004. The first rates are expected in spring 2002. They will cover juveniles reprimanded, warned or convicted in July 2000, shortly after most of the new youth justice interventions had been brought into operation across England and Wales.

programme was launched last year. We understand from the Association of Chief Police Officers that 32 forces have now trained officers in these techniques.
<P>

<a name="11127w19.html_para18">While there is no specific target in respect of drug recognition techniques and field impairment testing, the Department for Transport, Local Government and the Regions supports developments in this area through continuing research to monitor the use of these techniques.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make a statement on progress towards the public service agreement target for reducing the level of disorder.  [17053]<P>

<P>
<a name="11127w19.html_spnew17"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The Government have introduced a range of measures to help tackle the problems of disorder and anti-social behaviour, such as the Anti-Social Behaviour Order, and we are encouraged by the increasing use of these by the police and local authorities. A public service agreement target for the reduction of disorder and anti-social behaviour will be set in April.

 The Government have not issued such guidance. Proof of age, like proof of identity, can be achieved by using authentication services, such as certified digital signatures.

 The Government have no plans to create such a new offence. Aggravating factors inform the decision by the police on how to proceed with an offence, and will also properly be considered by the courts when sentencing. Aggravated possession is already recognised to some extent by the separate offence of possession with intent to supply a controlled drug.

 The first part of the latest review has now finished and I have carefully considered the recommendations in line with the terms of guidance for reviewing non-departmental public bodies (NDPB), included in the Government's Modernising Government White Paper.
<P>

<a name="11127w21.html_para5">Compass Partnership, a firm of independent consultants, conducted the review and after focusing on the context within which the Community Development Foundation (CDF) works, reviewed its management arrangements, surveyed a sample of its external stakeholders and considered the alternative options for CDF. They also considered whether there was a need for the particular functions carried out by CDF as an NDPB to continue.

<a name="11127w23.html_para1">Although the period given for discussion was shortened, the listening exercise for the discussion document met the spirit and principles of the Cabinet Office guidance in every other respect.
<P>

<a name="11127w23.html_para2">We have received around 1,000 written responses to the listening exercise from members of the public, community health councils, National Health Service bodies, the voluntary sector and local government. In addition we have also commissioned a research company to conduct some research with people from socially excluded groups about their views on the proposed new structures.
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what proportion of poultry feed <i>(a)</i> deliveries and <i>(b)</i> movement in the United Kingdom was traceable in (i) 1998, (ii) 1999, (iii) 2000 and (iv) 2001; and if he will make a statement.  [17101]<P>

 <i>[holding answer 23 November 2001]:</i> Figures on the traceability of deliveries and movement of animal feed in the form requested are not recorded. However, various European Commission measures on the labelling and composition of animal feed, implemented in the United Kingdom over the last few years, assist with traceability by requiring extensive labelling and for documentary records to be kept. Additionally, the vast majority of animal feed manufacturers in the United Kingdom operate under assurance schemes which cover manufacture, packaging, storage and supply and require records to be kept to permit traceability.

 For the period January to December this year, 579,033 summonses for jury service were issued, to supply around 187,000 potential jurors to the courts. There are no figures available on how many people actually served on juries. However, a recent Home Office research project confirmed that, in a sample of 50,000 people summoned for jury service in June and July 1999, only one-third was available to attend. About one-third of these had their service deferred until a later date. Of the remaining two-thirds, 13 per cent. were ineligible, disqualified or excused as of right, 38 per cent. were excused and 15 per cent. either failed to attend on the day or their summonses were returned as "undelivered".

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs in how many infected premises in Powys in the foot and mouth outbreak samples from animals diagnosed as having foot and mouth disease were taken and tested in a laboratory for foot and mouth disease virus or antibodies; how many of those samples proved positive; and, where samples were not taken, what were the reasons for samples not being collected.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11127w25.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 There have been 70 foot and mouth (FMD) infected premises recorded in Powys. Of the 63 premises where samples were taken for laboratory testing, 44 were considered positive for FMD. In the early stages of the outbreak laboratory resources were limited. In cases where clear clinical signs of FMD were observed and where disease had already been confirmed in the locality, it is possible that samples were not requested.

 <i>[holding answer 21 November 2001]:</i> Hunting (except the hunting of deer) will be able to resume in foot and mouth disease free counties of England and Wales from 17 December under a temporary system of permits issued by DEFRA local animal health offices. I published details of the system and the Veterinary Risk Assessment on 15 November and placed copies in the House of Commons Library . The list of foot and mouth disease free counties is updated weekly and can be viewed on the Department's website http://www.defra.gov.uk/. The Veterinary Risk Assessment is that hunting should be permissible in other areas once those areas also achieve foot and mouth disease free status.
<P>

<a name="11127w28.html_para0">Restrictions on hunting arise from the need to prevent further outbreaks of foot and mouth disease, which remains a central concern of the Government. We also want to enable the countryside to return to normal as quickly as possible. To keep the balance right we are allowing hunting to resume to the extent that is consistent with the Veterinary Risk Assessment and with conditions that reflect the assessment.
<P>

<a name="11127w28.html_para1">The precautions to be taken when different forms of hunting resume are outlined in proposed permit conditions, which have been placed in the Library of the House and are also available on the DEFRA website. I have invited interested parties to let us have any comments on the proposed permit conditions by 7 December. I have already met representative groups to explain the background and to discuss the arrangements.

 <i>[holding answer 22 November 2001]:</i> With effect from 20 November 2001, Northumberland has been reclassified for the purposes of foot and mouth disease controls from 'High Risk' to 'At Risk'. This means that under the Animal Movements Licensing Scheme cattle may move into Northumberland from 'FMD Free' counties under a licence issued by a local authority subject to prior veterinary inspection. All counties in Scotland are designated as 'FMD Free'. The licence system is in place to minimise the risk of spreading FMD.

 <i>[holding answer 23 November 2001]:</i> Controls on pesticide residues in food are based on a system of statutory maximum residue levels (MRLs). MRLs are set for particular pesticide active ingredients on particular foodstuffs. MRLs are not safety levels but are established on the basis of the approved use of the active substance. They are generally set at levels lower than is necessary for safety purposes to ensure that only the minimum necessary pesticide dose is applied.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (1) what the permitted concentrations of <i>(a)</i> nicarbazin, <i>(b)</i> lasalocid and <i>(c)</i> dimetridazole residues in poultry are which were deemed safe for human consumption in the United Kingdom (i) 1998, (ii) 1999, (iii) 2000 and (iv) 2001;  [16973]

<P>
<P>
<a name="11127w30.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 23 November 2001]:</i> The Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) has set an Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) for nicarbazin of 0&#150;400 g/kg of body weight&#151;24,000 g for a person weighing 60 kg.

<P>

<a name="11127w30.html_para3">No samples of poultry have been found to contain residues of dimetridazole in the period. Residues of nicarbazin and lasalocid have been found in samples of UK poultry, but toxicologists' advice has confirmed that none posed a risk to consumer safety. The presence of nicarbazin in poultry products is a food contaminant issue, rather than a food safety issue.

 <i>[holding answer 26 November 2001]:</i> In April 2000 the new contaminated land regime (under Part IIA of the Environmental Protection Act 1990) came into force in England. It places a duty on local authorities to inspect their areas for contaminated land. The enforcing authority will then establish the appropriate person(s) to bear the costs of remediation, decide on the remediation required, and ensure that it takes place, whether through agreement, or by serving a remediation notice on the appropriate person(s), or by doing the work and then recovering the costs.
<P>

<a name="11127w31.html_para0">In most cases the appropriate persons will be those who caused or knowingly permitted the contamination, but if they cannot be found liability passes to the current owner or occupier unless the problem is solely one of water pollution. There is provision for waiving or reducing liability in certain circumstances, including cases of hardship. In this way, the regime reflects the "polluter pays" principle.

 <i>[holding answer 26 November 2001]:</i> Successive United Kingdom Governments have long been committed to radical reform of the CAP in order to bring benefits to UK consumers, taxpayers and farmers. Next summer we expect the EU Commission to initiate the mid-term review of the CAP following the Agenda 2000 reforms.
<P>

<a name="11127w31.html_para4">The United Kingdom Government have not yet finalised their position on the mid-term review but have signalled their view that the Community should seize the opportunity for a radical reform covering: a switch from market distorting subsidies (pillar 1) to support for rural development and environmental schemes (pillar 2); abolition of milk quotas and compulsory set aside; and decoupling of livestock payments. We believe that these changes are necessary to deliver the type of modern, market-driven, environmentally sensitive agriculture which will benefit society as a whole and is in the long-term best interests of the agricultural industry itself. They will also help achieve the EU's wider objectives as regards the WTO negotiations and enlargement.

 <i>[holding answer 5 November 2001]:</i> The Government have considered very carefully whether it would be appropriate to pay compensation for losses incurred on cattle which went beyond the 30-month age limit because of movement restrictions imposed during the earlier part of the foot and mouth disease (FMD) outbreak. We have conclude that it would not. Statutory compensation for losses incurred as a result of the FMD outbreak is only paid on animals which have been slaughtered as a result of FMD, or on property, including animals which have been seized and destroyed in order to prevent the spread of FMD. The Government do not compensate farmers, or businesses, for other, indirect losses.

<a name="11127w32.html_para7">The Primary and Secondary Thresholds for Class 1 contributions will continue to be aligned with the weekly amounts of the income tax personal allowance at &#163;89 a week. This means that no tax or Class 1 contributions will actually be paid on earnings below this level. The Upper Earnings Limit for primary Class 1 contributions will be raised to &#163;585.
<P>

<a name="11127w32.html_para8">The rate of secondary Class 1 contributions payable by all employers is to be reduced by 0.1 per cent. from 11.9 per cent. to 11.8 per cent. This is to ensure that the overall effect on industry from the introduction of the Aggregates Levy will be revenue neutral.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what plans he has further to encourage the recycling of aggregates <i>(a)</i> by means of the aggregates levy and <i>(b)</i> by other means.  [18425]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11127w33.html_spnew0"><B> Ruth Kelly: </B> 
 The aggregates levy will provide an incentive to use recycled aggregate and alternative materials, as these will be exempted. Levy revenues will also fund a &#163;35 million sustainability fund one of whose objectives will be to encourage recycling objectives of the levy.
<P>

<a name="11127w33.html_para0">Landfill tax on inactive waste also offers an incentive for the recycling of aggregate rather than its disposal in waste sites.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what research his Department has <i>(a)</i> commissioned and <i>(b)</i> evaluated on the environmental (i) costs and (ii) benefits of the supply of aggregates from coastal super quarries compared to that from other types of quarry.  [18426]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11127w33.html_spnew1"><B> Ruth Kelly: </B> 
 The independent research which underpins the aggregates levy considered all aspects of the environmental impacts of aggregate extraction. The levy will be introduced at a single rate in order to keep it simple and send a clear signal to encourage purchasers of primary aggregate to use alternative materials where possible.
<P>
<P>

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer (1) what assessment he has made of the direct environmental <i>(a)</i> costs and <i>(b)</i> benefits arising from the introduction of the aggregates levy;  [17924]

<UL>(2) what assessment he has made of the impact of the aggregates levy on the environmental aspects of quarrying which are not dealt with by existing regulatory controls.  [17923]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11127w33.html_spnew2"><B> Ruth Kelly: </B> 
 Independent research shows there are significant environmental costs associated with aggregates extraction that are not already covered by regulation including noise, dust, visual intrusion, loss of amenity and damage to biodiversity.
<P>

<a name="11127w33.html_para1">The aggregates levy will encourage the efficient use of natural aggregates and the greater use of alternative materials, such as recycled aggregate and certain waste materials, thereby reducing the environmental costs of aggregates extraction.

<a name="11127w33.html_spnew5"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 Repair work to churches is liable to VAT at the standard rate. There are no special VAT rules for churches in designated conservation areas. However, the Government have introduced a UK-wide grant scheme, the effect of which will be to reduce the VAT cost to 5 per cent., for works of repair, maintenance and improvements to listed places of worship undertaken from 1 April 2001.

<P>

<a name="11127w33.html_para2">The Government are currently spearheading a drive to tackle financial exclusion.

<a name="11127w33.html_spnew10"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 Personal tax and benefit measures introduced since 1997 have lifted 1.2 million children in the UK as a whole out of poverty, defined as 60 per cent. of median income after allowing for housing costs. Because of the margins of error, it is not possible to model the precise effects in individual counties or regions.
