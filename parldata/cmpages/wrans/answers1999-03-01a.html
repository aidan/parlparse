To ask the Secretary of State for Wales what proportion of ordinary classes in primary schools contained more than 30 pupils in January 1998.  [73110]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90301w01.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 In January 1998, 28 per cent. (2,735) of ordinary classes in primary schools had more than 30 pupils.
<P>

<a name="90301w01.htm_para1">On the basis of grant approvals for local authorities to employ additional teachers from September 1998 to reduce infant class sizes, it is estimated that there are 722 fewer infant classes with over 30 pupils than would have been the case without grant. The additional &#163;50m provided for schools in the local government revenue settlement for 1998-99 will also have had an impact. The results of the January 1999 schools' census will give the actual position.

 The withdrawal of payable tax credits will be completed from 6 April 1999. We recognise the special position of charities and provided generous compensation for them through public expenditure, for the withdrawal of their payable tax credits. This compensation takes the form of a payment to a charity of a percentage of the dividends it receives, and will apply for five years from 6 April 1999 on a tapering basis, giving charities an opportunity to adjust to the withdrawal of payable tax credits.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90301w02.htm_spnew3"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 The Government are committed to improving consumer protection, and the creation of the single ombudsman scheme is an important element in delivering such protection. The response to the draft Bill published in July 1998 showed strong support for the creation of the single ombudsman scheme. The Government, however, intend to amend some of the relevant provisions of the Bill to meet valid concerns raised.
<P>

<a name="90301w02.htm_para0">The draft Bill allows for an appeal to the courts against the ombudsman's determination by either respondent or complainant on a point of law. Consistent with the objective of resolving disputes quickly and with minimum formality, we have decided to remove this provision.
<P>

<a name="90301w02.htm_para1">Currently, the Bill allows the Ombudsman to order complainants to pay costs if they behave improperly or unreasonably. In order that complainants should be able to approach the Ombudsman without the fear of being ordered to pay the respondent's costs, we have decided to provide for the scheme operator to make rules authorising awards of the scheme's costs against either party, limited in the case of the complainant to the costs of the scheme operator.
<P>

<a name="90301w02.htm_para2">We also intend to widen the FSA's discretion over which complaints are to be included in the compulsory jurisdiction. The FSA will be able to include all financial services carried out by authorised persons, not just those listed in Schedule 2 to the Bill. This change will allow the FSA to bring within the compulsory jurisdiction the large majority of disputes involving authorised persons which can currently be dealt with by the existing schemes, including the Banking and Building Societies Ombudsmen. We will also give the FSA sufficient flexibility to exclude some categories of regulated firms where there is a case to do so. We propose that the scheme operator should have similar discretion over the scope of the voluntary jurisdiction.

 HSE inspectors have sought clarification from Zeneca regarding reports in the national press that members of staff have eaten whole genetically modified tomatoes as part of taste trials. If this had taken place it would have represented a possible breach of environmental safety regulations. This is because tomatoes are a seed bearing fruit and the inadvertent dispersal of seeds from genetically modified tomatoes could have given rise to growth of genetically modified plants in the environment. The concern would have been that seeds would have dispersed through the sewage system, thereby breaching containment requirements.
<P>

<a name="90301w03.htm_para7">It has been found that there were major inaccuracies in the reporting. In particular, it would appear that taste trials have been undertaken only using tomato tissues from which all seeds have been removed.

Where these suggestions were judged, on the advice of the nature conservation agencies through the JNCC, to be consistent with the Habitats Directive's criteria and requirements, they have been adopted. The JNCC publications, The Habitats Directive: selection of Special Areas of Conservation in the UK (Report No. 270), sets out the rationale that has been applied. It was published in October 1997 and placed in the Library of the House at the time.

 Our proposals were set out in our White Paper "A Mayor and Assembly for London" (Cm 3897). Paragraph 5.27 of the White Paper indicates that the Mayor will be able to:
<P>

<a name="90301w04.htm_para2"><P>

</FONT></UL>
<a name="90301w04.htm_para7">The White Paper made it clear that OPRAF would not be bound to accept the Mayor's guidance if it would have an adverse impact beyond London or would result in additional financial liability to the taxpayer. Transport for London will also be able to exercise powers inherited from London Transport to ensure consistency between

rail, Underground and bus services in terms of Travelcard fares and ticketing, marketing and passenger information. Transport for London will also have the power to oppose rail schemes which it thinks are contrary to the Mayor's transport strategy or other policies, or to the interests of Londoners.
<P>

<a name="90301w04.htm_para8">Clauses 163 to 166 of the Greater London Authority Bill currently set out the draft provisions which will give effect to our proposals. Those clauses were debated in Standing Committee on 23 February 1999, <i>Official Report, Standing Committee A,</i> columns 723-49.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90301w04.htm_wqn7"><B> Mrs. Dunwoody: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what is the current estimate for the start date of the construction of the Thameslink 2000 rail scheme.  [73092]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90301w04.htm_spnew7"><B> Dr. Reid: </B> 
 The start of construction work on the Thameslink 2000 rail project is dependent on two factors:
<P>

<a name="90301w04.htm_para9">Firstly, the project requires construction powers to be granted under the Transport and Works Act 1992 (TWA). Railtrack submitted an application for a TWA Order for Thameslink 2000 in November 1997. Following consideration of representations made in respect of that application, and changes resulting from a review of the project, Railtrack is currently preparing a supplementary TWA Order application. A decision on when any public inquiry into the proposed scheme might be held has therefore been deferred until December 1999. The earliest an Inquiry could realistically be expected to commence is Spring of 2000. The timing of the Secretary of State's decision on whether to grant powers following the Inquiry Inspector's report, and--if powers are granted--the start of construction work, would depend on a number of factors, including the length of the Inquiry and the Inspector's findings.
<P>

<a name="90301w04.htm_para10">Secondly, the Thameslink 2000 project is dependent on Stage 2 of the Channel Tunnel Rail Link (CTRL) for the provision of certain works at St. Pancras. Railtrack has said that it intends to proceed with the exercise of its option to construct Stage 2 of CTRL, but believes that it would be inappropriate to make such a commitment until after the outcome is known of the Rail Regulator's review of access charges. If this option were exercised in 2001, construction of Thameslink 2000 would start in early 2002 and the service could be operational in 2006.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90301w04.htm_spnew8"><B> Dr. Reid: </B> 
 The Office of Passenger Rail Franchising (OPRAF) is in discussion with the local authorities and Central Trains about the future arrangements for the funding and provision of services on the Robin Hood line. For the current financial year (1998-99), OPRAF is providing a contribution of &#163;350,000 to Central Trains in respect of Robin Hood Line services.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90301w05.htm_spnew0"><B> Dr. Reid: </B> 
 The Franchising Director does not have any power to prevent train operating companies from reducing their staffing levels. He has rights of approval over changes to pension arrangements and changes to pay and conditions which would leave undesirable legacies for the next franchisee.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90301w05.htm_spnew4"><B> Dr. Reid: </B> 
 In 1997 the Department published a report entitled "Perceptions of safety from crime on public transport". This was the outcome of a number of surveys and focus groups carried out across England which included train travel. In the last five years the British Transport Police have carried out annual surveys alternately with railway passengers or staff and these included questions on the fear of crime.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what was the total sum invested in measures specifically to improve access to stations for travellers with disabilities in each of the years between 1987-88 and 1997-98.  [73103]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90301w05.htm_spnew5"><B> Dr. Reid: </B> 
 Information on specific expenditure on disabled access is not available for those years.
<P>

<a name="90301w05.htm_para0">However, all new stations planned or in build will provide full unassisted wheelchair access. In addition, Railtrack are on course to meet the target, set in the Network Management Statement 1998, of providing unassisted wheelchair access at a further 119 stations this year.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what duties will be given to the Strategic Rail Authority in regard to improving access to the rail network for travellers with disabilities.  [73102]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90301w05.htm_spnew6"><B> Dr. Reid: </B> 
 Subject to Parliament's' consideration of the necessary legislation, the Strategic Rail Authority will have a duty to have regard, in particular, to the interests of disabled people. The SRA would also inherit the Rail Regulator's code of practice for protecting disabled railway passengers and a duty to revise it from time to time and encourage its adoption and implementation. The Rail Vehicle Accessibility Regulations 1998, which came into effect on 1 January this year, have set clear technical requirements for wheelchair access and a range of other features that will apply to all new rolling stock coming into service from that date.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90301w05.htm_spnew10"><B> Dr. Reid: </B> 
 In all the access agreements which the Rail Regulator has approved to date, the acceptance of national interavailable protected fares has been a requirement. The Rail Regulator has indicated that he would not expect to approve access rights for new services where he had reason to believe that approval was likely to result in the loss of network benefits. Those benefits include the provision of interavailable tickets. For franchise operators, the obligation to accept interavailable tickets is a condition of their franchise agreement.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90301w05.htm_wqn11"><B> Mrs. Dunwoody: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what instructions he gave to passenger transport authorities in regard to fares levels in connection with the payment of the special rail grant to passenger transport executives.  [73094]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90301w05.htm_spnew11"><B> Dr. Reid: </B> 
 None. Where Passenger Transport Authorities (PTAs) have chosen to retain responsibility for setting fares on the rail services which they support, they are free to raise or lower fares as they wish. However, the amount of grant entitlement will take account of the financial consequences of fares changes which diverge from the national fares cap set by the Franchising Director. Fares in the areas of the two PTAs which have chosen to pass responsibility for setting fares to the train operating companies are subject to the regulated fares cap set in franchise agreements, i.e. RPI-1 from 1 January 1999.

[73089]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90301w05.htm_spnew12"><B> Dr. Reid: </B> 
 The Criterion for securing the bus links was the integration of public transport in line with our recent White Paper, <i>A New Deal for Transport</i>. The primary aim was to transport passengers to rail heads by bus from areas not currently served by rail services and thus to encourage greater use of train services from these rail heads.

<a name="90301w06.htm_para1">There has been one official visit on 27-30 January 1998 when a senior Departmental official represented DETR at an International Workshop on Strategic Approaches to Freshwater Management. The event was attended by some 80 countries, together with NGOs, industry and International agencies. This event was hosted by the Zimbabwe Government with EC support, and helped pave the way for the Commission for Sustainable Development's Sixth meeting at which a formal Decision on Strategic Approaches to Freshwater Management was adopted by CSD, and later endorsed by UNGASS.

Mr. Meale <i>[holding answer 26 February 1999]:</i> The requirements for selecting zoo inspectors are set out under Section 8 of the Zoo Licensing Act 1981. The list of inspectors is compiled after consultation with the British Veterinary Association, the Federation of Zoological Gardens and other bodies. The list consists of two parts: the first part contains the names of veterinary surgeons and practitioners who have experience of animals of the kinds that are or may be kept in zoos; the second part contains the names of other persons who are in the Secretary of State's opinion competent to inspect animals in zoos, to advise on keeping them and on their welfare, and to advise on the management of zoos generally. The Secretary of State may, after the required consultation, vary the list of inspectors by adding or deleting names.
<P>
Following the Government's review last year of the operation of the Zoo Licensing Act 1981 we plan to revise and update the current list of zoo inspectors. A new advisory body, the Zoos Forum, which we will be establishing shortly will also have an important part to play in reviewing the current list of inspectors and advising on further nominations for appointment.

 <i>[holding answer 26 February 1999]:</i> All zoos in Great Britain are required to comply with the <i>Standards of Modern Zoo Practice</i> issued by the Secretary of State under the Zoo Licensing Act 1981. The <i>Standards</i> do not at present specifically cover shackling. We announced a package of proposals in September last year to modernise the British zoo licensing system, and this included a review of the <i>Standards</i>, which is currently under way.
<P>

<a name="90301w06.htm_para2">Local authorities are responsible for the issuing of licences and other executive functions under the Act. In considering whether to issue a new or renewed licence under the Act, local authorities may attach any conditions or recommendations which they consider necessary or desirable, having regard to the <i>Standards</i>. Local authorities may also refuse to grant a licence, or to revoke an existing licence, if a zoo is not meeting required standards. The Act provides for inspections of zoos by teams of experts to ensure that the arrangements for accommodation, staffing or management are adequate for the proper care and well being of zoo animals.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90301w07.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Raynsford </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 26 February 1999]:</i> Our aim is to offer everyone the opportunity of a decent home and so promote social cohesion, well-being and self-dependence. The provision of good quality, efficiently managed social housing plays an important part in meeting that aim.
<P>

<a name="90301w07.htm_para0">We are making available an extra &#163;5 billion for housing over the life of this Parliament, giving local authorities increased scope to invest in new social housing where this best reflects local needs and priorities, and boosting the Housing Corporation's support for new social housing relative to the last Government's spending plans.
<P>

<a name="90301w07.htm_para1">However, the overall number of new social houses built is not a full or satisfactory measure of a successful housing strategy. Decisions on investment have to strike a balance between the need for new social housing and the requirement to invest in improvements to the existing social and private sector stock. They must also take proper account of the demand for social housing, which varies greatly between regions and even between local neighbourhoods. It is important, therefore, that investment decisions reflect local circumstances. The policies we are putting in place following the Comprehensive Spending Review are designed to ensure that investment decisions are based on robust local assessments of housing need, reflected in housing strategies drawn up by local authorities in partnership with their communities.

 The Environmental Protocol entered into force in January 1998, although the UK had implemented its provisions soon after its adoption in 1991. Operational procedures in Antarctica have changed considerably within the past few years to take on board the tough provisions of the Protocol, e.g., the regular use of Environmental Impact Assessments, rigorous waste 



<P>
<P><I>1 Mar 1999 : Column: 523</I><P>
disposal standards, etc. All activities of British citizens in Antarctica, including the scientists of the British Antarctic Survey, are the subject of permits issued by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. An assessment of compliance with environmental standards is a routine part of permitting procedures. From our knowledge of the operations in Antarctica of other Treaty parties it is apparent that all, to a greater or lesser extent, have embraced the provisions of the Protocol.
<P>

<a name="90301w07.htm_para6">Scientists from the British Antarctic Survey continually monitor conditions in Antarctica. Whilst the Environmental Protocol has strengthened the environmental protection of Antarctica from activities which are carried out there, changes to Antarctica's environment are occurring due to the impact of wider global events, e.g., pollution from industrial areas outside of Antarctica.
<P>

<a name="90301w07.htm_para7">The Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions partly funds the Hadley Centre to analyse global temperature trends, although they have not studied Antarctica specifically.

<a name="90301w07.htm_para8">The Department does, however, follow the work of scientists working in the region.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90301w08.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Meale: </B> 
 The building of the Millennium Dome, and its proposed long-term retention, will have major regenerative benefits for London, the full effects of which will become increasingly apparent over time.
<P>

<a name="90301w08.htm_para2">Before the decision was taken to site the Millennium Dome at Greenwich, the Greenwich Peninsula was one of the largest derelict sites in the country, suffering from heavy contamination. Yet it lies only a few miles from the centre of London and close to the many historic attractions of Greenwich. The extensive site preparation works and infrastructure improvements required for the Millennium Experience have acted as the catalyst for a major mixed-use development project on the Greenwich Peninsula, under the direction of English Partnerships. This project, including the new Millennium Village that is being built in the southern part of the site as a model for sustainable regeneration of a brownfield site, will establish the Peninsula as a vibrant new urban quarter for London, with ensuing economic, social and environmental benefits for the capital--and beyond.
<P>

<a name="90301w08.htm_para3">Furthermore, the Government intend shortly to launch a competition to find an alternative use for the Dome after the Millennium Experience finishes. We consider that retention of this unique structure with a new use that is both suitable and sustainable can make a substantial and lasting contribution to development of the Greenwich Peninsula, and give an added impetus to the long-term regeneration of the Thames Gateway. My hon. Friend will appreciate that different types of use could have widely varying impacts, both locally and nationally. We are confident, however, that the competition will bring forward a wide range of imaginative proposals and an outcome that will be of major benefit to London.

 The Government have said that, barring some fundamental and unforeseen change in economic circumstances, making a decision during this Parliament to join the single currency is not realistic. The UK economy needs a period of stability in order to demonstrate sustainable convergence. The Government have put in place a new macroeconomic framework and introduced a series of microeconomic reforms which are both in the national economic interest and will help to deliver the stability required to demonstrate that convergence is sustainable.

 The English Sports Council is announcing today, Monday 1 March, with the Government's support, the United Kingdom Sports Institute's (UKSI's) network of centres around England. 



<P>
<P><I>1 Mar 1999 : Column: 536</I><P>
The English Sports Council is prepared to commit, in principle, up to &#163;100 million of Lottery funding to help British athletes achieve future gold medals.
<P>

<a name="90301w11.htm_para0">The provision of Lottery funding for the English network will, of course, remain a matter for the English Sports Council to decide on the basis of a full and proper assessment of suitable applications from the sites that have been identified, in line with the Policy and Financial Directions I have given them, and in line with advice from the UK Sports Council and UK Sports Institute when operational.
<P>

<a name="90301w11.htm_para1">The Government are determined to ensure our leading sportsmen and women--now and in the future--have access to the very best sporting facilities and services to enable them to compete successfully against the world's top athletes. We have listened to their needs and concerns. The package announced today will deliver the right blend of local provision and central co-ordination. This is what sports want, it is what competitors want and I am confident we have got it right.
<P>

<a name="90301w11.htm_para2">The network centres are central to delivering the UKSI's objectives. They will enable our sportsmen and women to have access to the most modern training facilities and methods in the world, near where they live. Competitors will in future be able to spend more time and energy in improving performance and less on struggling to find and get to the right place to train.
<P>

<a name="90301w11.htm_para3">Facilities, expertise, resources and services will be sport specific and delivered where, when and how athletes want them. All sports will be able to make use of the facilities and services. There will be a mix of private and public investment. The public investment will be through Lottery funding. The UKSI will concentrate on the Olympic sports and those minority sports lacking a commercial element.
<P>

<a name="90301w11.htm_para4">The UKSI will consist of a Headquarters in Sheffield, already announced, supported by network centres across England in 10 areas of England, as well as centres in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. In England these will be at Bath University, Bedford, Bisham Abbey, Crystal Place, Gateshead, Holme Pierrepont/Loughborough, Lilleshall, Manchester, Southampton University and Sheffield. These will be supported by regional sites of expertise; ensuring all best practice is harnessed for the benefit of athletes and coaches through a consortium approach.
<P>

<a name="90301w11.htm_para5">The investment of &#163;100 million of Lottery Funds into the network in England brings with it a commitment from the sports in the programme to make use of the services and facilities for a significant amount of time. Therefore the Sports Councils will expect the commitment to the network by the governing bodies of sport to be linked to the Lottery funding they receive through the World Class Performance Plans they produce.
<P>

<a name="90301w11.htm_para6">Each of the networks in England, plus those in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, will have access to specialist science and medical advice from the UKSI's headquarters in Sheffield. The HQ will also co-ordinate research and other athlete services and training support to ensure that the UK's top athletes, wherever they may live, have access to the very best facilities and services through UKSI, with an emphasis on making the facilities easily 



<P>
<P><I>1 Mar 1999 : Column: 537</I><P>
accessible throughout the country. A separate announcement has already been made in respect of Scotland.
<P>

<a name="90301w11.htm_para7">The UKSI's headquarters in Sheffield is also moving forward and announcements will be made at each key stage, as appointments are made and designs finalised.
<P>

<a name="90301w11.htm_para8">Today's announcement adds another dimension to the extensive support now being provided to the UK's leading athletes. It will build on the success of the World Class performance programme and the English Sports Council's recent announcement extending this Lottery support to programmes for World Class Start and World Class Potential.
<P>

<a name="90301w11.htm_para9">Sporting success brings with it an enormous sense of pride. Pride for the individual competitor; pride for those close to them; and pride for those of us who support the endeavours of British athletes. The UKSI is not a quick fix. It is a long term investment in the future performance of British sportsmen and women.
<P>

<a name="90301w11.htm_para10">Work has already been undertaken in full consultation with Performance Directors, coaches, athletes and service providers to develop a menu of 40 UKSI services to be delivered directly to athletes by the network. The list has been further refined to indicate those which would be provided from the HQ and those services which must be provided via each of the network locations.
<P>

<a name="90301w11.htm_para11">There has always been a commitment to deliver urgently needed support services as soon as they are ready, particularly those that do not currently exist. The athlete personal development programme, ACE UK, will be the first of these launched in May this year.
<P>

<a name="90301w11.htm_para12">With the very best facilities, the best coaching, and the best scientific and medical support, I am confident that our top athletes--both those of today and of future generations--will have the best opportunity to turn potential into medals.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what amounts in his Department's budget for 1998-99 can be attributed to spending on disabled people; and what proportion this represents of total departmental spending.  [71285]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90301w13.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Chris Smith: </B> 
 My Department takes the principle of equal opportunities very seriously. Facilities and support to ensure reasonable access to persons with disabilities is built into many of my NDPBs' main programmes. However, it is not always possible to disaggregate all spending on specific initiatives/activities for disabled people within those programmes. It is not, therefore, possible to provide a meaningful answer on the amounts spent attributable to disabled people and the proportion this represents of my Department's total budget.

 My hon. Friend the Minister for the Arts did not discuss the Answer with either the former or the present Chairman of the Heritage Lottery Fund. The guarantee we have given that there will be no further adjustments to the percentage shares of Lottery income for the arts, sport, heritage and charities, and that each can count on receiving 16 per cent. after the current temporary reduction ends in May, and beyond 2001, is excellent news for these good causes and for the Heritage Lottery Fund.

 The Scottish Office provides detailed guidance to colleges regarding completion of the Unit Cost Data Forms BMU, in order to ensure accuracy and comparability. Although the forms are not themselves audited the figures are reconciled with colleges' audited annual accounts.

To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland if he will make a statement on the progress made by the Government in tackling social exclusion in Scotland.  [74118]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90301w15.htm_spnew7"><B> Mr. Dewar: </B> 
 Social exclusion is a pernicious phenomenon and we have made clear our determination to confront it. Since coming into office we have put in place a wide-ranging and well resourced programme of action. We have today published a social inclusion strategy for Scotland, which has been developed and endorsed by the Scottish Social Inclusion Network, chaired by my noble Friend Lord Sewel. The strategy aims to ensure that action already underway achieves the greatest possible impact, and that future action to promote social inclusion is integrated, evaluated and informed by new ideas and existing best practice.
<P>

<a name="90301w15.htm_para14">A statement of the Government's programme of action is set out in a companion document to the strategy, also published today. Copies of both documents are available from the House Library.
<P>

<a name="90301w15.htm_para15">From 1 July 1999 action taken forward under the social inclusion strategy will be a matter for the Scottish Parliament.

<a name="90301w15.htm_wqn8"><B> Mr. Russell Brown: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland when he expects to respond to the report of the Royal Commission on Long Term Care of the Elderly.  [74394]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90301w15.htm_spnew8"><B> Mr. Dewar: </B> 
 As my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Health has indicated today, we have just received the Royal Commission's very full and detailed report. I join my right hon. Friend in his tribute to the work of the Commission, under the chairmanship of Sir Stewart Sutherland. We are grateful to all the Commission members, including the other Scottish-based member, Professor Mary Marshall of the Dementia Services Development Centre at the University of Stirling.
<P>

<a name="90301w15.htm_para16">The report's recommendations are important and wide ranging. They will require very careful consideration. Some relate to matters such as social security and pensions which are to be reserved to Westminster. Scottish Ministers and officials will play a full part in inter-departmental discussions on these matters, both now and, I am sure, after devolution. Other recommendations 



<P>
<P><I>1 Mar 1999 : Column: 554</I><P>
relate to matters such as social work, health and housing, which will be devolved. From 1 July 1999 these will be a matter for the Scottish Parliament and the response to the recommendations will be for the Scottish Executive and Parliament to take forward in the light of the informed debate which the Commission hopes to see, and our proposals for modernising social work services which will be set out in a White Paper later this month.
<P>

<a name="90301w15.htm_para17">The Commission has made two key recommendations. The first is that personal care as defined by the Commission (that is, not including the costs of board and lodging) should be free in all settings. This recommendation will clearly have to be addressed in the light of the spending priorities of the Scottish Parliament. The second is that there should be a National Care Commission to look at the whole system in a strategic way, represent the interests of older people receiving services and produce national benchmarks. Again this will have to be considered carefully.
<P>

<a name="90301w15.htm_para18">I congratulate the Royal Commission and Sir Stewart on the production of this report. I am confident that the Scottish Executive and Parliament will give it the full consideration it deserves and requires.

To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland what assessment he has made of seal damage to salmon in the last five years.  [73908]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90301w16.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Macdonald: </B> 
 Seals are opportunistic predators which take whatever prey is locally abundant, and only by studying rivers on a site-by-site basis can the effects of seals on salmon be measured.
<P>

<a name="90301w16.htm_para0">A study based on direct observation of seals and their impact on salmon in the estuaries of the Rivers Dee and Don was conducted between 1993 and 1996. This found that common seals were the most prevalent species, that peak numbers were seen in the winter months, but that the number of individual seals was very low.
<P>

<a name="90301w16.htm_para1">A new project studying the interaction between the two species has begun on the River Conon, funded by The Scottish Office, through the Marine Laboratory, and Aberdeen University.
<P>

<a name="90301w16.htm_para2">There are no estimates of predation on salmonids in the open sea.
<P>

<a name="90301w16.htm_para3">From 1 July 1999 the protection and management of seals in Scottish waters will be a matter for the Scottish Parliament.

To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland what proposals he has to control the seal population.  [73909]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90301w16.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Macdonald: </B> 
 A delicate balance must be struck between maintaining a sustainable population of seals and protecting legitimate fishing interests. Current legislation provides local solutions to local problems.
<P>

<a name="90301w16.htm_para4">Under the Conservation of Seals Act 1970, fishermen are permitted to shoot seals during the open seasons, providing an appropriately licensed firearm is used. Limited shooting under licence is permitted during the close seasons for the prevention of damage to fisheries. 



<P>
<P><I>1 Mar 1999 : Column: 555</I><P>
Throughout the year, fishermen may shoot seals to prevent them from causing damage to a fishing net or fishing tackle, or to any fish captured by that net or tackle.
<P>

<a name="90301w16.htm_para5">In April 1998 we announced the lifting of the year round protection given to common seals in Shetland under the Conservation of Seals (Common Seals)(Shetland Islands Area) Order 1991. We have no plans at present to change the existing management regime. This matter is kept under constant review.
<P>

<a name="90301w16.htm_para6">From 1 July 1999 the protection and management of seals in Scottish waters will be a matter for the Scottish Parliament.

 Tackling domestic violence requires partnership working between agencies in the public, private and voluntary sectors. The Crime and Disorder Act 1998 has reinforced the statutory framework under which such partnership working can take place. We have always made it clear that we expect the local crime and disorder partnerships set up under the Act to identify the level of domestic violence in their area and to develop and implement strategies for reducing it.

 Representations have periodically been made since 1994 for the control under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 of gammahydroxybutyrate. In total, eight Parliamentary Questions have been answered in this House and nine letters from Members.
<P>

<a name="90301w17.htm_para4">The Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs, which is established under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 to advise the Government on drug misuse issues, has considered the misuse of gammahydroxybutyrate on three occasions--in May 1994 shortly after the drug first appeared as a drug of misuse in this country; in November 1996; and in May 1998.

having to appear capable of having harmful effects sufficient to constitute a social problem; and to give to Ministers advice on measures (whether or not involving alteration of the law) to be taken for preventing the misuse of such drugs or dealing with social problems connected with their misuse.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many applications for <i>(a)</i> residence permits and <i>(b)</i> leave to remain as the spouse of an EEA national exercising treaty rights, were refused on the basis that the marriage was one of convenience over the period 1 February 1998 to date.  [72875]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90301w17.htm_spnew6"><B> Kate Hoey: </B> 
 From 1 February to 31 August 1998, 216 applications for residence documents on the basis of marriage to an European Economic Area (EEA) national were refused. The reasons for refusal are not separately categorised. The granting of leave to remain relates to applications made under the Immigration Rules and does not apply to requests for residence documents by the spouses of EEA nationals exercising treaty rights.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what is the length in time of residence documents or endorsements given to third country national spouses of EC nationals exercising treaty rights who have been granted indefinite leave to remain.  [72855]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90301w17.htm_spnew7"><B> Kate Hoey: </B> 
 Where a European Economic Area (EEA) national has been granted indefinite leave to remain, the third country national spouse may apply either for leave to remain under the Immigration Rules on the basis of marriage to a person present or settled in the United Kingdom or for a residence document in accordance with European Community law. In the former case, the applicant, if successful, would be granted 12 months' leave to remain in the first instance; in the latter case, the third country national spouse may apply for a residence document which, if issued, would have the same validity as any extant residence permit issued to the EEA spouse. If the EEA spouse no longer holds a valid residence permit, one would be issued with five years' validity as the basis for the issue of a residence document of the same validity to the third country national.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90301w17.htm_spnew8"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The available information relates to European Union nationals who were refused leave to enter because their exclusion from the United Kingdom was deemed conducive to the public good or because they were medically undesirable. A provisional total of 46 persons in the first of those categories were removed between February and December 1998. During the same period, no European Union nationals were recorded as having been refused and removed on health grounds.

[72873]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90301w17.htm_spnew9"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 Effect is given to implementing this judgment through instructions that third country national employees of service providers established in another member state are not required to obtain work permits when they are sent to provide services in the United Kingdom.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90301w18.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 Statistics are not kept of the number of such inquiries. Normally, document abuse is identified without the need to refer to the issuing authority. In 1998, 3,478 forged European Union/European Economic Area travel documents were detected at our ports of entry.

 I regret that full information is not available in the form requested. In 1998, some 46,000 asylum applications, including those at the ports of entry but excluding dependants, were received and at the end of the year 68,400 applications were outstanding. The number of applications received from non-European Economic Area nationals for an extension of stay is not available, but 157,000 initial decisions were made in 1998 and it is estimated that around 27,000 applications were outstanding at the end of the year.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make a statement on the progress of the arrangement between Premier Prisons Services and his Department for the employment of prisoners at Her Majesty's Prison Lowdham Grange, Nottingham; and how many other such arrangements are proposed, where and with whom.  [73173]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90301w18.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 The aim is to generate work for the certified normal accommodation of 500 prisoners at Lowdham Grange prison. Approximately 150 prisoners are employed on jobs servicing the prison such as in the kitchens, cleaning and gardening. There is capacity for 350 prisoners at the industrial complex within the prison. At present, some 250 prisoners are employed at the complex on work for five different companies. The work consists of coat hanger recycling, paper hat manufacture for the catering industry, welding, painting model soldiers and folding and enveloping charity bags. Premier Prison Services Ltd. manages the prison and is actively seeking work for the remaining 100 prisoners from other companies in the locality.
<P>

<a name="90301w18.htm_para0">Premier Prison Services' policy, which is in line with that of the Prison Service, is to seek work for prisoners which is not economically viable elsewhere, cannot be done in the United Kingdom or cannot be organised by a company due to restrictions on its premises or labour force.
<P>

<a name="90301w18.htm_para1">The industrial complex at Lowdham Grange is operated on a cost recovery basis and, should any profit be generated, it would be returned to the prisoners' amenities fund.

[72867]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90301w18.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 There is no separate statutory provision which gives effect to Article 6(3) of the Agreement. Instructions to caseworkers ensure that Turkish nationals who have rights under the Agreement are granted leave to remain in the United Kingdom, as appropriate.

 The Security Service has no powers to investigate any such pressure group and therefore does not do so unless it is suspected of presenting a threat to national security or to the economic well-being of the United Kingdom; or unless the Service has been tasked by a law enforcement agency to investigate the group because it is suspected of involvement in serious crime.

 The Security Service will undertake operations involving entry onto or interference with property only in accordance with its statutory functions and under the authority of a warrant issued by the Secretary of State in accordance with section 5 of the Intelligence Services Act 1994.

<P>

<a name="90301w19.htm_para2">On Wednesday 17 February, Merseyside Police became aware of the presence of a large group of Greenpeace activists at Hapsford Service Station on the M56 in Cheshire. It was apparent to the police that the members of Greenpeace were intending to demonstrate at Liverpool Docks in order to disrupt commercial trade. After consultation with Cheshire Constabulary, Merseyside Police officers attended and, given the dangers of any potential demonstration, seized a number of dinghies under section 19(3) of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984; section 3 of the Criminal Damage Act 1971 and section 12(1) of the Aviation and Maritime Security 



<P>
<P><I>1 Mar 1999 : Column: 569</I><P>
Act 1990. I understand that the seizure was carried out with the co-operation of the demonstrators and the dinghies were placed in a safe location.
<P>

<a name="90301w19.htm_para3">The following day, Thursday 18 February, 11 Greenpeace activities were arrested for aggravated trespass under section 68 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 at the Seaforth Dock on Merseyside. Ten people were later charged and will appear at South Sefton Magistrates Court on 25 March.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what assessment was made of the security and safety arrangements covering the plutonium shipments from France to Japan in 1992 prior to deciding upon the appropriate arrangements for the forthcoming shipment of plutonium MOX fuel from Sellafield to Japan.  [72962]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90301w20.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 The transport of MOX fuel from Europe to Japan will be undertaken in full accordance with internationally agreed commitments and recommendations on physical protection, reflecting the concern of all parties to prevent the proliferation of sensitive nuclear materials. The Government are satisfied that the security measures proposed for the shipment of MOX fuel provide at least the same level of protection as the arrangements which were in place for the 1992 shipment of plutonium from France to Japan and that they are adequate and make the security risks negligible.
<P>

<a name="90301w20.htm_para2">The ships which will be used for the shipment of MOX fuel meet the highest safety rating of the International Maritime Organisation (IMO), a United Nations agency, which regularly reviews its regulations. The design and construction of the ships are approved by the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions and by Lloyds Register. The ships have a range of safety features which exceed those found on conventional cargo vessels. PNTL has been safely transporting nuclear fuel by sea for over thirty years during which time its ships have covered over 4.5 million miles without a single incident involving an escape of radioactivity.

 Last year I addressed two conferences held by the British Wind Energy Association (BWEA), many of whose members are based in the North East of England.

I have also visited several wind projects including that of Border Wind at Blyth Harbour which will be one of the first UK offshore wind installations.
<P>

<a name="90301w20.htm_para3">Through the New and Renewable Energy (NRE) programme, my Department has also held seminars aimed at encouraging engineering companies to invest in the manufacturing and supply of components for wind farm sites. One such event was held in September 1997 in Durham where firms from the region were given a detailed outline of the technology, the market and the opportunities open to engineering industry. The programme has supported 10 projects to develop wind turbine components to date. These projects are worth a total value of &#163;2.4 million. In addition, the programme has supported a number of companies visits to wind turbine manufacturers in Europe as part of this initiative.

 Within the United Kingdom it is the Post Office rather than the Government that has responsibility for postal operational matters such as the tendering for contracts to transport mail. Contracts are awarded by the Post Office, in accordance with public procurement regulations, based on the most economically advantageous tenderer against a range of criteria which may vary from one route to another including, but not limited to, the ability by an airline to serve the destination; carry the weight of traffic tendered; achieve required handover time; service quality; price; and acceptance of Post Office terms and conditions. I am advised by the Post Office that routes are normally tendered annually or bi-annually.

This application for leave to appeal was granted on 4 February. We will consider the need for guidance to Health and Local Authorities once the result of the appeal is known. In the interim, health authorities and social services departments are advised to seek their own legal advice if they have any concerns.

 We have since 1997 been providing health warnings and monitoring the effects of the ash on health in Montserrat. Preliminary studies into the toxicity of the ash and the respiratory health of children on Montserrat have recently been completed. The results have been disseminated on the island via radio and information leaflets. Ash levels continue to be monitored daily from various points on the island. We plan to support further research on ash toxicity later this year. Further clinical surveys of Montserratians living on the island will also be undertaken. We have sought proposals for this work and are improving facilities on the island so that the work can be undertaken to a satisfactory standard.

We continue to press WFP to make full use of all delivery methods in order to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of good aid delivery and targeting.

 Throughout our work, we seek to enhance respect for human rights, particularly those of the poorest. We consider civil and political rights and broader governance issues when we assess the scope for partnerships with developing countries and when we draw up country strategy papers. The position is kept continuously under review, but no country has a perfect record of respect for civil or other human rights and DFID work is concentrated in the poorest countries where it is difficult to secure all human rights for all citizens. Completed strategy papers are publicly available and provide details of progress to date and the prospects for development and partnerships. Full information of DFID's bilateral programmes in 1993-94--1997-98 was published in "Statistics on International Development" in December 1999.

 <i>[holding answer 16 February 1999]:</i> I have been asked to reply as responsibility for this subject lies with The Scottish Office.
<P>

<a name="90301w25.htm_para2">The Department has itself made no assessment of the work in question, but following the publicity which surrounded this project the Rowett Research Institute arranged last August for an audit committee, including external experts, to carry out a full analysis of all data available. The audit committee concluded that the data did not support any suggestion that the consumption by rats of transgenic potatoes expressing the lectin GNA (<i>Galanthus nivalis</i>) has an effect on growth, organ development or the immune system.

These comprise proposals for reform of the arable crops, beef, milk and wine regimes, proposals on rural development and on common measures affecting direct payments to farmers, and a proposals concerning the financing of the CAP. My objective in the negotiations was to secure ambitious and worthwhile reforms in all sectors and to ensure that, by 2006, CAP spending is stabilised in real terms at its current level.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security if he will estimate the total amount of money lost through fraud to his Department's budget for 1997-98, indicating that amount as a percentage of the budget for that year; and if he will break down these figures by individual benefits.  [73969]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90301w27.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 The Green Paper "Beating Fraud is Everyone's Business; securing the future" set out the difficulties of measuring a covert activity such as fraud. Previous work reviewing individuals' claims shows that at least &#163;2 billion per year is lost through fraud. This figure is based on a sample of cases where we have obtained firm evidence or an admission of fraud. There are strong indications that a further &#163;3 billion is lost. This figure is based on a sample of cases where there is strong suspicion, but it cannot actually be shown that the claimant was guilty of fraud.
<P>

<a name="90301w27.htm_para1">In other cases still, claim reviews have raised suspicions that there could be fraud, but the evidence is weak--for example, where people have been observed to be living above their means. Cases of this kind account for a further &#163;2 billion per year in benefit claims. In addition, customer and staff errors lead to about &#163;750 million being overpaid each year and &#163;600 million being underpaid.

<P>

<a name="90301w27.htm_para5">We indicated in the Green Paper that we intended to overhaul how fraud was calculated.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. Estimates are rounded to the nearest ten thousand. Estimates may not sum owing to rounding.<P>

2. Figures are an average of the recipients of Severe Disablement Allowance in the 1995-96 Households Below Average Income datasets based on the Family Resources Survey (FRS) and as such are subject to sampling error.<P>

3. The measure of income used is household equivalised net income before housing costs and after housing costs. Incomes are equivalised to adjust for household size and composition. No adjustment is made to household income to reflect any additional needs that recipients of severe disablement allowance might have. A household can comprise more than one benefit unit, for example a pensioner living with their grown up children.<P>

<i>Source:</i><P>

The dates are taken from the Family Resources Survey (FRS) and all estimates are subject to sampling error. The total of recipients of Severe Disablement Allowance living in private households is estimated to be 260,000 while the total 1996-97 caseload was 355,000. Part of this difference will be due to the fact that the FRS does not survey those who do not live in private households, for example those in residential homes. However, there may also be under-reporting of benefit receipt within the FRS.<P>

Member for Birkenhead (Mr. Field) of 11 February 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>376</i>, on pensions, what are the reasons for the lower cost of the state second pension compared with SERPS in 2010 and 2020.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90301w28.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 Expenditure on State Second Pension will be lower than on SERPS over the first 20 years or so because the provisions for carers and the long-term disabled take longer to build up than the previous Government's policy of extending Home Responsibilities Protection to SERPS (which is included in the SERPS baseline). The main reason for this is that few carers of pre-school age children will reach State pension age before 2020.

<a name="90301w28.htm_para4">We are currently overhauling the whole decision making and appeals system. We are firmly committed to tackling the unacceptable delays in the appeals service--currently averaging seven months, with some appellants waiting over a year for the decision on their case. Regulations will be debated shortly under affirmative procedures. Under the provisions of the Social Security Act 1998, which paves the way for modernising the delivery of Social Security, one of the major areas of change will be to reduce substantially the current waiting times for appeals. The intention of these changes is to provide a more effective and faster service and to reduce the kind of lengthy waiting period that Mrs. Adams suffered.

 There have been some tangible improvements in human rights in Yemen. There is a democratically elected parliament and universal franchise among men and women. The last elections in 1997 were judged to be largely free and fair. A broadly free press ensures that issues are properly aired. Our Embassy has provided modest financial support for human rights organisations operating in Yemen. Our priority is to help improve Yemen's judicial process. We have provided assistance in training judges and related officials on national and international human rights law and its application in the court-room.

 We are deeply concerned about reports of religious persecution in Vietnam. We have repeatedly, with our EU partners made representations to the Vietnamese government about human rights. In June last year the British Ambassador in Hanoi handed over a list of prisoners of conscience, urging their release. These included many imprisoned for exercising their religion freedoms. I raised the issue with the Vietnamese Ambassador in January. We shall continue to press the Vietnamese to improve respect for human rights.
