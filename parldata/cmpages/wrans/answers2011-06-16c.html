 Before the last election PICT was asked to select a range of printers from which Members could choose. The printers had to be capable of using the House's relatively heavy embossed paper and envelopes. The assessment included evaluation of the full-life cost of the printers. Six printers were selected, including black and white, colour and multi-function devices. Members and their staff were invited to view and test the models before a final decision was made. The printers are procured through contracts that have been subject to full EU competitive tenders, thereby ensuring their pricing is competitive. The House also uses these contracts to meet its requirements for printers for the House Service.</p>

Part of the regulatory regime establishes a licensing regime which is the most restrictive regulatory approach available other than prohibition. As part of the licensing regime licensees are required to re-view and re-assess the safety of their plants periodically and systematically. Periodic safety reviews (PSRs) which are normally carried out on a 10 yearly cycle, are normally placed in the public domain once the regulator agrees that the findings have met the safety requirements.</p>

 The outbreak has had a disruptive economic impact on growers and others within the supply chain for fruit and vegetables across the EU, including our domestic industry. Because of this, the Agriculture and Fisheries Council on 7 June discussed the need for exceptional measures to address the market situation and to provide financial support for growers affected. Proposals were discussed by Ministers at Council level and considered by officials at the EU Fruit and Vegetables Management Committee, but no package has yet been agreed for implementation.

 The Health Protection Agency (HPA) runs a small environmental radioactivity surveillance programme in the UK. The most recent published results are for 2007 and 2008 and can be found on the HPA website. The results for 2009 will be published shortly. The main objective of the HPA programme is to provide data typical of the UK against which site specific data can be compared and to provide independent evidence that can be used in support of queries about the impact of radioactivity in the environment. Some limited monitoring of plutonium levels in air is carried out but no analyses are routinely done for uranium or actinides other than plutonium. No measurement data are currently available for the period 1 January 2011 to 19 March 2011.</p>

               <a name="11061644000377"> The sites used by the HPA across the UK for its surveillance programme were used to monitor activity concentrations in air following the release of radioactivity to atmosphere from the Fukushima plant in Japan. The frequency of collection of air samples was increased and a very high volume air sampler at HPA's Chilton site in Oxfordshire was also deployed. The air samples collected were analysed for a wide range of radionuclides. All the results from the air samples taken from 20 March 2011 onwards have been published in the Fukushima updates on the HPA website. No other radionuclides have been measured using the very sensitive monitoring equipment which can pick up trace levels of radionuclides in air and other environmental materials. Some air filters were further analysed using radiochemical techniques for isotopes of plutonium and strontium-90. Only background levels of plutonium were found, which are consistent with levels routinely measured by HPA at Seascale in Cumbria; strontium-90 was not detected.</p>

               <b>Mr Bellingham:</b>
 We are very concerned at the latest reports of violence in South Kordofan, which include continued fighting in Kadugli and aerial bombardments in several locations across the state. The British embassy in Khartoum and the consulate general in Juba remain in daily contact with their UN colleagues to ensure they are kept abreast of the most up to date reports. We have seen unconfirmed reports of the Sudan People's Liberation Army moving north. These reports are very worrying, and we urge both parties to de-escalate the situation and return to the negotiating table.</p>

As a result more produce is being sent to the wholesale market, which is experiencing consequential price movements. Surplus EU produce has been directed to alternative EU markets, including our own, with similar consequences for prices, although I understand that prices for English produce are faring better than those for imported produce. But the situation continues to develop and the latest indications from our trade organisations are that the market continues to remain depressed, which is not helped by retail demand for salad crops in particular being sensitive to the weather.</p>

 Under the NHS (Pharmaceutical Services) Regulations 2005, if a pharmacy opens in a rural area, or if an area is no longer considered rural, general practitioners (GPs) are required to reduce their dispensing unless the area is designated as a “reserved location” (where both the pharmacy and the doctors can dispense). Specifically, doctors can no longer dispense to patients who live within 1.6 kilometres of the new pharmacy or who live in a non-rural area. This change can take effect immediately, but can also be phased in if the primary care trust considers that would benefit patients more (“gradualisation”).</p>

 The “NHS Outcomes Framework 2011/12” was published in December 2010 and signals the direction of travel for the national health service in focusing on outcomes. The first NHS Outcomes Framework made clear our commitment to update the NHS Outcomes Framework annually, to ensure it can accommodate new and better indicators as they become available. In order to measure progress against the outcomes the NHS will be aiming to deliver, it will be important to maintain continuity of the indicators included in the framework. For this reason, we envisage that only a small number of indicators will change or be refined in any one year. We currently have no plans to consult on the 2012-13 NHS Outcomes Framework.</p>

 The grading structure in the National Offender Management Service (NOMS) differs from the rest of the Ministry of Justice (MOJ). The definition of Grade C is different in each case. Senior Manager C in NOMS refers to a more senior responsibility level than a Band C in MOJ. The equivalent of a Senior Manager C within MOJ is Band A. It is this level for which information is supplied in the answer.</p>

               <a name="11061644000603"> The number of senior managers (Bands A and above) that left the MOJ between 1 April 2009 and 31 March 2011 was 348. The number of senior managers (Senior Manager C and above) that left NOMS during the same period was 109. Of these, 38 staff were operational grades.</p>

               <a name="11061644000604"> The MOJ and NOMS do not keep records of employment taken up by former staff after they have left. NOMS is however aware that a small number of senior managers resigned in 2010 to take up posts in the private sector, including the governors of Holloway, Whitemoor, Moorland and the Isle of Wight prisons. The former director general of NOMS also took up an appointment with G4S after he had left Crown employment in 2010. There may have been others who joined private sector providers but there is no requirement for those leaving to advise the Department or agency of their future employment plans, save for any obligations under the Business Appointment Rules.</p>

 Offenders serving a sentence of 12 months and over are released from prison, in most cases automatically at the half way point of a determinate sentence, under licensed supervision to the Probation Service. Offenders released on licence are recalled to custody if their behaviour gives cause for concern. Offenders who, at the point of recall, are believed to present a high risk of serious harm or a risk of imminent re-offending are classified as an “emergency” recall. There were 2,454 emergency recalls in 2009 and 2,458 in 2010.</p>

 Local authorities have a statutory duty to safeguard and promote the welfare of children in their area. They work in close co-operation with the police and the UK Border Agency to support and provide protection for potentially trafficked children. This will include assessing their needs and putting in place support packages, which may include the child becoming looked after in the care system. Where a child does become looked after, local authorities must allocate the child a social worker who will draw up a care plan. This sets out how the authority intends to respond to the full range of a child's needs, including the need to safeguard them from contact with traffickers.</p>

               <a name="11061644001126"> The plan will also include arrangements to be followed if the young person goes missing. The National Minimum Standards (NMS) for Children's Homes and Fostering Services require all homes and fostering services to have explicit procedures for when looked after children are missing or absent. “Statutory Guidance on Children who Run Away and Go Missing from Home and Care”, issued in July 2009, requires local authorities to collect information on missing from care incidents. Local authorities must make regular reports to council members with responsibility for “corporate parenting” on patterns of children going missing from care. However, information on whether a looked after child has been the victim of human trafficking, or has been trafficked into the country and subsequently goes missing from care, is not collected centrally.</p>

This change will allow people to retire when they choose to. The legislation will still allow employers to use compulsory retirement ages, which can be earlier than 65 years, providing they can objectively justify it.</p>

                     <i>Notes:</i>
 1. Caseloads are rounded to the nearest 10—totals may not sum due to rounding.
 2. Where more than one disability is present only the main disabling condition is recorded.
 3. Figures show the number of people in receipt of an allowance, and exclude people with entitlement where the payment has been suspended, for example if they are in hospital.
 4. ‘Physical Disorders’ encompass all categories not included in ‘Mental Health Disorders’. Namely, the main disabling conditions Arthritis, Muscle/Joint/Bone Disease, Blindness, Stroke Related, Epilepsy, Deafness, Malignant Disease, Chest Disease, Back Ailments, Heart Disease, Parkinson’s Disease, Diabetes Mellitus, Renal Disorders, AIDS, Skin Disease, Frailty, Multiple Sclerosis and a number of cases not allocated to a main disabling condition. These are codes which were introduced in October 2008 and include B21 ‘Infectious diseases (Tuberculosis)’, B31 ‘Infectious diseases (Malaria)’ and B99 ‘Infectious diseases (Other ‘Infectious Disease’)’. Unknown cases are also included in this category.
 5. ‘Mental Health Disorders’ encompass the main disabling conditions ‘Learning Difficulties’ and ‘Mental and Behavioural Disorders’ and the new code introduced in October 2008, ‘Psychiatric Disorders’.

<i>Notes:</i>
1. Case loads are rounded to the nearest 10—totals may not sum due to rounding.
2. Where more than one disability is present only the main disabling condition is recorded.
3. Figures show the number of people in receipt of an allowance, and exclude people with entitlement where the payment has been suspended, for example if they are in hospital.
4. Constituencies used are for the Westminster Parliament 2010.
5. 'Physical Disorders' encompass all categories not included in 'Mental Health Disorders’. Namely, the main disabling conditions Arthritis, Muscle/Joint/Bone Disease, Blindness, Stroke Related, Epilepsy, Deafness, Malignant Disease, Chest Disease, Back Ailments, Heart Disease, Parkinson's Disease, Diabetes Mellitus, Renal Disorders, AIDS, Skin Disease, Frailty, Multiple Sclerosis and a number of cases not allocated to a main disabling condition. These are codes which were introduced in October 2008 and include B21 'Infectious diseases (Tuberculosis)', B31 'Infectious diseases (Malaria)' and B99 'Infectious diseases (Other Infectious Disease)'. Unknown cases are also included in this category.
6. 'Mental Health Disorders' encompass the main disabling conditions 'Learning Difficulties' and 'Mental and Behavioural Disorders' and the new code introduced in October 2008 , 'Psychiatric Disorders'.

However to help identify those claimants who return quickly to benefit and who experience difficulties remaining in work, Jobcentre Plus monitors the number of times claimants have been on the same benefit over the previous two years, and the period since they last claimed the benefit. The Department also undertakes a range of evaluation activity of its programmes to assess the impact on long term employment.</p>

 We know it is essential that the assessment for personal independence payment effectively accounts for the needs of disabled people with autistic spectrum disorders. We want the assessment for personal independence payment, which we have been developing in collaboration with a group of independent specialists in health and disability, to consider the impact of disability in a more holistic way than DLA does. The activities we have chosen to assess are intended to allow us to accurately consider the impact of physical, sensory, mental, intellectual and cognitive impairments. For example, the introduction of communication is a significant departure from DLA and one which will ensure we better take into account the effect of impairments that impact on sight, hearing, speech and comprehension.</p>

We are also testing the draft assessment criteria over the summer to enable us to better understand their likely impact. As part of this we will be specifically looking at how they affect people with autistic spectrum disorders.</p>

 Consultancy (or external assistance) includes a range of activities, such as management consultancy, specialist lawyers, commercial bankers and IT expertise. Consultants help us increase our efficiency and effectiveness, but are employed only where the necessary work cannot be undertaken in house and where value for money can be clearly demonstrated. The total spend on consultants for the period 1 November 2010 to 30 March 2011 for the Ministry of Defence (MOD) was £13.085 million. This includes the MOD agencies and trading funds.</p>

The reducing demand theme outlines our approach to preventing young people taking drugs in the first place and, for those already misusing drugs, intervening early and providing support to help them stop their drugs use. By working with the Department for Education and others we are ensuring young people have access to information on drugs—and the effects and harms of drugs—via schools through the internal review of Personal, Social, Health and Economic education and review of the National Curriculum and the FRANK drugs information and support service.</p>

Approaches to identifying the needs of young people and the appropriate support are best made at the local level. For those young people who already misuse drugs we are ensuring they have rapid access to specialist support through local substance misuse and youth offending services.</p>

 The Government do not make estimates of the number of people who will attend university from different backgrounds. It is expected that the total number of places in 2011/12 will be broadly similar to 2010/11. The Government are committed to access to higher education being based on talent and potential irrespective of background, and the coalition agreement recognises the need to attract a higher proportion of students from disadvantaged backgrounds.</p>

               <i>[holding answer 15 June 2011]:</i> The UK’s research base is a vital national asset and critical to long-term economic growth. Despite enormous pressure on public spending, the funding for science and research programmes has been protected in cash terms at £4.6 billion for each year of the spending review within a ring-fence. Maintaining a substantial flow of new researchers was indentified as a priority in the allocations to the research councils, Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) and the national academies.</p>

Surplus EU produce has been directed to alternative EU markets, including our own, with similar consequences for prices, although I understand that prices for English produce are faring better than those for imported produce. But the situation continues to develop and the latest indications from our trade organisations are that the market remains depressed, which is not helped by retail demand for salad crops in particular being sensitive to the weather.</p>
