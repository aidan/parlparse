railway bridges and widening between Gypsy Corner and Western Circus to bring the road up to a consistent dual three lane standard. The work at Western Circus has been completed at Gypsy Corner is planned for later this year. Design work has started on the third stage and it is anticipated that this would start in about 2002. A decision on the start date for this project will be for Transport for London. There are no plans to reinstate the major schemes at Gypsy Corner and Western Circus which were cancelled in 1997.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00131w01.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Gill: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what nugatory costs were incurred in relation to the cancelled improvement of the A40 in London.  [106314]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00131w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 The majority of the &#163;27 million costs incurred for the cancelled schemes have been in acquiring land and properties over a long period and much of this will be recovered from its resale. Outline planning permission is being sought from the local authorities for its development following which the sale will take place. All other purchased properties which were not demolished have been or are about to be sold.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00131w01.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Gill: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if land and buildings purchased for the purpose of improving the A40 in London will be retained.  [106316]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00131w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 Nearly all the land purchased for the cancelled scheme is to be sold. Some will be retained to enable the narrow bridges to be replaced.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00131w01.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Gill: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what assessment he has made of the effect of traffic jams on the A40 in West London upon <i>(a)</i> quality of life of adjoining residents, <i>(b)</i> pollution levels, <i>(c)</i> additional fuel consumption and <i>(d)</i> the cost to businesses and individuals.  [106317]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00131w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 The three stage improvement programme announced in September 1998 addresses all these concerns. The completion of the first stage at Western Circus has already brought benefits of improved traffic flows, particularly eastbound into London. It has also provided safer and pleasant conditions for local residents with improved pedestrian facilities and by the closure of some local roads onto the A40 to prevent rat-running.
<P>
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what assessment he has made of the year on year increase in traffic holdups on the A40 in West London.  [106318]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00131w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 The Highways Agency, on behalf of the Secretary of State, monitors traffic flows on all trunk roads throughout the network, including the A40 in West London.
<P>

<a name="00131w01.html_para3">Westbound queues on the A40 in Acton have not changed significantly in the last decade, while eastbound queues have reduced significantly as a result of the improvements recently completed at Western Circus. The improvements planned at Gypsy Corner this year and the bridge replacements in 2002 will further improve traffic flow at this location.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what research his Department has <i>(a)</i> undertaken and <i>(b)</i> commissioned to determine the radioactivity levels and isotopic composition of PM10s or dust particles with a diameter of less than 10 microns.  [105582]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00131w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 20 January 2000]:</i> Radioactivity in the air is monitored for the DETR by contractors managed by the Environment Agency. As part of this programme, there is a network of high volume air samplers around the UK in which the particles in the air, including PM10s, are drawn onto the air filter papers and the long-lived radioactivity associated with those particles is measured. The Environment Agency publishes the results of this "fall-out" monitoring programme annually in "Radioactivity in the Environment".
<P>

<a name="00131w02.html_para0">It is known that the main radioactive species attached to PM10s in the air are short-lived decay products of the naturally occurring radioactive gas radon, which are addressed in the Government's radon programme.
<P>

<a name="00131w02.html_para1">Since 1987 some 400,000 measurements have been carried out in homes most likely to have elevated levels of radon and its decay products.

This issue will also be discussed at this year's meeting of the Commission on Sustainable Development.
<P>

<a name="00131w02.html_para3">In addition, the United Kingdom will continue to press within the World Trade Organisation for the launch of a comprehensive Round of trade negotiations at the earliest possible opportunity, because we believe that a comprehensive Round offers the best means of delivering trade liberalisation in a manner consistent with the pursuit of global sustainable development and, in particular, delivering benefits for developing countries.

<P>

 None. Planning Policy Guidance note 17 "Sport and Recreation" already emphasises the special significance of playing fields and that they should normally be protected. The Town and Country Planning (Playing Fields) (England) Direction 1998 requires referral to the Secretary of State of planning applications for development of local authority-owned playing fields or those currently, or in the previous five years, in educational use, where Sport England has objected but the local planning authority is minded to grant permission.

To ask the Prime Minister what steps he has taken since May 1997 to combat age discrimination; and if he will make a statement.  [107145]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00131w04.html_spmin0"><B>The Prime Minister</B> 
 <i>[holding answer 28 January 2000]:</i> The Government undertook a year long consultation on age discrimination in employment. The results were set out in the report "Action on Age" which was published in August 1998. One of the conclusions of the consultation was that a non-statutory Code of Practice could provide a useful tool for tackling age discrimination in employment.
<P>

<a name="00131w04.html_para0">A draft Code of Practice was developed with the help and advice of key partners including the CBI, TUC, Age Concern, IPD, and the Institute of Management. Consultation on the Code took place from November 1998 and the final version was launched in June 1999. The Code covers all aspects of employment, including recruitment, selection, training, development, redundancy and retirement, and provides detailed guidance and case studies to help employers to tackle age discrimination in their organisations. Over 40,000 copies have been distributed since its launch. It is being backed by a publicity campaign to promote good practice and practical help for employers wanting to adopt the principles set out in the Code. The effectiveness of the Code is being evaluated through a large scale research project which looks in detail at employer policies and practices in recruitment and employment and the impact this has on age diversity in their workforce. The results of the evaluation will be published in 2001.

<P>
<a name="00131w04.html_spnew0"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 I have had several discussions with Commissioner Nielson about the EC aid budget, but not about EU enlargement.
<P>

<a name="00131w04.html_para1">In July 1999, EU Foreign ministers agreed that the Commission should table proposals for the overall division of the EC external assistance budget, to allow Council discussion of development priorities as a whole and an opportunity to focus more EC resources on the poorest countries. I have pressed Commissioner Nielson on this and on other EC development issues and will continue to do so. The disproportionate amount of EC aid going to richer countries, and the inertia of the EC in rectifying this, are unacceptable.
<P>

<a name="00131w04.html_para2">When the EU is enlarged to include new member states during the period 2000-06, the European Parliament and the Council, acting on a proposal from the Commission, will jointly adjust the multi-year budget ceilings to take account of expenditure requirements arising from the enlargement. Such adjustments are not expected to affect the aid budget.

The Council will review the quality of management education and training, advise on action to be taken, and report annually to Government and stakeholders on progress.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00131w06.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Alan Johnson: </B> 
 Launch investment is a risk-sharing Government investment in specific civil aerospace projects in the UK, enabled by the provisions of the Civil Aviation Act 1982. It has been used to support the design and development of airframes (or parts of airframes, such as wings), helicopters and aeroengines. The investment is not a grant and is repayable to the Government at a real rate of return, usually via levies on sales of the product developed. Large aerospace projects typically have high costs, pose a high level of risk, and generate a return only in the long-term. This has created a market deficiency in the availability of development funds for such projects. Launch investment remedies this, and also recognises the international mobility of aerospace projects, and the significant financial incentives that are available in other countries.
<P>

<a name="00131w06.html_para0">Any UK aerospace company can apply for launch investment, and each application is considered on its merits against a range of established criteria and also, by the Treasury, against public expenditure constraints. An applicant must demonstrate that the project is technically and commercially viable; that Government investment is essential for the project to proceed in the UK on the scale and in the timescale specified in the application; and that Government will recoup the investment at a real rate of return. Finally, the Government must be persuaded that support for the project will lead to major strategic advantages to the UK economy.

 Electricity cables do not have a single age at which they cease to be functional; instead there is a range of ages.

The statement of my right hon.

<P>
<a name="00131w07.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Hodge </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 24 January 2000]:</i> The Disability Discrimination Act 1995 makes it unlawful for employers and providers of goods, facilities and services to discriminate against disabled people by treating them less favourably than other people, or by failing to make reasonable adjustments. For service providers, the new

Code of Practice which we published on 29 June 1999 explains the duties under Part III of the Act and gives practical guidance on how to prevent discrimination against disabled people, including examples of good practice. In October 1999, we published an information booklet called "An Introduction for Small and Medium-sized Businesses", explaining the new and existing duties on businesses and organisations under Part III of the DDA. For employers, there has been an employment Code of Practice since 1996. More recently, we have published a booklet called "Employing Disabled People: A Good Practice Guide for Managers and Employers", which contains examples of good practice and this has been promoted by the Federation of Small Businesses to its members. The examples it contains are based on 40 case studies that were published following a DfEE-funded research project, in a report called "Integrating Disabled Employees".
<P>

<a name="00131w07.html_para5">The Secretary of State launched the "See the Person" campaign, in June 1999, to publicise the DDA and the rights of disabled people. It is specifically aimed at increasing awareness among businesses and disabled people of the requirements and opportunities provided by the DDA, as well as more generally aiming to improve the public's understanding of the barriers faced by disabled people. The campaign has included TV adverts, posters, articles in various publications, radio advertisements and articles in national, regional and specialist press. It helps promote the DDA Helpline from which employers and service providers can obtain copies of the booklet and guide mentioned previously as well as further information about the Act and the Codes of Practice.

 The three national bodies cited in Circular 3/99, "The Protection of School Playing Fields", are the National Playing Fields Association, the Central Council of Physical Recreation (CCPR) and Learning through Landscapes. Since the Circular was published on 7 June 1999, Ministers have met with the CCPR and officials have held several meetings, and corresponded, with all three organisations.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00131w08.html_spnew7"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 Since the issue of Circular 3/99, the Secretary of State has approved 13 applications to sell areas of land affecting sports pitches at schools. Of these, six involved sports pitches at closed schools and a further three provided new or improved sports facilities including, in one case, a new sports hall. In the four remaining applications, the sales proceeds have all been reinvested for educational purposes.
<P>

<a name="00131w08.html_para1">The introduction in Circular 3/99 of strict criteria against which decisions are made has been a great success. Since the issue of this Circular, the Department has received an average of just five applications a month to dispose or change the use of sports pitches. Not all of these applications involve the loss of a playing field. For example, some are for transfers of ownership or involve acquiring new replacement pitches. Authorities now see how tough our criteria are and generally bring forward only those proposals which make all round sense.

<a name="00131w08.html_para2">DfEE does not itself collate information on the number of out-of-school child care clubs which have been set up, but Kids' Clubs Network estimate that there are now around 5,000 such schemes in England and Wales.

Most of the Group's recommendations, published in its report in May 1996, have been implemented. One of those recommendations was that money should be made available specifically for school security improvements. I announced last month that &#163;22 million would be made available in 2000-01 for school security, building on the &#163;66 million that has been made available over the past three years.

<a name="00131w09.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 In the last year, the Prison Service has enhanced its management of under-performing prisons. To strengthen this development, I am announcing today the establishment of a working group on Targeted Performance Improvement. Its terms of reference are to develop proposals for enhancing management arrangements to identify failing prisons; develop special measures to improve performance within such establishments, including effective partnerships with other criminal justice agencies and the private voluntary sectors; and develop a management tool to support the more rigorous line management of all establishments; including ways of recognising good performance and disseminating best practice with particular reference to the development of community partnerships in the locality of each.
<P>

<a name="00131w09.html_para0">The working group is chaired by Lord Laming and its other members are Phil Wheatley, Deputy Director General; Roger Brook, former head of the Audit Commission; Patrick Carter, non-executive Director of the Prison Service; and Una Padel, of the Centre for Crime and Justice Studies. I have asked the noble Lord, Lord Laming to report to him and the Director General by 1 May this year.

 The Government have a responsibility for public and environmental safety. Some regulatory safety evaluations require the use of protected animals where there are no viable alternatives. A number of the substances in current use pose risks either through

This includes household products for which a regulatory requirement applies.
<P>

<a name="00131w09.html_para1">The need for testing household products on animals is to be considered by the Animal Procedures Committee as part of its planned work on the cost/benefit assessment carried out under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986.

<a name="00131w09.html_para2">1,477 scientific procedures and 1,448 animals were used for this purpose in Great Britain during 1998, the last year for which figures are available. In 1997, comparable figures were 2,026 procedures and 2,004 animals. As with any other scientific procedure under the 1986 Act, animals are used to test household products only where necessary and where there are no alternatives.

 Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) schemes funded by the Home Office are governed by codes of practice and data protection legislation to ensure that the systems are operated fairly and lawfully, and with due regard to individual rights to privacy, as provided in Article 8 of the European Convention of Human Rights.
<P>

<a name="00131w09.html_para5">The Human Rights Act 1998 will give further effect in United Kingdom law to the rights and freedoms guaranteed in the Convention. A properly regulated and controlled CCTV system should fully comply with the requirements of the Act.

 It is not possible to provide a single answer to this question. Asylum seekers who claim asylum at their port of entry may be eligible for social security benefits. This will include housing benefit which will be set at broadly the average rent for the area concerned. Asylum seekers who do not make their application at their port of entry may, if they would otherwise be destitute, be supported by local authorities.

 The unit cost of accommodating a single asylum seeker in a detention centre is currently &#163;1,300 per week. It is not possible to give an average cost for accommodating an asylum seeker in the community. Currently, asylum seekers may be supported in one of two ways. Those who are port applicants are eligible for income support and housing benefit. Those who are in-country applicants may, if they would otherwise be destitute, be supported by local authorities. The Home Office will make grant available to enable local authorities to reclaim the costs of supporting asylum seekers. For this financial year reimbursement of &#163;140 per week per single adult will be available.

[107835]<P>

 The information is not available in the form requested.

<a name="00131w12.html_para1">Where asylum seekers have no identity documents they are issued with a Standard Acknowledgement Letter (SAL) which confirms that an asylum application has been made and bears the holder's photograph.

<a name="00131w12.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 In reaching my decision to admit Mr. Tyson one of the factors which weighed most heavily with me was the lack of consistency in the application of this Immigration Rule, as well as the likely effect of cancellation of the fight on those who had already purchased tickets and smaller enterprises and individuals who were probably least able to beat any losses. The situation of the latter had been drawn to my attention in the representations submitted by Mr. Frank Warren, the promoter of the event, who also referred to the investment in the promotion by television networks including "Showtime" in the United States of America and "BSkyB" in this country. Although I considered these factors I did not regard them as relevant to the decision I took.

 The recent Treasury Policy Action Team (PAT 14) report on "Access to Financial Services" found that the relationship between bank branch closures and financial exclusion is far from straightforward. The general theme of the report is that tackling financial exclusion requires the development of new products and new ways to access them. Different techniques may suit different circumstances. These may help financially excluded people across the whole community, not just in deprived neighbourhoods.

 The advice and selling of endowment policies is fully regulated by the Financial Services Authority (FSA). On 21 December, FSA announced the conclusions of recent work on endowments. FSA concluded that on average holders of mortgage endowments have enjoyed returns which mean they have fared at least as well as they would have done with a repayment mortgage, and that there were no grounds for an industry-wide review of all past business. However, targeted visits to product provider and independent financial adviser firms show current selling practices to be poor. As part of its normal regulatory activities, the FSA will make follow-up visits to check for marked improvements in sales practices by the end of 2000. The FSA will not hesitate to take disciplinary action where appropriate if standards remain poor.

 Branded medicines supplied to the National Health Service throughout the United Kingdom are covered by the Pharmaceutical Price Regulation Scheme (PPRS). The PPRS includes a 4.5 per cent. reduction in the price of branded medicines from October 1999. Thereafter, the only changes permitted until 1 January 2001 are cost-neutral modulations, with strict controls on price increases after that date. The Health Act 1999 includes reserve powers to deal with companies which elect not to be scheme members or cease to be scheme members. Regulations have just been laid to ensure that the prices of medicines supplied by companies outside the voluntary scheme may be controlled, and the price reduction implemented where appropriate. At the same time the PPRS contains incentives to companies to develop new medicines, and allowances for the cost of research and development.
<P>

<a name="00131w16.html_para4">Generic medicines are not covered by the PPRS. We have commissioned a fundamental review of arrangements for the supply of generic medicines to the NHS in England to examine whether existing arrangements best serve the health service and to identify possible alternatives. The conclusions of the programme of work are expected in the summer.

 We have carefully noted General Musharraf's promise to Pakistan's minorities that their rights would be respected and that they would be treated as equal citizens. We have urged the Pakistani authorities to respect human rights, notably when I met Sharifuddin Pirzada, a civilian member of Pakistan's National Security Council on 8 December, and when our High Commissioner in Islamabad saw General Musharraf on 15 October and 15 November 1999.

 The situation is highly volatile and there are no reliable casualty figures. The Indonesian media have reported that over 1,000 Christians and Muslims have been killed in Maluku since the new year. These tragic deaths highlight the importance of the new Indonesian Government's efforts to secure peace and reconciliation in Maluku in partnership with the United Nations Development Programme--a process we fully support.

<P>
<a name="00131w17.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Robin Cook: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister made it clear in his speech at the Mansion House on 22 November that the international community needs an agreed framework on when and how it is appropriate to intervene in the face of massive violations of human rights and international humanitarian law. The United Nations Charter declares that armed force should not be

<P>

<a name="00131w17.html_para2">We believe that the development of a set of pragmatic understandings on action in response to humanitarian crises would help the Security Council--acting on behalf of the Members of the United Nations--to reach consensus when such crises occur, thus ensuring effective and timely action by the international community. In this context, we have put to the UN Secretary-General and to key international partners a set of ideas, of which the key elements are:
<P>

<a name="00131w17.html_para3"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>first, any intervention is by definition a failure of prevention. Force should always be the last resort.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="00131w17.html_para4"><P>
<BR>

</FONT></UL>
<a name="00131w17.html_para5"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>but, third, when faced with an immediate and overwhelming humanitarian catastrophe and a government that has demonstrated itself unwilling or unable to prevent it, the international community should take action;
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="00131w17.html_para6"><P>

<a name="00131w17.html_para8">The increased focus brought to our international counter-drugs activities by this Government's 10-year drugs strategy has resulted in targeting of assistance on the countries posing the greatest drugs threat to the UK. Recent UK assistance to Iran is helping that country to make the world's biggest seizures of opiates (180 tonnes in 1998), much of which would otherwise reach the UK and the rest of Europe. The close co-ordination of our international counter-drugs work helped HMS Marlborough and HMS Northumberland to seize more than 11 tonnes of cocaine in 1999, worth well over &#163;1 billion at UK street prices.

 The subject matter of these three files is UK policy concerning Gibraltar in 1967-69.

This is because release of these documents would harm the United Kingdom's international relations. The application to close the files in our view meets the criteria for extended closure of public records set out in Chapter 9.10-14 of the White Paper on Open Government (Cm. 2290). In accordance with the requirements of the White Paper, these files will be re-reviewed for release in 10 years time.

 The reform of the child support scheme is a major programme of work involving new legislation, new computer systems and significant changes to the way the Child Support Agency operates. We have always made it clear that we would not repeat the mistakes of the previous Government by introducing the reforms too quickly or before robust and reliable computer systems were in place and staff were properly trained. We therefore propose to introduce the new child support scheme for new cases by April 2002, by which time successful introduction can be achieved without unacceptable risks.

<a name="00131w19.html_para5">An anomaly in the Jobseekers Act 1995 prevented this provision from applying to hardship payments of Jobseeker's Allowance.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security how many children living with parents with care will under the new formula in the Child Support, Pensions and Social Security Bill be entitled to reduced support; and what the average loss for each child will be.  [106571]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00131w19.html_spnew5"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 Overall, more than 1 million children will be better off as our reforms take effect. If all existing cases moved to the new scheme today, we estimate that, where the non-resident parent is in work, around 350,000 parents with care, with around 500,000 children, would have a lower assessment. The average reduction for parents with care would be around &#163;17 a week in total, which equates to around &#163;11 per child.
<P>

<a name="00131w19.html_para8">However, because of the introduction of a maintenance premium in Income Support and the 100 per cent. disregard of maintenance in Working Families Tax Credit, around 85 per cent. of children will be better off at the point they first come to the CSA than they would have been under the old arrangements. In the remaining cases, although assessments may be lower under the new scheme, we will get more of what is due actually paid--compliance is expected to increase to 80 per cent. or more, compared with 66 per cent. now--so the difference in cash terms will not be so marked. Also, changes in liability for existing cases will be phased in.

 The overall average unit cost to the Benefits Agency of making a payment to a claimant via automated credit transfer (ACT) is in the order of 1p.
<P>

<a name="00131w19.html_para10">It is not appropriate to give a full breakdown of how this figure is calculated as part of the costs are commercially confidential between the Benefits Agency and its suppliers.

<a name="00131w19.html_para13">Around one third of benefit recipients already choose to have their benefits paid by automated credit transfer, direct into their bank accounts, and the vast majority, around 85 per cent, already have access to a bank account. However, there will be some limited exceptions. We have given an assurance that those benefit recipients, whether paid by automated credit transfer or otherwise, who wish to collect their benefits in cash at post offices will continue to be able to do so.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security what steps his Department has taken to encourage local authorities to prevent fraud from entering the benefit system.  [107669]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00131w20.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 We are committed to taking tough action to combat Housing Benefit fraud. We have made an additional &#163;100 million available to enable all LAs to implement the Verification Framework by 2001. The Framework forms a platform for the secure and accurate administration by defining the evidence which should be gathered to support a claim, and for the frequency of subsequent checks. As of 28 January 2000, 226 LAs have received funding to implement the Framework.
<P>

<a name="00131w20.html_para0">We have reformed the anti-fraud financial incentive scheme for local authorities to ensure they can be rewarded for detecting and prosecuting cases of fraud. We want all LAs to implement the Verification Framework so we have built additional incentives into the scheme to encourage them to do so. Every LA that adopts the Framework can qualify for extra subsidy payments.
<P>

<a name="00131w20.html_para1">We have invited all local authorities to participate in the Royal Mail "do not redirect" initiative which prevents benefit claimants from using Royal Mail's postal redirection arrangements to make false claims to benefit from multiple addresses. Already, well over 200 local authorities are operating this scheme and many more are preparing to implement it.
<P>

<a name="00131w20.html_para2">We have made &#163;4 million available to install computer terminals in local authorities which provide access to the Department's benefit systems. We are now looking to extend this initiative to include exchanging information electronically between local authorities and the Department, providing further scope to prevent fraud and error occurring in the first place. The electronic transfer of data is being successfully piloted with 20 LAs and we plan to roll this service out nationally from February 2000.

 The UK is a party to seven international Conventions and Agreements, which have established reciprocal arrangements with a number of foreign authorities. These are designed to assist a person entitled to receive payments under a maintenance order in one country to obtain payment from a former partner residing in another. The Lord Chancellor's Department is responsible for transmitting and receiving papers between the UK courts and the overseas authorities. It would be inappropriate to comment on individual cases.

<a name="00131w21.html_spnew6"><B> Janet Anderson: </B> 
 In marked contrast to the opinions of some media commentators, polls of people visiting the Dome show that the majority of them have extremely encouraging positive reactions and views. Polls of Dome visitors by <i>The Sunday Times</i>, <i>The Mirror</i>, ITN and <i>The Independent</i> in the first week of opening all showed high approval ratings. Results ranged from 91 per cent. in the ITN poll on 7 January saying the Dome was worth the trip, to 85 per cent. in <i>The Sunday Times</i> poll of 9 January saying they enjoyed the Dome and 74 per cent. in the same poll saying they would recommend it to friends. On 13 January the London <i>Evening Standard</i> poll, conducted by ICM, reported that 8 out of 10 visitors said that they were satisfied or very satisfied with the Dome. Other findings reported were that seven out of 10 visitors would recommend their friends to come; half are keen to return for a second visit; that children are especially enthusiastic; and most said their day was better than expected.
<P>

<a name="00131w21.html_para1">Recognising the inevitable bedding-in and teething problems being experienced by this unique visitor attraction over its first few weeks of operation, these high level outcomes from polls undertaken by third parties give every indication that the Millennium Experience at the Dome will, over its 12 months of operation, be a great success. The New Millennium Experience Company itself is conducting a visitor opinion poll through MORI covering the first month of operation and will have the results by mid February.

 The Government introduced tax breaks in 1997, and a new definition of "British film" last year, which make it more financially attractive for foreign film makers to film in Britain. Government Departments are also working in close co-operation with the British Film Commission to attract foreign film makers to the UK. This has enabled us to set up the British Film Office in Los Angeles. In November I launched a DVD, produced by the Government and British film industry, which provides film makers with an introduction to the first class film making facilities in the UK. We have also set up the Film Council to deliver a coherent strategy for

 The Millennium Commission today published a report about the new year celebrations including the major events that took place in 22 cities across the United Kingdom and the Beacon Millennium project. It concludes that overall the celebrations were very well received and extremely successful. Given that many of the cities involved do not have a tradition of large scale public new year events, this is a tremendous achievement. Copies of the report have been placed in the Library of the House.

<a name="00131w22.html_para0">In addition, the Government have received very positive feedback on the major religious events that took place during the first weekend of 2000: the four Millennium Church Services in London, Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast and the Shared Act of Reflection and Commitment by the faith communities of the UK.

 The Government have no plans to amend the television licensing regulations so as to exempt students in accommodation owned by universities from the normal licensing requirements applicable to people living in accommodation in multiple occupation. To do so would discriminate against students living in other types of accommodation, while extending the concession to all students would inevitably prompt demands for similar concessions for other people living in comparable accommodation.

 Estimated figures show that total income from farming remains broadly unchanged in 1999 compared with 1998. The continued difficulties in the farming industry are as a result of lower prices for most agricultural commodities due to the oversupply of commodity markets. The strength of sterling, which affects all sections of the economy, has also been a factor. Detailed estimates of the income, output and productivity of United Kingdom Agriculture in 1999 were published this morning and have been placed in the Library of the House.

 <i>[holding answer 25 January 2000]:</i> All pesticides, including rodenticides, are subject to strict statutory control. Anyone wishing to gain an approval for a rodenticide is required to submit a substantial data package for rigorous assessment by the departments responsible for pesticides. Advice is also sought from the independent Advisory Committee on Pesticides on any application for a new use of an approved rodenticide where significant new issues arise as well as on any new rodenticide compounds. Only if, on the basis of these assessments, Ministers are content that there are no unacceptable risks to people or the environment will the rodenticide be approved. All approved rodenticides and their uses are subject to review and, if appropriate, approvals can be restricted or revoked entirely.

<P>
<a name="00131w23.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 13 January 2000]:</i> The Government act as necessary on pesticides in order to safeguard health. In the case of lindane, using a precautionary assessment, independent scientific advice is that currently approved uses (agricultural and non-agricultural) of lindane do not pose any unacceptable risk to people or the environment. In addition all UK pesticide approval holders are legally obliged to report any scientific information relating to the safety of their products and the Government's Pesticide Incident Appraisal Panel considers all investigated incidents where the use of agricultural pesticides may have affected a person's health.

<P>

<a name="00131w23.html_para4">Both the EU and UK have programmes to review pesticides and lindane is under consideration in both programmes. Last June the Advisory Committee on Pesticides, an independent body, considered evidence from both the UK and EU reviews of lindane. In the light of the Committee's recommendations the Government moved swiftly to ban those uses of lindane that gave rise to unacceptable levels of exposure with the remaining uses being allowed to continue subject to further controls to reduce exposure and, where appropriate, companies being required to submit further data including environmental data for non-agricultural uses.
<P>

<a name="00131w23.html_para5">We do not routinely monitor and investigate the decisions taken by the regulatory authorities of other countries primarily because our decisions are based on the evidence and advice presented to UK Ministers about uses in the UK. Technical specifications, product formulations and uses are liable to considerable variation across the world and particular decisions elsewhere may have no direct relevance in the UK. Consequently, in the case of lindane, we have not attempted to establish its historic use overseas or the reasons why other countries have introduced partial or complete bans. The EU has yet to reach conclusions on the future European status of lindane but we have reported the action we have taken to the Commission and encouraged them to reach a European view as soon as possible.

 <i>[holding answer 18 January 2000]:</i> The Commission's White Paper on food safety published on 12 January sets out detailed proposals aimed at restoring public confidence on food safety and includes proposals for setting up an independent European Food Authority by 2002. The Commission proposes that the role of the Authority be restricted to information gathering, risk assessment and analysis, provision of scientific advice and monitoring, but with no responsibility for proposing legislation. The Commission are inviting comments on these proposals by the end of April.
<P>

<a name="00131w24.html_para0">The Government welcome the proposal to set up a European Food Authority which they see as an opportunity to improve the EU food safety regime. The Government will give careful consideration to the proposals before submitting their formal and detailed response.

<P>
<a name="00131w24.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 Sulphuric acid has been used as a pesticide, principally as a desiccant for potato crops, for over 50 years. The current pesticide approval for sulphuric acid was issued in November 1995.
<P>

<a name="00131w24.html_para4">As part of its programme of work the Advisory Committee on Pesticides (ACP) reviewed the use of sulphuric acid as an agricultural desiccant in October 1997. The ACP recommended that approval could continue subject to further investigation into the potential risks to bystanders and the aquatic environment being produced.
<P>

<a name="00131w24.html_para5">The Health and Safety Executive is addressing the issues associated with bystander exposure and will report its findings to the ACP. A research project, managed by the Scottish Agricultural College, is presently under way to study the effects of sulphuric acid on the buffering capacity of natural waters in isolated systems. This addresses changes in acidity in water courses adjacent to crops treated with sulphuric acid. The results are expected later this year and will also be referred to the ACP.

 The &#163;1.6 billion support for Rural Development, which my right hon.

The shift of emphasis away from production subsidies and the decision to modulate CAP subsidy payments mean that the rural development measures will be of benefit to family businesses in both rural areas and national parks.
