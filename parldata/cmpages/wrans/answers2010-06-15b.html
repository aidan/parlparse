 Government Hospitality (GH) in Protocol Directorate of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office has responsibility for the management of the stock in the Government wine cellar. Apart from beverage wines that are bought on an ad hoc basis, GH usually buys new stock on two or three occasions each year, as advised by the GH Advisory Committee for the Purchase of Wine. GH buys wines young, when first available in the retail market and relatively less expensive, and stores them until they are ready to use. It purchases throughout the year according to its requirements, market rates, availability and value for money. Since 6 May 2010 Government Hospitality has spent £17,698 on new stock for the cellar.

In financial year 2009-10 GH was able to reclaim £47,000 of the total annual expenditure on the cellar of £80,662. This was itself a reduction on the 2008-09 figure of over 30%.</p>

Human rights groups continue to raise concerns about the use of the 2007 Computer Crimes Act to interfere with the internet on grounds of national security, which has been deemed to include criticism of the monarchy.

The Government are committed to increasing the number of apprenticeships, in particular advanced apprenticeships, to meet the needs of employers in an advanced modern economy. We know also that the demand from young people and adults for good quality employer-owned apprenticeships is high. The Government's decision to redeploy £150 million of Train to Gain funds for 2010-11, creating an additional 50,000 adult places, demonstrates our commitment to high-quality skills. Apprenticeships are founded on partnerships so it is important that employers, including those in manufacturing and engineering, take up these new opportunities and offer apprenticeship places to secure a new generation of highly skilled employees and we will be encouraging them to do so.</p>

 Early data suggests that the recession may have had a significant impact on those areas that were already lagging, with the regions and sub-regions with the highest initial unemployment experiencing the highest increases. For example latest data for 2008 indicates that GVA growth between 2007 and 2008 was 3.0% in the West Midlands, below the English average of 3.5% and the lowest of the English regions; and in the period from 2007 to 2009, the West Midlands saw the largest percentage point increase in the unemployment rate of all the English regions, rising by 4.6 ppts compared to the English average of 2.6 ppts.</p>

 I am aware that the previous Government consulted on this issue and announced in March this year their decision to make no change to the existing position. According to 2001 census results 21% of people in Wales said they could speak Welsh.

 It is beneficial to victims who would otherwise have to give evidence, if defendants who are guilty plead guilty at the earliest opportunity. The main means of encouraging defendants to do so is the long-standing practice of recognising timely pleas of guilty with a reduction in sentence. It is not possible to plead guilty before the first appearance in court, but it is open to suspects to co-operate when they are interviewed by the police. It is of considerable advantage to the whole Criminal Justice System, witnesses and the taxpayer if suspects co-operate in this way. There is a case for treating those who do more favourably and it is open to the Sentencing Council to consider this.</p>

 To ask the Minister for the Cabinet Office if he will make it his policy to publish the remuneration rates for all persons in receipt of Civil Service pensions who are employed on non-executive or consultancy contracts with Government departments at rates which exceed the ministerial element of the Prime Minister's salary; and if he will make a statement.

 There is no prohibition on retired civil servants returning to work. Many Government Departments have chosen to operate a policy of "partial retirement" such that older workers may apply to restructure their jobs so that they are drawing pension and a reduced salary. This enables Departments to retain skills and enables staff to extend working lives by moving gradually into retirement.</p>

This means that, where people are receiving both a civil service pension and pay in respect of a contract of service, their pension will be reduced so that the total of pension and pay does not exceed the pay they were receiving before drawing their pension.</p>
