 External policing at RAF Menwith Hill and RAF Fylingdales is primarily provided by the local constabulary, the North Yorkshire Police (NYP). At RAF Menwith Hill the Ministry of Defence Police (MDP) conduct joint patrols with the NYP. The MDP costs are met from the defence budget.

 The Food Standards Agency (FSA) carried out a comprehensive review of the health impacts of trans fats in 2007, and reported that voluntary action taken by the food industry to reduce the levels of trans fats in foods in the United Kingdom has been successful in achieving the reduction in dietary intakes to 1 per cent. of food energy. As part of this review the Government's Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (SACN) examined the evidence regarding the health effects of trans fat, including coronary heart disease (CHD). The SACN review concluded trans fat from partially hydrogenated oils has a moderate impact on increasing the risk of CHD and recommended that trans fats should contribute no more than 2 per cent. of food energy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_156"><a name="100125w0010.htm_para5"><a name="10012511001336">The FSA is aware that the World Health Organisation (WHO) published a scientific update on trans fats in 2009.

 The Physical Agents Directive has yet to be implemented. The adopted Directive has been amended to provide for a later implementation date of April 2012 so that the European Union can reassess its potential impact. The Directive itself covers both optical and electromagnetic (EMF) radiation, but is specifically aimed at workers. Both the optical and the EMF parts of the Directive explicitly exclude patients. Therefore, there should be no effect on the number of medical scans patients receive each week unless implementation limits the types and number of scans that can be done because of exposure to clinical staff attending the patient. This cannot be assessed until the Directive is finally implemented.</p>

 Level 6 of the Code for Sustainable Homes (the Code) is a zero carbon home with very high sustainability standards and is an incredibly high standard to build to. However, we now have a growing number of homes been built to this higher level of the Code.</p>

At the end of December 2009, there were a total of 2,434 homes with Code certificates spread across all Code levels at post-construction stage (i.e. completed Code homes), 10,319 at design stage and over 300,000 registered homes on over 3,000 developments. Most of these homes are built to Code level 3-which represents for energy a 25 per cent. improvement on the current building regulations and is a demanding building standard.

Volumes will increase in the coming months as more appeals are processed giving a more robust picture of appeal volumes and outcomes.

<i> [holding answer 18 January 2010]:</i> The cost to the Exchequer of making the personal allowance transferable between couples individually subject to the basic rate of income tax, will depend on whether one or both members of the couple are subject to the basic rate of income tax; and if one, whether the intended focus is for second member to be subject to a higher rate of income tax, or alternatively a zero rate of income tax.

To ensure we meet this priority, Public Sector Agreement 11 (PSA) specifically focuses on narrowing the gap between children from low income and disadvantaged backgrounds and their peers. Local authorities must set statutory attainment targets, in line with PSA 11, that amongst other things, increases the proportion of children eligible for free school meals achieving five GCSEs at grades A* to C, including English and mathematics. The performance of local authorities to date in narrowing attainment gaps is variable, depending on many circumstances including the starting point of children in that authority.

 No; there are no new burdens costs. When ISA-registration becomes mandatory in November 2010 for people starting new posts in regulated activity, payment of the Â£64 registration fee will be the responsibility of the applicant, although employers may choose to pay on their behalf. The fee, which includes the cost of a Criminal Records Bureau enhanced disclosure, is payable just once in respect of working with children or vulnerable adults or both vulnerable groups. The applicant will then be registered for life if they so wish, unless they are barred from working with the vulnerable groups. The vetting and barring scheme will monitor continuously any information from the police, employers or other sources about registered persons, and the Independent Safeguarding Authority will bar them from working with children or vulnerable adults if they do anything that harms or poses a risk of harm to the vulnerable groups.</p>

<i> [holding answer 11 January 2010]:</i> The number and proportion of recorded crimes of each type detected in which a DNA match was available in 2008-09 is shown in Table 1. The figures held do not include crimes detected as a result of one-off speculative searches of the NDNAD or from comparing DNA profiles in a forensic laboratory. One off speculative searches and DNA profile comparisons are used mainly in the investigation of serious crimes such as murder and rape. Therefore the figures provided in Table 1 will under-represent the overall contribution of DNA matches to the detection of serious crimes such as murder and rape.</p>

 Access to good quality information, advice and guidance is important in helping learners improve their skills, get a job and progress in work. The adult advancement and career service (AACS) will provide all adults in England, from August 2010, with access to impartial advice and support. Once established, it will work in partnership with a range of organisations in local networks, including colleges and universities, and with Connexions services to support smooth transitions between services for young people and adults. It will also work in partnership with Jobcentre Plus as an integrated employment and skills system. Currently, Jobcentre Plus advisers have comprehensive guidance on helping people access graduate internships, either directly through the graduate talent pool or by signposting customers to university careers services. We are developing a partnership agreement to promote good practice and active collaboration between university careers services and Jobcentre Plus. We will also be developing a graduate guarantee so that all new graduates still unemployed after six months will have access to an internship, training or help to become self-employed.</p>

There is no proposal to replace the MVBER with the general Vertical Agreements and Concerted Practices Block Exemption Regulation (No. 2790/1999), itself currently under review. The MVBER, both current and revised, are in addition to the Vertical Agreements and Concerted Practices Block Exemption Regulation.

 The timetable for the introduction of individual electoral registration remains as I set out during the parliamentary passage of the Political Parties and Elections Act 2009. During Commons Consideration of Lords Amendments on 13 July 2009, <i> Official Report</i>, column 99, I explained that:</p>
<a name="100125w0041.htm_brev0"><a name="1001268001439"><ul><p class="tabletext">"Our approach to individual registration is to move in two phases: a voluntary phase and a compulsory phase. During the voluntary phase, it will be compulsory for electoral registration officers to ask individuals to provide the relevant identifying information-national insurance number, date of birth and signature-but individuals will not be required to do that to be on the register.....The voluntary phase will not commence before July 2010-in other words, it will not become entangled with the next general election, whenever that may be-and will not finish before 2014. That period will enable us to be fully confident that the system is ready before we move to the compulsory phase, when it will be obligatory for individuals to provide identifying information to electoral registration officers to be included on the register. It will enable us to prepare the public for the change, and to take steps to bolster registration rates in the meantime. That will be fundamental to protecting the system against the risk of a drop in the numbers registered."</p>

 Succession to the Crown is governed by the common law rules of descent for hereditary titles, including legitimacy, as well as the Act of Settlement. Although the Legitimacy Act 1976 made it possible for persons born outside wedlock to be legitimised, for most purposes, by the subsequent marriage of their parents, succession to the Crown and to any peerage is specifically exempted. The Act of Settlement and the common law together form the basis on which the UK's interpretative declaration in respect of articles 9 and 10 of the European Convention on the Legal Status of Children Born out of Wedlock was made and remains valid.</p>
