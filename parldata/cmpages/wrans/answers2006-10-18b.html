 In financial year 2005-06, DFID spent nearly &#163;50 million developing alternative livelihoods in Afghanistan. This is a tenfold increase on the amount spent in 2003-04.

 The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) has long been one of world&#146;s neglected crises. In February I wrote to the Secretary General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan, in support of the UN&#146;s ambitious 2006 Humanitarian Action Plan for the DRC, which aims to address better the enormous unmet needs across the country. In this letter I called on other national governments to increase their humanitarian aid to the DRC in the same way that the UK has done.

For example, in the transport sector we have used our planned support to reach agreement among all major donors on integrating critical maintenance elements into all future roads programmes. We are also trying to find ways of rapidly expanding access to basic social services in the future. These are practical ways to show how we can scale up impact in DRC and give donor partners the confidence to increase their support. We are also working with bilateral and multilateral partners to develop more co-ordinated and coherent strategies for post elections assistance to DRC.</p>

 The Government consider that the role played by the Facility for Euro-Mediterranean Investment and Partnership (FEMIP) in promoting sustainable private sector development is an important part of supporting the middle east peace process. During the UK presidency last year, two projects were approved by FEMIP for the west bank and Gaza Strip. These were &#8364;10 million in risk capital for credit guarantees and a &#8364;45 million loan for electricity upgrading. However, as with many donor-funded projects in the west bank and Gaza this year, FEMIP has been unable to implement these projects. This is because the Hamas government has so far not met internationally agreed principles for renouncing violence, recognising Israel, and accepting previous agreements and obligations.</p>

 Africa&#146;s infrastructure deficit and poor condition of existing infrastructure significantly hampers Africa&#146;s ability to trade both regionally within Africa and beyond. Good infrastructure reduces transportation costs and delays in moving goods. Recent research shows that in one third of all African countries, transportation costs account for more than 25 per cent. of the total value of exports&#151;and in Uganda they exceed 70 per cent. A 10 per cent. reduction in transport costs can increase trade by 25 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_416"><a name="61018w0003.htm_para9"><a name="06101833000222">Trade-related infrastructure includes rural and international roads, railways, ports and airports, telecommunications, energy and water. Well managed small towns also serve as a vital link between local, national and international markets. Enormous investment is needed to extend and improve Africa&#146;s infrastructure base. The Commission for Africa Report estimates that countries need to spend around 5 per cent. of GDP on infrastructure investment and a further 4 per cent. on operation and maintenance. This means a requirement for an additional $10 billion/year by 2010&#151;a doubling of existing expenditure.</p>

The first of these principles is ownership, and the review reaffirmed the Bank&#146;s commitment not to impose policies, including privatisation and trade liberalisation, on developing countries. In July 2006, the Bank produced a report on what it had done to implement the good practice principles. The report contained some good examples of where the Bank had sought to apply the principles, but there was not enough information to reach a judgment on how consistently and effectively they had been applied. I emphasised to President Wolfowitz at the Annual Meetings of the World Bank and IMF in Singapore last month the importance I place on the Bank ensuring these principles are consistently implemented in all its programmes, and that I expected a more detailed report.

 The UK, along with other donors, has repeatedly expressed serious concern about Operation Murambatsvina, through which the government of Zimbabwe displaced some 700,000 of its own people from their homes and/or livelihoods, as reported by UN Special Envoy Anna Tibaijuka following her visit to Zimbabwe last year. The government of Zimbabwe has consistently denied the extent of the humanitarian tragedy that resulted from those actions, and has shown no interest in discussing housing issues with donors. In addition to Operation Murambatsvina the UN estimate that some 800,000 people have lost homes and/or livelihoods as a consequence as the consequence of the fast track land reform process. No substantial progress can be made on housing without the government of Zimbabwe rethinking its policies on land ownership.</p>

There is a substantial ongoing need for assistance to vulnerable and mobile populations from Operation Murambatsvina and other causes such as former farm workers from commercial farms. DFID recently committed a further &#163;5 million to the International Organisation for Migration and &#163;1.1 million to NGOs to support their work in Zimbabwe addressing the needs of mobile and vulnerable populations, including the provision of temporary shelters.</p>

 Defra has had to review the budgets for its entire family in the light of pressures arising during the course of the year. For 2006-07 Natural England has provided me with an assessment of the likely impact of the cuts. Ministers specifically asked that the impact of the cuts on the Government's Public Service Agreement targets for Sites of Special Scientific Interest, and on Biodiversity Action Plans, be minimised. I will shortly be announcing Natural England's budget for the coming year and I will again emphasise the importance of continuing to make progress on our biodiversity commitments.</p>

 The Department's policy is to control common ragwort and other injurious weeds, where there is a threat to animal welfare or agricultural activities. It is not Defra policy to eradicate ragwort entirely, as we recognise it forms an important habitat and food source for many insects. It is the responsibility of all land managers, including local authorities, to control the spread of weeds from land under their control. There is no specific financial assistance available from Defra for this task.</p>

 It is an offence without authority to disturb buried human remains, including any disturbance as a result of building works. Specific measures in relation to burial grounds in certain circumstances are contained in the Town and Country Planning (Churches, Places of Religious Worship and Burial Grounds) Regulations 1950, and in relation to disused burial grounds in the Disused Burial Grounds Acts of 1884 and 1981.

 The Data Protection Act 1998 covers all processing of personal data by automatic means, including those close circuit television (CCTV) systems in public places, or on premises where members of the public may have access, where it is possible for the operator to identify distinct individuals from the film footage. The Act does not apply to CCTV filming purely within a private house/garden, but where the camera's field of operation extends beyond the private property, individuals caught on the film&#151;where it is possible for the operator to distinctly identify them from the footage&#151;have a right of access to the film under s7 of the Act. There is no automatic right to insist on destruction of the film, but individuals have a right, under s10 of the Act, to object to any processing likely to cause damage or distress where such damage or distress is, or would be, unwarranted and this could involve destruction, in appropriate circumstances.</p>

Britain has a long tradition of apprenticeship, however from the mid 1960&#146;s numbers fell from 243,700 in 1966 almost dying out completing during the 1980&#146;s with only 53,000 participating by 1990. The current apprenticeship programme was launched in 1994 to address skill deficiencies at intermediate level, aimed both to expand and update existing apprenticeship schemes whilst promoting structured training in those occupations, industries and sectors with no tradition of offering apprenticeships. The table above gives numbers since this current format of apprenticeships (Level 2) and advanced apprenticeships (Level 3) was introduced and became fully operational.</p>

<i>  [holding answer 11 October 2006]:</i> The Department for Education and Skills plans to replace the requirement on English local authorities to hold a separate child protection register with a requirement that local authorities can record within their electronic recording systems for children&#146;s social care whether a child has a child protection plan. These systems will replicate all the information currently held on child protection registers. This arrangement is due to be implemented in April 2008 but a final date will not be set until we are confident that all local authorities have secure systems in place to hold these records. This means that this separate arrangement to record that a child has a child protection plan will coexist with and be separate from the information sharing index.</p>

Amnesty International&#146;s report of its most recent visit to Algeria in May 2005, acknowledges that there has been progress on strengthening safeguards to protect detainees in custody and a fall in the number of allegations of torture in custody.</p>

In the UAE a presidential decree was issued banning the use of boys who were under 16 years of age. The Ministry of Interior replaced the camel racing federation as the organisation responsible for regulating the sport. New measures have been introduced such as stringent immigration checks and a requirement for all children to have their own passport. Breaching these rules will result in a fine and persistent offenders may receive a jail sentence. The UAE also signed an agreement with the United Nations Children&#146;s Fund (UNICEF) whereby UNICEF will process the registration, repatriation and integration of camel jockeys in their home countries.

Turkey and the EU agreed that the shared objective of these negotiations is accession and that advancement of the negotiations will be guided by Turkey's progress in preparing for membership. Turkey will need to demonstrate progress and implement its obligations to the EU, including the Ankara Agreement Protocol.

This informs the strategy which sets outs actions addressing priority areas and targets.

 The British Crime Survey (BCS) provides information about the numbers of domestic burglaries and vehicle-related thefts in England and Wales. The BCS can provide a better reflection of the true extent of crime because it includes crimes that are not reported to or recorded by the police. The BCS count of crime includes crimes against adults (aged 16 or over) living in private households. The numbers of domestic burglaries and vehicle-thefts for the last five years, based on the BCS, are displayed in table 1.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_587"><a name="61018w0021.htm_para12"><a name="0610196000281">Based on the BCS the numbers of domestic burglaries have decreased by 24 per cent. between 2001-02 and 2005-06 BCS. According to the latest BCS (2005-06) there were 733,000 domestic burglaries in England and Wales, compared with 969,000 domestic burglaries based on the 2001-02 BCS. The numbers of vehicle thefts have also decreased. The numbers of vehicle thefts have fallen by 31 per cent. from 2,494,000 (2001-02 BCS) to 1,731,000 (2005-06 BCS).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_588"><a name="61018w0021.htm_para13"><a name="0610196000282">The BCS also provides information about the proportions of crimes that are reported to the police. Approximately half of vehicle thefts and just over six out of 10 domestic burglaries are reported to the police.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_589"><a name="61018w0021.htm_para14"><a name="0610196000283">Police recorded burglaries in dwellings have decreased from 430,347 in 2001-02 to 300,555 in 2005-06. The numbers of vehicle thefts recorded by the police have fallen from 983,276 to 721,469 over the same period. Police recorded burglaries in dwellings and vehicle-thefts are included in table 2.</p>

 The police funding formula provides an assessment of the relative need of each police force in England and Wales. This assessment is based on the social characteristics of each police authority which are considered to affect the level of demand for police services in the community. To avoid penalising police authorities which successfully reduce crime, actual crime data are not used in determining relative need.</p>

<i>  [holding answer 16 October 2006]:</i> The range of spectacles carried by an optician&#146;s practice is not within the scope of the national health service (NHS) general ophthalmic services contract. However, the system of NHS optical vouchers is designed to give patients maximum choice in deciding where to purchase spectacles and thereby promote access to a wide range of spectacles.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_653"><a name="61018w0028.htm_para3"><a name="0610196001136">The system of NHS optical vouchers provides help in buying spectacles or lenses for children, those on low incomes and individuals requiring complex lenses. The voucher scheme gives eligible patients flexibility over which spectacles or lenses to choose. Patients are able to take their voucher to the provider of their choice so are able to shop around from a wide range of providers to obtain the spectacles. The scheme also gives patients flexibility to top up the voucher value (if they wish) to obtain more expensive frames of their choice.</p>

 National health service Blood and Transplant (NHSBT), of which the National Blood Service (NBS) is an operating division, is currently developing a strategic plan to address how NHSBT must adapt to the challenges it faces in a rapidly changing health service and to continue to deliver the high quality services that patients need.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_655"><a name="61018w0029.htm_para1"><a name="0610196001411">Over the last year, NHSBT has been communicating with unions and staff about these challenges. There have been many contacts with staff representatives, including Amicus during this period. The national joint staff consultative committee has met a number of times this year and there have also been meetings at national level, involving staff representatives and senior NHSBT executives and the chairman.</p>

These draft proposals will not impact upon the service to hospitals and there are no proposals to close any blood donation sessions. The NBS will continue to provide critical services to hospitals (such as continuing to have a network of local blood banks to meet orders for blood) and is looking to broaden the choice of places where people can donate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_657"><a name="61018w0029.htm_para3"><a name="0610196001413">The NBS currently has 15 centres from where it distributes blood to hospitals, and reconfiguration of these will be considered in the strategic proposals. The NBS will continue to maintain a network of centres, hold stocks and issue blood to hospitals from near to or in most of its current locations. These proposals will be presented to the NHSBT board later this year and build on a series of communications to staff and staff representatives about the future of the NBS.</p>

 The Government agreed to implement the European Working Time Directive (WTD) as United Kingdom legislation to improve the health and safety and working lives of all employees. The vast majority of staff groups have been covered by the 48-hour week since 1998. The Government negotiated an extension to the WTD for doctors in training to enable phased implementation from August 2004.</p>
