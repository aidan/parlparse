<P>
<a name="00516w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mrs. Browning: </B> 
To ask the Prime Minister if he will make a statement on his April meeting with the management of Ford, Dagenham.  [121070]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00516w01.html_spmin0"><B>The Prime Minister</B> 
 <i>[holding answer 5 May 2000]:</i> My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry and I met with representatives of the Ford Motor Company at the end of March, and representatives of the car industry including Ford at a meeting with the motor industry in April. However, I have had no meetings with the management of Ford, Dagenham during April.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00516w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Dalyell: </B> 
To ask the Prime Minister if he will make it his policy to offer to assist the authorities in Serbia to establish a Truth and Reconciliation Commission similar to that in South Africa; and if he will make a statement.  [122336]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00516w01.html_spmin1"><B>The Prime Minister:</B> 
 There is no prospect of the present Serbian authorities establishing a credible Truth and Reconciliation Commission. However, the UK Government have always stressed the importance of bringing to justice those responsible for serious violations of international humanitarian law in former Yugoslavia. To this end, we support the work of the International Criminal Tribunal for Yugoslavia (ICTY) by providing information and resources. In 1999 our contribution to the ICTY was assessed at &#163;3.1 million.
<P>

<a name="00516w01.html_para0">In Serbia, our active support for Serbian civil society and independent media includes support for projects in this field, including one media project which aims to draw on the experiences of South Africa. The issue of "Reconciliation with the Past" will be the subject of one of the UK funded New Serbia Forum series, which brings together Serbian experts from the democratic opposition to discuss the policies necessary for the post-Milosevic era.

<a name="00516w01.html_sbhd2"><H4><center>Finance Bill</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="00516w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Rammell: </B> 
To ask the Chairman of the Information Committee on which date the amendments to the Finance Bill, due to be debated on 2 May, were posted on the parliamentary intranet; and if he will make a statement.  [122120]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00516w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Allan: </B> 
 This is a matter for the Deliverer of the Vote, but I am advised that the Notice of Amendments given up to and including Thursday 27th April 2000 for the Committee of the whole House on the Finance Bill was 



<P>
<P><I>16 May 2000 : Column: 68W</I><P>
posted on the parliamentary intranet at 8.13 am on Friday 28 April. The Amendment Paper for the business of the Committee of the whole House for Tuesday 2 May, which was substantially the same as the previous paper, was posted on the parliamentary intranet at 9.34 am on Tuesday 2 May. If the hon. Member has any further queries on this matter, I would advise him to contact the Deliverer of the Vote.


<a name="00516w01.html_dpthd2"><H3><center>HEALTH</center></H3>



<a name="00516w01.html_sbhd3"><H4><center>Death Certificates, Royal Free</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="00516w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Dismore: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health what arrangements are in place at the Royal Free Hospital to provide death certificates at weekends in respect of members of groups and communities who require them to arrange early burial or cremation because of their beliefs or culture; and if he will make a statement.  [117840]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00516w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 At the Royal Free Hospital, a doctor who knew the patient in life must sign a cause of death certificate. This is usually a junior doctor, if the death occurs out of normal hours. Once it has been completed, the body can be released to the funeral director who will obtain the death certificate from the Registrar of Births, Marriages and Deaths. The Registrar's office opens from 9am-12:20pm every Saturday and they have an on-call system for Sunday registrations.
<P>

<a name="00516w01.html_para1">In response to concerns that have been expressed by some religious groups, such as Muslims, that removal and burial can be unreasonably delayed where the death occurs at the weekend, I understand that the Home Office, which has a general responsibility for coroner arrangements, has asked coroners to ensure that they always take account of the religious feelings of the bereaved and deal with their concerns with understanding and sensitivity. Many coroners have discussed these issues with their local ethnic and religious communities.

<a name="00516w01.html_sbhd4"><H4><center>Thyroid Disease</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="00516w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Wigley: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health (1) what research his Department has sponsored as to whether the estrogenic dose from soy baby foods is in the range known to cause thyroid abnormalities; and if he will make a statement;  [118340]
<P>
<UL>(2) if he will estimate by age the number of people in the UK, and the proportion of the population which this represents of their age group, who are thought to be at risk of thyroid disease; and what correlation these figures have with the consumption levels of these age groups of soy baby food products.  [118342]
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00516w01.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Stuart: </B> 
 Thyroid dysfunction is common and it is thought that up to 5 per cent. of the population are affected by hyper- or hypo-thyroidism. There is no central statistical information to answer the question with regard to incidence or risk of thyroid disease.
<P>

<a name="00516w01.html_para2">Following the 1996 advice of the Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment (COT), a large programme of research was sponsored to specifically determine if soy infant formula carries any risk for infants. The Food Standards Agency is now responsible for this research.




<P>
<P><I>16 May 2000 : Column: 69W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="00516w01.html_para3">The COT has set up a working group to review the available scientific evidence, including data on thyroid abnormalities, to determine if there are health implications associated with soy infant formula. The group will publish a report early next year. On the basis of this report, the FSA will consider whether any action needs to be taken.

<a name="00516w01.html_sbhd5"><H4><center>Slimming Drugs</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="00516w01.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Gale: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health how many slimming clinics have closed as a result of the implementation by the Medicines Control Agency of the ban on the use of products containing amfepramone and phentermine; and how many jobs have been lost through such closures.  [121109]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00516w01.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Stuart </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 8 May 2000]:</i> We do not have evidence that slimming clinics are closing, other than the one claim brought to our attention by the right hon. Member, following the withdrawal of amfepramone and phentermine from the market.
<P>

<a name="00516w01.html_para4">The European Commission's decision to withdraw amfepramone and phentermine products became effective from 9 April 2000. Following a legal challenge, the European Court has suspended the European Commission decision to withdraw amfepramone products. As a consequence the licences for amfepramone products were reinstated on 18 April 2000 and amfepramone has again been available on the United Kingdom market since that date. The European Court has not currently made any decision to suspend the Commission's decision regarding phentermine, which remains withdrawn.

<a name="00516w01.html_sbhd6"><H4><center>Food-related Illness</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="00516w01.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Tyler: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health what assessment he has made of the impact of conventional farming methods on levels of food-related illness and the cost of treating food-related illness in the NHS.  [118572]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00516w01.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Stuart: </B> 
 There has not been any assessment carried out of the impact of conventional farming methods on the levels of food-related illness. Indeed, it is usually not possible to trace the source of sporadic cases of food poisoning (which constitute the majority of cases) to a specific food, let alone to a specific food producer.
<P>

<a name="00516w01.html_para5">Although we have a good estimate of the total number of cases of infectious intestinal disease, and their cost to the National Health Service, it is not possible to say what proportion of this is foodborne. On the basis of a large study carried out in 1994-95, the cost to the NHS in England of treating illness due to the major food poisoning bacteria, <i>Salmonella</i> and <i>Campylobacter</i>, alone was between &#163;26 million and &#163;30 million per year from 1997 to 1999.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00516w01.html_wqn7"><B> Sir Brian Mawhinney: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health when the right hon. Member for North-West Cambridgeshire will receive a substantive answer to his letter of 28 March on behalf of his constituent Mrs. Drickett.  [122332]
<P>
<P>
<P>

 My right hon. Friend replied to the right hon. Member on 15 May.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00516w01.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Robertson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health what steps he is taking to promote research into and public awareness of causes and symptoms of myalgic encephalomyelitis; and if he will make a statement.  [122395]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00516w01.html_spnew6"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 The chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis working group convened by the Chief Medical Officer to produce good practice guidance for the care and treatment of people with CFS/ME--will make recommendations about the need to identify and commission further research.
<P>

<a name="00516w01.html_para6">The CFS/ME working group is also producing briefing notes. These are being distributed widely. The aim of the briefing notes is to inform people about the working group and the condition itself.
<P>

<a name="00516w01.html_para7">Priorities for departmental research and development support for the development of policy are determined through discussions with policy colleagues, the Departmental research Committee and Ministers. In the National Health Service research and development programme, priorities take account of widespread consultation with those using, delivering and managing services, within a framework overseen by the central research and development committee for the NHS. In all cases, priorities for our budgets reflect analysis of the burden of disease, potential benefits and our priorities and take account of the responsibilities and work of other funders.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00516w02.html_wqn0"><B> Joan Ruddock: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health when, and on what terms, EU marketing consent was given for honey containing genetically modified pollen.  [121699]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00516w02.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Stuart: </B> 
 The European Commission, in response to questions from the European Parliament, has advised that honey containing trace amounts of pollen from genetically modified crops is not classified as a novel food, and may therefore be lawfully sold throughout the Community. Work carried out by the Laboratory of the Government Chemist, a report of which is available in the Library, indicates that the amount of genetically modified material in honey is likely to be extremely small, at most no more than 0.00000000003g to 0.000000005g in a 500g jar.
<P>

<a name="00516w02.html_para0">All GM crops intended for deliberate release in this country, and in the rest of the European Community, have to be thoroughly assessed for human and environmental safety before they are allowed to be planted. This assessment includes safety implications of any exposure to pollen through ingestion or inhalation from the air, or as a result of it landing on other crops.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if there will be a coroner's inquest, with a jury, into the death of Jay Abatan.  [122481]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00516w02.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 I understand that the coroner will decide shortly whether to resume the inquest into the death. A jury would not be mandatory, but the coroner could summon one if she were satisfied that there was reason to do so.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00516w02.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Peter Bottomley: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will call for a report from the Chief Constable on the circumstances of the death and investigations following the attack on Jay Abatan in Brighton in January 1999.  [122480]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00516w02.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 I have received a report from Sussex Police and will write to the hon. Member as soon as possible. A copy of this letter will be placed in the Library.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many animal trainers are licensed under the Performing Animals Regulations 1925; and if he will make a statement.  [122303]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00516w02.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The Home Office has so far this year received notification of 61 trainers and exhibitors of performing animals currently registered with local authorities under the Performing Animals (Regulation) Act 1925. Local authorities were reminded last January of their obligation under the Act to copy related certificates of registration to the Secretary of State.

<a name="00516w02.html_sbhd4"><H4><center>Sentencing</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="00516w02.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Hope: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what plans he has to introduce new sentencing arrangements.  [122565]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00516w02.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 As part of our objectives of reducing crime and dispensing justice fairly, we have already put in place a comprehensive programme of work to reduce the rate of re-offending. This includes ensuring that the Prison Service and the probation service work more effectively together; improving the enforcement of community penalties; developing programmes, in custody and in the community; which are known to reduce re-offending (based on the "what works" strategy) and building on the opportunities which new technology opens up.
<P>

<a name="00516w02.html_para1">Together these developments present an opportunity to consider possible new forms of sentences which better protect the public and reduce re-offending. In particular, they open up the possibility of a more flexible sentencing structure, in which the boundaries between custodial and community penalties are less rigid. However, the current legal framework established in the Criminal Justice Act 1991 may not be best suited to an approach of this sort. I have therefore decided to review that framework. The review will complement that of the criminal courts being conducted by Lord Justice Auld.

 Unpriced copies of contracts between the Prison Service and companies operating prisons are available in the Library and can be obtained from the Prison Service for a small fee to cover administrative and printing costs. This policy is consistent with the Cabinet Office guidance on interpreting the Code of Practice on Access to Official Information and with the requirements of the European Union Procurement Directives.

<P>
<a name="00516w03.html_wqn0"><B> Jackie Ballard: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what financial penalties have been incurred at HMP Altcourse since the prison opened; if he will list the reasons for each penalty; how many of the recommendations for improvements made by the Chief Inspector of Prisons in his report were implemented before the publication of the report; what conclusions were drawn from the recent security audit; by what date recommendations for improvement were implemented; and what penalties were incurred by Group 4 as a result of that audit.  [121468]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00516w03.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 Financial penalties totalling &#163;212,728.23 were withheld for the period 1 December 1997 to 30 August 1998 for Altcourse prison. Of these, &#163;195,000 have been calculated by converting the penalty points accrued during the period to a financial value in accordance with the performance mechanism contained in the contract. The amount also includes the sum of &#163;17,728.23 which has been deducted from the contractor for 'doubling', in excess of permitted levels. There have been no financial penalties since 1 September 1998.




<P>
<P><I>16 May 2000 : Column: 74W</I><P>

The incidents leading to the deductions are listed in the table and are failures to comply with performance standards.
<P>

<a name="00516w03.html_para0">The inspection report on Altcourse prison was published on 19 April. In accordance with the protocol for handling inspection reports, the Prison Service will produce an action plan within 30 working days of publication of the report, addressing all the recommendations made by Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons. It is not possible to say how many of the 106 recommendations were fully implemented before publication, but once the action plan has been completed and reviewed at Prison Service Headquarters, I will write to the hon. Member with a progress report on implementation.
<P>

<a name="00516w03.html_para1">The overall compliance rating of the security audit of Altcourse prison was acceptable. Of the modules audited, four were rated as good, two as acceptable and three as deficient. Only one of these was rated as a significant finding and this has been fully addressed.
<P>

<a name="00516w03.html_para2">An action plan has been produced addressing the recommendations for improvements, and some non- compliant baselines were resolved during the course of the audit. Ninety per cent. of the action plan has already been implemented with full implementation to be completed by the end of June. No financial penalties were incurred as a result of the audit.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what proposals he has received from the European Commission in respect of powers exercised by virtue of any convention or treaty article concerning the standardisation of tests for accepting asylum applications to Governments of member states.  [121631]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00516w03.html_spnew1"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 I am aware of no proposals from the European Commission concerning the standardisation of the criteria for the recognition of refugees, or for determining the member state responsible for determining an asylum claim made within the European Union. Such proposals would be consistent with the requirements of article 63 of the Amsterdam Treaty. However, the European Commission has to date produced only a discussion document on "Towards Common Standards on Asylum Procedures" and a working paper entitled "Revisiting the Dublin Convention". The latter seeks to initiate debate on the Dublin Convention as the first step towards developing Community legislation for determining which member state is responsible for considering an application for asylum submitted in one of the member states. The Government's view of this document can be found in the Home Office Explanatory Memorandum dated 10 May, deposited in the Library. The Government's view on the discussion paper "Towards common Standards on Asylum Procedures" can be found in the Home Office Explanatory Memorandum dated 26 March 2000 deposited in the Library.

<P>
<a name="00516w03.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Straw </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 12 May 2000]:</i> The Human Rights Act 1998 gives further effect in United Kingdom law to most of the rights guaranteed by the European Convention on Human Rights, which successive governments and Parliament have abided by for the last 50 years. The Court of Appeal takes a robust approach to those who waste its time and the position should be no different when the Human Rights Act comes fully into force. All judges, lay magistrates and their legal advisers are being trained to deal with Convention points effectively.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what financial and other assistance is available at the time of release for prisoners freed by the Court of Appeal on grounds of wrongful conviction; and if he will make a statement.  [121937]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00516w03.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 Most prisoners when released from prison are given a discharge grant to help them meet their immediate needs. The position of prisoners discharged from court after a sentence has been quashed or reduced on appeal is that they would normally be entitled to a grant provided they have been in custody for at least nine days of their sentence.
<P>

<a name="00516w03.html_para3">In cases of wrongful conviction where it has been decided that an individual qualifies for payment of compensation, he or she may then apply for an interim payment to help alleviate any immediate financial difficulties.
<P>

<a name="00516w03.html_para4">Funding has been made available this year to enable a voluntary body, familiar with prisoner resettlement issues, to develop, on a national basis, an advice and counselling service specifically geared to the needs of successful appellants. We hope to be entering into discussions soon with possible providers of such a service. The Probation Service may also provide assistance on a voluntary basis.

 The priority for the use of scarce frequency channels is to develop digital terrestrial television across the UK, rather than to extend analogue Channel 5 services.

<P>

<a name="00516w04.html_para1">The Welsh transmitters broadcast analogue S4C, instead of Channel 4, so only the 40 per cent. or so of Welsh viewers who can receive signals from English terrestrial transmitters can obtain terrestrial analogue Channel 4.

 These are matters for the Independent Television Commission. The Broadcasting Act 1996 empowers the Commission to vary a Channel 3 licence on a change of control if they consider it may be prejudicial to the regional character of the service. The Commission can take into account the extent to which managerial and editorial decisions are taken by persons employed in the licence area.

 I have today issued a consultation document outlining proposals for implementation of the 'downstream' aspects of the Gas Directive. This follows a parallel consultation document outlining proposals to implement those aspects of the Gas Directive which apply to upstream pipeline networks, which I issued on 30 March 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 242-43W.
<P>

<a name="00516w04.html_para3">The regime for the gas market in Great Britain, which has been fully open to competition since 1998, with regulated third party access to pipelines and requirements for non-discrimination, is generally well ahead of the requirements of the Directive. However, there are a number of areas where relatively limited technical amendments will be needed to ensure full compliance.

 <i>[holding answer 2 May 2000]:</i> National population projections are prepared by the Government Actuary's Department and published jointly with the Office for National Statistics. A description of the assumptions in the 1996-based national population projections can be found in "National Population Projections: 1996-based" (ONS series PPG2 No. 21, published by TSO). These included a long-term asylum seeker assumption of 5,000 a year to the UK, virtually all of whom were assumed to settle in England. This assumption has subsequently been revised.

<a name="00516w05.html_para0">The 1996-based national population projections were an input into the Department's household projections, the latest of which is published in "Projections of Households in England to 2021", a copy of which is in the Library.

<a name="00516w05.html_para1"><i>Letter from Peter Nutt to Mr. Tom Levitt, dated 16 May 2000:</i>
<P>

<a name="00516w05.html_para2">

<BR>
The Parliamentary Under Secretary of State, Keith Hill, has asked me to reply to your recent question requesting (a) the number of (i) fatalities and (ii) injuries recorded in road accidents and (b) the number of speeding offences detected in the 30mph zone, both over the last ten years, on the A6 Trunk Road through Dove Holes, Derbyshire. You also asked what assessment had been made of the efficacy of the recently implemented traffic calming measures there.
<BR>
Unfortunately, we do not have personal injury figures for a full ten-year period for this length of A6. The figures between April 1994 and December 1999, the latest period for which information is available, are as follows:
<BR>
Fatal - Nil;
<BR>
Serious - 7;
<BR>
Slight - 28
<BR>
As enforcement of speed limits is a matter for the police, the Highways Agency does not record the number of speeding offences on trunk roads. This information should be available from the Chief Constable of Derbyshire Constabulary.
<BR>
The "traffic calming measures" to which you refer take the form of variable speed limits (30mph in the built-up area, 40mph in the more rural area) rather than physical constraints on the speed of traffic more normally associated with traffic calming schemes. At present, it is too early to say how effective the measures at Dove Holes have been; monitoring began in April and a report will be produced later this year. I will ensure that you receive a copy.
<BR>
In the meantime, if you wish to discuss any aspect further, the Highways Agency Route Manager for this length of A6 is Steve Forgham. He can be contacted at our office at Broadway, Broad Street, Birmingham, B15 1BL, or by telephone on 0121 678 8506.

<P>
<a name="00516w05.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 DETR received in January 2000 a copy of the Communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament entitled "The creation of a single European sky"--EM No. 13735/99 COM(99) 614 final.




<P>
<P><I>16 May 2000 : Column: 84W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="00516w05.html_para3">This Communication examined in detail the European air traffic management system. It provides the Commission's views on where it believes there are shortcomings, and makes proposals for areas which need further study in order to achieve the Commission's objective of "European airspace as a seamless continuum". In general, the Commission's ideas, such as the need to separate service provision from regulation, seem compatible with UK air traffic control policy. This is also the broad consensus view of the respondents to DETR's recent consultation exercise on this Communication.
<P>

<a name="00516w05.html_para4">In June 1998, the Council mandated the Commission to develop, on behalf of the European Community and the member states, a Treaty for a new international organisation to be known as the European Aviation Safety Authority, involving both EU and non-EU member states, as well as the Community itself. The mandate required the Commission first to submit a draft outline text of the founding Treaty to a Special Committee of member states representatives. The draft Treaty agreed by the Special Committee envisages that national aviation authorities, such as the United Kingdom Civil Aviation Authority, will continue as nationally constituted.
<P>

<a name="00516w05.html_para5">The Commission has recently suggested an alternative option, based on the creation of a Community Agency. In this connection, DETR received in April 2000 a copy of the Communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament entitled, "Commission Working Document with a view to discussions within the Council on the creation of the European Aviation Safety authority in the Community framework"---COM(2000) 144 final.

 Consignors of dangerous goods may choose the mode of transport most appropriate for their needs, provided that they comply with the relevant safety requirements. As demonstrated in the 1992 Health and Safety Commission Advisory Committee on Dangerous Substances report on the major hazard aspects of the transport of dangerous substances, a copy of which is in

<P>
<P>
<a name="00516w06.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Woodward: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what estimate he has made of growth in housing in West Oxfordshire over the next 20 years.  [121816]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00516w06.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 The level of house building in Oxfordshire is set through Regional Planning Guidance for the South-East (RPG9). The next round of this guidance is currently being prepared by my Department, taking into account the first draft prepared by the local authorities in the region, and also responses made to this draft. We have now published the latest set of proposed changes and are currently inviting comments.




<P>
<P><I>16 May 2000 : Column: 88W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="00516w06.html_para5">Draft RPG9 allocates an annual average of 43,000 new dwellings per year in the South-East. Local authorities in the region have been asked to consider how this figure can best be divided between the counties, working from an illustrative distribution included with the draft. This suggests that 2,680 new dwellings could be built per year in Oxfordshire.
<P>

<a name="00516w06.html_para6">Following final publication of RPG9 later this year it will be the responsibility of Oxfordshire County Council and the district councils in the area to decide on the allocation of the Oxfordshire housing figure between the districts, including West Oxfordshire. This figure will be then adopted in the next Oxfordshire County Structure Plan.
<P>

<a name="00516w06.html_para7">Until this time the building rates set out in the current Oxfordshire Structure Plan will apply. This allocates 6,750 new dwellings to West Oxfordshire District between 1996 and 2011.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will make a statement regarding Government policy towards the ivory trade and elephant poaching, following the recent agreement of countries attending the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species meeting.  [122141]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00516w06.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 15 May 2000]:</i> The Government support the co-operative arrangements for elephant conservation between the African range states which have developed at a series of special dialogue meetings over the last five years, sponsored by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and the UN CITES Secretariat. The latest dialogue meeting took place in Nairobi immediately before the CITES Conference and was, like the previous meetings, partly funded by my Department. Senior UK officials attended the meeting. The Nairobi dialogue agreed arrangements for each African region to participate in two systems which underpin future elephant management and trade: the Monitoring of Illegal Killing of Elephants (MIKE) and the Elephant Trade Information System (ETIS). The dialogue paved the way for the compromise reached at the CITES Conference itself.
<P>

<a name="00516w06.html_para8">The main features of the compromise are that the elephant populations of Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe, estimated at a total of 192,000 animals, are now listed on Appendix II of the Convention. This means that managed trade in elephant products of these four populations is agreed to be scientifically sustainable according to the criteria laid down under CITES. However there are still concerns among a number of African states--which we share--about resuming further commercial trade in raw ivory at present, particularly as we cannot yet assess the full impact of last year's experimental ivory auctions on elephant poaching levels, both in Africa and Asia. We therefore welcome the decision reached as part of the compromise which sets zero quotas for the export of ivory from southern Africa.
<P>

<a name="00516w06.html_para9">MIKE and ETIS are expected to provide comprehensive information to enable the next CITES Conference in 2002 to decide whether controlled ivory trade can safely be resumed, and whether the conservation benefits of such trade outweigh any remaining risks. The 



<P>
<P><I>16 May 2000 : Column: 89W</I><P>
European Union, with the support of the UK, is considering a grant of 4 million Euro to MIKE. The UK has already provided &#163;60,000 towards the cost of ETIS.
<P>

<a name="00516w06.html_para10">The Government appreciate the role played by responsible non-Government organisations, particularly the World Wide Fund for Nature and Fauna and Flora International, in obtaining such a successful outcome in Nairobi.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions, pursuant to his answer of 9 May 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 360W, on Railtrack, under what statutory provisions Railtrack is required to consult before creating a safety company; with whom it will consult; and what are the terms and timetable for the consultation.

 Arrangements for consultation by Railtrack before the proposed safety company assumes any safety responsibilities and in respect of other requirements for the company's operation are expected to be specified in modifications to its Network Licence. The Rail Regulator will consult shortly on his proposals for these modifications before the nature of the obligations are finalised. These would be imposed under the Railways Act 1993.

 Last year the Environment Agency commissioned a review of human pharmaceuticals in the environment for completion by the end of May. This will report on the information available on such substances in the environment, their occurence, fate and ecological effects and will provide a basis for further work. The Department has also funded extensive monitoring for drug residues in drinking water sources since the 1970s. Although certain common drugs have been detected at very low concentrations in some drinking water sources, current drinking water treatment processes are effective in removing them.

<a name="00516w08.html_para5">The subject matter is now devolved. However, the Game Conservancy Trust and the Institute of Terrestrial Ecology carried out a study between 1992 and 1996 of grouse populations on Langholm and other moorland estates in response to concerns about the impact of birds of prey on the number of grouse available during the annual shooting season. The results, published in 1997 as "Birds of Prey and Red Grouse", cost &#163;400,000; the study

 I hope that Zambia will reach its Decision Point under the revised Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative within the next nine months.

<P>
<P><I>16 May 2000 : Column: 98W</I><P>
set up a joint committee to oversee the implementation of HIPC. In order to reach its Decision Point and begin to receive debt relief, there are also actions that Zambia has to undertake. The Government have already begun work on developing their interim poverty reduction strategy, which I welcome. They also need to agree quickly and implement a programme of economic reform with the IMF.
<P>

<a name="00516w09.html_para1">In revising the HIPC Initiative last year, it was agreed that Completion Points would be "floating", that is, the requirement would be for countries to fulfil agreed conditions, rather than reaching Completion after three years. It is too early to say, at this stage, when Zambia will reach its Completion Point. I continue to emphasise that, in our view, the main condition for a country to complete the HIPC process should be the production of a high quality poverty strategy, based on sound analysis and extensive consultation.

 <i>[holding answer 8 May 2000]:</i> My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State received a report on 13 December 1999 from the Disability Rights Task Force, 



<P>
<P><I>16 May 2000 : Column: 100W</I><P>
set up by the Government to consult and advise on how to implement comprehensive and enforceable civil rights for disabled people. In its final report, the Task Force made over 150 recommendations. On 13 December, my right hon. Friend announced that the Government would be bringing forward legislation to give effect to the education recommendations of the Task Force. On 30 March, the Government issued an interim response to the report's recommendations in the areas of local government, health and social services, housing, the environment and participation in public life.
<P>

<a name="00516w10.html_para5">Also on 30 March, I informed the House in a written reply that the Government are still considering a number of the recommendations that would require legislative changes to the DDA. One such recommendation is that the employment provisions of civil rights legislation should cover barristers. The Government's final response to the report will be made in due course.

 I represented the UK at the Employment and Social Affairs Council held in Brussels on 8 May. There were two items on the agenda: the Broad Economic Guidelines 2000 (BEGs), prepared by Economic and Finance Ministers (ECOFIN) in accordance with Article 99 of the Treaties establishing the European Community; and Article 13 (non-discrimination).
<P>

<a name="00516w10.html_para6">In the discussion on the Broad Economic Guidelines, the UK supported the emphasis on structural reform, but argued that more attention should be given to tackling social exclusion. The Presidency undertook to write to ECOFIN summarising the views of the Employment and Social Affairs Council and said that he had received an assurance that ECOFIN would not be invited to finalise its draft of the BEGs until it had received the views of the Council.
<P>

<a name="00516w10.html_para7">The Presidency reported on the negotiations on the two proposed Directives and the action programme brought forward under Article 13(non-discrimination). The Presidency noted that a number of issues remained to be resolved but hoped to register progress at the SAC on 6 June.

 The Learning Gateway provides a client-centred approach, based on one-to-one support from a Personal Adviser, for 16 and 17-year-olds who have drifted away from learning and need additional help to enter mainstream learning opportunities. The Learning Gateway was introduced in September 1999. At the end of March 2000, some 17,500 young people had joined and over 11,000 were still on it. Around 3,500 (60 per cent. of leavers) were known to have progressed to a mainstream education or training opportunity or found a job--an encouraging start for a new initiative dealing with a particularly disadvantaged client group. The Learning Gateway has a key role to play in the development of the Connexions Service--the new youth support service for 13 to 19-year-olds, which will be phased in from April 2001.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00516w11.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 As the Chancellor stated when the climate change levy was first proposed, the levy package is designed to be revenue neutral for the private sector. Moreover, the levy package is expected to be broadly neutral between services and manufacturing, in that the Government expect manufacturing and services each to pay broadly as much in the levy as they get back via the 0.3 per cent. NICs reduction and the additional support for energy efficiency measures. The Government do not intend to make the levy revenue neutral for each firm or sector, however. As Lord Marshall stated in his report "Economic Instruments and the Business Use of Energy", the design of the levy should ensure
<P>

<a name="00516w11.html_para0"><P>

<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="00516w11.html_para1">As with excise duties, the Government expect that the rates of the levy will keep pace with inflation over time. The value of the NIC reductions to business is also expected to increase over time.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00516w11.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 Emissions trading will provide a flexible way in which sectors involved in negotiated agreements as part of the climate change levy can meet their individual energy efficiency targets.
<P>

<a name="00516w11.html_para2">In addition, the Government are working closely with the business-led UK Emissions Trading Group (ETG) on the development of a wider emissions trading scheme, and have said that they see merit in the case put forward by the ETG that some form of financial incentive will be required for companies to take on binding emission targets that generate additional emission reductions. Issues being addressed include the links between the wider trading scheme and the negotiated agreements; and the form a financial incentive might take. Further announcements will depend on the progress the ETG and the Government can make in dealing with these outstanding issues.

<a name="00516w12.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Andrew Smith </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 15 May 2000]:</i> No. The Government will be spending an additional &#163;6.5 billion on pensioners over the course of this Parliament, &#163;2.5 billion more than if the basic state pension had been increased in line with earnings. We are helping all pensioners, but targeting help on those who have lost out over the last 20 years. Over half of these additional resources are going to 3 million of Britain's poorest pensioners. As a result of all our measures, including the introduction and uprating of the minimum income guarantee in line with earnings, raising the winter fuel payment to &#163;150 and the introduction of free TV licences for pensioners aged over 75, the poorest pensioners over 75 will be up to &#163;950 better off in cash terms than in 1997.
<P>

<a name="00516w12.html_para0">The Government make their spending decisions based on what is affordable within the prudent control of the public finances. In general, the Government believe that how money is raised should not determine how it is spent, and spending priorities are best determined in the round. The Chancellor's recent Budget continued to build a platform of economic stability from which to deliver high and stable levels of growth and employment, while releasing substantial new resources for its key priorities, including extra support for pensioners.

<a name="00516w12.html_para1">We expect two main issues for agreement at the Nice European Council. First, the agreement to reform of the European Union to prepare it for enlargement, on which we share with France the key objective of securing a reweighting of votes in favour of larger members. Secondly, conclusion of the arrangements for the European Security Initiative, on which France has been our partner since we launched it jointly at St. Malo. The French Presidency is also mandated to take forward the conclusions of the Lisbon European Summit, at which Britain secured Europe's commitment to our agenda of economic reform and full employment.

 UK counter-drugs activity overseas aims to reduce the availability of Class A drugs in the UK. Progress, achieved through co-ordinated inter- Departmental activity on agreed priorities, is being seen in increased seizures of heroin and cocaine en route to the UK/EU, and increased disruption of the criminal groups involved in trafficking. The UK is also active in international forums aimed at strengthening the global framework for tackling the illicit drugs trade, including in the UN and G8. In the financial year 1999-2000 my Department spent &#163;6.7 million on anti-drugs projects overseas.

We raised his case during the fourth round of the UK/China Human Rights Dialogue in Beijing in February, and I have also raised this case more recently with the Chinese Ambassador. We also pressed the Chinese authorities to facilitate the freedom of religious practice in line with the provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights which China signed in October 1998. We will continue to press our concerns with the Chinese authorities at every appropriate opportunity including future rounds of the UK and EU Human Rights Dialogues.

<P>
<P><I>16 May 2000 : Column: 116W</I><P>



<BR>
<i>Access to Census Records from 1901 and 1911</i>
<BR>
The Master of the Rolls has asked me to thank you for your letter of ****, and to reply on his behalf. He has seen and approved the contents of this letter.
<BR>
I think that your constituent has been briefed by Mr. Denis McCready, who has for some years been campaigning about access to the census records. Mr. McCready himself appealed to the Council on this issue, and the Council considered his appeal on 22 October 1998. I shall set out below the background, then explain the Council's position.
<BR>
The Public Records Act 1958, as amended by the Public Records Act 1967, specifies the normal term for the closure of public records, and the procedure for changing that period, as follows:
<BR>
Public records in the Public Record Office . . . shall not be available for public inspection until the expiration of the period of thirty years beginning with the first day of January in the year next after that in which they were created, or of such other period, either longer or shorter, as the Lord Chancellor may, with the approval, or at the request, of the Minister or other person, if any, who appears to him to be primarily concerned, for the time being prescribe as respects any particular class of public records. (c5(1))
<BR>
It is thus the responsibility of the Lord Chancellor and (in the case of the Office for National Statistics, for census records) the Economic Secretary to the Treasury to decide whether and for what period the normal thirty year term will be varied. The Lord Chancellor always seeks the advice of the Council before making such a decision. Neither the Master of the Rolls (as the Council's chairman) nor the Keeper of the Public Records has any authority in the matter, so neither has the power unilaterally to release closed records.
<BR>
In a Schedule to an Instrument signed by Lord Gardiner, the Lord Chancellor, on 20 June 1966 all decennial census returns were closed for 100 years. I enclose a copy of the Schedule. Mr. McCready has suggested that this schedule is invalid because it does not specify the "class" of records, as required by s5(1) of the Act. Mr. McCready is using the term "class" in its technical sense in the Public Record Office where it has until recently meant a particular series of records identified by letters and a number (such as AIR 21 on the same schedule). However, as you know, the interpretation of an Act of Parliament depends on definitions contained within the Act (there is none for "class" in the Public Records Act), the Interpretation Act, or normal dictionaries. The word "class" in the Act should thus be understood to have its normal meaning of a category, such as (in this instance) "Decennial Census Returns".
<BR>
Mr. McCready has also pointed out that no undertaking of closure for 100 years was given to individuals when the 1901 and 1911 censuses were taken, and suggested that this means that there could be no breach of confidence by releasing them after a shorter period. The Home Secretary on 26 October 1998 in a Written Answer to a Parliamentary Question gave the terms of the undertakings of confidentiality stated on the 1901, 1911 and later census schedules (<i>Hansard</i> cols 55-6). That on the 1901 schedule reads:
<BR>
The Return is required for carrying out the provisions of the Census Act. The contents of the Schedules will be treated as confidential; they will be published in General Abstract only, and strict care will be taken that the Returns are not used for the gratification of curiosity, or for other purposes than those of the Census.
<BR>
Those for 1911 read, on the front and on the back of the schedule:
<BR>
The contents of the Schedule will be treated as strictly confidential.
<BR>
The contents of the Schedule will be treated as confidential. Strict care will be taken that no information is disclosed with regard to individual persons. The returns are not to be used . . . for any other purpose than the preparation of Statistical Tables.




<P>
<P><I>16 May 2000 : Column: 117W</I><P>

<BR>
In 1981, the Government for the first time spelt out on the census schedules the period that it considered would need to pass before the duty of confidence owed as a result of such undertakings would be discharged:
<BR>
Your replies will be treated in strict confidence. After the census, the forms will be locked away for 100 years before they are passed to the Public Record Office.
<BR>
In answer to Parliamentary Questions the Government has reiterated that it considers that 100 years is the period which should pass before the duty of confidence is discharged. In a written answer to Lord Teviot in the House of Lords on 14 October 1997, the Lord Chancellor said that:
<BR>
the maintenance of public confidence in the census is paramount. It would be unwise to amend retrospectively the period of closure as the credibility of assurances about recent and future censuses would be affected if the Government is seen to be departing from previous assurances.




<P>
<P><I>16 May 2000 : Column: 118W</I><P>

<BR>
The present Government therefore adheres to the guidelines, set out in the previous Government's White Paper <i>Open Government</i> of 1993 (Cm 2290), for determining the extended closure of records (annex C, p 90). These specify that records of the decennial census of population are to be closed for 100 years.
<BR>
The Council concluded in October 1998 that the Government's grounds for the closure of the census records were valid, but that it might be possible to overcome the problem for future generations by giving a lesser commitment in forthcoming censuses. It therefore decided not to ask the Lord Chancellor to initiate any reconsideration of the matter, and informed Mr. McCready of its views. As you will appreciate, in the absence of any change in policy by ministers there was nothing that the Council could ask the Master of the Rolls or Keeper to do. There has been no change since 1998 that would justify asking the Council to reconsider, and so far as the 1901 census is concerned the records will become open at the beginning of 2002 in any case, in a searchable digital format that has been widely welcomed by genealogical bodies.

 The Lord Chancellor, as Head of the Judiciary, deals with allegations of judicial misconduct. There have been two occasions where retrials have been necessary because of judicial delay.

 Some 470,000 people overseas are in receipt of a UK State Retirement Pension which has been frozen.

 The Winter Fuel Payment scheme relates only to people aged 60 and over who are ordinarily resident in Great Britain. Eligible people living in Northern Ireland get similar payments through mirroring legislation.
<P>

<a name="00516w15.html_para5">If someone lives only part of the year abroad and their normal home is in Great Britain they are eligible for a payment; but someone whose normal place of residence is outside Great Britain is not eligible.
<P>

<a name="00516w15.html_para6">The payments are aimed at mitigating harmful climatological effects that are particular to the British winter. Great Britain has a variable winter climate, which means that there are short spells of very cold weather rather than long ones. Weather conditions can also change rapidly over a few days, and winter mortality rates are higher in Great Britain than in most other European countries. The payments are therefore aimed at older households in Great Britain to ensure they are able to turn up their heating when it is cold.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security how many newly-issued national insurance numbers have gone missing and how many missing national insurance numbers have been traced to <i>(a)</i> asylum seekers and <i>(b)</i> other persons subject to immigration control in each of the last three years for which figures are available; what estimate he has made of the extent to which national insurance numbers are misappropriated (i) generally, (ii) by asylum seekers and (iii) by other persons subject to immigration control; what action he is taking to investigate this; and if he will make a statement.

 There are no missing National Insurance numbers; all numbers issued are recorded on the Departmental Central Index (DCI). There are some numbers, however, that will have been created, typically when someone invents a fictitious identity. We know of 716 such cases.
<P>

<a name="00516w15.html_para7">I announced on 27 March plans to ensure that our defences against identity fraud are strengthened. We have found from a pilot in Balham, South London, that a combination of dedicated resources, better training, specialist equipment and effective liaison between Government Departments, particularly with the Immigration and Nationality Department, leads to improved performance in this area. Staff in Balham, using these techniques, have detected 225 cases where fraudulent identity documents were used, all of which resulted in an arrest.
<P>

<a name="00516w15.html_para8">While data are collected on the number of false identities detected, they are not available in the required format to supply details specific to asylum seekers and those subject to immigration control. The Home Office and my Department work closely to monitor cases involving immigration offenders, 9,256 such cases have been referred. These are checked against DCI, any found to be claiming benefit are referred for investigation by both the Benefits Agency and the Home Office. Data are not available on the outcome of those investigations.

 The Supply Operations Group Print Contract Management Team has liaised with Newcastle Disability Benefit Centre (DBC) and established their requirement. As a result, Tactica Solutions are issuing 500 copies of each claim pack to the DBC today.

<a name="00516w16.html_wqn1"><B> Dr. David Clark: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security if he will launch an inquiry into the failure of the Group 4 contractor to supply Disability Living Allowance and Attendance Allowance claim packs to disability benefits centres in the north-east of England.  [122397]

<a name="00516w16.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Bayley: </B> 
 Based on the existing annual usage information, Tactica Solutions, one of the contractors who supply print items (ie: claim packs, forms and leaflets) to the Benefits Agency, printed adequate stocks of the Disability Living Allowance and Attendance Allowance claim packs to meet demand into May 2000.
<P>

<a name="00516w16.html_para0">However, an increase in demand in March and April exhausted stock more quickly than anticipated. This was made worse by the fact that stocks were being run down in anticipation of revised versions of these claim packs becoming available. As it takes an average of six weeks to produce a claim pack, the sudden upsurge in demand created a gap in supply.
<P>

<a name="00516w16.html_para1">New usage figures have now been negotiated with the supplier to take account of the most up to date demand information. This will lead to an increase in stock held that should more accurately reflect customer requirements.
<P>

<a name="00516w16.html_para2">The current shortage has now been rectified and Tactica Solutions have the products in stock.
