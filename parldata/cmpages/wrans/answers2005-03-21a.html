 The regulatory impact assessment (RIA) methodology provides for the assessment of economic, environmental and social impacts. This includes analysing the benefits that may arise from the use of environmental technology as well as any costs to UK industry. Assessments undertaken by Departments should reflect the social, environmental and economic benefits of any relevant emerging technology.

<p><a name="st_3"><a name="50321w01.html_spnew3"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 The Commission for Africa report is a well argued case for the international community and Africa working in partnership to achieve change. One key recommendation is that aid to Africa should be doubled. DFID supports this, the UK is on track to double UK aid by 2010 from levels in 2004&#150;05. The political momentum generated by the report will encourage other countries to increase aid flows and support the International Financing Facility (IFF). DFID will work to enlist maximum international response through our presidencies of the G8 and EU during 2005.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50321w01.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_3">The Commission for Africa report presents a powerful analysis of the most effective ways to ensure that growth in the quantity of aid is matched by increased aid effectiveness. We strongly agree and will be taking further steps to improve the predictability and harmonisation of UK aid, as recommended by the report, so that it will have maximum impact. The report also recommends that aid is untied&#151;which is already the case for UK aid. More effective aid means better value for money for the UK taxpayer.

<p>
<a name="50321w01.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_4">The report is clear on the importance of donors being held to account for the effectiveness of their aid and recommends the establishment of new mechanisms for monitoring donor performance against clear, time bound and quantifiable commitments. DFID supports this.

 DFID maintains close contact with the Government of Grenada, including its new Agency for Reconstruction and Development (ARD), and with other donors. We do so both bilaterally and through a forum which is convened by the United Nations Development Programme which includes the participation of the other major donors. Through these contacts we have responded to the Government of Grenada&#039;s requests for budget support and technical assistance for the reconstruction effort and have helped to press other donors to respond in a timely manner.

The ARD was formally launched on 15 March&#151;albeit somewhat later than originally envisaged. There has been progress in school reconstruction and in the housing sector. In the education sector, funds from the US Agency for International Development, World Bank, European Commission and DFID are being used for a programme of schools&#039; rehabilitation.

<a name="stpa_7">The Government of Grenada has said that housing reconstruction and financing is a top priority and has committed to a number of initiatives for rebuilding. For priority vulnerable and needy families, as a first phase, it committed to constructing 225 low-income homes at a cost of about &#163;8,000 per home, and providing material assistance for the repair of 1,125 roofs during the same period. The Government are also offering a Soft Loan Facility which provides a maximum loan amount of approximately &#163;8,000 for 10 years with a one year grace period, at an interest rate of 3 per cent. In addition the Venezuelan Government, the US Agency for International Development, and the People&#039;s Republic of China have all committed to the construction and repair of homes in Grenada.

Since our emergency assistance in the immediate aftermath of the hurricane, when we quickly contributed relief supplies and helped with the clear-up operation, both the islands&#039; Governor and our Disaster Management Adviser have kept in close contact and provided us with reports. In addition, the Cayman Islands Government have shared with us a damage assessment by the United Nations&#039; Economic commission for the Caribbean and Latin America (ECLAC).

<a name="stpa_9">We understand that the pace of recovery, including repairs to housing and essential infrastructure, continues to be strong and that the situation is improving on a daily basis.

This covers a range of activities such as school education, harm reduction such as needle exchanges, and methadone replacement for intravenous drug users, voluntary counselling and testing, procurement and supply of sexual and reproductive health commodities and associated training and counselling.

DFID is a major donor of reproductive health commodities (including condoms), mainly through budgetary support to country strategies that include reproductive health but also via support for specific reproductive health programmes.

Generally speaking, flat rate payments redistribute subsidy from more intensive to less intensive producers and to land not formerly in receipt of subsidy. On average larger dairy farmers will receive lower payments under this system than under one based on historic receipts whereas smaller farms will on average be better off. We believe that the eight-year transition to the flat rate payment will give all farmers time to adjust.

All payments to dairy farmers in the UK, as for other recipients of the Single Payment, will be decoupled from production, and therefore are no longer linked to particular farming activity. In a decoupled subsidy environment, farmers should only produce milk if they can do so profitably.

<p>
<a name="50321w05.html_para7">

Monitoring included testing water, sediments and shellfish for zinc, toxicity testing and measuring the solubility of metallic elements in the sphalerite ore.

 The existing European Union treaties contain no provisions that relate directly to sport, but EU law has implications for the conduct of some sporting activities (for example because of the rules on competition and free movement of workers).

<p><a name="st_97"><a name="50321w12.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Stephen Twigg: </b> 
 We are committed to improving recruitment and retention of teachers. Nationally, there are around 29,000 more qualified teachers working in schools than there were in 1997. We have put in place nationally a number of incentives to attract and retain teachers, including PGCE bursaries of up to &#163;6,000 and Golden Hellos&quot; of up to &#163;4,000 in certain subjects. The Teacher Training Agency supports the cost of Recruitment Managers in local education authorities. Every outer London borough has received funding for the last four years and will continue to be supported for the next two years.

<p>
<a name="50321w12.html_para9">
<a name="stpa_92">Vacancy rates are falling faster in London than in the rest of the country but remain twice the national rate. We therefore continue to take additional steps to recruit and retain teachers in London, including outer London. As part of the London Challenge, which the Prime Minister launched in May 2003, we introduced Chartered London Teacher status. This recognises and rewards the distinctive skills and expertise demonstrated by teachers in outer and inner London and provides incentives for good teachers to stay teaching in London. We are also aware that the cost of housing is a factor in teachers&#039; decisions about where to live and work. With the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, we have introduced interest-free equity loans to help teachers in London schools buy homes. The Key Teacher Homebuy scheme, which is only available to school teachers in London, offers loans of up to &#163;100,000 for teachers willing to commit to a long-term career working in London schools.

<p>
<a name="50321w12.html_para10">
<a name="stpa_93">We have established a separate pay scale for teachers in outer London. Starting salaries for teachers in outer London will increase from &#163;20,862 in April 2004 to &#163;21,384 in April 2005 and &#163;22,002 in September 2005. Schools retain the discretion to make such payments or other financial assistance, support or benefits to a teacher as they consider necessary as an incentive for the recruitment of new teachers or the retention of existing teachers.

 The Ministry of Defence is conducting a review of the potential future status options for DARA and its Business Units. This work is being carried out without prejudice or preconception. The analysis currently being done by Morgan Stanley to test market interest does not, in any sense, imply that we see sale to the private sector as a preferred option, and any industry interest in any of DARA&#039;s business units will be judged impartially against a full range of options, including retaining DARA in-house. The criteria for any final decision will be quality of support to the front line and overall value for money. I aim to reach conclusions about the way forward for DARA, if at all possible, by the middle of 2005.

<a name="stpa_126">The results for the half-year to September 2004 show an improvement of eight percentage points on those for 2003&#150;04. This is very encouraging and continues the upward trend of recent years: in 2001&#150;02 enforcement stood at 53 per cent. rising to 64 per cent. in 2002&#150;03 and again to 77 per cent. last year. The NPS is now closer than ever to achieving its enforcement target of 90 per cent. and I am optimistic that the 85 per cent. achieved in the first six months can be increased by the end of 2004&#150;05.

The data is from 2000&#150;01, 2001&#150;02, and 2002&#150;03 where appropriate uprated to 2002&#150;03 prices. Estimates of average incomes may still be vulnerable to random fluctuations in the number of very high income pensioners in each group in the FRS sample. In particular the differences between men and women should be treated with caution.<br>

Notes:<br>

1.Income-related additions refer to the minimum income guarantee and the pension credit (payable from October 2003) and represent male and female claimants. Figures for male claimants are higher because they include a greater proportion of cases where the claim relates to a couple than the figures for female claimants. Figures for March 1998 are only available for all claimants and cannot be given in the format requested.<br>

2.Figures for basic state pension and additional state pension are taken from a 5 per cent. sample and are therefore subject to a degree of sampling variation. The average weekly rates are based on all state pension recipients in Great Britain.<br>

3.Basic state pension means the basic component of Category A or B state pension or Category C or D state pension.<br>

4.A basic state pension is paid to those who fully or partially satisfy the contribution conditions for a Category A or Category B basic state pension, either in their own right or, where applicable, on the basis of their spouse&#039;s or former spouse&#039;s National Insurance contributions and to persons aged 80 or over who satisfy the entitlement conditions for Category C or Category D Pensions.<br>

5.Average amounts of additional state pension include the additional state pension component of Category A and B state pension and the addition to long-term incapacity benefit, graduated retirement benefit and age additions paid to people aged 80 and over.<br>

As required under the legislation, a report by the Government Actuary was laid at the same time and set out the rebate rates that, under the legislation then in force, he considered to be appropriate. Before these reports were laid, a draft of the Government Actuary&#039;s report was issued for consultation. This consultation included questions on the appropriateness of the level and structure of the rebates.

2.For the years 2001&#150;02; 2002&#150;03; 2003&#150;04, the basic state pension was uprated by more than the retail prices index.<br>

3.Figures have been rounded to the nearest 5 pence at each uprating.<br>

4.The basic state pension is an individual payment and there is no such thing as a singles&quot; or couple&#039;s&quot; rate. The pensioner couple rate, commonly referred to as the couples rate&quot;, is the sum total of a basic state pension and around 60 per cent. of it. The actual amount for a couple will therefore depend on the amount of the basic state pension to which the husband is entitled.<br>

 The Department&#039;s guidance on the tracking of surgical instruments is contained in Health Service Circular (HSC) 2000/032 (Decontamination of Surgical Instruments). This asked chief executives of national health service trusts to have taken steps, by April 2002, towards having systems in

NHS trusts are not required to report to the Department which tracing system they use.

<p><a name="st_260"><a name="50321w30.html_spnew0"><b> Ms Rosie Winterton: </b> 
 A new set of arrangements have been put in place to enhance accountability to patients and the public. Patients&#039; forums have been set up to monitor local health services and to feed back the views of local people to the trusts. Patient advice and liaison services provide information, advice and support to help patients, families and their carers. Independent complaints advocacy services offer support to patients and their carers wishing to pursue a complaint about their national health service treatment or care. Health overview and scrutiny committees in local authorities are scrutinising health services and a new duty has been placed on the NHS to involve and consult in service planning and operation, and in the development of proposals for changes. The advent of NHS foundation trusts has further led to greater accountability to patients and the public by enabling far greater local ownership and involvement of patients, the public and staff.
