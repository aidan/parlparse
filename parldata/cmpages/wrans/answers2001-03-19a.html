<a name="10319w04.html_para1">Four people were taken to hospital for treatment of minor injuries. The traction current was isolated to allow passengers to begin to leave the train at 10.00am. The Health and Safety Executive's (HSE's) Railway Inspectorate (HMRI) were at the scene and have confirmed that the collision was caused by the driver of the Sevenoaks train passing a signal at danger (SPAD).

 The Government amended the powers of the Audit Commission, and of auditors appointed by it, in the Local Government Act 1999, the Health Act 1999 and the Local Government Act 2000. The Audit Commission was given a new power to inspect compliance by Best Value authorities with the requirements of Part 1 of the Local Government Act 1999; and to work jointly with the Commission for Health Improvement in the Health Act 1999. Auditors appointed by the Audit Commission have been given new a new power to audit the best value performance plans of Best Value authorities under the Local Government Act 1999. The powers of auditors to issue prohibition orders have been replaced by a power to issue advisory notices. In the Local Government Act 2000, the auditors' surcharging powers were repealed.

 The Government have indicated that a move to elected regional government in England would imply changing to a predominantly unitary system of local government.

 Last September's local government finance green paper consulted on options for making the current grant distribution system for local authorities fairer.

<P>
<a name="10319w05.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 We believe that the council tax is working well as a local tax. In our Green Paper on modernising local government finance, which we published in September 2000, we explained that the banding system makes tax bills predictable and stable. A number of respondents to the Green Paper proposed that changes should be made to the structure of the council tax bands. We are considering what they had to say in the context of preparing a White Paper on local government finance which we intend to publish later this year.

 The average band D council tax for England was &#163;688 in 1997-98 and &#163;847 in 2000-01. Council tax levels for Wales and Scotland are a matter for the National Assembly for Wales and the Scottish Executive respectively.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10319w05.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 We have powers to protect local people from excessive council tax increases. These powers are more discriminating than the previous system of crude and universal capping and enable us to look at councils' budget increases over several years. They are also more flexible: in addition to in-year capping the Secretary of State may set a national budget requirement to be used for future comparisons or he may cap the following year's budget.
<P>

<a name="10319w05.html_para0">When we have information on all local authority budgets and council taxes for 2001-02, we shall need to consider carefully whether any of them are excessive, and what action we might take as a result.

answer of 7 March 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 253W, on cycling, when the Government expect to meet their interim target under the National Cycling Strategy for doubling the number of cyclists from 1996 levels.  [154411]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10319w05.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 Progress will depend on a number of factors. However, given the greatly increased funding which the Government have made available for local transport, the encouragement to cycling which we have given in our guidance on Local Transport Plans, and the generally positive response to this guidance by local authorities, I am hopeful that cycle trips in England will double from their 1996 level by 2005 or 2006.

<P>
<a name="10319w06.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Robert Ainsworth: </B> 
 The Queen's speech on 6 December announced the Government's intention to draft a Safety Bill. We will use this opportunity to introduce a prescribed blood/alcohol limit for safety critical personnel in aviation, and to take permissive powers to allow testing for drugs.
<P>

<a name="10319w06.html_para0">We propose to set a 20 milligram per 100 millilitre blood/alcohol limit for aircraft crew, air traffic controllers and aircraft maintenance engineers, while also granting to the police the necessary powers to test suspected offenders. This limit is in line with an agreed Joint Aviation Requirement for aircrew and will apply equally to safety critical aviation personnel in the commercial and leisure sectors, and to those people flying or working with aircraft in their free time. It also reflects the positive responses to a Government consultation paper issued in July 1996, which proposed this limit.
<P>

<a name="10319w06.html_para1">It will continue to be a criminal offence to be engaged in an aviation related activity while unfit though the influence of alcohol or drugs. It is our belief that these proposals will further enhance safety in our skies.

Homeowners and disabled people will benefit from a wider choice of support to carry out essential repairs and adaptations to their homes.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Chancellor of the Exchequer has asked me to reply to your 3 Parliamentary Questions about GCat and S-CAT (Ref: 151578, 151579, 151580). The information you have requested is given below.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>You asked what assessment has been made of the compliance of GCat and S-CAT with EC tendering legislation. An assessment of compliance with the EC procurement rules was made by CCTA before the GCat and S-CAT framework contracts were awarded. Following the establishment of the Office of Government Commerce (with effect from 1 April 2000) further reviews have confirmed the view that both GCat and S-CAT are compliant with the EC rules.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>You also asked what the largest contracts are which have been placed through GCat and S-CAT respectively and if a statement can be made. It is a feature of these schemes that customer organisations contract direct with their selected prime contractors. It is not therefore appropriate for CCTA to give details regarding individual contracts to which we are not party as there may be commercial or contractual sensitivities of which we are unaware. However, in terms of contractual value, the largest individual customer orders placed so far through GCat and S-CAT are valued at &#163;2.5 million and &#163;17.8 million respectively.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Finally you asked what assessments have been made of the benefits that Government departments realise through the use of GCat and S-CAT. In general the benefits gained from these framework contracts are:</FONT></UL>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The quantification and aggregation of these benefits is not a straightforward process as different customers derive differing degrees of benefit according to their own circumstances. However CCTA have estimated that savings during the first 5 years from GCat and S-CAT are approximately &#163;30 million and &#163;3.5 million respectively.

 <i>[holding answer 16 March 2001]:</i> Applications for the Working Families and Disabled Person's Tax Credits are subject to risk assessments based on accumulated Inland Revenue and DSS experience. 



<P>
<P><I>19 Mar 2001 : Column: 33W</I><P>
Specialist staff may inquire formally into applications identified as requiring further investigation. Child care providers confirm the level of charges they have agreed with parents and provide information as part of the application that can confirm that the service they provide is eligible for support through the Child Care Tax Credit component of the Working Families and Disabled Person's Tax Credits. WFTC and DPTC awards are based on the information supplied in the application and normally continue for the full 26 weeks of the award. As with other changes in circumstances, changes in child care arrangements will not normally alter awards.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer how many claimants of family credit there were in South Shields constituency in 1997; what the average benefit for a <i>(a)</i> full-time and <i>(b)</i> part-time worker was; how many claimants of Working Families Tax Credit there are; and what the average benefit is for a (i) full-time and (ii) part-time worker.

 At May 1997 there were an estimated 1,200 families receiving Family Credit in the South Shields constituency.
<P>

<a name="10319w07.html_para13">For the other parts of his question, I refer my right hon. Friend to my answer to my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne, Central (Mr. Cousins) on 13 March 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 552W. There are too few cases in the 5 per cent. sample used for the analyses of these awards to yield reliable separate estimates of average awards for South Shields; and for the same reason care should be taken when making comparisons over time in estimates of the number of awards.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will set out with statistical information, relating as directly as possible to the constituency, the effects on Middlesbrough, South and Cleveland, East of his Department's policies and actions since 2 May 1997.  [154433]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10319w07.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Andrew Smith: </B> 
 Middlesbrough, South and Cleveland, East, along with the rest of the United Kingdom, is benefiting from the long-term action we have taken to build economic stability and secure high and stable levels of growth and employment. Since the general election, claimant unemployment in the constituency has fallen by 785, or 22 per cent., youth unemployment is down by 65 per cent., and long-term unemployment has fallen by 65 per cent.
<P>

<a name="10319w07.html_para14">Macroeconomic stability is being complemented at the microeconomic level by the Government's policies to ease the transition from welfare into work and to make work pay. To the end of December 2000, the New Deal for 18 to 24-year-olds had helped 1,589 young people in Middlesbrough, South and Cleveland, East constituency gain valuable skills and experience--791 (50 per cent.) of whom had moved into employment. The Working Families Tax Credit (WFTC), introduced in October 1999, is helping to make work pay for low and middle income families. In August 2000, 2,300 families in Middlesbrough, South and Cleveland, East constituency were benefiting from WFTC.

<a name="10319w07.html_para15">The Government are also committed to policies which enable pensioners to share in the country's rising prosperity. All pensioners, including 16,900 in Middlesbrough, South and Cleveland, East will receive an above-inflation increase in the basic state pension from April 2001. Single pensioners will receive an extra &#163;5 a week and couples will receive an extra &#163;8 a week. All pensioners aged 75 or over have also been entitled to a free TV licence since November 2000--including around 10,100 in Middlesbrough, South and Cleveland, East.

<P>

<a name="10319w08.html_para4">Under the new provisions, couples without dependent children wishing to claim Jobseeker's Allowance will have to make a joint claim from 19 March 2001. This will apply where one member or both members of the couple were born after 19 March 1976, covering couples where at least one member is aged 18 to 24 years when the requirement is introduced. Each member of the couple will be required to meet Jobseeker's Allowance conditions and will be required to be available for and actively seek work. They will both receive help to obtain work and will be directed to training programmes or New Deal assistance as appropriate.

Joint claims will ensure that both members of unemployed couples without dependants are directly involved in the labour market and do not become dependent on benefits from an early age when they are in a position to find and take work.

 <i>[holding answer 12 March 2001]:</i> The available information for 1997, 1999 and 2000 for England is shown in the table. Due to problems with National Data Collection in 1998, we are unable to provide statistics on the number of extension paper results for that year.

<a name="10319w09.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Brady: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what assumption he made in setting the education standard spending assessment for each local education authority about the cost of the servicing and provision of school organisation committees in <i>(a)</i> 2000-01 and <i>(b)</i> 2001-02.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10319w09.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Estelle Morris </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 16 March 2001]:</i> The increases in Education Standard Spending for 2000-01 and 2001-02 were 5.4 per cent. and 4.8 per cent. respectively: these increases took account of the range of pressures that local education authorities and schools face, including the introduction of school organisation committees. The distribution of these increases among LEAs depends on the factors in the Standard Spending Assessment formula, such as pupil numbers, additional educational needs, and area costs. It is for each local education authority to decide how much of its increase it spends on school organisation committees, taking account of local needs and circumstances.




<P>
<P><I>19 Mar 2001 : Column: 44W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="10319w09.html_para1">The increases in Education Standard Spending are part of the substantial extra resources that the Government have been able to direct to local authorities. In the three years from 1997, funding per pupil has already increased by over &#163;300 per pupil in real terms. Under the last Government, funding per pupil fell by &#163;60 in real terms between 1994-95 and 1997-98. There will be further increases in funding following the Year 2000 Spending Review and recent budget announcement: a further &#163;420 per pupil over the three year period, taking the total increase to nearly &#163;750 between 1997-98 and 2003-04.

 <i>[holding answer 16 March 2001]:</i> Local Public Service Agreements have now been concluded with 14 authorities and copies will be placed in the Library of the House as soon as possible. The agreements set out the additional flexibilities we have agreed with the authorities to help them achieve their enhanced education targets. Negotiations are continuing with the six remaining authorities taking part in the pilot scheme of local Public Service Agreements. We expect to conclude agreements with these authorities soon.

 <i>[holding answer 16 March 2001]:</i> The total amount spent so far on the 73 large zones since the first Education Action Zones began operation in September 1998 is &#163;89.7 million. This works out to approximately &#163;100 per pupil per year for every full year a zone has been in operation.
<P>

<a name="10319w10.html_para5">This funding has led to improvements in the standards of education. In the 25 first round zones which have been running the longest, the proportion of 7-year-olds reaching level 2 in reading, writing and maths has increased by 7, 6 and 8 percentage points respectively since 1998, compared with national increases of 4, 4 and 6 percentage points over the same period.

The high level of retirements in 1996-97 and 1997-98 were due to teachers anticipating changes that were made to the Teachers Pension Scheme in 1997, which resulted in the decline from 1998-99 onwards.

<P>

<a name="10319w10.html_para7">Of those who have left the New Deal having taken part in an option (including leavers from the follow through stage of the programme), 31 per cent. are recorded as having found work. We know that many others will have left the programme for employment without telling the Employment Service--these people are not included in this figure. The most recent Government survey into unknown destinations, published in January 2001, concluded that the known destinations were representative of unknown destinations. Using this evidence we calculate that 46 per cent. of option participants entered work on leaving New Deal. Work is ongoing to improve the recording of option outcomes so that the raw data better reflect true performance. The cumulative figures mask the fact that all Option performance has steadily improved over the last year.

 Local education authorities and schools should normally employ teachers who hold Qualified Teacher Status (QTS).

Teachers from other EEA countries can apply for QTS under EC mutual recognition arrangements, while teachers from non-EEA countries are only able to gain QTS though the employment based Graduate Teacher Programme. My Department is consulting on proposals to allow overseas trained teachers to teach in one school for up to four years without gaining QTS, and to create a tailored Graduate Teacher Programme which meets their needs.

 <i>[holding answer 16 March 2001]:</i> The climate change levy is broadly revenue neutral.

I would expect that as large employers the majority of local authorities will be net gainers from the levy.

 The Department fully recognises the importance of this country's ecclesiastical heritage, and contributes to its preservation in England through grant in aid to English Heritage, which funds conservation work for places of worship listed Grade I and II. The Heritage lottery fund, too, has contributed substantial sums from the national lottery to repairs and new facilities for historic churches throughout the country. The Department further supports the Churches Conservation Trust's work in caring for historic churches no longer in use for regular worship. We will shortly be introducing a new UK-wide grant scheme for listed places of worship which will substantially increase the amount of public support for repairs to our heritage of fine ecclesiastical buildings.

It was explained that the asylum process project/vantagepoint report was part of the overhaul, but it was never intended that it be viewed in isolation. Indeed, many changes had already been introduced before the report was completed, as part of our strategy to streamline asylum processing as a whole. Thus many improvements had already been made.

 I am today publishing a consultation document which sets out proposals for an order under the Deregulation and Contracting Out Act 1994--or, if it is enacted, the Government's Regulatory Reform Bill--to change certain aspects of the gaming machine industry. Our consultation document makes three specific proposals that would alter the law contained in the Gaming Act 1968 Act on jackpot and higher-value amusement with prizes machines.
<P>

<a name="10319w17.html_para0">First, we propose to allow players to use bank notes and electronic smart cards in these machines. Secondly, we propose to allow winnings to be stored in these machines to be used for further plays without the player having to reinsert money into the machine. Finally, we propose to allow these machines to be set so as to pay out winnings in cash (notes or coins), by printing a cheque, by adding credit to the player's smart card, or by means of a credit note or token redeemable by the operator.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="10319w17.html_spnew5"><B> Jane Kennedy: </B> 
 All advisory committees in England and Wales operate the criteria set out in my noble and learned Friend the Lord Chancellor's directions for advisory committees on justices of the peace, copies of which are available in the Libraries. The pre-eminent requirement is that a candidate must be personally suitable for appointment, possessing the six key qualities required in a magistrate (good character; understanding and communication; social awareness; maturity and sound temperament; sound judgment; commitment and reliability). As a secondary consideration, in common with his predecessors, the Lord Chancellor requires that each magistrates bench should broadly reflect the community it serves in terms of gender, ethnic origin, geographical spread, occupation and political affiliation.
<P>

<a name="10319w17.html_para3">Political affiliation has been used by successive Lord Chancellors as a proxy for social balance in the lay magistracy and has been endorsed by two Royal Commissions. The Department, by letters dated 7 August 1995 and 17 July 1996, copies of which have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses, referred to the concern of the then Lord Chancellor, Lord Mackay of Clashfern, that the political balance in Stoke-on-Trent was not good, with the Labour vote under reflected, and encouraged measures to seek our more Labour voters to become magistrates.
<P>

<a name="10319w17.html_para4">My noble and learned Friend the Lord Chancellor personally favours the abandonment of using political balance as a proxy for achieving social balance. With this in mind he issued a consultation paper in 1998 "Political Balance in the Lay Magistracy" seeking views. While most respondents favoured removing political affiliation as a balancing factor, no viable alternative was suggested. The Lord Chancellor therefore reluctantly decided in 1999 that political balance would have to remain for the time being, but instructed officials to continue to work on an alternative.
<P>

<a name="10319w17.html_para5">Later this year pilots will be conducted to ascertain whether or not a combination of social and occupational groupings would be a practical alternative to political balance.

<P>
<a name="10319w18.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 Yes, Guaranteed Minimum Pensions (GMPs) are payable to women, in their own right, at age 60, but they may be payable earlier to a widow who qualifies for half of her late husband's GMP. In some cases GMPs may be paid later because occupational pension schemes can have a rule which enables payment of the GMP to be postponed, beyond age 60, while an individual remains in employment.

 British troops are in Sierra Leone to assist the democratically elected Government to establish effective and accountable armed forces. We have between 550 and 600 troops on the ground in Sierra Leone at any time. These are divided into the UK contribution to the international military advisory and training team, soldiers providing the short-term training teams, and a brigade headquarters. In January we deployed a field surgical team to cover the gap in medical cover due to the roulement of UN medical facilities.

 Current plans, as a consequence of the public-private partnership initiative, are that operations at the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency (DERA) range, Shoeburyness, known also as New Ranges, will be carried out by NewDERA under an arrangement which is currently being negotiated. The intention is that NewDERA will have the flexibility to conduct operations on ranges while meeting the needs of the Ministry of Defence and maintaining value for money for the taxpayer. Meanwhile, DERA is continuing to work with SERCo Ltd. to rationalise the New Ranges estate to introduce new businesses which are able to co-exist with continuing range activities. There are currently 10 tenants on the site and this number is expected to increase. Recent new tenants include two from the transport industry. I understand that the hon.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10319w21.html_spnew1"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The strategic defence review announced the largest warship-building programme for many years amounting to over 30 major vessels. It remains Government policy that all warships for the Royal Navy will continue to be built in the UK. This commitment, together with the size of our forward programme, offers a platform for UK Industry to plan ahead and modernise. This in turn will allow them to improve their competitiveness for naval export orders, and in competing for the commercial opportunities that are essential if the existing capacity is to be maintained or enhanced.
<P>

<a name="10319w21.html_para3">In the last nine months, this Government have placed orders for two survey vessels with Vosper Thornycroft (UK) Ltd. and announced the company as the preferred bidder for the provision of three offshore patrol vessels; a prime contract for the design and build of the first three type-45 destroyers was placed with BAE Systems Electronics; and we have ordered the design and build of two alternative landing ships logistic from Swan Hunter (Tyneside) Ltd. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence has also announced that, subject to satisfactory terms and conditions being negotiated, the BAE Systems Marine yard at Govan will receive an order for an additional two alternative landing ships logistic. These orders and announcements will create or secure several thousand jobs in UK shipyards and their ancillary industries throughout this country.
<P>

<a name="10319w21.html_para4">Over the next few years, orders will be placed for the follow-on batches of Astute class submarines and type-45 destroyers, and also for the detailed design and build of the future aircraft carriers.

<P>

<a name="10319w21.html_para5">If Saddam Hussein's air defence units attack our aircraft, coalition aircrew are authorised to respond in self-defence. They do so entirely in accordance with international law, attacking those Iraqi military facilities that pose an immediate and serious threat to their safety.

It is in his interests to do so and we have learned not to give too much credence to these allegations. We conduct careful battle damage assessment after every incident; this analysis demonstrates in the majority of cases that coalition weapons have hit their intended military target. The Iraqis regularly claim that there have been civilian casualties on days when the coalition has not even patrolled, let alone dropped any ordnance, and they routinely claim that civilians have been killed when the casualties were actually military personnel. Furthermore, Saddam Hussein has claimed the coalition was responsible for casualties that were in fact caused by Iraqi air defence weapons.

<P>
<a name="10319w21.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 As I explained in my letter of 21 August 1999 to the hon. Member, the only revisions to the Chinook FADEC software since 1994 were the nine software changes introduced as part of the block 1 upgrade later in that year. Two of these changes were potentially the most significant. The first of these was the introduction of a discrete memory to store the position of the engine condition lever (ECL) which was designed to prevent an engine shut down. The second was the fitting of a software filter to screen the speed values of the engine compressor and power turbines, which was designed to prevent an engine run-up.
<P>

<a name="10319w21.html_para8">However, we know that an engine shut down or run up was not a factor in the Mull of Kintyre accident. Examination of the wreckage showed that both engines were working normally right up until impact, and thus faulty FADEC could not have caused this accident. Indeed, the Air Accident Investigation Branch (AAIB) concluded that there was no evidence of any technical malfunction that could possibly have caused the crash.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health when his Department received the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation's review of the abstract presented to the American Association of Immunologists and Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology meeting in San Francisco in 1998 by Dr. V.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10319w22.html_spnew8"><B> Yvette Cooper </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 8 February 2001]:</i>The abstract by Dr. V. K. Singh entitled "Positive titers of measles and measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) antibody are related to myelin basic protein autoantibody in autism", which he had forwarded to the annual meeting of the American Association of Immunologists/Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology held in San Francisco on 22 April 1998, was considered by the joint committee on vaccination and immunisation (JCVI) at its meeting held in October 1998.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what seroconversion rates occur with MMR in relation to <i>(a)</i> measles, <i>(b)</i> mumps and <i>(c)</i> rubella after (i) the first (ii) the second dose.  [153674]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10319w22.html_spnew9"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 Taking seroconversion to mean the percentage of children with detectable antibodies against that infection shortly after vaccination, the usual proportion of individuals with detectable antibodies after the first dose of measles mumps rubella (MMR) vaccine is as follows:
<P>

<a name="10319w22.html_para4"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Measles 95-99 per cent.
<P>
</FONT></UL>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Mumps 90-95 per cent.

<a name="10319w22.html_para6"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Rubella nearly 100 per cent.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="10319w22.html_para7">However, the proportion of children with detectable antibodies against infection declines over time so that just before the age of school entry the proportions are lower. The proportion of children with detectable antibodies some years after MMR correlates much better with the actual efficacy of the vaccines (that is the ability to protect against the disease) and is as follows:
<P>

<a name="10319w22.html_para8"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Measles around 90 per cent.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="10319w22.html_para9"><P>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Mumps around 85 per cent.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="10319w22.html_para10"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Rubella around 99 per cent.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="10319w22.html_para11">The second dose of MMR vaccine, given just before school entry, boosts the proportions of children with detectable antibody for each of the three diseases to around 99 per cent. for measles and mumps and virtually 100 per cent. for rubella. Although antibody levels do decline after the second dose of MMR vaccine, the vaccine's clinical efficacy against each of the diseases after the second dose is 99-100 per cent. This shows the importance of children receiving both doses of MMR vaccine.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what his estimate is of the average time taken between submission of the first draft of full business cases for NHS hospital trust computer systems to NHS regional offices and approval of the final version of full business cases by the NHS executive.  [153093]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10319w24.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Denham </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 9 March 2001]:</i> The Department has approved eight full business cases (FBC) for hospital computer systems where the first draft of the FBC was submitted to the regional offices of the national health service executive on or after December 1998. On average, each of these FBCs was approved four months 



<P>
<P><I>19 Mar 2001 : Column: 96W</I><P>
after the submission of the first draft of the FBC to the regional office. Details of the schemes concerned are shown in the table.
<P>

<a name="10319w24.html_para1">The regional offices of the NHS executive have a dual role. They are responsible for helping NHS trusts to develop their business cases for investment in computer systems. They are also responsible for approving the business case, working jointly with NHS executive headquarters as necessary. Where several months elapse between submission of the first draft of the FBC and approval of the final version, much of this time is likely to be taken up by the development of the FBC rather than the formal process of approval.

 <i>[holding answer 12 March 2001]:</i> We have accepted the recommendation of the Meat Inspection Charges Task Force (the "Maclean Group") that the current method of charging for meat inspections on an hourly basis should be changed and that all abattoirs and cutting plants should instead be charged the standard (headage/throughput) fees laid down in the European Union Charges Directive or their actual inspection costs where these are lower.
<P>

<a name="10319w24.html_para2">The Statutory Instrument (SI) giving effect (in England) to this recommendation--The Meat (Hygiene and Inspection) (Charges) (Amendment) (England) Regulations 2001--was laid before Parliament on 9 March 2001 and, subject to parliamentary approval, will come into force on 2 April 2001. (Similar legislation is being made in Wales and Scotland).
<P>

<a name="10319w24.html_para3">The Regulatory Impact Assessment accompanying the SI gives examples of the impact of these changes on the level of meat inspection charges incurred by certain abattoirs. For example, a small plant (100 livestock units

per annum) would see its annual inspection charges fall from &#163;3,500 to &#163;200. And a medium-sized plant (16,300 livestock units per annum) plant would see its annual charges fall from &#163;107,200 to &#163;49,200. A number of plants with very large annual throughputs will, however, continue to be charged their actual inspection costs (calculated on a per hour basis) since these will be lower than the charge calculated on a throughput basis.

 Over the last 12 months we have received seven letters requesting that Parkinson's disease be included in the list of medical conditions conferring exemption from prescription charges. People suffering from Parkinson's disease are entitled to free prescriptions if they are aged 60 or over, or they (or their partner) are receiving Income Support, income-based Jobseeker's Allowance or tax credits (with their maximum credit reduced by &#163;70, &#163;71 from 10 April, or less per week). They may also claim for help under the national health service low income scheme. We have no plans to change these arrangements.

<P>
<a name="10319w25.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 Medical advice for UK Transplant is obtained from a number of sources. The authority has a number of long-established advisory groups (one for each organ type) which bring together leading clinicians in the field of transplantation from whom advice is sought as needed.
<P>

<a name="10319w25.html_para1">Additionally, UK Transplant is able to access medical advice from the Department. In the future, the medical director at UK Transplant will be the chief source of advice for the authority, in discussion with colleagues in transplant and related services.

<a name="10319w25.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 Transplant co-ordinators are employed by individual national health service trusts, not by the Department. One of the key recommendations in the quinquennial review report of United Kingdom transplant support service authority (as it was) published in February 2000 was that the special health authority should be given responsibility, among other things, for co-ordination of transplant co-ordinator services on a national basis. UK Transplant has prepared a business case for taking action forward in this area. The business case is currently under consideration within the Department. In the interim, a transplant co-ordinators advisory group has been established by UK Transplant to begin to deliver the recommendations of the review.

 As stated in the NHS plan, improving health is a key priority for all Government Departments. Therefore, we are committed to promoting health impact assessment at national, regional and local levels to inform development of policy, strategy, programmes and projects. Methodologies and approaches are being developed, and there is work across Government in a number of areas to support this. A screening checklist has also been developed and has been piloted by the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions.

 When a patient is admitted for treatment it is a decision that must be made by their hospital consultant and must be based on the patient's clinical need and their priority on the waiting list. Under the NHS plan the maximum waiting time for all elective admissions to hospital will be reduced from 18 months today to six months, by the end of 2005. Under the NHS cancer plan, by the end of 2001 there will be a maximum one month wait from diagnosis to treatment for breast cancer. This will be extended to all cancers by the end of 2005.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what discussions he has had recently with representatives of higher education over <i>(a)</i> the impact of and <i>(b)</i> future implications to Project 2000 for nurse recruitment.  [153794]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10319w25.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Denham </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 16 March 2001]:</i> Project 2000 nurse education and training is currently being phased out and replaced by a new model of nurse education--as outlined in the Government's "Making a Difference" strategy and United Kingdom Central Council Education Commission report, "Fitness for Practice" in 1999. The Department is working with all key stakeholders--and especially higher education, with which it has a long established partnership--to ensure the effective roll-out of the new model of nurse education to support nurse recruitment.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will make a statement on the role of nurse consultants with regard to their preceptor responsibility for newly qualified D grade nurses.  [153795]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10319w25.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Denham </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 16 March 2001]:</i> Guidance issued to the national health service (in Health Service Circular 1999/217) makes it clear that nurse consultants have an important education, training and development role but that this is best targeted to support colleagues who need to develop advanced knowledge and skills. A period of preceptorship for newly qualified D grade nurses is good practice in the NHS and best provided by a more experienced nurse in the same team who has been trained for the role.
