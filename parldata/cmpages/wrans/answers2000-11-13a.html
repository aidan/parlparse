<a name="01113w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Reed: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what progress has been made on the establishment of the UK Sports Institute.  [135647]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01113w01.html_spnew0"><B> Kate Hoey: </B> 
 The UK Sports Institute's aim is to provide our best sportsmen and women with the facilities and support services that they need to compete and win at the highest level. It will provide much needed world class facilities and a higher standard of co-ordinated support services than the UK has ever had before.
<P>

<a name="01113w01.html_para0">Recruitment of the key staff of the UKSI Central Services team has been completed. From November 2000, sports will have access to the technical, operational and programme support provided through the UKSI Central Services Team.
<P>

<a name="01113w01.html_para1">The UKSI is also made up of a network of Institutes operated by the home country sports councils. The establishment of the English Institute of Sport of the UKSI is on-going. The Badminton Centre in Milton Keynes, the Aquatics Centre and the Velodrome in Manchester and the Ice-Centre in Nottingham are already available to athletes. In May-June 2000, the water-based hockey pitches in Birmingham and Cannock were among the first completed new projects. At Loughborough, Lottery funding of up to &#163;2.1 million has been agreed for the development of swimming facilities, an indoor athletics centre, international hockey pitches, a gymnastic centre, facilities for badminton and netball together with athlete support services. Over &#163;50 million of new Lottery funding has been committed by Sport England to date for additional facilities for the English network. It is expected that the majority of the remaining Lottery applications, representing over &#163;60 million of further investment in network facilities in England, will be made in the next six months. Once the full building programme has been completed, there will be over 80 facilities that go to make up the English Institute of Sport network.
<P>

<a name="01113w01.html_para2">In addition, the UKSI Scottish Institute of Sport, funded by Sport Scotland, has been established and operating for 18 months and The Sports Council for Wales has been operating and developing UKSI Cymru for sometime. Both have been providing a range of services direct to athletes including technical training and support, conditioning guidance and supervision, preventive and reactive sports medical support and sports science. The Sports Council for Northern Ireland has identified the University of Ulster as their preferred partner to develop in partnership the UKSI network centre for Northern Ireland. Initial principles of agreement have been signed by both parties and work is under way to identify the most appropriate format to operate the network centre.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport for what reason he has not dismissed the National Lottery Commissioners who were in post at the time of the decision which resulted in the resignation of the Chairman of the Commission.  [136243]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01113w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Chris Smith: </B> 
 I have no grounds for dismissing the National Lottery Commissioners. The former Chairman of the National Lottery Commission, Dame Helena Shovelton, resigned from the Commission for personal reasons. I appointed Lord Burns to take her place on the Commission, and gave him a clear remit, alongside the other Commissioners, to conduct the selection process with absolute fairness and impartiality between the applicants. The Government have every confidence in their ability to do so.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01113w01.html_spnew6"><B> Kate Hoey: </B> 
 I have currently no plans. Any decision to recognise chess as a sport would have to be agreed by all four home country sports councils and departments.

<P>
<a name="01113w01.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Cohen: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what plans he has for funding regional theatre in the areas covered by <i>(a)</i> the South East Arts Board, <i>(b)</i> Waverley district council and <i>(c)</i> Mole Valley district council, with particular reference to (i) the Redgrave Theatre, Farnham and (ii) the Thorndike Theatre, Leatherhead.  [137687]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01113w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Alan Howarth: </B> 
 This is a matter for the Arts Council of England, as the main funding body for the arts in England, in collaboration with South East Arts, as the regional arts board, to decide within the context of their current review of theatre. The Arts Council have already announced additional funding for theatre from 2002-03, and decisions on how this will be distributed will be made in the near future.

<P>
<P>
<a name="01113w01.html_wqn8"><B> Dr. Julian Lewis: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, pursuant to his answer of 30 October 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 330W, on subtitling for the deaf and hard of hearing on digital, cable and satellite television, for what reason the scope of his Department's review has been extended to include satellite and cable TV; and what other aspects of provision and reception of subtitling, signing and audio description services are also being reviewed.  [137919]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01113w01.html_spnew8"><B> Janet Anderson: </B> 
 The review was widened to include other aspects of the provision and reception of subtitling, signing and audio description services in order to inform Government in the development of future broadcasting policy and legislation in this area. Other aspects being considered are the possibilities of different targets for different broadcasters, the prioritisation of certain programmes/channels, the costs of providing and receiving these services and the availability of skilled subtitlers, signers and audio describers.

<P>
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what the level of <i>(a)</i> Government and <i>(b)</i> European Communities support for the European Union Baroque Orchestra is.  [138084]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01113w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Alan Howarth: </B> 
 The European Union Baroque Orchestra is an official cultural training initiative of the European Parliament and the European Commission, and receives funding from the European Commission's Directorate General for Education and Culture. The orchestra also receives major sponsorship from industry and other organisations and individuals. The level of that funding is for those organisations to determine; no additional support comes from Government.

<a name="01113w02.html_para0">Experts recommend that all adults should participate in at least 30 minutes of moderate intensity physical activity five times a week and children should be active for at least an hour every day. In each case, physical activity can include activities like brisk walking, cycling and swimming.
<P>

<a name="01113w02.html_para1">The National Service Framework for Coronary Heart Disease set out key milestones for the implementation of a range of prevention programmes at a local level. These milestones state that, by April 2001, all NHS bodies, working closely with local authorities, will have agreed and be contributing to the delivery of local programmes on physical activity. By April 2002, all local health communities will have quantitative data on implementation of these policies. The Health Development Agency has compiled a guide for implementing the preventive aspects of the NSF. This will be sent to Health Authorities in November and will provide examples of the projects they can set up in order to reach NSF milestones.
<P>

<a name="01113w02.html_para2">Several Government initiatives are promoting opportunities for people to be more physically active. The Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions has made safer roads a priority in their White Paper 'A New Deal for Transport'. The Department for Culture, Media and Sport have outlined their commitment to improve access to services in their 'Sports Strategy'. There is also a joint DH/DfEE programme to implement the objectives of the 'National Healthy School Standard', which includes physical activity as a component.
<P>

<a name="01113w02.html_para3">Initiatives are in place to promote physical activity among children. The Safe and Sound Challenge, which encourages children to walk or cycle to school along safe routes, has run successfully for two years. In 2000-01, the aim of the scheme will be to offer schools in socially deprived areas the opportunity to develop healthy active modes of travel to school.

However, the negative impact of growth on the environment has to be reduced and a more productive use of environmental resources developed. To do this we need to: address problems at the right level--international, national, regional and local; harness consumer demand, not stifle it; stimulate science and innovation to provide solutions to environmental problems; use environmental resources more efficiently and become a low-carbon, recycling economy; and see protecting the environment as a business opportunity.

<a name="01113w03.html_para0">The charge to customers for the use of the NBC Training Facility at DERA Porton Down, known as the Battle Run, comprises range maintenance and manpower operational costs as well as an element of profit as agreed between DERA and MOD in their Terms of Business Agreement (TOBA). The actual amount of usage and the associated cost are agreed on a yearly basis within an agreed limit of liability which is specified in the contract for use. The basis for the calculation of charges for each of the three years and the current year is the same apart from adjustments for inflation, the amounts of which are also agreed between MOD and DERA. The charges to HQ Land Command, the Ministry of Defence budget holder for these units, for each of the three years were &#163;48,928, &#163;42,118 and &#163;51,715 respectively. Costs are not attributed to individual units. Costs include elements for facility maintenance and improvements to overall capability as well as the actual operational cost for the conduct of the Battle Run training.

 The Ministry of Defence has purchased only one variant of the Tomahawk Land Attack Missile, the Block IIIC, which has a conventionally armed blast warhead. It is currently deployed in RN submarines. Although we are studying future Tomahawk developments, and joint work with the United States Navy has shown that a Torpedo Tube Launch version is possible, we have made no commitment to buying the next generation Tactom Block IV variant.

 The Ministry of Defence offered the assistance of the UK Submarine Search and Rescue Service (UKSSRS) to the Russian rescue effort in a letter to the Russian Defence Minister, which was delivered by the British Embassy Moscow on 14 August.

<P>
<a name="01113w03.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The Phoenix Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) was first deployed to the Balkans theatre between June-August 1999. No UK UAVs were deployed before this date. At the request of KFOR Headquarters, the system was deployed again in May 2000 and remained in-theatre until 1 November 2000. Since June 1999, some 270 missions have been flown in-theatre. In total there have been 29 occasions where either the airframe and/or the sensor payload has been lost or written off due to damage incurred. Reasons for losses include hostile action, landing damage and equipment failure. The attrition rate, including losses to hostile action, is not inconsistent with that expected during peacetime usage. The costs associated with the losses need to be set against the risks of using alternative means of surveillance and reconnaissance such as manned aircraft or personnel on the ground. Operational reports continue to indicate that Phoenix is both reliable and highly effective as a general reconnaissance and surveillance system with the capability to conduct safe surveillance over areas which might otherwise be inaccessible.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will make a statement on the level of pensions payable to former members of the armed services who retired in the 1970s.  [136117]

<P>
<P>
<a name="01113w04.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 Former members of the armed services who retired during the mid 1970s were affected by policies under which increases in pay were limited, but pensions in payment continued to be fully protected against price inflation. People who retired when price inflation was running at a higher rate than pay increases could therefore receive lower pensions than those retiring before or after them.
<P>

<a name="01113w04.html_para0">These policies affected all those employed in the public service. The Government have no plans retrospectively to change the pensions of those who retired during this period. The pensions of all such individuals have, like those of other public servants, been fully protected against inflation since their retirement.

 The operational capability of the Royal Navy is kept under continual review. This allows the RN to take into consideration changing circumstances. In addition, at any one time, it is likely that a number of more formal reviews or studies with a wider remit will be taking place, any one of which may impact on the area of operational capability. It is the nature of operational issues that much of this work is classified.

<P><I>13 Nov 2000 : Column: 460W</I><P>
Overseas Trade Statistics. These statistics do not identify the age of the animal from which the beef was derived, but the sale for human consumption of any meat from animals aged over 30 months at slaughter is prohibited by the Fresh Meat (Beef Controls) (No. 2) Regulations 1996. The country from which these imports originated is not recorded in the Overseas Trade Statistics; therefore not necessarily all beef shown as being imported from France will be of French origin.

 While the decision whether to offer subsidised school milk is essentially for the schools themselves or for the LEA, we have had and continue to have contact with local authorities and others interested in the use of the scheme. One barrier to take-up has been the perception that the scheme administration is particularly complicated. We are working with the Commission in its current review of administration to see whether there are ways this can be simplified for schools.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland how many bomb scares have there been in town centres in each police division in Northern Ireland in each week since 1 April; and, of these, how many were <i>(a)</i> Republican-inspired and <i>(b)</i> Loyalist-inspired.  [136040]

 The table shows the number of hoax bombing incidents recorded in Northern Ireland during the period 1 April to 27 October 2000. These are incidents where an Army Technical Officer (ATO) was in attendance. It is not possible to define a town centre and so the table gives the location of each recorded incident. It is also not possible to give attributions for hoax bombings.

 The following table provides the information requested, by recruitment competition from 1995. Under the terms of section 31 of the Fair Employment (Northern Ireland) Act 1989 (now Article 55 of the Fair Employment and Treatment (Northern Ireland) Order 1998) this matter is continuously under review and requires the Royal Ulster Constabulary to identify under-representation and establish appropriate affirmative action to address any imbalances. The Royal Ulster Constabulary fully recognises the benefits and the need to be more representative of the communities it serves and its goal is to reflect the composition of those communities. The Government are committed to taking all appropriate steps as are necessary, in line with the recommendations contained in the Report of the Independent Commission on Policing for Northern Ireland, to bring about an increase in full cross-community representation within the police service.

 As we have made clear in the past, we have not given specific deadlines. We have learned the lessons of the rail privatisation debacle when best value was compromised by working to a politically driven timetable. The position on the PPP is that bids have been received for the sub-surface lines contract, and best and final offers have been invited for the two deep tube contracts. Contracts will be signed when the bids have been evaluated and negotiations are complete, subject to the bids representing best value.

 I refer the hon. Member to the answer given on 18 May 2000, <i>Official Report,</i> column 252W.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01113w07.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 The review contains a wide-ranging discussion of issues relating to London Underground funding, and has a great deal that is positive to say about the PPP. It says,


<BR>
"The PPP will provide a framework in which higher investment can be insulated from Treasury cuts and planned over a 30-year period."
It goes on to say that,
<BR>
"The contract outlines we have inspected offer a workable framework for improved performance for most aspects of the Underground,"
and that the
<BR>
"rewards and penalties together should incentivise investment, cost control and good management."
I particularly noted its statement that
<BR>
"The Review does not subscribe to the argument that the PPP structure is inherently unsafe and it recognises the special effort made by Government in ensuring that safety is managed centrally and rests ultimately in public sector hands."

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what research he has <i>(a)</i> undertaken and <i>(b)</i> commissioned into emissions from crematoriums; and what plans he has to conduct further research.  [137039]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01113w07.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 Emissions from crematoriums are regulated under the air pollution control system established by Part I of the Environmental Protection Act 1990. As such, emissions must be controlled in accordance with the Best Available Techniques Not Entailing Excessive Cost. Guidance on BATNEEC for crematoriums was published in 1991 and revised in 1995. A second review of the guidance by the Environment Agency's Local Authority Unit is currently in progress and the revised guidance will also be applicable when crematoriums become regulated under the Pollution Prevention and Control Act 1999.
<P>

<a name="01113w07.html_para0">My Department, on behalf of Government and the devolved Administrations, has established a programme of monitoring levels of airborne lead and heavy metals (cadmium, arsenic, nickel and mercury) in the UK. This includes measurement in the vicinity of the Sutton Coldfield crematorium. Weekly measurements started in October 1999, and interim results will be posted on the internet shortly (www.aeat.co.uk/netcen/airqual/). A fuller report of the work will be published on the internet, at the same internet address, early next year.
<P>

<a name="01113w07.html_para1">In 1997 my Department commissioned Entec UK Ltd. to carry out tests to investigate the effectiveness of selenium ampoules as a means of abating mercury emissions from crematoria.
<P>

<a name="01113w07.html_para2">My Department has commissioned a report on sources, sinks and levels of atmospheric mercury from DERA. The report will include a review of knowledge of UK emissions of mercury into the atmosphere, details of all the available sources of data on concentrations of mercury in the atmosphere, and a review of the current state of knowledge on the behaviour of mercury in the environment.
<P>

<a name="01113w07.html_para3">The DERA report is expected shortly from the research report pages of the National Air Quality Information Archive on http://www.aeat.co.uk/netcen/airqual/.

 We published our first assessment of the impacts of climate change in 1990, and our second in 1995. In 1997, my Department established the UK Climate Impacts Programme to help organisations assess their vulnerability to climate change and assist them in planning responses to adapt to it. In addition actions have already been taken by Government to build adaptation into its own policies, in sectors such as flood defence, land use planning and water resources.

 The Government have continued to play a leading role in the international response to climate change. The Conference of the Parties in The Hague later this month will be a crucial step towards our goal of effective international action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In recent months, the Deputy Prime Minister has discussed climate change with Governments from 14 countries, including China, India, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, Mexico, Algeria, Malaysia and Jamaica, as well as with the Prime Minister of Japan and Vice-President Al Gore. On 7 November, the Deputy Prime Minister and I attended the Special EU Environment Council on climate change. I discuss climate change regularly with my EU colleagues, and take the opportunity of raising it whenever I meet Environment Ministers from around the world. In June and October I also attended preparatory meetings organised by the President of the forthcoming negotiations, Minister Jan Pronk of the Netherlands, in Warsaw and Muiden. These informal consultations were attended by around 30-40 Ministers from key countries in the climate negotiations. Discussions focused on the central issues in the negotiations and a range of possible options for resolving them, in advance of the key political choices which will have to be taken at The Hague summit.

his Department <i>(a)</i> has taken and <i>(b)</i> intends to take to address the environmental impact of using oil as an energy source.  [137220]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01113w07.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The Government are taking action to tackle climate change by reducing emissions of greenhouse gases, including those from the use of oil and other fossil fuels as an energy source. The climate change programme, which will be published shortly, will outline the scale of the challenge facing the UK and make clear that emission reductions of 60-70 per cent. or more are likely to be needed globally in order to avoid dangerous climate change. The programme will set out the policies and measures that will begin to move the UK towards a low carbon economy. And it will detail how the Government intend to help and assist the development of new, sustainable and renewable technologies.
<P>

<a name="01113w07.html_para7">One area where oil is still used as a primary energy source is in the transport sector. The Government are taking forward a range of policies that will improve the fuel efficiency and emissions performance of vehicles, encourage people to buy smaller, cleaner and more fuel- efficient cars, and stimulate the development and use of alternative fuels and technologies. The Government are also addressing the environmental impact of traffic growth through the Ten Year Plan for transport and planning policies.
<P>

<a name="01113w07.html_para8">The use of oil as an energy source can also have serious air quality impacts. The Government and the devolved Administrations published the Air Quality Strategy for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland in January 2000. This sets out a programme of action that will be taken at international, national and local levels to tackle air pollution from all sources. In the transport sector, the fuels that are used today are significantly cleaner than those used only a few years ago. This is largely the result of progressively tighter European fuel quality standards, but is also due in part to our incentivisation of the use of cleaner fuels (such as ultra-low-sulphur petrol and diesel) across the UK through favourable duty rates. This has led to significant reductions in emissions of the most harmful air pollutants. We will continue to play an active role in discussions at a European Union level on the possible further tightening of vehicle and fuel standards.

<a name="01113w08.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 The proposed allocations for the Neighbourhood Renewal Fund cannot be calculated using the old 1998 Index of Local Deprivation in exactly the same way that they have been determined using the new Indices. The new Indices of Deprivation are very different from the old Index. The new Indices are based on ward level information whereas the old Index relied heavily on district level information and did not adequately capture pockets of deprivation. It would not therefore be appropriate to use the same method to calculate the NRF allocations if only the old Index was available.

 In addition to the general guidance at present in Circular 30/92, which is to be updated in PPG25, guidance on housing is given in PPG3 "Housing", published in March 2000. This requires local authorities to assess the suitability of land for housing against a range of physical and environmental constraints, including flood risk, and the fact that such risks may increase as a result of climate change.

<P>
<a name="01113w09.html_spnew9"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 Guidance is at present given in DOE Circular 30/92, "Development and Flood Risk". This requires local planning authorities to take flood risk considerations into account in determining planning applications. They should also take into account the results of surveys of flood defence issues prepared by the Environment Agency under section 105 of the Water Resources Act 1991, and the views of the Environment Agency on individual applications. This guidance is currently being revised and strengthened in Planning Policy Guidance Note 25. A consultation draft was published in April 2000 and the final text is expected to be published in December.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will place in the Library a map showing the flood plain of the Ouseburn/Jesmond Dene, Newcastle upon Tyne, and the location and date of <i>(a)</i> flooding of property and <i>(b)</i> storm sewer overflows in the last 10 years.

<a name="01113w09.html_spnew10"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 Indicative flood plain maps prepared by the Environment Agency were distributed to all local authorities in 1999. These are currently being revised and the Agency intend to place them on their website in December in a form that will enable searches by postcode. While the Environment Agency could supply the current flood plain map, my hon. Friend may wish to await publication of the revised maps in December.
<P>

<a name="01113w09.html_para6">My Department does not hold records of flooding of property and storm sewer overflows. Operational flood matters are for the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the Environment Agency and other drainage authorities. I would expect the information to be available from one or more of the local authorities, the Environment Agency and the sewerage undertaker for the area.

All tables include some revisions to figures for earlier years revealing slightly lower performance than previously reported. The last figure announced was 18.1 per cent. to March 1998, but clarification of a misunderstanding with the Navy and data revisions by some other departments have reduced that figure to 17.5 per cent.

<sup>(10)</sup> Progress is expressed as a percentage relative to the 1990-91 base year value of the performance indicator in question. Positive figures represent improvement. The standard indicator, against which the target to improve energy efficiency by 20 per cent. by 31 March 2000 is measured, is obtained by weather-correcting energy consumption and converting to costs using "standard prices" for fuel (6p/kWh for electricity and 1.25p/kWh for all fossil fuels) then dividing by floor area. Conversion to money both reflects the relative costs of electricity and fossil fuel and their environmental impact, and the use of fixed prices eliminates the effects of tariff changes which distort the comparison of fuel bills.<P>





<sup>(11)</sup> Although figures have been prepared on a consistent basis, caution should be exercised in comparing the energy use of different departments and agencies because of differences in their estate and the nature of their work. For example, the operational needs of prisons and the QEII Conference Centre mean that they have a pattern of energy use which is different from that of a department which has predominantly office accommodation. Expenditure on energy and investment figures are included for information only. Investment figures relate to clearly identifiable energy efficiency measures undertaken by departments. Energy efficiency is an integral part of all major construction projects, including building refurbishment and plant replacement and the figure "0" for some departments does not necessarily mean there has been no investment, just that the investment was not clearly identifiable.<P>

<P>

<P>

<P>

<sup>(12)</sup> The average performance figure for the civil estate cannot be derived by simply adding together the individual departmental progress and dividing by the number of departments because this does not allow for the large variations in consumption. The correct figure is obtained by calculating the value of the performance indicator for the year in question and the base year, for the civil estate as a whole, and calculating the reduction relative to the base year.<P>

<P>

<P>

<P>

<sup>(13)</sup> The energy performance for MAFF's "Main estate" and its "Laboratories" continues to improve through on-going investment in energy schemes, monitoring of energy at local level and taking appropriate action as well as central initiatives including continued staff awareness programmes.<P>

<P>

<P>

<P>

<sup>(14)</sup> The DETR's figures have been compiled from the former Environment and Transport Departments. The Department now has a greater proportion of air-conditioned buildings than in the base year, because of estate rationalisation, relocation to new HQ buildings and inclusion of some Government Offices for the Regions. Performance in 1997-98 was adversely affected by parallel operation of both old and new buildings while staff moved from one to the other.<P>

<P>

<P>

<P>

<sup>(15)</sup> HSE was removed from the DfEE estate on the formation of that Department. QEII Conference Centre is reported separately because of its business-led demands. The initial sharp rise in consumption following the 1990-91 base year was directly attributable to increased revenue earning activity, which has continued throughout the reporting period, ["and the more recent decline in consumption reflects the effect of energy conservation measures undertaken at the site".]<P>

<P>

<P>

<P>

<sup>(16)</sup> Rationalisation of the estate since the base year has led to staff moving from several naturally ventilated buildings to more densely occupied air-conditioned buildings, all equipped extensively with information technology equipment. Staff numbers have increased by over 25 per cent. since 1997-98 which has led to a commensurate increase in energy consumption.<P>

<P>

<P>

<P>

<sup>(20)</sup> The Ministry of Defence (MOD) estate is different from the rest of the Government estate, and has been undergoing more radical changes. It is therefore treated in a slightly different way. In common with the civil estate, it has greatly increased its use of information technology.<P>

<P>

<P>

<P>

<sup>(21)</sup> In civil departments, the effect of estate changes is allowed for by dividing consumption by floor area. In MOD, floor area is sometimes not meaningful (eg in relation to security or runway lighting) and also not often available. Estate changes are allowed for by being explicitly excluded from the calculations, ie the energy consumption of new facilities is removed, and for facilities no longer part of the estate, the consumption for the last full year of operation is added back. In most cases, such changes are small compared to the total and can often approximately cancel each other out.<P>

<P>

<P>

<P>

<sup>(22)</sup> No 1998-99 data were available for the Common User Estate part of MOD. 1997-98 results are quoted.<P>

<P>

<P>

<P>

<sup>(23)</sup> It is almost impossible to produce any meaningful results to date for MOD's Procurement Executive (PE) since it has suffered major estate gains and losses over the past 10 years and now consists largely of one recently built large office. The standard MOD methodology produces a meaningless "no change" result (since the present estate is almost entirely different from the original). Consequently, we have taken 1997-98 as the base year and applied the civil departments' methodology to this office.<P>

<P>

<P>

<P>

<sup>(24)</sup> This shows the combined results for the whole of the Government estate based on the data in tables 1, 2 and 3. It is not a simple average of the data, but reflects the proportion of total consumption represented by each part of the estate (see also note 3). Some departments have a different base year, and the individually agreed base year has been used for the purposes of this table, where appropriate.<P>

<P>

<P>

<P>

<sup>(25)</sup> In some instances the base year is not 1990-91, but for the purpose of this table the agreed base year has been used in the calculation.<P>

<P>

<a name="01113w12.html_para0">

<BR>
<i>Ramsar sites in England--A policy statement</i>
<BR>
<i>Introduction</i>
<BR>
1. The Convention on Wetlands of International Importance especially as Waterfowl Habitat (the 'Ramsar Convention'), signed in Ramsar, Iran, in 1971, is an intergovernmental treaty which provides the framework for the conservation and wise use of wetlands and their resources by national action and international co-operation as a contribution to achieving sustainable development throughout the world. In May 2000 there were 121 Contracting Parties to the Convention. The UK ratified the Convention in 1976. The UK Government is fully committed to effective implementation of the Convention.
<BR>
2. One of the main means by which the Ramsar Convention seeks to conserve wetlands and wetland interests is through the listing of sites on the Ramsar List of Wetlands of International Importance. In May 2000 there were 1,027 wetland sites covering over 78 million hectares on the Ramsar List. At that time the UK had listed 157 sites covering almost 738,000 hectares.
<BR>
3. The Joint Nature Conservation Committee, the Government's statutory adviser on international conservation matters, is currently carrying out a review of the UK Ramsar site list, taking account of the Convention's Resolution VII.11 (Strategic Framework and Guidelines for the Future Development of the List of Wetlands of International Importance of the Convention on Wetlands). It is the Government's intention to publish a revised site list before the 8th Conference of Contracting Parties (COP) in 2002 and to designate any new sites which meet the selection criteria by COP9 in 2005. This will contribute towards the Ramsar Convention's own target of 2000 listed sites globally by 2005.
<BR>
4. This statement sets out the Government's policies for the protection and management of Ramsar sites in England, of which there were 75 covering over 361,000 hectares at the end of May 2000. Matters relating to the management and protection of Ramsar sites in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland fall to the devolved administrations of those countries.




<P>
<P><I>13 Nov 2000 : Column: 489W</I><P>

<BR>
<i>Ramsar sites in England--the current position</i>
<BR>
5. All terrestrial areas included within listed Ramsar sites in England are currently Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and it is the Government's firm intention that this will continue to be the case. As such they are subject to the same arrangements as for other SSSIs notified by English Nature. The Countryside and Rights of Way Bill currently before Parliament will substantially enhance the protection available to SSSIs and to make it easier for English Nature to create the conditions for their conservation interests to be managed positively. As such the Countryside and Rights of Way Bill changes will make a very substantial contribution to meeting the Government's obligations under the Convention.
<BR>
6. Paragraph C7 of the current Planning Policy Guidance on Nature Conservation (PPG9) published in 1994 extends the same protection at a policy level to listed Ramsar sites in respect of new development as that afforded to sites which have been designated under the Birds and Habitats Directives as part of the EU Natura 2000 network.
<BR>
7. Article 6 of the Habitats Directive (as transposed into UK law through the Conservation (Natural Habitats, &c.) Regulations 1994 as amended otherwise referred to as 'the Habitats Regulations') requires that any new development proposal likely to have a significant impact on a Natura 2000 site is assessed for its implications on that site in view of the site's conservation objectives. If that assessment concludes that the project would have an adverse effect on the integrity of the site it can only proceed, in the absence of alternatives, in the overriding public interest. In addition, compensatory measures must be taken to maintain the coherence of the Natura 2000 network. The Government's Outline Position Statement on the Birds and Habitats Directive published in May 1998 (otherwise referred to as the Government Statement) gave further guidance on the application of Article 6.
<BR>
8. It is the Government's intention to bring forward revised Planning Policy Guidance on Nature Conservation once the Countryside and Rights of Way Bill has completed its passage through Parliament. It will continue to apply as a matter of policy substantially the same framework to listed Ramsar sites as to Natura 2000 sites. Paragraphs 15-27 of this policy statement draw attention to, and provide further guidance on, how that framework will be applied to Ramsar sites.

9. In May 2000 there were 79 Special Protection Areas (SPAs) classified under the Birds Directive and 148 candidate Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) under the Habitats Directive covering almost 990,000 hectares in England. The Government has recently initiated consultation on substantial additions to its list of candidate SACs which will increase the proportion of SSSIs in the Natura 2000 network to around 75 per cent. by area.
<BR>
10. Of the 75 English Ramsar sites at the end of May 2000, only 6 were completely outside the Natura 2000 network of sites. The remaining 69 were either coincident with or substantially overlapping SPAs or candidate SACs. The Government does not envisage that the proportion of Ramsar sites outside the Natura 2000 network is likely to change substantially in the light of planned revisions to both site networks.
<BR>
<i>Management issues</i>
<BR>
11. English Nature, the Government's statutory adviser on nature conservation matters in England, is charged with ensuring promotion of the conservation and wise use of all Ramsar sites through management and various other measures. In May 2000, 70 per cent. of Ramsar sites were in favourable or improving condition. English Nature's objective is to increase this to 75 per cent. by 2002, to 80 per cent. by 2004, and to exceed 95 per cent. by 2010.




<P>
<P><I>13 Nov 2000 : Column: 490W</I><P>

<BR>
12. Resolution V.7 adopted by the Ramsar Convention in 1993 requires that all Ramsar sites should have a management plan. All areas included within English Ramsar sites have some type of management plan incorporating conservation objectives for the Ramsar interests. Where the management plan for a site covers more than one designation, English Nature has been asked to ensure that plans adequately cover the Ramsar interests especially where these may be broader than Natura 2000 interests. They have also been asked to ensure that plans are consistent with the international best practice guidance contained in the Ramsar Toolkit (see paragraph 29).
<BR>
13. All statutory bodies involved in funding conservation, both on designated sites and in the wider countryside, are encouraged to develop and use schemes to support the positive management of Ramsar sites and their interests.
<BR>
<i>Countryside and Rights of Way Bill</i>
<BR>
14. The Bill places a new duty on the Secretary of State to notify the statutory nature conservation agencies of Ramsar designations in England and Wales and, in turn, on the agencies to inform owners and occupiers and other specified bodies. This duty will bring the notification procedures for Ramsar sites in line with those for sites designated as SSSI, SAC and SPA.
<BR>
<i>Planning policies</i>
<BR>
15. Most new development proposals likely to affect a Ramsar site will require an Environmental Impact Assessment under the Town and Country Planning (Assessment of Environmental Effects) Regulations 1988 as amended. In applying the provisions of the Habitats Regulations to Ramsar sites, PPG9 requires that all development proposals likely to have a significant effect on such a site shall be subject to an 'appropriate assessment' of the implications for the site in view of that site's conservation objectives. This includes any proposal which a statutory body or 'competent authority' proposes to undertake itself. In carrying out an assessment the competent authority is required to consult English Nature and have regard to any representations made. In order fully to meet that policy obligation, the authority will need to ensure that its assessment takes into account the full range of Ramsar interests for which the site has been designated and their vulnerabilities to any effects of the proposed development.
<BR>
16. Competent authorities are required by the Habitats Regulations to undertake an appropriate assessment of any plan or project likely to have a significant effect on a Natura 2000 site. Where Ramsar sites are coincident with or overlap Natura 2000 sites, authorities also need to ensure that their assessment takes fully into account the Ramsar interests on the site and any additional vulnerabilities that they may have to the effects of the proposal in order to fulfil their policy obligations under PPG9.
<BR>
17. Wetland sites are some of the most fragile and vulnerable sites in the SSSI series, often subject to hydrological or other changes which occur both on and off site. Assessments need to take particular care to consider indirect effects as well as direct effects of proposals and the cumulative effects of piecemeal development.
<BR>
<i>Special considerations</i>
<BR>
18. The Government Statement of May 1998 on the Birds and Habitats Directives gave extensive guidance on the application of Article 6 of the Habitats Directive and relevant factors to be weighed when making judgments about overriding public interest. In reaching decisions on Ramsar sites, it will be necessary to take into account the wording of Article 4 of the Ramsar Convention, which allows a Contracting Party to delete or restrict the boundaries of sites 'in its urgent national interest'.
<BR>
19. The general principles expounded in paragraphs 8 to 11 of the Statement on the Birds and Habitats Directives should be followed when applying the provisions of PPG9 to listed Ramsar sites. The Government's view is that a development proposal does not necessarily have to be of national significance in its own right to meet the requirements set out in Article 4 of the Convention. Any benefits arising from 



<P>
<P><I>13 Nov 2000 : Column: 491W</I><P>
the proposal must, however, demonstrably outweigh the acknowledged international conservation value of the site. Projects of limited regional or local significance are thus unlikely to meet this test.
<BR>
20. Article 4 of the Ramsar Convention requires Contracting Parties which delete sites or restrict site boundaries to provide compensatory measures for the loss of conservation interests. It is the Government's view that compensatory measures should provide, as a minimum, no net loss to the overall value of the national Ramsar site series either by way of quality or area. It is the Government's view that the principles expounded in paragraph 11 of the Government Statement on the Birds and Habitats Directives should also apply when it comes to compensatory measures for lost Ramsar interests, namely there must be a reasonable expectation that any such measures involving habitat recreation or restoration will be successful and that any such measures will be delivered within a timescale which secures the continuing nature conservation interests of any species present. The Government expects that a suitable package of compensatory measures will normally be a condition of any consent given and that wherever possible the developer will bear the cost of any such measures under the polluter pays principle.
<BR>
<i>Other development and consent regimes</i>
<BR>
21. Ramsar sites are potentially vulnerable to developments regulated by regimes other than the development control framework. For example, the Environment Agency regulates a wide range of waste management, discharge and water abstraction activities. Ministers expect that those, including the Government themselves, who have responsibility for such regimes should follow the policy approach advocated in PPG9 in respect of developments likely to have significant impacts on listed Ramsar sites.
<BR>
<i>Reviews of consents</i>
<BR>
22. Regulation 50 of the Habitats Regulations as amended requires the review of extant (i.e. unimplemented or partially implemented) consents on Natura 2000 sites. There are no such provisions for Ramsar sites and it has, to date, been the major difference between the two.
<BR>
23. For the overwhelming majority of Ramsar sites, reviews of consents on Natura 2000 sites under the Regulation 50 provisions will normally be sufficient to ensure the Ramsar interests are adequately protected.
<BR>
24. Local planning authorities are expected to extend the scope of their appropriate assessments when carrying out Regulation 50 reviews on Natura 2000 sites to consider the effects on coincident or overlapping Ramsar sites. Where the planning authority reaches the conclusion that there would be no adverse effect on the integrity of the Natura 2000 site from allowing the consent to proceed, but there would be an adverse effect on integrity on the Ramsar site, it should consider whether to issue a modification or revocation order using powers available under Section 97 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990. In cases where the authority considers modification or revocation is warranted, the Government will consider reimbursing local authorities where the costs were high, where the action taken was no more than necessary to remove the risk to the site, and less costly alternatives have been fully explored.
<BR>
25. Local planning authorities are expected to adopt a similar approach where listed Ramsar sites are not within the Natura 2000 network, by carrying out an appropriate assessment analogous to that required by Regulation 50 and by issuing modification or revocation orders under Section 97 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, at the earliest opportunity following the listing of a Ramsar site. Where the integrity of a Ramsar site would be adversely affected by the full implementation of an extant consent and modification or revocation of the consent is warranted, the Government will again consider reimbursing local authorities where the costs were high, where the action taken was no more than necessary to remove the risk to the site, and less costly alternatives have been fully explored.




<P>
<P><I>13 Nov 2000 : Column: 492W</I><P>

<BR>
26. The Government expect competent authorities, other than planning authorities, to use whatever review powers are available within the regimes they administer to address any potential adverse effects on the integrity of listed Ramsar sites from extant consents by adopting a general approach analogous to that advocated for planning authorities in paragraphs 24 & 25 above.
<BR>
27. It is the Government's view that the additional call on public funds arising from the application of paragraphs 24 to 26 is not likely to be significant given the very high proportion of the Ramsar site series which is already covered by the Natura 2000 network and the review provisions of Regulation 50 of the Habitats Regulations. These existing measures are expected to protect the Ramsar interests in the vast majority of cases.
<BR>
<i>Wider issues</i>
<BR>
28. Designated sites are to a greater or lesser degree affected by activities which occur away from or adjacent to those sites, as well as those on site. Wetland sites are especially vulnerable to factors such as hydrological change within or adjacent to the site. The Countryside and Rights of Way Bill places a duty on public bodies to 'further the conservation and enhancement' of Sites of Special Scientific Interest. The Government expect that public bodies, in meeting that new obligation, will pay particular attention to the needs of listed Ramsar sites. Where they have not done so already, public bodies will need to incorporate these considerations into their strategic thinking and planning mechanisms.
<BR>
29. Article 3.1 of the Ramsar Convention requires Contracting Parties to 'formulate and implement their planning so as to promote the conservation of the wetlands included in the List, and, as far as possible the wise use of wetlands in their territory'. The Ramsar Convention has developed and adopted 'Guidelines for the Implementation of the Wise Use Concept' <sup>1</sup> . It has also recently published The Ramsar Handbooks on Wise Use <sup>1</sup> , nine handbooks (referred to ask the "Ramsar Toolkit"), embodying the major 'best practice' guidelines developed and approved by the Conference of the Contracting Parties, complete with case studies, illustrations, and other helpful materials. The Government commend these documents to statutory bodies as valuable sources of further guidance and technical assistance on how issues of wise use should be addressed.

 As set out in "Transport 2010: The 10 Year Plan" we are committed to providing sufficient funds to tackle the backlog of expenditure on carriageway, footway, bridge, and street lighting maintenance, estimated to be &#163;7 billion in the next 10 years. In the forthcoming Local Transport Plan settlement we will provide &#163;535 million to fund capital maintenance works on local highways in 2001-02 and &#163;555 million in 2002-03. These are increases of 103 per cent. and 110 per cent. respectively compared with 2000-01. We have extended the settlement to cover non-principal roads as well as principal roads and bridges.

<a name="01113w13.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 We have not produced a UK assessment. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change published their report, "Aviation and the Global Atmosphere", in December 1999. UK experts made significant contributions to the report on both science and technology. It considered all potential effects on the atmosphere and climate, up to 2050, from aviation emissions and identified the present and future impacts, on the basis of a range of scenarios, as well as remaining areas of uncertainty. The Government continue to support research to reduce these scientific uncertainties, and to improve technology.

 I refer the hon. Member to my reply of Thursday 25 November 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column 171W.
<P>

<a name="01113w13.html_para4">The Secretary of State has not had any recent discussions with the CAA over such incidents. However the CAA is continuing to investigate icefall incidents whenever possible.




<P>
<P><I>13 Nov 2000 : Column: 496W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="01113w13.html_para5">I understand the hon. Member met CAA staff on 18 May specifically to discuss icefalls, following which the CAA wrote to her on 26 May 2000 providing comprehensive details of icefall incidents. In the period 1 January 2000 to 1 November 2000, 36 incidents of icefall and 21 incidents of other falling objects were recorded. The average number of incidents recorded over the five-year period 1995-99 was 31.
<P>

<a name="01113w13.html_para6">The CAA places the primary emphasis on prevention, and both the Authority and airlines are putting a great deal of effort into eliminating icefalls by checking water systems for leaks. The CAA has also issued reminders to UK operators, by way of Airworthiness Directives, emphasising the importance of regular checks.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions when the proposal of a link road between a new junction 18a on the M4 and the Avon Ring Road was <i>(a)</i> first included and <i>(b)</i> removed from the Government's trunk road programme.  [138229]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01113w14.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 The proposal for a new link road and a new junction on the M4 was first put forward by the former Avon County Council in 1985. This was accepted in principle by the then Department of Transport, but was never included in the Government's trunk road programme.
<P>

<a name="01113w14.html_para0">Responsibility for the scheme passed to South Gloucestershire Council, following local government reorganisation. The Council subsequently carried out a review of a number of major road schemes in their area in the context of current Government transport policy and emerging development plan policies. As a result, they decided in 1999 not to pursue this particular scheme.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what assessment he has made of the implications of EC Directive 94/25/EC on small businesses engaged in the modification, upgrading and conversion to LPG of recreational craft engines.  [137294]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01113w14.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Alan Johnson: </B> 
 No specific assessment has been made at present. EC Directive 94/25/EC on recreational craft (RCD) is principally concerned with the design and construction (in terms of safety) of such craft, as well as certain specified components for incorporation into craft (including fuel tanks and fuel hoses), when they are placed on the market or put into service for the first time in the European Economic Area (EEA). The RCD became mandatory on 16 June 1998. The object of the RCD is to allow the free trade in recreational craft and the specified components, while maintaining a high level of product safety. Any person placing those products on the EEA market, or putting them into use, since that date is obliged to meet the essential safety requirements covering for example hull strength, stability and buoyancy, as well as safety requirements concerned with the installation of the engine, fuel systems and fuel tanks. Meeting the requirements of the RCD and properly applying the CE 



<P>
<P><I>13 Nov 2000 : Column: 497W</I><P>
marking confers the right to sell the craft anywhere in the EEA. Any subsequent modification, upgrading and conversion of a craft, concerned with the engine installation, is not currently within the scope of the RCD unless that modification, upgrading or conversion of the craft was so extensive that it amounted (in effect) to a "new" craft being produced for the purposes of the RCD. However it may be the case that, depending on where the craft is used, local "in use" safety regulations would need to be met as part of or following an engine modification.
<P>

<a name="01113w14.html_para1">The Commission has recently issued a proposal for the modification of the RCD which would (if adopted) include, in particular, requirements related to engine exhaust and noise emissions: the former would include propulsion engines subject to a "major engine modification" and the latter to recreational craft with engines that are subject to a "major craft conversion". Businesses are aware of this proposal but will be consulted as negotiations progress: A regulatory impact assessment is being commissioned. A public meeting has been arranged at the DTI on 15 January 2001, to which interested parties will be invited.

 The DTI commissioned independent tests, published in August, on the use of personal hands-free kits with mobile phones. The tests showed that use of hands-free kit reduced exposure when compared to normal use of the phone.

 It is our objective that the transition from the existing BL network to the new SBS local network should be conducted in such a way as to ensure publicly funded assets continue to be used for the purposes for which they were intended. My officials are working with the organisations concerned in each area to ensure that this outcome is achieved to the greatest possible extent. I do not feel it would be appropriate to comment on the individual commercial negotiations concerned.

<P>
<a name="01113w15.html_spnew0"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 I have today granted consent under section 36 of the Electricity Act 1989 to Conoco Global Power Developments UK Ltd. for the construction of a 475 megawatt gas-fired combined heat and power station at the Conoco Humber Refinery at South Killingholme in North Lincolnshire. The station has also today been given clearance as a gas-fired station under section 14 of the Energy Act 1976 and planning permission for the station has been deemed to be granted subject to 47 planning conditions agreed with the North Lincolnshire Borough Council.
<P>

<a name="01113w15.html_para0">The station will supply the energy requirements of the Conoco Humber Refinery and the Lindsay Oil Refinery and is the largest combined heat and power station given approval by the Government. This demonstrates our continued support to promote CHP stations, wherever practicable, and our commitment to reducing emissions of carbon to fulfil the promises we gave at Kyoto.

 The Joint Environmental Market Unit's (JEMU's) role--working with others such as Trade Partners UK--is to promote the UK's environmental industry's capabilities and to help provide market access to relevant suppliers. JEMU has made good progress in implementing specific initiatives identified in its three year Business Plan, published in 1998. A key achievement has been the development of the first online database of UK environmental capabilities, providing a world wide shop window which enables companies to be contacted directly from one site. Representatives of the UK environmental industry have recently acknowledged JEMU's contribution to trade promotion as being relevant and effective.

 Environmental issues related to the extraction of oil are regulated in the main according to the Offshore Petroleum Production and Pipe-lines (Assessment of Environmental Effects) Regulations 1999. Other environmental legislation such as the Prevention of Oil Pollution Act 1971 also applies. The environmental aspects of oil production are kept under review and it is planned to introduce further legislation to deal with specific aspects.
<P>

<a name="01113w15.html_para3">UK refineries have invested heavily in recent years to meet rising environmental standards, influenced--among other requirements--by the EU's Auto-Oil programme. They are regulated under the Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control regime. All oil-fired Large Combustion Plant will be controlled through the revised EU Large Combustion Plant Directive. In addition, the UNECE Gothenburg Protocol and the proposed EU National Emissions Ceiling Directive will set annual emission ceilings for sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds from 2010.

 The total number of hours spent on Physical Education is not available as the length of the school week varies from school to school. However, recent research by MORI confirms that the most popular out-of-school hours learning activity was participating in sport. It shows that the vast majority of schools have increased their extracurricular activities over the last two years. We have set an aspiration that all schools should provide two hours of curricular or extracurricular activities a week, and we are working to encourage schools and partners in the sports sector to deliver this through the Sports Strategy, an important part of which is promoting team games.

 <i>[holding answer 10 November 2000]:</i> Available data are provided in the table. The Department has funded additional planned higher education places: 36,000 in 1999-2000; 35,000 in 2000-01 and 45,000 in 2001-02. Of these additional places, 7 per cent. were for full-time undergraduates doing first degrees and the rest were for part-time students, post-graduates and students studying for courses below first degree level. Part-time undergraduates, who are mostly mature students, accounted for 57 per cent. of the additional places. Places beyond 2001-02 have not yet been decided. A complete time series is not available, but the table shows the recent trend and the projected impact of additional funded and non-funded places.

 The UK Government does all it can to ensure that goods imported into Iraq under UNSCR 986 are used for agreed purposes. Our experts scrutinise all contracts carefully to ensure that they fall within the terms of the relevant UN resolutions. We frequently discuss monitoring of oil-for-food goods in Iraq with the office of Iraq programme and, where goods are of concern, ask for specific in-country monitoring. Of particular concern are goods identified by UNMOVIC as of potential use in weapons of mass destruction programmes.

 There are no reliable figures on child malnutrition in the centre and south of Iraq. Despite UN efforts, the Iraqi regime has refused to cooperate with a group of independent experts appointed by the UN to prepare a comprehensive report and analysis of the humanitarian situation in Iraq. In the meantime the UK continues to advocate and support initiatives through the oil-for-food programme to better target the UN's humanitarian effort to help the most vulnerable in Iraq. This has already improved the situation on the ground. In northern Iraq, for example, where the UN rather than Iraqi authorities run the humanitarian programme, infant mortality is now lower than before sanctions were imposed.

 In order to make appropriate Winter Fuel Payments to those newly eligible as a result of the changes made to the scheme following the Taylor ruling, we asked that a claims process be developed as a matter of urgency. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State announced details of the claims process on 11 April. In parallel an information campaign--which includes national and regional press advertisements, a telephone helpline, leaflets, posters and the internet--aims to make existing and potential customers aware of the changes and what action, if any, is required.

However, pensioners will also receive a Winter Fuel Payment of &#163;200 this year, which equates to just under &#163;2 a week more than the previous year (when it was &#163;100), and pensioners over age 75 will receive a free TV licence, which is worth a further &#163;2 a week.

<a name="01113w21.html_spnew9"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 We have already introduced measures to bring about improvements in housing benefit administration. Since April, all local authorities have had to set challenging targets to secure year on year improvements in performance standards for housing benefit delivery. Our Housing Green Paper, published in April 2000, set out a range of further proposals for modernising the system. We are currently studying the responses and will announce our decisions shortly.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security what is the basis for payment of allowances by his Department to a person receiving respite in <i>(a)</i> a private and <i>(b)</i> a local authority residential home.  [136793]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01113w22.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Bayley: </B> 
 Entitlement to the income-related benefits for people in care homes depends on whether the person is admitted to a private or local authority home. The difference reflects the funding responsibilities between central and local government for the different types of home. Entitlement may also reflect any need for continuing payment of housing costs in respect of the person's own home during the period of respite care.
<P>

<a name="01113w22.html_para1">Where respite care is publicly funded, Attendance Allowance and the care component of Disability Living Allowance are not payable, to avoid duplication of provision, but no adjustment is generally made for the first 28 days. Where people pay for their own care these benefits are paid as normal.
<P>

<a name="01113w22.html_para2">Most other benefits are not affected by admission to care homes; though a person may have to pay the home for their respite care if privately arranged, or the local authority if that authority has arranged and funded the care.

<P>

<P>
<a name="01113w22.html_spnew9"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 Council tenants are paid by rent rebate. This means their Housing Benefit is credited against their rent account held by the council. Those in the private sector are paid by rent allowance. Payment is made by various means, either to the tenant or, in prescribed circumstances, direct to the landlord. The question of how Housing Benefit is paid was visited in the Housing Green Paper. We are currently studying the consultation responses carefully and will take decisions on how to proceed in the light of them. We expect to announce our decisions in due course.

 The Government are committed to action against hi-tech crime in line with our twin objectives of making the United Kingdom the best and the safest place in the world to conduct and engage in e-commerce.
<P>

<a name="01113w23.html_para2">I am therefore making &#163;25 million available to the police in England and Wales over the next three years to initiate the implementation of a National Hi-Tech Crime Strategy to enhance the capability of law enforcement more effectively to investigate crime where new technology is used.

technology. It is important to ensure that the police have the proper skills and equipment to support them in this new activity.
<P>

<a name="01113w23.html_para4">With those skills the police will, at the local level, be able to deliver improved service to the public to investigate reports of computer-related crime and to recover and analyse computer based evidence. The crimes concerned cover a wide spectrum from hacking and financial fraud to obscenity and the unlawful activities of paedophiles. The work of local units will be complemented by a multi-agency National Hi-Tech Crime Unit that will begin operation in April 2001. The national unit will provide advice and support to local units, and to other law enforcement agencies across the United Kingdom, and deal with the most serious and organised hi-tech crime offences, including those which have a transnational impact.
<P>

<a name="01113w23.html_para5">The Government's commitment to support the development of the capability of law enforcement was made by my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister, when he endorsed the Cabinet Office Performance and Innovation Unit report, "e-commerce@its.best.uk", last summer. That report recommended that the Government improve the technical capability of law enforcement to investigate internet crime and establish an Internet Crime Unit.
<P>

<a name="01113w23.html_para6">On 11 September the Prime Minister published the UKOnline Annual Report. The establishment of a National Hi-Tech Crime Unit was identified as a specific action, part of the Government's commitment to work with industry to ensure a safe and secure environment for e-commerce and to help people trust the internet.
<P>

<a name="01113w23.html_para7">I am pleased that with the support of the Association of Chief Police Officers, the National Criminal Intelligence Service and the National Crime Squad, we are able to make progress towards ensuring that the police both locally and nationally are better trained and equipped to deal with hi-tech crime.

 The Crime and Disorder Act 1998 recognised the key responsibility of the police and the local authority for tackling problems of crime and disorder on a local basis. The Act created the anti-social behaviour order as a powerful community-based measure to assist the police and local authorities in carrying out that responsibility and gave them the power to apply for such orders. The guidance we issued in June emphasises that registered social landlords should play a full and active part in any anti-social behaviour order case involving their tenants.
<P>

<a name="01113w23.html_para9">We have given a commitment to review the operation of anti-social behaviour orders within two years of implementation. The review will start in the new year and its findings and recommendations will be published. The review will cover the current procedures and channels for making an application. The review will specifically consider giving registered social landlords the power to apply for anti-social behaviour orders.

The Human Rights Task Force played an important part in helping public authorities prepare for the Human Rights Act, issuing guidance and publicity materials and raising awareness of the Act among the general public. Financial provision has been made for dealing with challenges based on the Convention rights, especially in the initial period of operation.

 Estimates of the number of crimes per 1,000 population in rural and urban areas can be derived from the 2000 British Crime Survey (BCS). The 2000 BCS interviewed a core random sample of 19,411 adults (those aged 16 and over) living in private households in England and Wales about their experience of crime during 1999.
<P>

<a name="01113w25.html_para2">There is no commonly agreed definition of rural areas. The definition of rural areas used in the BCS is based on those parts of England and Wales falling within A Classification of Residential Neighbourhoods (ACORN) categories 1 to 9, and 27. These categories were developed by CACI Ltd. and classify areas according to the demographic, employment and housing characteristics. They account for an estimated 24 per cent. of the adult population in 1999. Estimated crime rates per 1,000 population are given in table 1. BCS data have been used in this answer, rather than recorded crime data, owing to the better division of rural and urban areas in the BCS.

 <i>[holding answer 6 November 2000]:</i> Police operational experience and various research studies show that Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) has significant crime reduction and detection potential, particularly when used as part of a wider strategy. As with any crime reduction measure, there is a possibility of some displacement, but this is by no means inevitable. Schemes funded under the Crime Reduction Programme CCTV Initiative will be evaluated to build up the knowledge base of what works best in what context. The evaluations will address the issue of displacement.

The application prospectus for the second round was issued in march 2000. It was amended from the first round to give increased emphasis to bids aimed at reducing crime and the fear of crime in rural areas and small community shopping centres where absolute crime levels may be lower, but fear of crime is having a significant adverse effect on local communities.

 It has been the long-standing policy of successive Governments not to comment on issues of national security. It is also an important principle that we do not ordinarily discuss an individual's immigration status. This has been explained to journalists by my Department's Press Office.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many <i>(a)</i> passports and <i>(b)</i> identity documents purported to be issued by an EU member state presented by passengers on arrival in the UK were the subject of inquiries with the authorities of the member state to determine the document's genuineness, and whether issue to the holder was correct, during 1999.  [137290]

<P>
<a name="01113w26.html_spnew10"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 Statistics are not currently compiled for the number of inquiries made with other European Union/ European Economic Area (EU/EEA) member states regarding documents issued by them. The Immigration Service National Forgery Section is the nominated United Kingdom contact point for EU/EEA travel document inquiries. Other Immigration Service offices, however, also make certain unilateral inquiries directly with EU member states via established bilateral liaison contacts. Reference is normally made to these authorities only in a restricted number of cases; for instance, when it cannot be determined that the document is a forgery, or to clarify whether or not a document is a stolen blank whose details have not already been circulated via the nominated national contact point. A new system of recording details of the mutual exchange of such information is currently being put in place.
<P>

<a name="01113w26.html_para1">Comprehensive figures are, however, available for the number of cases of fraudulent passports and identity cards detected by the Immigration Service at United Kingdom ports of arrival during the course of 1999. There were 5,516 such detections, 3,018 of which were non-British EEA documents.

 I have been asked to reply.

<a name="01113w26.html_para3">There are no meaningful average times applicable to claims for criminal injuries compensation. Applications range from the very straightforward ones in which a decision may be issued within a few weeks, through to exceptionally complicated cases in which it may take a number of years for the injury to be fully assessed.
<P>

<a name="01113w26.html_para4">The Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority has, however, been able to provide some information about the percentage of cases settled within various time frames under both the current (tariff) scheme and the former (common law damages) scheme. This is summarised in the table.

<P>
<P><I>13 Nov 2000 : Column: 554W</I><P>

<BR>
The contribution of voluntary workers to GDP is included in the National Accounts where the output of the organisations they work for is estimated as part of market activity. For example, the output of a charity shop, which may be staffed by unpaid volunteers, will be included in the output of retailers, and any profit the shop generates will appear in the income estimate of GDP. However, it is not possible to identify separately where this output that contributes to GDP has been produced by voluntary workers.
<BR>
The System of National Accounts (SNA) makes provision for information on unpaid work to be compiled in a satellite account. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) is currently developing a Household Satellite Account, which will include, amongst other things, an estimate of the volume and value of voluntary work. It is expected that this will be published at the end of 2001.

 We are fully committed to the promotion of breastfeeding, which is uniformly accepted as the best form of nutrition for infants. We also firmly believe that it is important that women and their partners are able to make a fully informed choice on how to feed their babies based on accurate and consistent information. This means that women should have access to information about all infant feeding practices through the relevant health care professional to be confident about the choices they make.
<P>

<a name="01113w29.html_para7">The Infant Feeding Initiative was launched in May 1999 as part of our commitment to improve health inequalities. We have appointed two part-time National Infant Feeding Advisers to act as a focus for developing and implementing strategies for promoting breastfeeding. In particular, their expertise is being utilised to increase the incidence of breastfeeding among groups where breastfeeding rates are lowest, for example, those on low income, and to ensure that all mothers have the information and support they need to make informed infant feeding choices.
<P>

<a name="01113w29.html_para8">We have established the National Network of Breastfeeding Co-ordinators to promote breastfeeding at a local level and to share ideas nationally with a view to increasing both the number of mothers breastfeeding and the length of time they continue to breastfeed. Each year the four United Kingdom Health Departments support National Breastfeeding Awareness Week to increase public awareness of the benefits of breastfeeding, which took place this year from 14-20 May.
<P>

<a name="01113w29.html_para9">We also provide financial support to the four main voluntary organisations in this area, the National Childbirth Trust, La Leche League, Breastfeeding Network and the Association of Breastfeeding Mothers. Close links are also kept with UNICEF's Baby Friendly Initiative (UKBFI) which includes a departmental observer sitting on the Steering Committee of the UKBFI. We offer support for research into breastfeeding through the Quinquennial Surveys of Infant Feeding Practice; a new survey will be undertaken this year. Also, as part of the Department's research initiative on health inequalities, we are supporting a study aimed at identifying the barriers to breastfeeding in low income groups. The Department also receives and publishes expert advice on breastfeeding through its advisory committees.

The report was based on levels of pollutants in 1995. It estimated that the deaths of between 12,000 and 24,000 vulnerable people (mainly those with heart or lung disease) may be brought forward and between 14,000 and 24,000 respiratory hospital admissions and readmissions may be associated with short term exposure to air pollution each year. There was insufficient information to allow quantification of other health effects of air pollution.

<a name="01113w30.html_para0">The main pollutants of concern were particles and ozone. Particle levels have decreased since 1995 but there is no clear downward trend for ozone. The main sources of particles are primary particles from combustion sources (mainly road traffic), secondary particles, mainly sulphate and nitrate formed by chemical reactions in the atmosphere and coarse particles such as dust and biological particles. Ozone arises from chemical reactions of pollutants in the atmosphere in the presence of sunlight. The precursor pollutants include nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds form traffic and industry.

 The Department is continuing to raise awareness of hepatitis C by working with the voluntary sector and others to provide information and advice for the general public and for those groups most at risk, specifically injecting drug users.
<P>

<a name="01113w30.html_para7">Hepatitis C is spread primarily by contact with the blood of an infected person, and injecting drug users are at increased risk of infection. In this country, there is a robust approach to harm minimisation that includes widespread needle exchange schemes and substitute prescribing, both of which encourage people not to inject and not to share injecting drug equipment. We are currently improving the effectiveness and efficiency of these programmes through shared care schemes. Guidance on hepatitis C and strategies to minimise transmission is being developed and will be backed up by regionally based workshops and seminars.
<P>

<a name="01113w30.html_para8">The risk of transmission of hepatitis C via blood donations has been virtually eliminated by the screening of blood donors for antibodies to hepatitis C virus and the treatment of blood products. Organs and tissues for donation are also screened for hepatitis C. The risk of hepatitis C transmission in the clinical setting is minimised by adhering to universal infection control procedures. To emphasise this, guidance has been issued to the National Health Service on minimising the risk of occupationally acquired hepatitis C for health care workers. Guidance on the prevention and control of blood-borne virus infection in renal dialysis units, which includes advice on hepatitis C, is currently being finalised. The Advisory Group on Hepatitis C is currently reviewing its advice on hepatitis C infected health care workers.

 Current information suggests that the prevalence (current level) of chronic carriage of hepatitis C may be around 0.5 per cent. of the general population. The incidence (new infection) of hepatitis C is not known as the virus is usually acquired without symptoms. Data from surveillance of antibody positive hepatitis C laboratory reports in the United Kingdom during the period 1995-99 are set out in the table. These laboratory reports do not distinguish between new and chronic infections, and reflect current laboratory testing patterns. They do not take into account under-reporting and under-ascertainment of cases.

 Our anti-drugs strategy is clear about the benefits of a policy that discourages drug use but also recognises that some people may still use illegal drugs. It is important to minimise the health risks and harm for those who do so.
<P>

<a name="01113w30.html_para10">Data from the drug action team template returns for 1999-2000 show a combined total of 322 statutory and voluntary sector providers of needle exchange services. The directory "Drug Problems: where to get help", published by the voluntary sector organisation Drugscope, lists 124 voluntary and statutory agencies which provide needle exchange facilities for injecting drug misusers. These data are not comparable due to their different methods of collection.
<P>

<a name="01113w30.html_para11">Other measures to minimise the spread of hepatitis C among drug misusers include the prescription of oral substitute medication, and health promotion literature.

 The regional chair considered the names of a number of candidates on the regional register as well as those of serving non-executives from the Rochdale area who were seen to have the necessary qualities for a chair appointment. The candidates subsequently invited for interview included the current chair, Mr. Hermann Jungmayr, but he declined to be interviewed. Two candidates were eventually interviewed, and both their names were recently recommended to Ministers for possible appointment to the post. A decision on the appointment is likely to be made shortly.

Friend the Prime Minister has issued a challenge to employers to give their employees paid time off to work in the community. This Department reacted positively to the challenge to support staff in undertaking voluntary activities. Department of Health staff are allowed a minimum of one day's paid leave per year to undertake voluntary activity. Furthermore, definitions of voluntary activity have been broadened, and managers are encouraged to exercise discretion and be flexible when considering requests for leave from work. We intend to undertake voluntary activity for a day during 2001.

 "Pharmacy in the Future--Implementing the NHS Plan" (a copy of which is in the Library) makes clear that we expect National Health Service hospitals in England to review their pharmacy systems to make them efficient, timely and safe, and more patient focused.
<P>

<a name="01113w33.html_para2">To see that changes are made, NHS Executive regional offices will be rolling out a medicines management performance management framework specifically for hospitals later this year and the Department will be establishing a collaborative programme in order to spread and share best practice. This is likely to include, in appropriate cases, the use of medicines which patients bring into hospital on admission and self-administration schemes on wards (including the use of patient bed-side boxes). Hospitals are also likely to dispense medicines on discharge and to out-patients more frequently in complete original packs. Many such packs are designed by their manufacturers to provide a course of treatment lasting 28 days, although this varies from product to product, and the quantity to be prescribed for any given patient must, of course, reflect their clinical needs.
<P>

<a name="01113w33.html_para3">Re-engineering systems in this way will reduce waste and improve the cost effectiveness of the NHS's spending on medicines generally. It may well involve spending being incurred within hospitals which was previously incurred within primary care. The size of any such shift will vary from place to place depending on current practice and on the nature of new arrangements agreed locally. Work is under way, co-ordinated by NHS Executive regional offices, to ensure that local health commissioners and hospitals work together to ensure suitable funding arrangements are in place.

 The Directive was incorporated into United Kingdom law by The Medicines (Marketing Authorisations etc.) Regulations 1994.
