<p><a name="50316w02.html_spnew5"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 Defra&#039;s aim is sustainable development, ensuring that environmental, social and economic considerations are balanced and integrated. As a result most of the Department&#039;s activities benefit the locations which fall within the growth areas, either directly or indirectly. As well as Defra&#039;s own actions we can achieve a great deal by working with a variety of partners and through exerting influence on Government Departments and others.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50316w02.html_para2">
The key Defra policy areas which have a direct impact on growth areas include waste and recycling initiatives, flood defence works, our wide-ranging rural development programmes and regulation of the water supply industry. Funding associated with these activities has not been exclusively earmarked for growth areas, and will be part of mainstream business delivery, not specifically as a result of growth area status.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50316w02.html_para3">
Delivery is carried out on Defra&#039;s behalf by a number of delivery agents, including the Environment Agency, the Countryside Agency, Government Offices, local authorities, and the Rural Development Service, all of whom have a strong regional focus. We also provide support to regional development agencies, rural community councils, parish and town councils and the voluntary and community sector.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50316w02.html_para4">
Turning to specific policy areas, the priority for flood defence is to optimise the protection of people and the reduction in flood risk as measured by net damages from flooding in relation to the funding available. Total Government spend has risen from &#163;312 million in 1997&#150;98 to &#163;478 million in the current year and &#163;570 million for 2005&#150;06 and the following two years. Where growth areas might have a risk of flooding, in many cases they will already have benefited from investment to protect them to a high standard, e.g. in the Thames Gateway. These defences will be subject to a renewal programme. Where further investment is needed, the development partnerships will consider provision in consultation with the Environment Agency, taking account of Planning Policy Guidance Note 25.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50316w02.html_para5">
The main source of funding for local authority waste management is the Environmental Protection and Cultural Services block of the central Government revenue support grant, which is allocated through the Local Government Finance Settlement using a population-based formula. Defra&#039;s waste performance and efficiency grant, which totals &#163;255 million over the three years from 2005&#150;06, is also allocated to all authorities using a population-based formula.

They undertook a Rapid Assessment, Analysis and Action Planning (RAAAP) exercise in 17 countries in sub-Saharan African countries with high HIV prevalence rates and orphan populations.

The RAAAP exercise consisted of three basic elements: situation analysis, response analysis, and preparation of two-year costed action plans for scaling up responses. Sixteen countries (all except Botswana) presented country profiles and plans to a UNICEF meeting in Cape Town, South Africa, last September. Uganda and Zimbabwe already had long-term plans of action.

<p><a name="50316w04.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Gareth Thomas: </b> 
 The Government of Vietnam have made rapid progress in reducing poverty in recent years and in maintaining a high rate of economic growth. The number of people living in poverty halved from 58 per cent. in 1993 to 29 per cent. in 2002 and economic growth has averaged approximately 7 per cent. per annum over the last 10 years.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50316w04.html_para0">
This progress is a result of the Government of Vietnam&#039;s programme of economic reform and sustained commitment to development and poverty reduction. Recognising that Vietnam is an environment in which aid works, DFID has rapidly increased its programme in Vietnam from &#163;6 million in 2000&#150;01 to an expected spend of &#163;55 million in 2005&#150;06. The DFID programme supports the Government of Vietnam&#039;s own poverty reduction and growth strategy. We work very closely with the Government and other donors to support the reform process and ensure that we achieve the maximum impact from the use of our resources. We co-finance the poverty reduction support credit with eight other donors. Key outcomes of our assistance include helping to define methods to target and reach the poor more effectively, and the development of policies in Vietnam that lead to broad-based growth and poverty reduction.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50316w04.html_para1">
Despite these notable successes, approximately 23 million people still live below the poverty line and an estimated 8.8 million live in hunger. DFID supports rural development programmes in the poorest regions of Vietnam such as the Northern Mountains and Central Highlands. We also support Government targeted poverty reduction programmes that include investments in roads, irrigation, village classrooms, commune health centres and clean water schemes in the poorest communes. In transport, DFID has co-financed a programme that will have built over 2,000 roads linking communes to markets in rural Vietnam by the end of 2005. Evaluations of these road programmes show positive results such as stimulating economic growth and increasing school attendance. In education, we are collaborating with Government and other donors to support the achievement of education for all objectives: 100 per cent. attendance at primary school, and 100 per cent. adult literacy.

Travel by Ministers makes clear that special flights may be authorised when a scheduled service is not available, or when it is essential to travel by air, but the requirements of official or parliamentary business or security considerations or urgency preclude the journey being made by a scheduled service. In respect of overseas travel by Ministers, since 1999 the Government have published an annual list of all visits overseas undertaken by Cabinet Ministers costing &#163;500 or more during each financial year. The list published in 1999 covers the period 2 May 1997 to 31 March 1999. Where RAF/Private Charter aircraft are used this is shown in the list. The Government have also published on an annual basis the cost of all Ministers&#039; visits overseas. Copies of the lists are available in the Libraries of the House. Information for 2004&#150;05 will be published in due course.

On making an application for naturalisation, an officer may continue to serve in the Army for so long as their commission allows. If an officer&#039;s commission

 The United Kingdom is fully committed to and in full compliance with its obligations under the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT), including under Article VI, and has a good record on disarmament. We have reduced the total explosive power of our nuclear forces by over 70 per cent. since the end of the Cold War and in the 1998 Strategic Defence Review we announced that only one Trident submarine would be on deterrent patrol at any one time. That submarine would normally be on several days&#039; notice to fire with its missiles de-targeted. We have conducted studies on the verification of nuclear disarmament since the Review Conference in 2000 and will report the concluding part of our findings to the NPT Review Conference this May. The UK has ratified and continues to support the early entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, and the negotiation of a Fissile Material Cut-Off Treaty without further delay and without preconditions.

Notes:<br>

1. Figures for 2002&#150;03 are not available.<br>

2. Figures for 2003&#150;04 are currently being validated.<br>

3. NHS regions no longer existed from 2001&#150;02. Figures quoted are based on nominal strategic health authority area, even though SHAs did not come into being until the following year.<br>

4. Total expenditure is taken from audited health authority accounts and primary care trust summarisation schedules, which are prepared on a resource basis and therefore differ from cash allocations in the year. The expenditure is the total expenditure by the relevant health authorities, and the commissioner costs of the primary care trusts.<br>

5. Total NHS expenditure cannot be identified by regional or health authority area because the majority of general dental services expenditure is not included in the individual health authority accounts or primary care trust summarisation schedules and is separately accounted for by the Dental Practice Board. The majority of pharmaceutical services expenditure is accounted for by the Prescription Pricing Authority and not by health authorities or primary care trusts.<br>

6. All figures are based on returns submitted by individual NHS organisations. These returns are signed off by the directors of finance of the NHS organisations and audited by auditors appointed by the Audit Commission.<br>

<p><a name="50316w10.html_wqn7"><b> Alan Howarth: </b> 
 To ask the Deputy Prime Minister whether it is his intention in Planning Policy Statement 7 not to preclude approval of applications to build new country houses in any particular architectural style or idiom but to encourage all styles and types provided that the proposals in question are of high quality in terms of design, construction and sustainability; and if he will make a statement.  [222648]</p>




<p><a name="50316w10.html_spnew7"><b> Keith Hill: </b> 
 Planning Policy Statement 7 (PPS7) &quot;Sustainable Development in Rural Areas&quot;, says (paragraph 10) that isolated new houses in the countryside will require special justification for planning permission to be granted. It goes on to say (paragraph 11) that:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;Very occasionally the exceptional quality and innovative nature of the design of a proposed, isolated new house may provide this special justification for granting planning permission. Such a design should be truly outstanding and ground-breaking, for example, in its use of materials, methods of construction or its contribution to protecting and enhancing the environment, so helping to raise standards of design more generally in rural areas. The value of such a building will be found in its reflection of the highest standards in contemporary architecture, the significant enhancement of its immediate setting and its sensitivity to the defining characteristics of the local area.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50316w10.html_para1">
The Government&#039;s intention is not to discourage particular styles and/or types of contemporary architecture which also meet the wider objectives of policy set out in PPS7. The fact that a particular design reflects the evolution of architecture from its historical roots is not of itself a reason to reject a proposal for an isolated new house in the countryside. Indeed, as Planning Policy Statement 1 (PPS1) &quot;Delivering Sustainable Development&quot; makes clear (paragraph 38), Government policy is that local planning authorities (when deciding planning applications) should not attempt to impose architectural styles or particular tastes, or stifle innovation.

None of these three organisations were prepared to accept unpackaged food prepared from fresh ingredients in our own kitchens and the Refreshment Department has minimal levels of wastage of packaged foods. All charities contacted in 2002 concluded that the nature, frequency and unpredictable quantity of food waste from the House of Commons Refreshment Department was unsuitable for their needs, but that they would contact us if their policy changed.

<sup>(14)</sup> The cause of death was defined using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) for England and Wales, and Northern Ireland, from 1997 to 2000, and for deaths in Scotland from 1997 to 1999. The International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) was used to define deaths in England and Wales, and Northern Ireland from 2001 to 2003, and in Scotland from 2000 to 2003. The codes used are listed below:<br>

Cancer (Malignant neoplasms)&#151;ICD-9 140&#150;208; ICD-10 C00-C97.<br>

<sup>(15)</sup> Usual residents of these areas.<br>

<sup>(16)</sup> UK figures include non-residents.<br>

<sup>(17)</sup> The introduction of ICD-10 for coding cause of death means that data for cancer are not completely comparable with data coded using ICD-9. The data should therefore be interpreted with caution. The effect of the change in classification in 2001 on cancer deaths in England and Wales is described in a report published in May 2002.*<br>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what the earliest date is by which the Government expect to have achieved an employment rate equivalent to 80 per cent. of the working age population in work.  [215557]</p>




<p><a name="50316w14.html_spnew0"><b> Jane Kennedy: </b> 
 An employment rate equivalent to 80 per cent. of the working age population in work is a long-term aspiration.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50316w14.html_para0">
This long-term aspiration is very challenging. It will require continued macroeconomic stability and further radical welfare reform to build on the success of achieving the highest employment rate of all the G8 major industrialised countries and one of the highest employment rates in our history.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50316w14.html_para1">
Our five-year strategy, &#039;Opportunity and Security throughout life&#039; outlines how we aim to meet this challenge. With unemployment at low levels helping inactive people into work is crucial to achieving our aspiration. We must:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">support children and families&#151;including helping lone parents into work by making work possible and making work pay</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">help people on incapacity benefits to get the support they need to fulfil their ambitions to return to work</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">break down the barriers that prevent disabled people meeting their desire to move back into work.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50316w14.html_para2">
It will take time to achieve this. Key elements to the strategy will be the reform of incapacity benefit and the equalisation of state pension age from 2010. The principle behind the strategy is to help people to move back into work while still delivering financial security for those who need it.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what guidance he gives to police authorities on the type of behaviour which merits the placing of an antisocial behaviour order (ASBO); and what steps he takes to ensure consistency across different police authorities in their attitude towards ASBOs.  [220364]</p>




<p><a name="50316w18.html_spnew1"><b> Ms Blears </b> 
<i>[holding answer 7 March 2005]:</i> Section 1 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 defines antisocial behaviour in relation to antisocial behaviour orders (ASBOs) as behaviour that
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;caused or was likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress to one or more persons not of the same household&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50316w18.html_para0">
ASBOs were introduced in April 1999. In 2000 the Home Office issued guidance to relevant agencies (including the police) on setting up local ASBO protocols.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50316w18.html_para1">
This guidance was superseded by more detailed guidance issued in November 2002 on ASBOs. That guidance offered some advice on the behaviour that might trigger an application for an ASBO. It advised that the most common behaviour tackled by ASBOs is general loutish and unruly conduct such as verbal abuse, harassment, assault, graffiti and excessive noise. The wide range of antisocial behaviour that can be tackled by ASBOs and the ability to tailor the terms of the order to each specific case illustrates their flexibility.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50316w18.html_para2">
However, ASBOs are just one tool available to tackle antisocial behaviour. Police, local authorities and other agencies need to assess the antisocial behaviour that is occurring and apply the most relevant tool available to them.

The Government acknowledges the need to raise sanction detections performance across all police forces.

Provisional data for 2004&#150;05 shows that this concerted effort has already resulted in performance improvements and we are hopeful that all forces, including the West Midlands, will benefit from this.

A damping mechanism subsequently applied to protect all authorities against financial instability ensures all authorities receive an increase in grant at least equal to the &quot;floor&quot; level on a like-for-like basis year-on-year. Grant floors are an integral part of the finance system.

 There are no specific guidelines given to police authorities regarding investigations into crimes involving members of a police officer&#039;s family.

Note:<br>

Operational capacity is the total number of prisoners that an establishment can hold without serious risk to good order, security and the proper running of the planned regime. Baseline CNA is the sum total of all certified accommodation in an establishment except, cells in punishment or segregation units, healthcare cells or rooms in training prisons and YOIs that are not routinely used to accommodate long stay patients. In-use CNA is baseline CNA less those places not available for immediate use, for example: damaged cells, cells affected by building works, and cells taken out of use due to staff shortages<br>

 We are deeply shocked by the brutal killing of eight unarmed civilians. Our Embassy in Bogota has spoken to the judicial authorities and to Colombian Government representatives at the highest level to express our concerns regarding these killings. Luis Eduardo Guerra was a highly respected member of the Colombian NGO community and well known to our Embassy. I met him during my visit to Colombia in 2004. I welcome the Colombian Government&#039;s assurances that there will be an impartial, swift and effective investigation into these murders. Officials from the human rights unit in the Attorney-General&#039;s office, as well as forensic specialists and other officials, are in the area where the killings happened and are carrying out their investigation. This process includes interviews with members of the Peace Community, as well as all local army units, to try and establish the facts. We have also stressed to the Colombian authorities the need for proper protection to be given to witnesses of the crimes and of human rights defenders following the case. The Colombian authorities have assured us that such protection will be available to anyone who needs it. We continue to closely monitor the situation. Those responsible, whoever they may be, must be brought to justice.

 Human rights lie at the heart of our policy towards Colombia. We regularly raise with the Colombian Government specific human rights cases. Through our Embassy in Bogota, we monitor the human rights situation in Colombia, keeping in close contact with the Colombian authorities. I have highlighted the importance we attach to human rights with President Uribe and other senior Colombian officials during my visits to Colombia in 2003, 2004 and during my most recent visit last month. I reinforced this again when I met Defence Minister Uribe here in London on 11 February. We continue to urge the Colombian Government to implement all outstanding recommendations by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights. We have also made it plain that the armed forces must act in accordance with human rights and international humanitarian law, and have provided funding for training in these areas. Where members of the armed forces are proven to have committed human rights abuses they must be punished in accordance with the law. Impunity must not be allowed, a message we have also reiterated to the Colombians.

<p><a name="50316w25.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. MacShane: </b> 
 The recent report from the Office of the High Commissioner on Human Rights (OHCHR) on business and human rights notes that the UN Norms have the status of a &quot;draft proposal&quot;. Therefore, the draft Norms have no formal or legal role in setting governance standards for business. However, through the Business Leaders&#039; Initiative on Human Rights (BLIHR), a number of multinational companies have been &quot;road-testing&quot; the draft Norms, using the content to inform their codes of practice. This process will continue until December 2006. In addition, the FTSE4Good benchmark takes the draft Norms into account in its assessment of companies&#039; performance. And some potential investors consider the draft Norms in their requirement for &quot;human rights impact assessments&quot;.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50316w25.html_para0">
The UK continues to play a constructive role in the debate on corporate responsibility and human rights. While we see merit in clarifying minimum standards for business in relation to human rights, we believe, as does the OHCHR, that future action on this agenda should take into account the many codes and initiatives which exist in this field, rather than focussing exclusively on the draft Norms. These include the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development Guidelines on Multinational Enterprises, the International Labour Organisation Tripartite Declaration of Principles concerning Multinational Enterprises and Social Policy and the UN Global Compact.

<p><a name="50316w26.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Alexander: </b> 
 Following the takeover of power by the King on 1 February I summoned the Nepalese ambassador to express our grave concern at developments. I also issued a public statement in which I set out our concern that the King&#039;s actions would increase the risk of instability in Nepal and undermine the institutions of democracy and constitutional monarchy in the country. In that statement I called for the immediate restitution of multi-party democracy. A copy of my statement is available on the Foreign and Commonwealth Office website www.fco.gov.uk/policy/news/press-releases. Our ambassador in Kathmandu raised these issues directly with the King in an audience on 8 February.

The UK also issued a statement with EU partners highlighting our concerns about restrictions on liberty and calling for human rights to be respected. With other EU member states&#039; ambassadors our ambassador in Kathmandu also raised them with the new Nepalese Foreign Minister on 7 February.

Such is the level of our concern that on 14 February my right hon.

Our ambassador has now returned to Nepal and will be seeking an early audience with the King to encourage him again to restore fundamental rights and release party leaders from detention as a first step towards restoring democracy and democratic process.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs if he will list the nuclear weapons in the United Kingdom stockpile which have been <i>(a)</i> withdrawn from service and <i>(b)</i> dismantled, (i) unilaterally and (ii) as a result of multilateral negotiations pursuant to United Kingdom obligations under Article six of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.  [221447]</p>




<p><a name="50316w26.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. MacShane: </b> 
 The UK has unilaterally withdrawn and dismantled all its nuclear weapons except those currently in service. We are the only nuclear weapon state to have reduced our capacity to one nuclear weapon system, Trident, and retain a stockpile of less than 200 operationally available warheads. There have been no multilateral negotiations to withdraw and dismantle nuclear weapons as part of the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT) process. However, alongside the important unilateral steps already referred to, we have pursued the practical steps agreed by States Parties to the Treaty for the systematic and progressive efforts to implement Article VI of the NPT.

<p><a name="50316w26.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Rammell: </b> 
 The Government recognise the positive and distinct contribution that women can make to post-conflict stabilisation. The new inter-departmental Post-Conflict Reconstruction Unit (PCRU) has been asked to develop a capacity to identify best practice in gender-related issues and to consider gender-sensitive approaches in its planning and deployment.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50316w26.html_para4">
As part of its recent public consultation process, PCRU sought the advice of groups representing gender issues in conflict, including Widows for Peace and Democracy and Women Waging Peace. PCRU will now produce a report drawing together the results of the public consultation which will show how contributions, including those on gender, have shaped the establishment of the unit. The report is likely to propose that permanent consultation mechanisms are established to ensure that PCRU continue to receive external advice and opinions on issues such as gender.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50316w26.html_para5">
The PCRU will continue to develop its capacity through close consultation with civil society groups and the Women&#039;s National Commission&#151;the Government&#039;s non- departmental advisory body on women&#151;to ensure that gender is mainstreamed in post-conflict strategies. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office will assist by providing country-specific advice as PCRU plans for deployments and briefing on UK Government work on women and conflict in international fora, such as UN Security Council Resolution 1325 on women, peace and security.

<i>[holding answer 15 March 2005]:</i> As the legislation was only passed on 14 March, its impact has scarcely been felt. Much will depend on the reaction of others and how China seeks to apply it.

<p>
<a name="50316w26.html_para6">
However, there is a risk that its introduction will slow or reverse the recent signs of progress in the relationship between China and Taiwan. We have made these concerns known to the Chinese and continue to watch developments closely. We continue to call on both sides to avoid unilateral actions which might heighten tensions. Although China has stressed its desire for a peaceful resolution of the issue, we are concerned that the legislation makes reference to the possibility of the use of &quot;non-peaceful means&quot;. We strongly oppose the use of force and believe that the Taiwan question should be settled peacefully through negotiation between the people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait.
