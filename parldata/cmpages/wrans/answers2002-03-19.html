 The pilot was launched on 1 October 2001. It is testing whether holding Court of Protection hearings locally for contested matters and fund management benefits parties by reducing the time, cost and anxiety involved in attending court. A full evaluation report will be available by the end of April 2002, but early indications are that local hearings will prove to be more convenient to parties, their families and their legal representatives. If successful, the Lord Chancellor will consider extending the scheme to other parts of England and Wales.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20319w02.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 Under Scots Law a maintenance agreement can be drawn up by means of a Minute of Agreement. (This is an agreement entered into by two or more people, usually drawn up before a solicitor). If there is a clause of consent for registration in the Books of Council and Session and sheriff court, this can then be transferred under section 18 of the Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Act 1982.




<P>

<P>

<a name="20319w02.html_para1">Section 18 of the Civil Jurisdiction and Judgments Act 1982 deals with cross border judgments in the UK. In this section "judgment" can mean any document which in Scotland has been registered for execution in the Books of Council and Session or in the sheriff court books kept for any Sheriffdom. If a Minute of Agreement has been registered for execution, this can therefore be transferred to the appropriate court in England under that section.
<P>

<a name="20319w02.html_para2">An individual who is in possession of a Minute of Agreement, that has not been registered, has another option. For example, if a party did not subsequently adhere to the obligations stated in the minute, the other party would be able to present the Minute of Agreement to the appropriate court in Scotland and request that a maintenance order is granted. In the event that an order was granted, it could be transferred to another part of the UK under section 16(2)(b) of the Maintenance Orders Act 1950.
<P>

<a name="20319w02.html_para3">An order made in a Scottish court, in relation to either spousal or child maintenance can be transferred to the appropriate court in England for registration and enforcement under section 16(2)(b) of the Maintenance Orders Act 1950.

 To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what role Community Legal Services Partnerships play in combating social exclusion.  [42355]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20319w03.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 By planning and co-ordinating local help and advice and by developing referral systems, Community Legal Service Partnerships are improving access to good quality legal services, so bringing valuable help and assistance to many of society's most vulnerable groups and individuals. In so doing they act as a valuable mechanism with which to help combat social exclusion. Through their growing involvement in Local Strategic Partnerships, representatives from Community Legal Service Partnerships are also able to ensure that legal and advice services play a central role within local community strategies to promote neighbourhood renewal.

<a name="20319w03.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Wills: </B> 
 I have assessed the implementation of similar legislation in some other countries from various published materials. In summary, other countries have implemented their freedom of information legislation within different time scales. The Canadian federal freedom of information legislation was enacted in June 1982 and came into force in July 1983. The New Zealand Official Information Act was enacted in December 1982 and came into force in July 1983. However, these countries were able to implement their Acts over a shorter time scale than is proposed in the United Kingdom because of the more limited scope of their legislation. The Canadian Act applies only to information held by Government Departments and most Government agencies, roughly 150 bodies, while the New Zealand legislation applies only to central Government. In contrast, the Freedom of Information Act 2000 will apply to approximately 70,000 bodies across the whole of the public sector. The Irish Act was signed into law in April 1997. It will eventually have roughly the same scope as the United Kingdom Act, although generally it is not retrospective in effect unlike the UK Act. It has been rolled out on an incremental basis from April 1998 onwards and it is likely that their implementation period will be longer than the time taken to fully implement the UK Act. The duties on public authorities under the Freedom of Information Act will come into effect in

stages from November 2002 to January 2005 and the Act will be fully in force 11 months ahead of the statutory deadline.

 The Government acknowledge the valuable contribution the report 'Making Contact Work' will make in addressing this difficult and sensitive area. The report makes a large number of recommendations, including some which would require legislative changes, on the facilitation and enforcement of contact between children and a parent who no longer lives with them. The Government are considering the proposals very carefully and will publish their response in due course. The Government remain committed to the principle that the welfare of the child must be paramount in any decision-making concerning a child's future, including decisions relating to contact.

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what contingency plans she has made to deal with the consequences of the elections in Zimbabwe.  [43664]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20319w08.html_spnew8"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 We are very concerned about the future for ordinary Zimbabweans. The election outcome is likely to accelerate poverty and hunger. The UK is working with key stakeholders and the international community to urge policy changes on the part of the Zimbabwe Government to halt the catastrophic decline in agriculture, the economy, and social services. In parallel, we continue to provide humanitarian assistance for the vulnerable, and to address the HIV/AIDS epidemic that affects one in three adults in Zimbabwe.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20319w08.html_spnew9"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 DFID does not provide any aid that is targeted specifically at the Congolese Banyamulenge community in Burundi. DFID has provided &#163;350,000 to the British Red Cross to assist Congolese refugees in Tanzania, which include some Banyamulenge. We have also provided about &#163;1 million in general humanitarian assistance to programmes in Burundi itself during this financial year. The UK continues to support the full implementation of the Arusha and Lusaka Peace Accords to achieve a lasting peace in the region.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20319w08.html_spnew10"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 DFID's aim is the elimination of poverty in poorer countries. Discrimination and marginalisation is frequently a cause of poverty, and we are seeking to ensure that poor people are consulted on policies and decisions that affect them and are aware of their rights. By adopting such an approach, we aim to promote social justice, including tackling discrimination against indigenous people and ethnic minorities.

 Around &#163;840 million in new commitments was made to Africa last year. Of this approximately 27 per cent. was allocated to projects in support of sustainable rural livelihoods.

 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for International Development has not made any representations to UNESCO about the Kalahari. UNESCO has a strong interest in supporting San communities across Southern Africa, and DFID has co-operated with UNESCO in supporting the South African San institute.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20319w09.html_spnew2"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 The UK provides no assistance directly to the Kalahari bushmen. In the financial year 2000&#150;01 the Department for International Development provided about &#163;2 million to Botswana, for activities in education, governance, health and livelihoods creation.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20319w09.html_spnew3"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 In 1996&#150;7 the UK provided &#163;425,000 for a capacity building programme in the Government of Botswana's Department of Wildlife and National Parks. The project lasted one year. The European Union is the only multilateral donor assisting in this area, and has committed over 20 million euro to wildlife conservation since 1997.

 The companies that have provided timber and wood products over the last five years are listed. The amounts given are in some cases estimated, as the companies supply a range of products, not all of which are timber and wood, and a precise breakdown is not available.

The most recent visit was by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence to RAF Menwith Hill on 5 July 2001. Prior to this, RAF Menwith Hill was visited by my right hon. Friend the Member for Warley (Mr. Spellar), the then Minister of State for the Armed Forces, on 24 January 2000, and my noble Lord (Lord Gilbert) the then Minister for Defence Procurement, visited RAF Fairford on 3 June 1999.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20319w09.html_spnew9"><B> Dr. Moonie </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 18 March 2002]:</i> The reference in the report relates to a support contract for the Rapier FSB2 guided weapon system. This contract has been in place since April 2000. Savings of approximately &#163;134,000 were achieved in the first year and similar levels of savings are expected throughout the remainder of the contract. Of equal importance is the increase in availability of the equipment system as a result of this contract.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what savings have accrued to his Department from the use of incentives in the MOD's food supply contract that require the contractor to seek improved value for money on behalf of the Department.  [44217]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20319w09.html_spnew10"><B> Dr. Moonie </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 18 March 2002]:</i> The decision to contractorise Ministry of Defence food supply is estimated to be saving &#163;13 million per year compared to previous arrangements. This is as a direct result of employing the contractor's commercial buying power to secure best value for money in the marketplace. The contractor does not profit from the cost of food supplied to the MOD and prices are subject to regular, independent, benchmarking. In addition to these savings the contractor's operating costs, on which the contractor does earn profit, are constrained through the use of a contracted Target Cost Incentive arrangement, under which annualised cost under- runs are shared. We are currently in negotiation over the precise amount accrued.

 The allocation of resources within the Ministry of Defence is carried out in accordance with agreed priorities and objectives. We take into account many issues, including predicted efficiency savings. These are not managed separately and we therefore do not track how they are reinvested.

<P>
<UL>(2) which single efficiency measures have resulted in annual savings of over <i>(a)</i> &#163;500,000, <i>(b)</i> &#163;1 million and <i>(c)</i> &#163;5 million.  [44223]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20319w09.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Ingram </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 18 March 2002]:</i> Efficiency savings are achieved by each area of the Ministry of Defence and of the services reviewing its business and identifying ways in which it might operate more efficiently and effectively.

 The Ministry of Defence legal advisers are currently considering whether extant legislation for the current Armed Forces Pension Scheme (AFPS) could be amended or if primary legislation would be the most effective means of implementing a new scheme. The timescale for implementation is expected to be determined by factors such as the introduction of a new joint personnel administration system which would provide the IT framework for the pension scheme and for the closely associated systems for personnel data. This system is scheduled for introduction from late 2004 onwards, and we are hoping to introduce the new pension scheme around 2005&#150;06, subject to IT and legislative requirements.

 <i>[holding answer 18 March 2002]:</i> Early on the morning of 16 February, an Observation Post manned by members of 2nd Battalion, the Parachute Regiment, reported coming under fire from as-yet-unidentified gunmen. The soldiers returned fire. At first light, a joint patrol with the Afghan Interim Authority Police was despatched to the area for follow-up action. In the vicinity of the incident, they discovered a car that had suffered damage from gunfire. On further investigation, they found in a nearby house one dead and four injured people and a new-born baby. The injured were taken to hospital. Their injuries were not life threatening.
<P>

<a name="20319w10.html_para0">The Afghan Interim Authority Police are investigating this incident, with support from members of the Royal Military Police (RMP). The Afghan police have retained any evidence that they wish to and the RMP have retained other items, including the car that had been fired upon. Before the investigation is complete it would not be appropriate to comment further on details of the incident.
<P>

<a name="20319w10.html_para1">The press were briefed at the time in Kabul and have been updated as necessary by the Ministry of Defence press office. Other troop-contributing nations of ISAF were informed of the incident along the same lines as the press.
<P>

<a name="20319w10.html_para2">In accordance with standard procedure, the two soldiers involved in the incident were withdrawn from the area of operations. Until the RMP investigation is completed, the question of disciplinary proceedings does not arise.
<P>

<a name="20319w10.html_para3">ISAF have held informal meetings with the family of the deceased man who understand that the investigation is continuing.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20319w11.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Engineers play a vital role within the armed forces. Training is accredited where appropriate with the relevant national awarding bodies. The successful Royal Navy engineering sponsorship scheme at Southampton university is shortly to be expanded to other universities and, to maintain the high quality of our technical officer intake across Defence as a whole, will include Army and RAF officers as well. A proportion of engineering graduates are selected each year to undertake a MSc; the number depends on the operational requirement. The holders of such higher degrees can apply for chartered status. Registration costs and the first year's membership fee are granted on a case by case basis to those whose posts require such status. However, the Engineering Technology Board, which recently superseded the Engineering Council, has revised the guidance for registration. As a result, for the majority of engineering posts in the armed forces, incorporated engineer status is more appropriate than chartered engineer.

 Further to my answer of 17 December to my hon.

<P>

<a name="20319w12.html_para1">Tested across ten central government departments, the information gathered from the e-tendering pilot scheme has provided valuable experience and knowledge. In the light of the fact that the pilot did not fully meet all its operational objectives, the Government will not roll out the scheme.

Plans for adopting this technology will be announced later this year.

The most significant type that remains exempt after three months is industrial property such as factories, warehouses, and mineral workings. Other types of property which remain exempt are: listed buildings; buildings with rateable values of less than &#163;1,900; buildings which the owners are prohibited by law from occupying or which are kept vacant by the actions of a public body; and buildings whose owners are either bankrupts, or are insolvent companies which are being wound up.

<a name="20319w13.html_para5">Under the Local Government Finance Act 1988 various reliefs are available to ratepayers.

 The Spring Supplementary Estimates were revised in order to allow provision for short-term financial support of up to &#163;30 million to the National Air Traffic Services, as referred to in my right hon.

<P>

<a name="20319w14.html_para0">As a consequence the revised Spring Supplementary Estimates differ from the Spring Supplementary Estimates as follows: the introduction includes a new sub-paragraph xlvi; the ambit of RfR2 has been revised; the total capital expenditure figure at Part II has been increased; column 7 of RfR2 section C has been increased with consequent changes to the totals in the revised subhead detail section, the resource to cash reconciliation table and the forecast cash flow statement; and a note has been added recording that the expenditure rests on the sole authority of the Appropriation Act.

<P>
<a name="20319w14.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 I am announcing today the names of 24 authorities in England which, on a voluntary basis and subject to the approval of their tenants, should be able to proceed with proposals to carry out 26 transfers of all or part of their stock to registered social landlords. I have today placed 15 proposals on the transfer programme while holding a place open for a further 11 transfers. Together the programme could involve over 180,000 dwellings in large scale voluntary transfers over two years.
<P>

<a name="20319w14.html_para2">Authorities on the 2002 Programme have decided, with their tenants, to pursue housing stock transfer as their vehicle for reaching by 2010 the Government's Decent Homes Target. They will have made this decision after considering the various options for reaching the target. Housing transfer enables the new landlords to obtain increased investment from private sources to carry out any backlog of repairs and subsequent improvements more quickly than if the properties had remained in local authority ownership. Housing transfer can also bring about higher levels of tenant involvement, ensuring housing services meet tenants' needs and preferences. It can also provide a significant boost to the wide-scale regeneration of the surrounding area. Over time, tenants' rents will be similar to what they would pay to their local authority, due to the Government's policy of bringing greater fairness and coherence to the structure of social rents.
<P>

<a name="20319w14.html_para3">Housing transfers are voluntary and may only take place if tenants are in favour. The consent of the Secretary of State is also required before a transfer can proceed and that will only be granted if it appears that a majority of tenants wish the transfer to proceed.
<P>

<a name="20319w14.html_para4">Proposals submitted for the 2002 Programme have been of high quality. However some are not as advanced as we would wish to secure a place immediately. Therefore Copeland, Teignbridge, Middlesbrough and the London boroughs of Hackney (Kings Crescent) and Islington (Tollington Estates) have been asked to develop their transfer proposals further. I am also holding open places on the programme for Cannock Chase, Nuneaton and Bedworth, Sheffield, Southwark (Tabard Gardens Estate), Solihull, and Worcester pending the agreement of valuations with them.
<P>

<a name="20319w14.html_para5">The authorities that have successfully gained places on the programme, together with the intended recipient RSL, are as follows:

 Parish councillors are currently expected to observe a National Code of Local Government Conduct, issued in 1990. The code is for guidance, although Section 94 of the Local Government Act 1972 provides that if a person should fail to declare a pecuniary interest they may be liable to prosecution and, if convicted, fined up to &#163;200 for each offence.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions what the expected annual investment spending this year is by London Underground; and what the figure was in 1996&#150;97.  [41293]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20319w15.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 London Underground is currently forecasting that it will deliver investment expenditure of &#163;422 million in 2001&#150;02, against a Government target of at least &#163;410 million. The equivalent investment figure for investment in the core underground network in 1996&#150;97 at cash prices was &#163;397 million.
<P>

<a name="20319w15.html_para1">Capital renewals accounted for &#163;198 million of the &#163;397 million expenditure in 1996&#150;97. The estimated investment expenditure for 2001&#150;02 reflects London Underground Ltd.'s adoption in 1999 of Financial Reporting Standard (FRS) 15, which requires that such expenditure must now either be charged to cost of operations, or capitalised as an addition to fixed assets.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20319w16.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 A competent harbour authority has a duty under section 2 of the Pilotage Act 1987 to keep under consideration whether any and, if so, what pilotage services need to be provided to secure the safety of ships navigating in or in the approaches to its harbour.

<P>
<P>

 The legislative authority of the code comprises the legal duties and powers of harbour authorities relating to marine safety. It was agreed with the representative bodies with whom the code was developed that it did not need to create new legal duties for harbour authorities, and it has been implemented without the Government having to take&#151;or confer on harbour authorities&#151;any new powers for that purpose.

<P>
<a name="20319w16.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The Sangatte centre did not close, nor did the nearby rail freight terminal at Fr&#233;thun operated by SNCF (the French railway company). Rail freight services to the UK through the channel tunnel are however currently severely disrupted as a result of the actions of would-be illegal immigrants trying to board the trains at Fr&#233;thun. SNCF are currently not accepting new traffic bound for the UK through the tunnel, while the backlog of trains in transit is cleared.
<P>

<a name="20319w16.html_para0">We are continuing to press the French Government at the highest levels to ensure that sufficient police resources are made available as soon as possible to enable the normal level of freight services to resume, free from disruption.

<P>
<a name="20319w16.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The Government are a strong supporter of the Single European Sky as we consider that it offers the best route to overcoming delays and congestion caused by the structural problems in Europe's Air Traffic Management (ATM) system. It should also improve safety, and provide the necessary framework for future air traffic growth.

[43862]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20319w16.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 There are no statutory requirements for airport operators with regard to waiting times for passengers passing through security and ticket checks. 20 UK airports and 10 UK airlines have, however, signed up to the Voluntary Commitments on Air Passenger Rights, which were launched at a Council of Europe ceremony in Strasbourg on 14 February. These contain non-legally binding commitments to deliver defined standards of service to air travellers, and waiting times and measures to speed up check-in are included within them.

 In 2001 the Government commissioned the Building Research Establishment Ltd. to undertake a review of the current state of research in a number of key areas of the aircraft cabin environment. BRE reported that some research has been carried out into the effects of cabin air ventilation rates on the health of passengers, but the report identified a number of areas where further research was needed. The inter-departmental Aviation Health Working Group is expected shortly to finalise a proposal for some of this work to be carried out.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions if he will undertake an assessment of the extent to which pilots reduce air flow in passenger aircraft cabins and the reasons for doing so; and if he will issue guidelines on this issue.  [43684]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20319w16.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 It is normal for air conditioning packs to be in operation during a flight. This is reflected in the manufacturers' instructions to crews and repeated in operators' manuals. On many aircraft it is possible to reduce the flow to a low setting, which is about 80 per cent. of the normal flow rate. However, there would be clear guidance in the operating manual that this setting should only be used when the aircraft is carrying significantly fewer passengers than the maximum. Figures would be specified.
<P>

<a name="20319w16.html_para1">In the event of a problem with an air conditioning pack in flight, the problem pack can be switched off. The remaining pack(s) have the capacity to maintain cabin pressure and adequate conditioned air.
<P>

<a name="20319w16.html_para2">In these circumstances the issuance of guidelines is not necessary.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions if he will publish the letter dated 8 January from HM Inspector of the Health and Safety Executive to the General Manager, NATS(En-Route)Ltd., concerning breaches of the Display Screen Equipment Regulations 1992.  [43060]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20319w16.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B>

<P>
<P>
<a name="20319w16.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 HSE inspectors and HSE's expert on display screen equipment visited the new en-route centre at Swanwick on 18 January. The purpose of this visit was to begin assessing NATS (En-Route) Limited's compliance with the Display Screen Equipment Regulations 1992. Since the visit NATS have provided HSE with further information about the display screen equipment in use at the Swanwick centre and this has been used to complete HSE's assessment of compliance. HSE's expert took BSEN 29241&#150;3/ISO 9241&#150;3 into account in making the assessment.

[43064]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20319w16.html_spnew14"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 HSE's inspectors considered the working conditions at Swanwick against the Health and Safety Commission's expectations for enforcement and did not consider it appropriate to serve an enforcement notice. Therefore there is no question of a notice being withdrawn.
<P>

<a name="20319w16.html_para3">HSE wrote to NATS on the 18 January summarising its concerns. HSE's expert on display screen equipment is finalising a detailed report on his findings. HSE will present that report to the management and employees' representatives at NATS shortly, and will require an action plan to address any matters which are outstanding at that time within an appropriate timescale.

Special purpose vehicles are a potential option for taking forward projects involving new or enhanced rail infrastructure.

 I welcome this report, copies of which have been placed in the Library of the House. It demonstrates that it should be possible to make real improvements to capacity and access&#151;particularly for disabled people&#151;without the need to rebuild Wembley Park Station.
<P>

<a name="20319w17.html_para0">While the report's proposals are significantly less expensive than rebuilding the station, they cannot be accommodated within the &#163;20 million which the Government have already agreed to make available for infrastructure improvements. In the light of this new evidence, I have now decided that if the stadium development proceeds, I should make available additionally up to &#163;7 million from my transport provision. This would make it easier for people travelling to the new stadium, as well as those living and working in the area. I understand that the Mayor of London has also agreed to make available a similar sum.

 The Government are committed to introducing a national licensing scheme for houses in multiple occupation (HMOs) and we consulted on our proposals in 1999. We remain committed to legislating for this at the earliest possible opportunity.

There is no Government-led study into such a link road but there is a wider local authority study currently taking place. This work includes a variety of separate work streams looking at the regeneration potential for the port area, and the feasibility of facilitating much of the future potential for local and port development.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20319w18.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Darling: </B> 
 The Department for Work and Pensions was set up last year to bring together the Government's Welfare to Work programme and to ensure a far better focus on the people we serve. As part of this programme of reform, I am setting up two new executive agencies in April: Jobcentre Plus, which will deliver an integrated, work-focused service to benefit claimants of working age and to employers; and The Pension Service, which will deliver a service dedicated to today's and tomorrow's pensioners.
<P>

<a name="20319w18.html_para2">In consequence of these changes, the Benefits Agency and the Employment Service will close on 31 March. The Department's other executive agencies (the Child 



<P>
<P><I>19 Mar 2002 : Column 240W</I><P>
Support Agency and The Appeals Service) will continue. Disability and carer benefits will be delivered by a distinct business&#151;the Disability and Carers Service&#151;which will work closely with both Jobcentre Plus and The Pension Service. The Child Benefit Centre will form a separate business until its transfer to the Inland Revenue in April 2003.
<P>

<a name="20319w18.html_para3">The targets I have set Jobcentre Plus and The Pension Service for 2002&#150;03 are given below.
<P>

<a name="20319w18.html_para4">Further information on Jobcentre Plus and The Pension Service plans for 2002&#150;03 is contained in their business plans, copies of which have been placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="20319w18.html_para5">I am also publishing today a departmental framework which sets out the main roles and accountabilities of each part of the Department, including its executive agencies, and the shared values and ways of working which ensure that the Department delivers a common agenda of reform. The framework incorporates the roles of each of the Department's executive agencies and replaces traditional free-standing agency framework documents.

 Retailing was originally included in the small firms loan guarantee scheme. Along with a number of other local service sectors it was excluded in April 1993.

Details of its functions, staffing and funding are set out in "British Trade International, The Government's Expenditure Plans 2001&#150;02 to 2003&#150;04 and Main Estimates 2001&#150;02", Cm 5123, a copy of which has been placed in the Libraries of the House.

<a name="20319w19.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B>

<P>
<P>
<a name="20319w20.html_spnew2"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 Following careful consideration of the Director-General of Fair Trading's review of the beer orders and taking into account the views of all interested parties, including those of micro-breweries, I decided that the beer orders are no longer relevant to the industry as it is currently structured. The provision on guest beers applied only to large brewers with tied estates. No such brewer now exists. Revocation will impose no costs on business and is deregulatory, so a regulatory impact assessment is unnecessary.

[34599]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20319w20.html_spnew8"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 In the case of <i>(a)</i>, the procedure that would apply would be the staff disciplinary procedure of the school in question. In general, misusing a school computer in this way would constitute very serious or gross misconduct, and could possibly result in dismissal. Where applicable the school's procedure may be deferred pending the outcome of criminal proceedings.
<P>

<a name="20319w20.html_para3">In the case of <i>(b)</i> the normal disciplinary procedure would be for the head teacher to consider all the relevant facts and such evidence as may be available to support the allegation made, allowing the student to give his or her version of events. If the head teacher is satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the student did what he or she is alleged to have done, he or she may exclude the student for a fixed period or permanently. Misuse of computers by students to view pornographic material is a very serious matter and exclusion for a fixed period or permanently would be an appropriate response to such behaviour.
<P>

<a name="20319w20.html_para4">We are, however, also determined to help schools ensure that teachers and pupils do not access unsuitable material while accessing the wealth of educationally valuable material on the internet.

 An interim evaluation report collecting baseline information from the phase 1 wired up communities pilot in Kensington (Liverpool) was produced in September 2001. Further data collection activities in the six phase 2 projects are currently taking place. The final evaluation report was due to have been published in April 2002 but delays in some projects becoming operational has put the expected publication back to November 2002.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what information she has collated on the number of schools which make provision for access to drinking water throughout the school day.  [42694]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20319w22.html_spnew4"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 The Education (School Premises) Regulations 1999 require all schools to have a wholesome supply of drinking water. The Department for Education and Skills does not collect information about pupils' access to drinking water throughout the school day.
<P>
<P>
<a name="20319w22.html_wqn5"><B> Ms Walley: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what guidance she has issued in respect of access throughout the school day to drinking water.  [42677]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20319w22.html_spnew5"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 The Department for Education and Skills (DfES) produced guidance in April 2001, to assist school caterers to implement nutritional standards for school lunches. This guidance states that the Secretary of State expects that drinking water should be available to all pupils, every day, free of charge.
<P>

<a name="20319w22.html_para1">The DfES circular, 0029/2000 (Standards for School Premises), gives advice on health and safety matters that schools should consider when positioning drinking water outlets. It also recommends that the pattern of demand for drinking water outlets should be considered by local education authorities, governing bodies and others when deciding how drinking water should be provided on school premises.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what funding there is to meet the costs of the installation of drinking water supply to schools in Stoke on Trent, North; and if she will make a statement.  [42695]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20319w22.html_spnew6"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 All schools are required to have a wholesome supply of drinking water. As this is a fundamental requirement for all school premises and should be installed when they are built, there is no specific capital funding available. We expect governing bodies and local education authorities to secure a continuing wholesome water supply to all schools as part of their duty to secure the health and safety of staff and pupils, and are sure that this is an important consideration for local education authorities in considering how to distribute capital funding.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20319w22.html_spnew7"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 The Department for Education and Skills has not conducted any surveys of access to, and availability of, drinking water in schools. It is for local education authorities, governors and schools to decide how and when drinking water should be made available to pupils.

<P>
<a name="20319w22.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 There are approximately 1,090 learning support units in schools in England. We plan to increase this total further as independent evaluation of LSUs shows that they improve behaviour and cut exclusions. Phase 3 of Excellence in Cities and the Excellence Cluster programme should provide another 140 LSUs and up to 50 more outside the Excellence in Cities programme will be set up shortly.

<P>
<P>

 To date, the Computers Within Reach scheme has cost just under &#163;5.5 million, leaving &#163;9.5 million of Capital Modernisation Funding (CMF) for a further phase or alternative scheme.
<P>

<a name="20319w22.html_para2">An external research evaluation has been carried out and the final report was received recently. This indicates the scheme successfully reached target groups and contributed positively to increased use of ICT among recipients and their families.
<P>

<a name="20319w22.html_para3">This report has contributed to our overall evaluation of the scheme and future policy will take this into consideration as well as the value for money of recycled computers compared with new ones and the technical and logistical issues that affect the recycled computer market.

 My Department has encouraged school children to play an active role in the Jubilee celebrations through its support of a range of projects, including a National Poetry Competition, the Commonwealth Games Spirit of Friendship Festival and the Millennium Children's Tapestry of Hope. Information about these projects and others, as well as helpful links to many useful resources for schools, are available on my Department's website at www.dfes/gov.uk/jubilee. I welcome the exciting and imaginative contributions school children are already making to the celebrations.

<P>

<a name="20319w23.html_para0">Serving teachers in maintained schools have, since 1998, had an entitlement to undertake ICT training funded by the New Opportunities Fund.

<a name="20319w23.html_para1">The Government are now drawing up plans for further training in the use of ICT to support teachers' continuing professional development. A pilot scheme will be run in selected schools from April 2002.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20319w23.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 To date, no cases of BSE have been found in the national sheep flock. The numbers tested are still relatively low because there is no validated, rapid method for differentiating between BSE and scrapie. We have to use a number of different tests, including where possible, bioassay in mice. Of course the Government have in place a comprehensive risk management strategy, should the theoretical risk of BSE in sheep become a real one. This includes: the National Scrapie Plan, aiming to reduce, and eventually eliminate, scrapie in the national sheep flock; a contingency plan, drawn up in conjunction with industry and other stakeholders; a major ongoing sheep TSE research programme, which is kept under review; and removal of specified risk material from the food chain. Independent advice from the Food Standards Agency remains unchanged: the risk of BSE in sheep is still entirely theoretical and the agency is not advising against the consumption of sheep or lamb.

(4) if she will make a statement on financial penalties for breach of agreements between farmers and her Department in respect of the Arable Stewardship Pilot Scheme.  [43122]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20319w24.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Arable Stewardship Pilot Scheme opened in 1998 and closed to new applications in 2000, but some individual agreements under the scheme will run until July 2006. The total amount paid to farmers over the period 1998&#150;2006 will be approximately &#163;7.5 million.
<P>

<a name="20319w24.html_para0">In the third year of the pilot, ecological and economic evaluations of the scheme options were undertaken. Following this evaluation, seven new options were incorporated into the Countryside Stewardship Scheme from January 2002. The options are:

<a name="20319w24.html_para1">Financial penalties for breaches of agreement under the Arable Stewardship Pilot Scheme are the same as those for the Countryside Stewardship Scheme. Payments made may be withheld or reclaimed with interest. In addition, a 10 per cent. penalty may be imposed where appropriate. In certain circumstances, the agreement may also be terminated and the agreement holder banned from entering a new agreement under any Rural Development Regulation scheme for up to two years.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will make a statement on the progress of the Government's Review of competition in the water industry in England and Wales.  [44725]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20319w24.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 I informed the House on 30 March 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 832W, that the Government had decided to boost the opportunities for competition in 



<P>
<P><I>19 Mar 2002 : Column 263W</I><P>
public water services in England and Wales. We proposed that the incumbent companies would remain vertically integrated statutory undertakers, while new entrants would be licensed for production and retail activities. Since then, DEFRA has undertaken further detailed work on the future framework, in close collaboration with other Government Departments, the National Assembly for Wales, and the three principal regulators of the water industry; Ofwat, the Drinking Water Inspectorate and the Environment Agency.
<P>

<a name="20319w24.html_para2">Competition can deliver benefits for customer through keener prices, more innovation and improved service quality. But competition must be consistent with the Government's wider policy objectives for the water industry. It is important for the framework and scope of any further competitive activity to be tailored to the particular circumstances of the industry and the needs of its customers.
<P>

<a name="20319w24.html_para3">After thorough consideration, we propose to extend competition for non-household customers that use large quantities of water. Market entrants will be authorised to enter into common carriage agreements with statutory undertakers to supply premises which use more than a specified threshold of water per year. We propose that this should be set initially at 50 megalitres, based on the evidence currently available. Work is under way to assess the likely effects of lower threshold levels, both in terms of increasing competitive opportunity and the Government's wider policy objectives for the water industry. Views will be invited on the threshold in a forthcoming consultation paper. This further analysis, the views received in response to consultation, and consideration of the implications for all customers, will inform any final decisions on the initial threshold to be introduced in England and Wales.
<P>

<a name="20319w24.html_para4">Any subsequent lowering of the initial threshold will be considered once we have the benefit of practical experience to draw on. We would consult publicly on any proposed change and the same considerations would apply as in the case of the initial threshold. From the outset, new entrants to the industry will be expected to co-operate with the statutory undertakers in preparing and implementing water resource, security and emergency planning.
<P>

<a name="20319w24.html_para5">We have considered very carefully whether to introduce competition now for household customers. We have concluded that extending competition to the domestic water sector, while at the same time seeking to ensure that the Government's public health, social and environmental objectives continued to be met, would require a complex and costly regulatory regime, which would still leave substantial uncertainties. The added complexity would militate against effective competition and the extra costs would have to be borne mainly by customers. In our view, these drawbacks are likely to outweigh the potential benefits.
<P>

<a name="20319w24.html_para6">Household and other customers can continue to rely on the present system of comparative competition operated by Ofwat, to encourage water companies to improve efficiency and their services. Average household customers are now paying 13 per cent. less than in 1999, a reduction of &#163;33 in real terms.

<a name="20319w24.html_para7">We shall be publishing a consultation paper with further details of our proposals later this year. As previously announced, our intention is to introduce a Water Bill to bring these changes into effect. The draft Bill also contains proposals to put customers at the heart of the regulatory process, including setting up an independent consumer body to be the voice of consumers.

<a name="20319w24.html_para8">Article 6 of the Habitats Directive as transposed into UK law through the Conservation (Natural Habitats, etc.) Regulations 1994 requires that any new development proposal likely to have a significant impact on a SAC or SPA is assessed for its implications on that site. If that assessment concludes that the project would have an adverse effect on the integrity of the site it can only proceed, in the absence of alternatives, in the overriding public interest.
<P>

<a name="20319w24.html_para9">Guidance to local planning authorities and other public bodies on how that protection should be delivered is given in the current Planning Policy Guidance on Nature Conservation (PPG9). In addition the Government Statement of May 1998 on the Birds and Habitats Directives gave extensive guidance on the application of Article 6 of the Habitats Directive and relevant factors to be weighed when making judgments about overriding public interest.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what estimate she has made of the <i>(a)</i> financial costs and <i>(b)</i> benefits to her Department of the Parental Leave Directive.  [42489]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20319w24.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Parental Leave Directive which introduced parental leave entitlements (along with increased maternity benefits and time-off to care for dependants) was introduced into UK law by the Employment Relations Act 1999. The Act has had a neutral financial effect and limited benefit on this Department and the Pesticides Safety Directorate, 



<P>
<P><I>19 Mar 2002 : Column 265W</I><P>
Veterinary Medicines Directorate and Rural Payments Agencies, because the leave is without pay and because prior to the introduction of the legislation the Department already had in place contractual terms which were generally more favourable to staff though they did not specifically cover unpaid time-off for parental leave. As part of its overall 'family friendly' provisions this Department continues to establish arrangements which allow staff to establish a proper work/life balance. The statutory rights which have now been incorporated into staff terms and conditions provide staff with basic entitlements in the event that they fall outside the contractual entitlements. So far there have been few requests for unpaid parental leave.
<P>

<a name="20319w24.html_para10">Responsibility for such matters within the Central Science Laboratory Agency, the Veterinary Laboratory Agency and the Centre for Environmental, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science Agency has been delegated to Agency Chief Executives and I have asked them to reply direct.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20319w25.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Bercow: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs how many and what proportion of the staff of her Department are <i>(a)</i> job sharing, <i>(b)</i> term working and <i>(c)</i> engaged in another form of flexible working.  [42432]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20319w25.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Of those employed in my Department, 83 are job sharing (1.03 per cent.) and 14 are block ("term") working (0.17 per cent.). A total of 724 work part-time (8.96 per cent.) and 80 are on unpaid leave (0.99 per cent.).
<P>

<a name="20319w25.html_para0">The Department also operates a flexible working hours scheme. This allows an individual to play a full part at work while enabling them to arrange their working hours to fit in with social and domestic arrangements. It also allows line managers to deal sympathetically with any requests for time off if the individual has particular needs.




<P>
<P><I>19 Mar 2002 : Column 266W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="20319w25.html_para1">It is departmental policy, as an equal opportunity employer, to meet requests for all types of flexible working wherever the nature of the work allows. This includes: maternity, paternity and parental leave (over and above legal requirements); flexible working hours; part-time work and job sharing; leave to care for sick children/carer's leave; home-working; term-time contracts; annual hours contracts; child care allowances; career break schemes; paid/unpaid leave. The flexibility of the working pattern is decided in conjunction with local management to suit an individual's need and the needs of their work. Managers are encouraged to welcome applications from people working different patterns, where the nature of work allows.
<P>

<a name="20319w25.html_para2">The Department sees flexible working arrangements as important in the promotion of diversity and equal opportunities policies, in the recruitment and retention of staff and for the creation of a better work/life balance.

<P>
<a name="20319w26.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 New business recovery and recycling targets for packaging waste in 2002 under the Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) Regulations 1997 (as amended) have been agreed by the Government. Subject to the approval of Parliament, these are as follows:

Material-specific recycling 19 per cent.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="20319w26.html_para0">The Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) Regulations 1997 were made to enable the UK to meet its obligations under the EC Directive on Packaging Waste, in particular the recovery and recycling targets in Article 6 of that Directive. The first targets that we and other member states had to achieve, in 2001, under the Packaging Waste Directive were that at least 50 per cent. of packaging waste be recovered, at least 25 per cent. recycled and 15 per cent. of each packaging material recycled.
<P>

<a name="20319w26.html_para1">On the assumption that the UK met these targets last year (and final figures are not yet ready), the targets I am proposing today should allow almost five million tonnes of packaging waste to be recovered in 2002.
<P>

<a name="20319w26.html_para2">My Department has, as was indicated in the recent consultation paper on targets for 2002, reviewed the figures that were used to develop the targets for 2002 in that paper and in light of the changes in the amount of packaging data reported by businesses obligated under the packaging Regulations, and the estimates for the tonnages expected to be obligated in 2002, the Government have decided on a recovery target of 59 per cent. and a material-specific target of 19 per cent.
<P>

<P>
<a name="20319w26.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 18 March 2002]:</i> We have introduced or are planning to introduce a range of measures to encourage businesses to recycle by both regulatory and voluntary producer responsibility schemes.
<P>

<a name="20319w26.html_para4">The EC Directive on Packaging and Packaging Waste&#151;94/62/EC&#151;was implemented in Great Britain by the Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) Regulations 1997 (as amended). In order to comply with the requirements in the Directive, recovery and recycling targets for 2001 under the packaging Regulations were 56 per cent. for recovery and 18 per cent. for material specific recycling of packaging waste.
<P>

<a name="20319w26.html_para5">The Regulations place obligations on certain businesses to recover and recycle specified tonnages of packaging waste. Their obligation is calculated by using three factors: the amount of packaging handled by the business, the national business recovery and recycling targets for 



<P>
<P><I>19 Mar 2002 : Column 270W</I><P>
the year and the "activity obligation" associated with the activity the business carries out on packaging. Businesses can also reduce their obligation by using less and reusing packaging whenever possible. By increasing the amount reused, producers are able to reduce the tonnages of packaging waste they are required to recover and so lessen their costs of compliance.
<P>

<a name="20319w26.html_para6">We are transposing the EC Directive on End-of-Life Vehicles and the proposed Directive on Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment is expected to be adopted by the EC later this year.
<P>

<a name="20319w26.html_para7">A voluntary agreement is in place with the Newspaper Publishers Association to increase the recycled content of newsprint to target levels over a period of years up to 2006 and we are currently talking to the producers of direct mail and promotions with the aim of agreeing recycling targets for this material.

 <i>[holding answer 15 March 2002]:</i> Shipments of hazardous waste enter the UK under a system of prior written notification and consent rather than licensing. These controls are set out by Council Regulation (EEC) No.259/93 on the supervision and control of shipments of hazardous waste. The UK does not designate specific ports of import for hazardous waste. The Environment Agency, which controls the import of waste, would not, therefore, necessarily know which port is being used for a shipment.
<P>

<a name="20319w26.html_para8">However, the Environment Agency area office believes that there has been one shipment of 60 tonnes of redundant pesticides and agrochemicals imported via Shoreham in the last two years. This arrived in 2002.

<P>
<a name="20319w26.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 15 March 2002]:</i> Local authorities have a duty under part IV of the Environment Act 1995 to assess air quality against objectives set out in the Air Quality Regulations 2000, including an objective in respect of particulate matter (PM10). If the air quality objectives are likely to be exceeded by relevant deadline in areas where the public are likely to be exposed, then local authorities have to declare an air quality management area.
<P>

<a name="20319w26.html_para9">Adur District Council has produced a stage III local air quality management review and assessment report.

<P>

<P><I>19 Mar 2002 : Column 271W</I><P>
the public are likely to be exposed. The modelling results have been compared to a limited period of monitoring in the Port area. The local authority's report states that it was not possible to undertake extensive monitoring of PM10 in the area of the Port. In September 2000 a cascade impactor was installed for four weeks. The overall conclusion of the report was that no exceedence of the PM10 objective would occur within Adur's District Council boundaries, and this conclusion has been accepted
<P>

<a name="20319w26.html_para11">Local authorities will be required to produce a further review and assessment report in the second phase of local air quality management by end of 2003.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20319w26.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 Local Authorities and the Environment Agency already have wide powers to tackle fly tipping under section 59 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990. Under this Act, local authorities and the Environment Agency have the power to remove fly tipped waste and recover the cost of collection on those who committed the offence. They also have the power to prosecute the perpetrator, and successful prosecution can lead to heavy penalties including an unlimited fine and up to two years in prison.
<P>

<a name="20319w26.html_para12">As part of the local public service agreement initiative, some local authorities have argued that to assist their ability to combat fly tipping, they should be given the power that the Environment Agency has to require companies and individuals to provide the Agency with copies of the duty of care paperwork which these companies and individuals are required to maintain. The Government have asked the fly tipping stakeholders' forum to consider this issue and make recommendations. We are currently awaiting the forum's views.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will list non-governmental organisations operating in the south-west region that receive public funds from his Department; and what amount of annual funding they received in the most recent year for which figures are available.  [39185]<P>

<P>
<a name="20319w28.html_spnew3"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 In this reply, "non-governmental organisation" means an organisation working within the voluntary or charity sector. The available information is set out in the table.
<P>

<a name="20319w28.html_para0">The Home Office does not generally record this information by region. It is therefore possible that other organisations in the south-west region, which are not listed, have received support from the Home Office.
<P>

<a name="20319w28.html_para1">In addition, funding awarded to national organisations may have been used to support work in the south-west region. It would be a matter for the organisation concerned how they chose to allocate such resources and the Home Office would not hold that information.

 Antisocial behaviour orders (ASBOs) are community-based civil orders, which can be applied for by the police or local authority in consultation with each other, against an individual or several individuals whose behaviour is antisocial. Applications are currently made to the magistrates court acting in its civil capacity. ASBOs were introduced from 1 April 1999.
<P>

<a name="20319w28.html_para2">Data on the total number of ASBOs issued between 1 April 1999 to 31 May 2000 was collected by police force area only.
<P>

<a name="20319w28.html_para3">From 1 June 2000 official statistics on the number of ASBOs issued are based on quarterly returns from Magistrates Courts Committees (MCCs) which from 1 April 2001 were all aligned with police force areas. These returns are not presently designed to give figures below MCC level. Available information, up to 30 September 2001, by police force/MCC area is given in the table.

 <i>[holding answer 27 February 2002]:</i> The cost of an Anti-social Behaviour Order (ASBO) is usually met by the lead agency making the application&#151;this will either be the local authority or the local police force. In some areas there are local arrangements where the costs are divided between the two agencies.

All visa regimes are kept under review, and are only maintained where they contribute to effective immigration control. There continue to be large numbers of Romanian nationals seeking asylum or being found here illegally. In the circumstances there are no plans to lift the visa requirement for Romanian nationals. United Kingdom citizens do not require visas to visit Romania, but any who wish to study there will need to fulfil the requirement of the Romanian immigration regulations.

This was to be expected from an organisation that was only created on 1 April 2001 and is still building its capacity and introducing first time business processes. The maximum achievable score is 1,000. In order to achieve an excellence award an organisation would need to score 600&#150;700.

 Wheelclamping is one of the activities to be regulated by the provisions of the Private Security Industry Act 2001.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many prosecutions have been brought under section 24(2) of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 paragraph (g) as amended by section 71 of the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001.  [39806]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20319w30.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Denham </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 11 March 2002]:</i> Prosecutions are not brought under these statutes.
<P>

<a name="20319w30.html_para9">Section 24(2) of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act sets out those offences for which powers of arrest without warrant apply, and section 71 of the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001 simply adds two further offences to this section. They are kerb crawling and failure to stop and report an accident (in which personal injury is caused).
<P>

<a name="20319w30.html_para10">There were 812 persons proceeded against for kerb crawling in England and Wales in 2000, 6,165 persons for failing to stop after an accident and 1,907 for failing to report an accident within 24 hours. In the case of the latter figures, it is not known centrally, however, whether the offences involved personal injury or only damage to a vehicle, an animal or other property.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will commit money that has been made available for providing civilians with conferred police powers in a manner that recognises the imbalance in funding between different police authorities.  [37905]<P>

<P>
<a name="20319w31.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 During the consultation period for the 2002&#150;03 funding settlement that was announced on 30 January 2002, seven police authorities referred to pensions in their letters of representation. We are aware of police authorities' concern over the increasing burden of the funding of pensions. We have increased revenue funding from 12.9 per cent. in 1997&#150;98 to 14.5 per cent. since 1999&#150;2000. It will remain at this level in 2002&#150;03.
<P>

<a name="20319w31.html_para0">As we made clear in our recently published White Paper "Policing a New Century: A Blueprint for Reform", we are also aware of the need of police authorities and chief officers for a system which brings greater clarity about pensions obligations on individual police forces. The Home Office and Treasury are reviewing the options for a revised system of funding which would bring this about.

 While backlog maintenance costs have risen since 1994&#150;95 the bringing into use of new health care buildings resulting from the major capital investment programme within the NHS, in the order of &#163;7 billion by 2010, should see a marked decrease in backlog maintenance costs. This is already evident in the smaller rate of change seen recently in backlog maintenance costs. It is estimated that the impact of this planned major capital investment, together with contributions from block capital issued directly to NHS trust should, if fully implemented, see the virtual eradication of most backlog maintenance costs within the NHS by 2010.

<a name="20319w34.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Blears </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 1 March 2002]:</i> Regulations to protect against the exposure to asbestos are already in existence. Under the Control of Asbestos at Work Regulations 1987, it is the duty of all employers to prepare risk assessments and make arrangements to protect workers and, in the case of the NHS, patients. The proposed new regulation, which will formalise and expand upon existing regulations, will better protect against the risks of exposure to asbestos by imposing more rigorous management arrangements on employers. The regulations will ensure that where there is evidence of asbestos, it is managed effectively and safely so as not to cause risk of harm to anyone.
<P>

<a name="20319w34.html_para0">Cost analysis of the proposed new regulation indicates that the financial burden on the NHS will not be major. Hospitals will be expected to pay for such work out of their normal running cost allocation budgets.

As a result of this, data held on registration numbers after 1997 is not comparable to earlier years. The data may also be affected by gradual improvements in the methods used for the removal of duplicate registration records, which were first employed by the dental practice board in 1993.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. Based on the number of registrations at 30 September 1992.<P>

2. ONS mid year population estimates for 1992 are used to calculate the percentage of patients registered.<P>

3. Registration rates reflect a 24 month registration period for adults whereas children's registrations lapsed at the end of the following calendar year. The basis of the later figures in table 2 are for a 15 month registration period for both adults and children. <P>

<P>
<a name="20319w35.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 The Department is commissioning a wide-ranging piece of primary research that will examine the role and effectiveness of air ambulance services in a modern national health service. The first stage is already under way and will provide an up-to-date review of existing evidence. This work is being undertaken by the medical care research unit at Sheffield University and will be completed by May 2002. No decision has been taken yet on who will undertake the next stage of research but it is intended that it will be completed by the end of 2003.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20319w35.html_spnew1"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 Health service circular 1999&#150;176 advises national health service bodies to use their existing arrangements to determine local prescribing policies, using the publicly available evidence to inform their decision. Local policies may therefore reflect differing assessments and interpretations of evidence along with differing local circumstances and priorities.
<P>

<a name="20319w35.html_para0">The National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) has been asked to appraise the use of infliximab (Remicade) and etanecerpt (Enbrel) in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis for adults and etanercept only for juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). Unless there are appeals, NICE expects to issue its guidance in March 2002 for etanercept for JIA and guidance on the etanercept and infliximab appraisal for adults in April 2002. NICE also has anakinra for rheumatoid arthritis on their appraisal work programme and guidance is expected in July 2003, providing there are no appeals.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20319w35.html_spnew2"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 The information requested is not collected centrally as the drugs budgets of health authorities and primary care trust are not determined centrally. They receive unified allocations to cover the

<P>
<P>
<a name="20319w35.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Blears </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 5 March 2002]:</i> The concept of care closer to home as identified by the National Beds Inquiry (NBI) underpins our plans for modernising the national health service. To this end maximum use needs to be made of cottage hospitals and primary care organisations in delivering and co-ordinating the local population's care. Cottage hospitals are working hard to develop their roles, for example in carrying out day surgery, minor procedures and caring for patients in the recuperative phases of recovery from illness or accident. They will be key players in meeting our target of introducing an additional 5,000 intermediate care beds&#151;the bridge between hospital and home&#151;by 2004.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20319w35.html_spnew4"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 Under the Foster Placement (Children) Regulations 1991, agencies are required to seek criminal record checks on prospective foster carers. Checks may be made through the Criminal Records Bureau, which began processing applications on 11 March 2002. The checks will also include information from the Department's Protection of Children Act List and Department for Education and Skills' List 99.

 <i>[holding answer 18 March 2002]:</i> The commission has the ability to take enforcement action in relation to the Care Homes Regulations 2001. The national minimum standards will be the basis for the commission to determine whether the regulations are complied with.

<a name="20319w35.html_para4">Regulations will be mandatory and providers must comply with them. If a regulation is breached, the breach of which is an offence, providers will be given a notice setting out the regulation breached, how the service is considered deficient, what must be done to remedy the deficiency, and a time scale within which the deficiency must be remedied. If the deficiency is not remedied, proceedings for prosecution may follow. The breach of regulation 5 of the Care Homes Regulations 2001, which states that a service users' guide should include a standard form of contract for the provision of services and facilities by the registered provider to service users, is an offence.

 <i>[holding answer 18 March 2002]:</i> The Department has commissioned the production of a new booklet containing key information that individuals should have when they are moving into, or resident in, a care home. It will include the contributions that residents may make to care home fees and other financial aspects. The booklet is currently being finalised, and it will be made available in hard copy to all councils with social services responsibilities and a range of relevant voluntary and community organisations. Other means are being considered to ensure the widest possible circulation.

 <i>[holding answer 18 March 2002]:</i> "Pharmacy in the Future&#151;Implementing the NHS Plan"&#151;our programme for pharmacy published in September 2000&#151;sets out a number of measures for increasing the role of community pharmacists in treating minor ailments. Successive winter campaigns have reinforced the message that in many cases the best course of action is to "Ask Your Pharmacist". All NHS sites will be able to refer callers to their local pharmacy, where appropriate, by the end of 2002. We are also committed to the availability of a wider range of medicines over the counter.
