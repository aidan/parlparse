 There are a wide range of factors which impact on the insurgency and conflict resolution in Afghanistan.

Furthermore, the 'Strategic Conflict Assessment of Afghanistan', published by the Recovery and Development Consortium in November 2008, suggests that men in rural communities are most at risk of recruitment into armed opposition groups. Providing increased and legitimate employment opportunities in the sector may, in addition to improving rural livelihoods, reduce the likelihood of disaffected, unemployed male youths joining the armed opposition. Conflict-sensitive community programmes which operate at the sub-district level may also help reduce tensions as well as resolve disputes over land ownership and natural resources.</p>

 Agriculture is the backbone of the Afghan economy, contributing more than one-third of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The Department for International Development (DFID) will continue to support a range of agricultural development programmes in Afghanistan over the coming years, to improve access to markets, add value to farmers' produce and provide support for agricultural livelihoods. For example, the new Helmand Growth Programme will provide support to farmers by providing skills training and access to credit and markets, while the Comprehensive Agriculture and Rural Development Facility provides incentives to sustain the reduction in poppy cultivation, by promoting licit agricultural livelihoods and strengthening agricultural markets. A decision on future programmes supporting agricultural development in Afghanistan will be made following the current Bilateral Aid Review, which will conclude early next year.</p>

 The food security situation in Afghanistan is not considered critical. Based on information from the Afghan Ministry of Agriculture Irrigation and Livestock (MAIL), supported by the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), national wheat prices have risen but remain affordable, and the availability of wheat is better than average due to last year's bumper harvest and better than average production this year. There is an overall grain shortage of around 750,000 metric tonnes, however there is good access to imports from Kazakhstan. The Government of Afghanistan and the international community, including the FAO and the UN's World Food Programme (WFP), are closely following the situation and have the capacity to provide support to food insecure areas and groups if required.</p>

The World Food Programme (WFP) estimates that Burundi's average per capita production is 1,400 kilocalories per clay, compared to a recommended daily intake of 2,100. Even during harvest season, households spend up to 60% of their income on food.</p>

 The Department for International Development (DFID) supports the FinMark Trust for Southern Africa, which has developed a far reaching programme on micro-insurance. Further to its research on the opportunities and constraints for delivering insurance to low-income households in South Africa, the trust has supported diagnostic studies, regulatory reforms and business innovations in several countries, including Ethiopia and Zambia. This is partly through sponsorship of the global Access to Insurance Initiative. In Kenya, the DFID supported Financial Sector Deepening Trust (FSDT) has supported micro-insurance in two ways: by advising on the design of Safaricom and Equity Bank's M-Kesho product; and to develop and demonstrate the market viability of index-based insurance products to reduce the impact of weather risk on smallholder farmers and pastrolists.</p>

We are also supporting the institutional strengthening of the microfinance sector in countries such as Pakistan and Bangladesh, thereby indirectly assisting the development of a range of financial products including micro-insurance. Going forward, DFID is considering how to further enhance the provision of affordable micro-insurance in a range of countries, in line with its 2011-15 business plan commitment.

 The Facilitated Return Scheme (FRS) accounted for approximately 30% of the 5,530 foreign national prisoner removals from the UK in 2009, and for around 50% of the 2,425 foreign national prisoner removals in quarters 1 and 2 of 2010. We are unable to advise at the current time the numbers who have received financial assistance and the amount spent on FRS since October 2010. Removal figures for quarter 3 of 2010 was published at the end of November, and for quarter four early in 2011. Once this information has been published the UK Border Agency will be able to confirm the number of foreign national prisoners removed under FRS and the average amount of assistance provided during those periods.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_478"><a name="101214w0002.htm_para15"><a name="10121448000678">Expenditure on FRS from inception in October 2006 to March 2009 was approximately £4.3 million. The cost of running the scheme for 2009-10 was £7.1 million (including £2.3 million of EU funding) and for 2010-11 is expected to be £9.7 million (including £2.7 million of EU funding). This is a slightly higher figure than previously reported for 2009-10 as the scheme has been successful in removing a larger number of foreign national prisoners than estimated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_479"><a name="101214w0002.htm_para16"><a name="10121448000679">The Facilitated Return Scheme is a practical solution that not only saves the taxpayer money in the long run, but also means foreign criminals are removed as soon as possible, denying them the opportunity to re-offend or drag out the removals process. All foreign national prisoners are entered on our watch list when removed, so checks can be made to prevent those who are barred and those who have no right from re-entering the UK.</p>

These cases are considered very carefully and in line with policy. We are aware of two individuals removed under FRS who have later successfully applied to have their exclusion orders lifted, to allow them to return to the UK. We are also aware of a small number of individuals who have re-entered illegally having taken up FRS. In such cases we take urgent action to remove them from the UK.

As of 1 October 2010, those who apply for and are accepted onto the scheme will receive a reduced cash payment amount. We anticipate that high numbers of individuals will continue to take up the scheme and we will monitor the level of applications over the coming months.</p>

However, any diversion of funding away from apprenticeships is to be agreed with the Agency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_531"><a name="101214w0002.htm_para68"><a name="10121457000096">By the end of the spending review period we will be spending up to £250 million more than was provided under the previous Government. It means we can carry forward the additional 50,000 adult apprenticeship places announced for 2010-11 into future years and add an extra 25,000 by 2014-15. That will take us to 75,000 more places than under the last Government.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_532"><a name="101214w0002.htm_para69"><a name="10121457000097">The figures above are for adult apprenticeships, that is people aged 19 and above. Funding for 16 to 18-year-old apprenticeships is provided by the Department for Education. They will publish information on funding and learner numbers for 16 to 18-year-old apprenticeships in their annual funding statement shortly.</p>

 The Government recently announced the Growth Review "The path to strong, sustainable and balanced growth". Although there has not been a specific benchmarking exercise to assess the burden of regulation on each sector of the economy, in the first stages of the Growth Review, departments will be looking at how they can remove the barriers to growth, including regulatory barriers, in six priority sectors: construction, retail, health and life sciences, professional and business services, manufacturing and digital and creative industries. The Government have also introduced a 'one-in, one-out' rule to cut red tape and ensure that no new regulation with a net cost to business is brought in without other regulation being cut by an equal amount.</p>

 Our reforms to higher education will shift the balance of public funds for teaching from direct grant to institutions to funding that follows the choices made by individual students. This will provide strong incentives for institutions to focus on providing high quality teaching as efficiently as possible. Over time, popular and successful institutions will be able to grow and we expect new providers to enter the sector providing they can offer teaching to the high standards students will expect. We do not expect the overall income of the sector to reduce and we expect improved teaching quality and better informed students to have a positive impact on the economy. We do not have the data in order to make an assessment at the local level of the effect of the reforms in any particular area, as that will depend on the decisions taken by each individual institution in response to the new funding regime.</p>

 No central Government spending has been allocated specifically to fund the activities of local enterprise partnerships. As set out in the White Paper on local growth, local enterprise partnerships will be expected to fund their own day-to-day running costs and will also want to consider how they can obtain the best value for public money by leveraging in private sector investment. Local enterprise partnerships and proposed partnerships may also wish to submit bids to the Regional Growth Fund or European Funding. It is for local authorities to decide how much of their discretionary spending they allocate to local enterprise partnerships.</p>

2. All estimates are based on survey data and are therefore subject to uncertainty. Small differences should be treated with caution as these will be affected by sampling error and variability in non-response.<br>
3. Figures have been presented on a before housing cost and an after housing cost basis. For before housing costs, housing costs (such as rent, water rates, mortgage interest payments, buildings insurance payments and ground rent and service charges) are not deducted from income, while for after housing costs they are.<br>
4. Disposable incomes have been used to answer the question. This includes earnings from employment and self-employment, state support, income from occupational and private pensions, investment income and other sources.

 Ultimately it is a matter of judgment as to the most suitable size of the House, and Ministers decided that a modest reduction to 600 seats would be appropriate, mindful that hon. Members must be able to serve their constituents and that the House must be of sufficient size to be able to carry out its functions effectively. Under the Government's proposals, the 1 December 2009 register suggests the electoral quota for the UK would be around 76,000. More than a third of the existing constituencies are already within 5% either side of 76,000, so the impact of our proposals will see constituencies of a size well within existing norms.</p>

Member to provide him with a copy of the data released to Clyde local authorities along with an explanation of how these forecasts have been calculated.</p>

<a name="101214w0003.htm_brev27"><a name="10121457001219"><ul><p class="tabletext">In my recent response to your Parliamentary Question regarding the trend in the number of service personnel that will be based at Her Majesty's Naval Base (HMNB) Clyde and their potential accommodation requirements (Official Report dated 30 Nov 2010: column 745W), I undertook to write to provide a copy of the data that was released to local authorities in the Clyde area. Please find enclosed a copy of the presentation used to brief local authorities in the Clyde area. This has been presented to council members and local government officers for Argyle and Bute Council (22 September 2010), local Helensburgh and Lomond Councillors (5 October 2010) and the Helensburgh and Lomond Community Council (28 October 2010). It is also intended to present the same information to Shandon and Rhu Community Council on 8 December 2010.</p>
</ul><a name="101214w0003.htm_brev28"><a name="10121457001220"><ul><p class="tabletext">First, I would like to explain that this data has been used by the Department for internal planning purposes and to assist local authorities in the Clyde area to review their arrangements in light of the potential future infrastructure and support needs of HMNB Clyde. The data used in the attached presentation was produced before the outcomes of the Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR) were published and is based on a number of assumptions, elements of which may be subject to change. It has, therefore, always been presented with the caveat that the data should not be considered to represent the final position of the Department. Work remains ongoing within the Department to implement the outcomes of the SDSR and HMNB Clyde will continue to update their forecasts as this work progresses.</p>
</ul><a name="101214w0003.htm_brev29"><a name="10121457001221"><ul><p class="tabletext">Turning now to specific slides within the presentation, I would like to draw your attention to slide 13, which forecasts a potential increase in the number of service personnel, between now and 2022, from 3,200 to 5,300. This forecast was based on the Royal Navy's existing staffing levels required to support the Fleet and was produced before the publication of the SDSR, which as you will be aware, confirmed the requirement for future manpower changes within the Ministry of Defence (MOD). The forecast therefore, does not take into account any future reduction in the numbers of service personnel. I can confirm that work is ongoing to assess the impact of the SDSR on HMNB Clyde, and this is being conducted alongside that already underway to assess how best to implement the Department's aim of making HMNB Clyde the main operating base for all classes of submarines, including the future classes of submarines such as the replacement for the Vanguard Class.</p>
</ul><a name="101214w0003.htm_brev30"><a name="10121457001222"><ul><p class="tabletext">Slide 14 of the presentation includes a projection that the number of all personnel to be based at HMNB Clyde would rise to 9,500. This figure includes the 5,300 figure discussed above and projects that the number of non-service personnel, including MOD civilians, the Commercial Partner (Babcock Marine and Technology Divisions) and other contractors, will increase from 3,000 to 4,200. When presenting the 4,200 figure to the local authorities, the Department made it clear that there are substantial margins of uncertainty in relation to this forecast. For example, the forecast was calculated assuming a direct correlation between workload and workforce and does not take into account any potential efficiencies such as economies of scale. In addition, the estimate does not account for the reduction in the Department's civilian workforce, confirmed in the SDSR, nor does it include any assessment of work ongoing within the Department to develop  <br>

</ul><a name="101214w0003.htm_brev31"><a name="10121457001223"><ul><p class="tabletext">Turning to slide 17, which contains an estimate that the number of Single Living Accommodation (SLA) spaces may increase from 2,250 to 3,250 and that the number of Service Family Accommodation (SFA) spaces may increase from 515 to 685. As the slide highlights, predicting the future accommodation requirements is a complex area, and I would like to make it clear that these forecasts are about potential space requirements and do not necessarily indicate that the Department will need to build new accommodation to meet such a forecast. For example, it is possible that some of this requirement could be met by better utilisation of existing capacity, including through refurbishment, and work continues within the Department to assess how best to deliver the future SLA and SFA requirement. I can, however, confirm that informal discussions on how we might meet our potential future SLA requirement for HMNB Clyde have recently taken place with the Argyll and Bute Council, but more work is required before the Department can place any formal plans before the Argyll and Bute Council.</p>

I would like to reassure you that the Department is committed to working closely with the local authorities in the Clyde area to assist them in planning for the future infrastructure and support needs of the area. As part of this process of continuous engagement with the local authorities, HMNB Clyde will continue to provide them with preliminary forecasts and to consult with them on the Department's plans, which may have an impact on the local communities.</p>

 All initial flying training for UK fast jets, helicopters, and multi-engine pilots takes place within the UK. However, training does not cease after pilots have completed their formal training but continues throughout their flying careers, because all operational flying includes an element of training. Small numbers of UK pilots are regularly posted on exchange tours overseas and this often involves conversion training to adapt to specific aircraft types. In addition, UK pilots regularly take part in flying exercises overseas with international partners. However, the information requested on location, aircraft type, hours flown and costs for these activities outside of the UK is not held centrally and could be provided only at disproportionate cost.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_611"><a name="101214w0004.htm_para26"><a name="1012151000154">The Government announced in September that a new mental health strategy is being produced. The Government intends a wholesale shift in emphasis that puts mental health outcomes alongside physical health indicators in assessments of the quality of the national health service. The strategy will take a cross-Government and life course approach focussing on outcomes that are meaningful to patients and their families. The strategy is due to be published in the new year.</p>

Employment tribunals already have discretion to accept an out of time application depending on the reason for the delay. In some jurisdictions, employment tribunals may consider claims made out of time where it was not reasonably practicable for a claim to have been submitted within the time limit. In others, late claims may be considered where it is just and equitable to do so. Responses to a public consultation in 2007 on time limits for making employment tribunal claims did not evidence any significant problems.</p>

 Most expenditure in support of looked after children (including children in care) is through local authorities. In 2007-08 local authority net expenditure recorded by them under the heading of children looked after amounted to £2,181 million, and in 2008-09 the figure was £2,453 million. Data for 2009-10 will be available in early 2011. These figures do not include other expenditure which contributes to supporting looked after children, such as expenditure on social worker salaries, on undertaking assessments of need or on delivering wider services such as school and leisure services. Over the last three financial years the Department itself has directly spent some £65 million in support of looked after children through the Care Matters programme budget; other departmental spending programmes have also contributed to improving outcomes for these children.</p>

The evaluation involved in-depth case study visits with participating schools to collect evidence on the take up and delivery of the programme, taking into account the views of school leaders, teachers, and local authorities. The evaluation also includes a robust assessment of the impact of the programme on pupils' attitudes and behaviour, using a quantitative survey of secondary pupils to compare changes over time in the attitudes and behaviour of SLN participants against a comparable group of non-participants.
