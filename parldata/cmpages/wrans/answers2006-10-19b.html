 Biofuel produced from sugar beet can offer a number of environmental benefits, with the precise benefits depending on a range of factors, including the energy used to fertilise and process the crop. The Government will be introducing a renewable transport fuel obligation in April 2008 which will require all transport fuel suppliers to ensure that a set percentage of their total fuel sales is made up of biofuels or some other renewable transport fuel. This will create a major new market for biofuels in the UK, and it will be up to individual transport fuel suppliers to source their biofuels from whatever feedstock they deem most appropriate. From the outset the RTFO will include environmental assurance schemes to monitor the carbon savings achieved and the impact on the wider environment.</p>

 In 2002 the Home Office, in partnership with the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO), introduced the National Crime Recording Standard (NCRS), designed to improve the quality of crime recording in all forces. NCRS was developed following extensive research undertaken by the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO), and Her Majesty&#146; Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC), as well as research commissioned by the Home Office, which demonstrated wide-ranging inconsistencies in the way that forces were managing crime reports taken from the public. NCRS is based on a number of key principles including the requirement for forces to create incident reports for all incidents and to record these incidents as crimes if, on the balance of probabilities, the circumstances of the incident amount to a crime and if there is no credible evidence to the contrary. NCRS was designed to secure a better quality of service for the victims of crime, particularly around reporting, and has delivered significant improvements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_122"><a name="61019w0003.htm_para2"><a name="06101950000321">The Home Office, through the Police and Crime Standards Directorate, has provided a strong lead in ensuring that forces are complying with NCRS. A three-year programme of annual external audit has been undertaken in partnership with the Audit Commission across a wide range of crime types, to ensure that forces are recording the crimes reported to them accurately and consistently. In 2003 the independent audit found that only 2 per cent. of forces were achieving a good or excellent level of performance for data quality. Self-improvement by forces, supported by the Home Office, have resulted in an outstanding improvement in performance. The Audit Commission&#146;s report Crime Recording 2005, published in June 2006 found that 81 per cent. of forces are now rated as either good or excellent, with no forces scoring poor. This represents a significant step forward in ensuring that the quality of reports taken from the public is robust and capable of supporting the investigation of crime. The Home Office remains committed to maintaining this high level of quality and fully intends to work with forces to build upon the achievements to date.</p>

 People who consider they are the victim of a miscarriage of justice can, if they regard a particular party or body as being responsible, make a complaint in accordance with any established complaints procedure. For example, all police forces have such procedures in place, and the Independent Police Complaints Commission ensures that complaints are dealt with effectively. The IPCC sets standards for the way the police handle complaints and, when something has gone wrong, they help them learn lessons and improve the way they work. In terms of redress, people can lodge an appeal against conviction, and if that is unsuccessful they can, in certain circumstances, apply to the Criminal Cases Review Commission for a reinvestigation of their conviction and possible referral to the Court of Appeal. Compensation in respect of a miscarriage of justice is payable, on application, if the criteria of section 133 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 are met.

 DFID has been one of the major supporters of the humanitarian response to the failure of the short season rains at the end of 2005. Since then we have committed over &#163;56.2 million to meet the most urgent humanitarian needs. Additional DFID contributions have been made via our support to the UN-managed central emergency response fund (CERF) to which the UK is the largest contributor, and through the EC Humanitarian Office (ECHO).</p>

Crop production is, however, only one of the factors affecting humanitarian needs. While most communities demonstrate impressive resilience in the face of adverse conditions, some remain in need even when crop production is good. There is evidence that in many communities, notably in Somalia, Kenya, Ethiopia and Eritrea, acute malnutrition remains well above levels that are regarded as sufficient to trigger humanitarian interventions. We will continue to monitor these needs carefully and respond where necessary.</p>

We are also pleased that LUPP partners will continue similar work in municipalities within and outside Luanda with the support of other partners, including the private sector (Chevron, Coca Cola and the diamond company Lazare Kaplan). To complement this, we have invited LUPP partners to submit a further proposal to DFID for our consideration, focused on their governance and influencing work. This should help capitalise on the gains made by LUPP to date, enable stronger links to be forged between the Government of Angola and civil society on urban poverty, and be manageable for DFID in light of our reduced administrative and financial resources for Angola.</p>

 There has been no reduction in funding to the National Fallen Stock Company. Government allocated &#163;20 million for the scheme over a three-year period in order to help with initial pump priming. We have recently agreed to extend that funding for a further year, but it was always intended that central Government's contribution would reduce over time. The recent reduction in the percentage contribution to farmers' collection costs reflects this approach.</p>

The review team delivered its recommendations in April 2006. The Government are now working closely with the National Fallen Stock Company to develop appropriate responses. We aim to publish these later this year.</p>

 French trawlers can legitimately operate outside the 12-mile limit off the Yorkshire coast. They also have limited access rights in the 6-12 mile area between Flamborough Head and Spurn Point to fish for herring. The activities of these vessels have been closely monitored by the Marine Fisheries Agency (MFA). A French trawler was successfully prosecuted on 7 July in Grimsby for fishing illegally inside the 12-mile limit and total fines and costs amounted to &#163;14,750. Since this incident, no further evidence of subsequent incursions within the 12-mile limit have been found.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_141"><a name="61019w0005.htm_para8"><a name="06101950000476">The MFA monitors fishing activity through a programme of inspections on land and at sea, using the Royal Navy's Fishery Protection Squadron. Aerial surveillance, combined with a satellite Vessel Monitoring System, precisely records the position of all vessels over 15m in length, including any French vessels. In recent weeks, approximately 80 per cent. of French vessels operating off the Yorkshire coast have been inspected when their catches are being landed.</p>

 The Government's 10-year child care strategy sets out our commitments: to extend the free early education entitlement to 38 weeks a year across all settings; to increase the number of free hours each week from 12.5 to 15; and to offer them more flexibly than at present. Around &#163;3 billion per year is provided to local authorities to fund the free entitlement.</p>

The most recent survey, carried out in 2004/05, shows that for full time, English domiciled dependent students who are in receipt of a higher education grant and hence have a household income of &#163;15,200 or less, the mean level of student support received was &#163;5,925. For students from high income families, who are those deemed to be paying full tuition fees ie whose household income is &#163;31,973 or more, the mean level of student support received was &#163;2,577. Both figures include student loans, the higher education grant, fee remission grants as well as supplementary grants and allowances for students in particular circumstances. They represent the average level of support for one year, not the duration of the course. The next survey is planned for the 2007/08 academic year.</p>

 There is no classification system in place for obscene material in films. Both films and printed material are covered by the Obscene Publications Act 1957. Ultimately it is a matter for the courts to determine what exactly is covered, but obscene material in films or in newspapers is illegal, and could not appear in a classified film, or in any publication. We have no proposals to introduce a classification scheme for newspapers and magazines; because of the extremely tight production deadlines involved, it would quite simply not be possible to factor in the time required for scrutiny.

While the appointment of suitable individuals for posts within the administration is important for strengthening good governance, human rights, the rule of law and economic growth in Afghanistan, many of the factors that influence opium poppy cultivation go well beyond the appointment of specific individuals.</p>

 The media in Haiti is dominated by private radio stations and while levels of state censorship are low, there are problems such as violence against journalists and resulting self-censorship. Press freedom was severely limited in Haiti during former President Aristide's period in office, which ended in February 2004. While some improvements in the situation were reported in the following months, the situation remained fragile under the interim Government that led Haiti until this year's presidential elections. There were a number of reports of violent attacks on journalists by armed gangs, and of impunity for the perpetrators in that interim period. An event of particular concern was the kidnap and murder of journalist Jacques Roche in July 2005. Bringing those responsible for attacks on press freedom to justice is essential and is one of the motivations behind the UN Stabilisation Mission in Haiti's focus on the reform of the police and judicial system. Encouragingly, the recently elected President, Rene Preval, has also expressed his determination to tackle this and other human rights problems in Haiti.</p>

The payment is tax-free and is paid for a maximum of 52 weeks. It is payable on top of any other in-work benefits which eligible parents may be entitled to, for example working tax credit and housing benefit. The IWC is primarily paid to lone parents but in April 2005, it was extended to other eligible parents in four London Jobcentre Plus districts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_219"><a name="61019w0014.htm_para1"><a name="06101964000164">We have commissioned a full evaluation of the IWC to assess the impact of the pilot on eligible parents, including movements off benefit and into work. Initial findings from the quantitative evaluation are expected to be published in February 2007. In addition, a qualitative evaluation has explored the impact of the pilots on the attitudes, motivations and actions of participants, and will also examine the effectiveness of delivery. We expect to publish this report in spring 2007.</p>

1. Median weekly household incomes are shown as equivalised pounds in 2004-05 prices. Equivalisation is the process by which household income is adjusted by household size and composition as a proxy for material living standards.<br>
2. The median has been used as the measure of the average income in the three lowest deciles in line with HBAI conventions. This median measure is preferred to the mean because it measures the central income of the group and for the lowest decile it is less influenced by possibly unrepresentative outliers.<br>
3. All estimates are subject to sampling error and response bias and small changes between years may be influenced by these. While results for individual years may be sensitive to the way in which household incomes are adjusted for size and composition, the picture of changes over time is less sensitive to this.<br>

 As a result of the measures we have introduced since 1997, we will be spending &#163;10.5 billion more on pensioners this year than would otherwise have been the case. Our policies target help on the poorest pensioners in particular, with over &#163;5 billion of the additional money going to the poorest third of pensioners. Between 1996-97 and 2004-05, the number of pensioners living in relative low income, fell from 2.8 million to 1.8 million, and a pensioner in Britain today is no more likely to be in poverty than anyone else.</p>

Additional help is provided through benefits in kind such as free prescriptions, eye tests, bus travel and television licences, and help with home insulation. Around &#163;14 billion will be spent on benefits targeted on low-income pensioners: pension credit, housing benefit and council tax benefit. This ensures that no single pensioner need live on less than &#163;114.05 a week, and no couple on less than &#163;174.05 a week.</p>

 &#147;A Vision for Pharmacy in the New NHS&#148;, published in July 2003, advocated the strengthening of communication about patients&#146; medicines between hospitals, community pharmacists and general practitioners. The national health service national prescribing centre (NPC), as part of the sharing of best practice through the medicines management collaborative, has developed guidance concerning the timely and accurate sharing of information about patients&#146; medicines when patients are transferred between care settings. The guidance is available on the NPC website at:www.npc.co.uk/mms/FiveMinGuides/index.htm. The method by which information is transferred is a matter for local decision.

<p><a name="stpa_257"><a name="61019w0020.htm_para6"><a name="0610209000764">It is not possible to say how many women have been screened using LBC techniques in each strategic health authority. Statistics on the programme are collected annually, and those programmes who converted to LBC would have done so at different times during the years of roll-out. As 72 per cent. of local screening programmes will have implemented LBC by 31 March 2007, we would expect nearly three million women to benefit from their cervical screening samples being processed with LBC techniques in 2007-08.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_258"><a name="61019w0020.htm_para7"><a name="0610209000765">LBC techniques began being introduced into the programme following a National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) technology appraisal published in October 2003. NICE is currently considering whether to review the appraisal based on any new evidence, which would include evidence from the national roll-out. Strict quality assurance and data collection are operated within the programme, and we would expect to start seeing an effect of LBC on the rate of inadequate samples when the statistics for 2005-06 are published in December 2006.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_259"><a name="61019w0020.htm_para8"><a name="0610209000766">Women are only offered human papilloma virus (HPV) testing in the NHS as part of clinical trials. As part of the pilot of LBC, which took place between 2001 and 2002, we also piloted the use of HPV testing as triage for women with mild or borderline test results. Following the receipt of the independent evaluation report of the HPV arm of the pilot in 2004, the advisory committee on cervical screening set up a dedicated working group to advise on how best to introduce HPV testing into the NHS cervical screening programme. A protocol for HPV testing sentinel sites has been developed, and the sites are expected to begin operations in 2007.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_260"><a name="61019w0020.htm_para9"><a name="0610209000767">There is currently insufficient evidence to support the use of HPV testing as a primary screening tool.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health what the evidential basis was for the recent statement made by the Minister of State that pregnant teenagers smoke to try to reduce the size of their babies, and make delivery less painful; what steps she <i> (a)</i> has taken and <i> (b)</i> plans to take to warn pregnant teenagers of the risks of smoking to (i) themselves and (ii) their unborn babies; and if she will make a statement.

 I made the observation, after having heard this issue anecdotally from both health professionals and young women, that some young pregnant women may take the message that smoking leads to low birth weight babies and that low birth weight or smaller babies may make childbirth less painful. It is important that we understand what stops young women making healthy choices and tailor our messages accordingly. In this case childbirth is no less painful if your baby is low weight.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_269"><a name="61019w0022.htm_para0"><a name="0610209001153">The Department&#146;s advice remains that women should not smoke during pregnancy. Women who smoke are less likely to carry their babies to full term and there is a 26 per cent. increased risk that they will miscarry or experience a stillbirth. Babies of smoking mothers are an average 200 g lighter at birth.</p>
