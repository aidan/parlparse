The repayment of the capital value is an element of this unitary charge but it is not the only cost covered. Other elements of the unitary charge can include inflation and service provision. We are not able to specify the exact breakdown of the unitary charge payments into these different elements, but have indicated for each scheme the type of costs that are covered by the charge. In each case, the unitary charge payments are projections to the end of the contract and are conditional on the performance of the private sector contractor.</p>

In response to the situation, the World Food Programme has already distributed food rations to cover needs in December, and agencies have put in place measures to allow most basic services to be continued if there was a full evacuation. Maintaining water supply is a major concern, due to the depth of the groundwater. If systems in the camps were to break down and agencies were unable to repair them, refugee and IDP populations would be forced to seek water elsewhere.

In his meetings, my right hon. Friend urged the caretaker government to act in a non-partisan manner to deliver free, fair, peaceful and accepted elections. He emphasised the need for responsible leadership and restraint from the parties in Bangladesh.

The degree of political freedom and debate in the run up to the election was unprecedented. We were disturbed that subsequent disputes over the election results led to civil unrest and violence which resulted in the tragic death of many people. There were also widespread arrests and allegations of human rights abuses. The main Opposition leaders and some civil society representatives remain in detention facing serious charges including genocide and treason. Since the election there has been a closing down of political space for the Opposition, the independent media and civil society.</p>
