<P>
<P>
<a name="30901w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Si&#244;n Simon: </B> 
To ask the Minister for Women what entitlements are available to women who act as carers who have been receiving Carer's Allowance, once they have become entitled to state pension.  [126105]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30901w01.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 Women entitled to both Carer's Allowance and State Pension receive the latter because the social security overlapping benefits rules give precedence to payment of State Pension, which is a contributory benefit, over payment of a non-contributory benefit such as Carer's Allowance. If the weekly amount of State Pension paid is less than the weekly rate of Carer's Allowance, the amount by which the Carer's Allowance exceeds State Pension is also paid. In addition, such carers may also be entitled to the carer premium if they are in receipt of an income related benefit, to a State Second Pension, other social security benefits depending on their circumstances, and the Christmas Bonus and Winter Fuel Payments.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30901w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Alexander: </B> 
 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="30901w01.html_para0">Departments and agencies are responsible for undertaking their own equal pay review and producing an action plan. It is for individual departments to determine whether they will place a copy in the Library.
<P>

<a name="30901w01.html_para1">The Cabinet Office is considering the actions contained in departmental action plans and will be publishing a summary of the findings after the summer recess.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30901w01.html_wqn2"><B> Keith Vaz: </B> 
To ask the Solicitor-General if she will make a statement on her practice in appointing trial counsel in Attorney-General reference cases.  [125995]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30901w01.html_spmin0"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 The Crown Prosecution Service instructs counsel on behalf of the Attorney-General in Attorney-General reference cases. These are cases that are referred to the Court of Appeal under section 36 of the Criminal Justice Act 1972 and sections 35 and 36 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 either on a point of law or because they come within the 



<P>
<P><I>1 Sept 2003 : Column 666W</I><P>
unduly lenient sentence provisions, under which the Attorney-General refers a case to the Court of Appeal to have the sentence reviewed on the grounds that it is unduly lenient.
<P>

<a name="30901w01.html_para2">The Crown Prosecution Service usually instructs Senior Treasury Counsel or Junior Treasury Counsel to undertake this work. Treasury Counsel are very experienced counsel, used by the Crown for serious work. When instructing counsel, the Crown Prosecution Service considers the seniority of counsel, the specialist areas of work in which counsel practises and the ability of counsel to return work at the specified time. In deciding which counsel to instruct, the Crown Prosecution Service strives to promote consistency in the decision-making process.
<P>

<a name="30901w01.html_para3">In cases concerning potentially unduly lenient sentences it is considered to be of particular benefit to have new counsel to consider the facts. Consistency in these applications is maintained by restricting them to Treasury Counsel, who build up expertise in this field of work.

To ask the Solicitor-General how many lawyers left the Crown Prosecution Service in 2002.  [125782]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30901w01.html_spmin1"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 During 2002, 83 lawyers (i.e. 3.56 per cent. of the average legal staff in post) ceased working for the Crown Prosecution Service. Of those, 27 were early retirements, 22 were resignations, eight were standard retirements, 11 were dismissals, nine were transfers to other Government Departments, four were early severance and two were deaths.
<P>

<a name="30901w01.html_para4">Within the same period, and as part of the Government's commitment in the White Paper, "Criminal Justice&#151;The Way Ahead", 251 lawyers (i.e 10.76 per cent. of the average legal staff in post) joined the Service.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30901w01.html_wqn4"><B> Llew Smith: </B> 
To ask the Solicitor-General what information the Attorney-General has <i>(a)</i> requested and <i>(b)</i> received from (i) the United States Secretary for Defense and (ii) the US Attorney General in respect of the legal rights and legal representation to be afforded to detainees held at camp X-ray in Guantanamo Bay in Cuba by the United States Administration.  [126318]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30901w01.html_spmin2"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 <i>(a)</i> The Attorney-General has raised the position of the UK nationals detained in Guantanamo Bay with the United States Department of Defense, which has responsibility for this matter, to express the Government's profound concern that if the UK detainees are to be tried they should have a fair trial with all proper safeguards, including legal representation, and to make plain the Government's opposition to the imposition of the death penalty.
<P>

<a name="30901w01.html_para5">During a meeting with the then US Assistant Attorney General in September 2002, the Attorney-General raised the Government's concern about the position of the UK nationals detained in Guantanamo

Bay. The Attorney-General has had no discussions about the Guantanamo Bay detainees with the US Attorney General.
<P>

<a name="30901w01.html_para6"><i>(b)</i> The Department of Defense has responded to the Attorney-General that detainees in Guantanamo Bay are held as enemy combatants under the laws of armed conflict and as such are not entitled to legal representation. They explained that their view is that the procedures of the military commissions established to try individuals designated under the US President's Military Order of 13 November 2001 provide for detainees to have access to defence counsel if the individual has been charged with an offence. They have also stated that they believe that the military commissions constitute an impartial and regularly constituted court respecting generally recognised principles of regular judicial procedure.
<P>

<a name="30901w01.html_para7">However, the Attorney-General continues to have serious concerns about these issues, and is in Washington on 21 and 22 July to discuss the matter further with senior members of the US Administration.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30901w01.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Watts: </B> 
To ask the Solicitor-General how many individuals have been successfully prosecuted for illegal trading in the last three years.  [125208]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30901w01.html_spmin3"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) and the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) among others prosecute offences of companies that continue to trade while insolvent.
<P>

<a name="30901w01.html_para8">The Serious Fraud Office has prosecuted one defendant in the last three years for an offence under section 458 of the Companies Act 1985.
<P>

<a name="30901w01.html_para9">The CPS's centrally held records do not include offence-based information about the cases that it prosecutes. It is therefore not possible to say, without incurring disproportionate cost, how many individuals have been prosecuted for such offences over the last three years.
<P>

<a name="30901w01.html_para10">The CPS is currently rolling out a new Compass Case Management System that will capture offence-based information from across the Service's 42 Areas.

these contracts is worth; with whom they are signed; how many have been renegotiated; how many are still in place; and if she will make a statement.  [126210]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30901w01.html_spmin4"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 The information requested is as follows.
<P>

<a name="30901w01.html_para12"><i>Crown Prosecution Service</i>
<P>

<a name="30901w01.html_para13">The Compass contract was awarded to LogicaCMG (formerly Logica UK Limited) on 31 December 2001 under a Private Finance Initiative procurement to provide a fully managed IT service .to the Crown Prosecution Service. The Compass contract is for 10 years with the option of extending it for a further 5 years. Over 10 years the cost is currently estimated to be &#163;275 million. This is subject to change as user numbers change and/or additional facilities are required. There has been no renegotiation of the contract.
<P>

<a name="30901w01.html_para14"><i>Serious Fraud Office and Legal Secretariat to the Law Officers</i>
<P>

<a name="30901w01.html_para15">There is one material contract relating to "Outsourced IT contracts" for the provision of IT support services. This contract is with IBM and originated as a comprehensive, PFI outsourcing in 1998. It was re-negotiated at end 2000 as a fixed-price, support agreement, subject to an inflation-related annual increase. The value of the agreement is affected by privity of contract but it has been considered to offer sufficient value for money that it was subsequently extended to provide support for the Legal Secretariat to the Law Officers. IBM charges the Serious Fraud Office for this extension and the Serious Fraud Office recharges to the Legal Secretariat to the Law Officers. Prior to 1998 IT was supported in-house both at the Serious Fraud Office and the Legal Secretariat to the Law Officers.
<P>

<a name="30901w01.html_para16"><i>HM Crown Prosecution Service</i>
<P>

<a name="30901w01.html_para17">Since its inception in October 2000, HM Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate has relied on the Crown Prosecution Service for the provision of its IT services. However, it used separate one-off contracts with commercial suppliers for the initial design and continuous improvement of its website. In 2002 this contract work totalled &#163;5,000.
<P>

<a name="30901w01.html_para18">The design of the website is such that the majority of maintenance work can be conducted in-house. Any specific improvements, or work beyond the in-house capability would be subject to the awarding of separate contracts.
<P>

<a name="30901w01.html_para19">HM Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate has budgeted for a maximum cost per annum of &#163;5,000 for both this work and the hosting of the website.
<P>

<a name="30901w01.html_para20"><i>Treasury Solicitor's Department</i>
<P>

<a name="30901w01.html_para21">Since 1997, the Treasury Solicitor's Department has entered into no contracts where an external organisation delivers and operates IT service on the Department's behalf. The Department's in-house Information Services team provides the IT services for the Department, generally using commercially available software, supported by contractors where necessary.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister pursuant to his answer of 19 May 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 653W, on the National Land Information System, what steps the Government have taken in the past 12 months to encourage local authorities to transfer their land and property information to electronic local land and property gazetteers to link into the National Land Information System.  [126638]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30901w02.html_spnew0"><B> Keith Hill: </B> 
 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is responsible for the Local e-Government programme, which is supporting the electronic enablement of the local authority services in England, including the development of an electronic National Land and Property Gazetteer (NLPG).
<P>

<a name="30901w02.html_para0">The Government have encouraged the recording of land and property information, as a means of providing both an improved service to customers making land charge searches, and an improved, consistent database for the authority's own use. In particular, on 24 July 2002, the Lord Chancellor, my right hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich and Woolwich (Mr. Raynsford), the leader of the Welsh Assembly and the Chairman of the Local Government Association and the Welsh Local Government Association jointly wrote to all local authority Chief Executives in England and Wales, pointing out the benefits of the NLPG, and of the one-stop shop for land and property related information provided by the National Land Information Services (NLIS). The benefits include saving staff time otherwise wasted on maintaining duplicate address lists, and improved service delivery based on accurate, up to date address data. My hon. Friend the Member for Pontefract and Castleford (Yvette Cooper), the then Parliamentary Secretary for the Lord Chancellor's Department and my hon. Friend the Member for Shipley (Mr. Leslie), followed up the letter by hosting a reception on 8 October 2002 for local authorities which had committed to NLIS.
<P>

<a name="30901w02.html_para1">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister also asked every authority in England to prepare and submit an implementing e-Government (IEG) statement in 2001 and 2002, in return for which they would receive &#163;200,000 to help implement the e-Government plan set

out in it. Authorities were asked to include some key data in their statements, including indicating whether they were committed to NLPG and NLIS. Following assessment of the IEGs submitted in 2002, Ministers of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister sought (with the agreement of the Local Government Association and other stakeholders) parliamentary approval for the use of &#163;2.2 million from the Local e-Government programme funds to ensure that all local authorities were committed to supporting the NLPG by December 2003. Specifically, this will fund work to identify the barriers to implementation of the NLPG. Where implemented the NLPG will provide basis for electronic land and property information searches by NLIS and other compatible services. It will remain a decision for local authorities as to whether or not to link to NLIS.

 I refer the hon. Member to the reply given by my hon.

The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister will continue fully to support policies and proposals by local authorities that are soundly based on such assessments. This process will also be aided by the more strategic and coherent approach to housing issues provided by the new South West Regional Housing Board established in February by the Deputy Prime Minister.

Friend the Deputy Prime Minister has no plans to visit North-East Lincolnshire and has made no recommendations to North-East Lincolnshire about large scale voluntary transfer in particular, although all authorities are required to have in place arrangements to ensure the delivery of the decent homes target by December 2010. Housing transfer is one of three options available to an authority where additional resources are required to meet this target.

 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's target set, following the 2000 spending review, is to reduce the number of fire-related deaths in the home by 20 per cent. averaged over the five year period to 31 March 2004 compared with the average for the five-year period to 31 March 1999. The base line figure is 379, so the average in the five years ending 31 March 2004 would need to be no more than 303.

<P>
<a name="30901w03.html_spnew5"><B> Keith Hill: </B> 
 The means test for disabled facilities grant (DFG) is kept under continual review and updated annually. The means test is broadly based on the eligibility rules for housing benefit and compares weekly household income with a set of standardised expenditure allowances. In cases where a household contains a disabled child the DFG means test provides for a higher housing cost allowance, which has the effect of increasing the level of grant entitlement for that household.

 As part of the normal Whitehall process Ministers and officials have had regular correspondence with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to discuss all aspects of the Convention, including legislative competence. In line with exceptions 1 and 2 of the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information, it is not the normal practice of Governments to disclose details about internal discussions, or information whose disclosure would harm the conduct of international relations or affairs.

 European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) is planned in calendar years rather than English financial years. Figures in the table below show details of allocations and targets for each region, both for this and the following calendar year. Spend so far for this year is also shown. Whilst spend is difficult to project (e.g. because of exchange rate fluctuations) regions are working to reach the targets shown.

 Local authority support for Somali community organisations is a matter for individual local authorities. The local government finance system takes into account the costs local authorities face in educating children who need additional support in English or who come from low-achieving ethnic backgrounds. There is also a top-up to reflect the cost of translation services.

 Information annually reported to the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister by local authorities identifies expenditure incurred in respect of bed and breakfast, private sector leasing and all other forms of temporary accommodation used by homeless households. This includes associated costs, such as the provision of furniture, property maintenance/refurbishment, rent guarantees, nomination fees and administrative costs, chargeable to the general fund services revenue account, along with any specific capital charges. Latest available information is for 2001&#150;02, when it is estimated that gross expenditure on homelessness in England amounted to some &#163;436.0 million. Net total costs&#151;after taking into account rents received directly from tenants, and housing benefit payments such as rent allowance&#151;amounted to &#163;190.75 million. In addition, net expenditure on homelessness funded from the housing

<P>

<a name="30901w04.html_para0">The return does not seek corresponding information on average unit costs but, from estimates of household-days spent in temporary accommodation derived from quarterly statistical returns, it is estimated that the overall average gross cost per household during 2001&#150;02, including HRA-funded expenditure, was some &#163;156 per week. The average net cost per household, excluding housing benefit/rent allowances and rent payments met directly by tenants, was &#163;73 per week.

<a name="30901w04.html_spnew4"><B> Keith Hill: </B> 
 The Regulatory Reform (Housing Assistance) (England and Wales) Order 2002, which took effect on 18 July 2002, gave local authorities new and wide ranging powers to provide financial assistance, including by way of grant, for these purposes. The Government consulted a wide range of stakeholders before introducing these new powers and there was overwhelming support for these changes.

<a name="30901w04.html_spnew5"><B> Keith Hill: </B> 
 Identification of the nine market renewal pathfinder areas and the policy approach on low demand and abandonment set out in "Sustainable Communities: Building for the Future" has been underpinned by a range of data available to the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, in particular Housing Investment Programme data and other published evidence including regional and local level data published by CURS at the University of Birmingham on changing demand.
<P>

<a name="30901w04.html_para1">A key remit of the pathfinders is to restructure the housing markets in their areas so that they are returned to places where people want to live and stay. We are clear that this is not something that can be left to the market alone to resolve. That route offers a prospect of years of neglect that will endanger economic resurgence and cause untold suffering for the communities affected. Turning round these areas will require long-term commitment. We have already signalled the Government's commitment through the creation of a &#163;500 million market renewal fund for investment in the pathfinder areas over the next three years. Tackling poor housing stock and empty homes will be a crucial part of the pathfinders work.

<P>
<a name="30901w05.html_spnew1"><B> Keith Hill: </B> 
 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister does not consider it prudent for local authorities to borrow against the security of their capital assets, since the potential seizure of property by creditors would pose an unacceptable threat to the delivery of services. Similarly it is not proposed to allow authorities to sell future streams of revenue such as rents, in return for immediate one-off payments. The Local Government

 86 local authorities have completed 117 large scale voluntary transfers since 1 April 1997. During this period, tenants have not supported the transfer proposal in 23 ballots. There are 38 transfer schemes in progress. Housing transfer is one of three options available to authorities for meeting the decent home target where additional resources are required. By July 2005, all stock-owning authorities are required to have completed an investment option appraisal, with the full involvement of tenants, to decide on the best means of meeting the decent home target for their stock.

These are likely to change as details of transfer proposals are finalised. These payments reflect the liability the office would have had to meet as ongoing Housing Revenue Account (HRA) subsidy if these authorities retained their stock. In respect of the authorities liable to require overhanging debt payments over the two years concerned, the total estimated provision for the Major Repairs Allowances (MRA) within the Housing Revenue Account subsidy is &#163;124.2 million in 2003&#150;04 and &#163;122.3 million in 2004&#150;05.

<a name="30901w06.html_para1">On Tuesday 15 July 2003 Deloitte and Touche published their report of the Implementation Review of the Ten Commitments to Best Siting Practice for the UK Mobile Industry. A copy of the report is available in the Library of the House. The opinion of Deloitte & Touche is the evidence they have seen of the operators' processes and procedures during the review fairly reflects the operators' assertion that they have made demonstrable progress in implementing the Ten Commitments. However, given the relatively new nature of some of the Commitments at the time of the review some of the processes were not fully operational and there were some areas where implementation was not comprehensive or thorough. Deloitte and Touche made 46 recommendations for improving procedures and all the mobile network operators have accepted all the recommendations.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what his policy is on public housing investment in <i>(a)</i> the south-east and <i>(b)</i> the south-west; how many homes were built in the south-west in each of the last 10 years; and if he will make a statement on the reasons underlying the trend.  [126932]<P>

<P>
<a name="30901w06.html_spnew7"><B> Keith Hill: </B> 
 The policy of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister on public housing investment is set out in "Sustainable Communities in the South East and Sustainable Communities in the South West", which made clear the actions that will be taken on a regional basis to deliver a step change in addressing the balance between supply and demand of housing.
<P>

<a name="30901w06.html_para3">Funding for the provision of affordable housing in the south-west has increased to &#163;81 million for 2003&#150;04, compared to just under &#163;62 million for 2002&#150;03. The programme is expected to deliver around 2,000 new affordable homes for the region in 2003&#150;04. Funding for the provision of affordable housing in the south-east has increased to &#163;146 million, compared to just under &#163;114 million for 2002&#150;03.

</UL></FONT><a name="30901w07.html_wqn2"><B> Dr. Desmond Turner: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister pursuant to his written ministerial statement of 16 June 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 2WS, on what basis he calculated that the cost of a national tenancy deposit scheme would be &#163;19 million per annum and the benefits equal to &#163;20 million.  [126812]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30901w07.html_spnew2"><B> Keith Hill: </B> 
 The calculations for both these figures are to be found in Annex 1 of the consultation paper "Tenancy Money: probity and protection". They start from a figure derived from the Survey of English Housing (SEH), that there are 127,000 tenancies ending each year in which there is a dispute about the deposit. The total cost is found from multiplying this figure by the average cost of each adjudication in the pilot Tenancy Deposit Scheme (TDS), &#163;150. The benefit is found from multiplying the derived figure on deposit disputes by the average level of deposit (&#163;510, SEH data) and by the average proportion of the total deposit an independent adjudicator would consider should be returned to the tenant (31 per cent. taken from data on disputes in the TDS).
<P>
<P>
<a name="30901w07.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Pound: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what estimate he has made of <i>(a)</i> the maximum annual adjudication costs and <i>(b)</i> the likely annual adjudication costs of a statutory rent deposit protection scheme.  [127050]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30901w07.html_spnew3"><B> Keith Hill: </B> 
 As my hon. Friend the Member for Harrow, East (Mr. McNulty) mentioned in his statement of 16 June 2003, <i>Official Report,</i> column 2WS, it is estimated that adjudication costs of a statutory scheme would be &#163;19 million. This is a best estimate based on survey findings of tenancy numbers and level of deposit, statistics on perceived prevalence of wrongful withholding of deposit moneys, and the adjudication cost per dispute in the pilot scheme.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30901w07.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Pound: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what estimates he has made of the amount of interest that would be generated by holding all rent deposit money in a single custodial scheme.  [127051]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30901w07.html_spnew4"><B> Keith Hill: </B> 
 The consultation paper "Tenancy Money: probity and protection" provides an assessment in paragraph 35 of the Regulatory Impact Assessment at Annex 1. It noted that if &#163;790 million (the amount estimated to be currently held in deposits) was held in a single custodial deposit scheme for a year, it would raise &#163;31.6 million in interest (calculated at the Bank of England's then current base-rate).
<P>
<P>
<a name="30901w07.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Pound: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister how many responses were received to the consultation on "Tenancy money: probity and protection"; how many responses were received from <i>(a)</i> individual landlords and agents and their representative bodies and <i>(b)</i> individual tenants and their representative bodies; of those respondents who were not individual landlords, agents and tenants or their representative bodies, what percentage of respondents were (i) in favour and (ii) not in favour of a statutory custodial scheme to protect tenants' deposits.  [127052]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30901w07.html_spnew5"><B> Keith Hill: </B> 
 Ninety-eight responses were received. Of these, 26 were from landlords and nine from landlord organisations; eight from letting agents and five from agent organisations; three from tenants and four from tenant organisations/representatives; 13 from local 



<P>
<P><I>1 Sept 2003 : Column 692W</I><P>
authorities; 24 from other organisations (of which 16 were public or voluntary sector); two from other interested individuals; and four from respondents whose type was not known.
<P>

<a name="30901w07.html_para3">Of the 43 respondents not in categories involved in letting or their representatives, 30 responded to the options concerning whether there should be Government intervention; and if so, of the three options which each included a statutory custodial scheme, which option they favoured. Two favoured no intervention; four favoured or appeared to favour a statutory scheme, but with no further details; favoured a custodial scheme as the sole option; two favoured a custodial scheme plus approved insured alternatives; five favoured a custodial scheme plus membership of an approved trade association or accreditation scheme that would provide insurance. There were four further options involving deposits (that did not involved a statutory custodial scheme), which respondents could indicate either instead of or in addition to the ones mentioned here.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what the refusal rate for waste disposal applications within the terms of county matters was for the last four quarters of the year.  [126918]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30901w07.html_spnew6"><B> Keith Hill: </B> 
 For 'County Matter' applications, the provisional numbers supplied to this Office for the four quarters ending 31 March 2003 show a total of 105 refused applications among the 1,154 decisions on waste applications. This is a refusal rate of 9 per cent. As there are relatively small numbers of 'County Matter' applications made and decided each quarter, refusal rates for individual quarters can be quite volatile. In 2002&#150;03, the quarterly refusal rates ranged from 7 per cent. to 12 per cent.

<a name="30901w07.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Alexander: </B> 
 As part of the normal Whitehall process my officials have had regular contact with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to discuss all aspects of the Convention, including legislative competences. My officials have also had regular contact with Member and Accession States to discuss issues arising in the Convention. In line with exemptions 1 and 2 of the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information, it is not the normal practice of Governments to disclose details about internal discussions, or information whose disclosure would harm the conduct of international relations or affairs.

It includes individual Departments' assessment of their short- and long-term skills needs to meet priorities, an assessment of their current talent pools and what they are doing to develop individuals through career moves and broader development.

<P>
<a name="30901w10.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Sutcliffe: </B> 
 The UK is in favour of legislation to provide minimum standards of employment protection, but is keen to maintain the flexibility our individual labour market requires, and which many individual workers prefer. Last year, we implemented new rights for employees on fixed-term contracts in a way that provides a high level of protection for these employees, without unnecessarily reducing employers' flexibility to use fixed-term contracts. We must allow workers choice as well as protection. The proposed Directive on temporary agency work is currently being considered by the European Council of Ministers. The Directive would not need to be implemented in the UK unless and until it is adopted. The Government are keenly aware of the potential impact on UK agencies and agency workers of a Directive that takes no account of conditions in the UK labour market. We are therefore pressing very hard for the UK's legitimate concerns to be recognised.

 The Government's approach to raising productivity centres on maintaining macroeconomic stability to allow firms and individuals to invest for the future, as well as implementing microeconomic reforms to remove the barriers which prevent markets from functioning efficiently. The Government are addressing historic microeconomic weaknesses in five areas that drive productivity growth&#151;investment, innovation, skills, enterprise and competitive markets.

In order to enhance the DTI's capacity to achieve these goals, we are currently working to develop a new strategy. This strategy will set out our longer-term direction; allow us to meet the expectations of our key stakeholders and guide the annual business planning process. The strategy will make the maximum use of the evidence base to inform both policy and delivery.

 <i>[holding answer 23 June 2003]:</i> The Department of Health will continue to have responsibility for the Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service, and as before will continue to work in close co-operation with the Department for Education and Skills. I will be working closely with ministerial colleagues in the Department of Health to address the needs of children and young people who require co-ordinated support from health and social services, including those with mental health problems. In particular we will be collaborating closely in the development of the forthcoming Children's National service Framework, which will set out standards for delivery of health and social care services for children, and DfES and DH will continue to have joint responsibility for the development of policy on Children's Trusts.

<a name="30901w13.html_para4">These initiatives supplement others which are available throughout the country to support our aims of providing affordable, quality child care for all parents. They include the child care element of the new working tax credit, which builds on the success of the child care tax credit to support working parents by adding greater flexibility and an extension of the range of eligible child care; and the expansion of free, part-time early years education, which is available to all 4-years-olds and will be available to all 3-year-olds from April 2004. In addition, developments in out of school care including before and after school and during weekends and holidays are making a real difference for children and their families. While the focus of these clubs is care for the children outside the school day, the provision is also about positive play and learning experiences. We launched extended schools through the Education Act 2002, giving schools the powers to provide community facilities, including child care. Child care in schools provides safe, accessible child care for children attending the school and children in the wider community.

 Sites for academies are usually provided by local education authorities, which transfer ownership to the academies themselves, on a leasehold or freehold basis. Where an academy is sponsored by a church, however, particularly if it replaces an existing church school, the site may be provided by a religious foundation.
<P>

<a name="30901w14.html_para0">Our normal expectation is that the site and buildings of an academy will revert to whichever body provided the site initially, in the event they are no longer required for the purposes of the academy. Individual academy funding agreements will make specific provision for this. Where a local education authority has transferred the land or buildings to an academy trust the Secretary of State has powers to transfer the land back to the authority if the academy ceases to exist or moves to another site.

It gives youth workers and the police a number of options to offer young people through a range of activities provided in leisure centres. Last year, 500 young people became involved in 'Youth Only Zone' through the Youth Service.

<a name="30901w14.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 The Education Formula Spending (EPS) system, which distributes the bulk of the financial support for schools, sets out not to provide the same level of funding for all pupils but to allow for the extra costs of educating children with additional needs, those in rural areas with sparse populations and those in areas where it costs more to recruit and retain staff. Therefore there are differences in the levels of funding which authorities receive recognising the differences in circumstances. For that reason, Leicestershire receives &#163;380 per pupil (10 per cent.) less in overall resources than the "top" funded county outside London but since 1997&#150;98 (the last year for which comparable data are available) real terms funding in Leicestershire has increased by 620 (29 per cent.) for primary pupils and by 550 (19 per cent.) for secondary pupils. The following table sets out the other information requested in cash terms between 1997&#150;98 and 2003&#150;04. For 2004&#150;05, we are working with representatives of schools and local education authorities to ensure that every school receives a reasonable per pupil settlement.

 <i>21st Century Skills: Realising Our Potential</i> sets out the National Employment Panel's role in implementing the Skills Strategy. The Panel will work with the Department for Work and Pensions and the Department for Education and Skills to consider how best to strengthen the links between placing people in jobs and supporting claimants in gaining skills for sustainable employment. The Panel will also review how best to help those on inactive benefits (some of whom have been out of the labour market for a long time) to develop their job-related skills and qualifications where this provides a route out of benefit dependency. The Panel will make recommendations by the end of 2003.
<P>

<a name="30901w15.html_para7">The National Employment Panel will also continue to give advice to Ministers for Education and Skills and for Work and Pensions on issues concerning the interface between skills and employment policy. Where relevant, this advice will be considered by the Skills Alliance.

<P>
<UL>(2) if he will indicate how the proposals in the Skills Strategy (Cm 5810) take forward the European economic reform agenda agreed at Lisbon in 2000 in <i>(a)</i> domestic and <i>(b)</i> international context.  [126800]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30901w15.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 In elaborating the Lisbon agenda, the European Council has set targets to raise the overall level of skills across the European Union. Member states contribute to the achievement of these targets through their own national strategies and policies. The Skills Strategy will contribute particularly by raising the skill levels and employability of adults in this country 



<P>
<P><I>1 Sept 2003 : Column 728W</I><P>
through the new entitlement to free tuition for adults seeking their first level 2 qualification, increased support for higher level skills in areas of sectoral or regional priority and by helping adults gain ICT skills as a third basic skill alongside literacy and numeracy.
<P>

<a name="30901w15.html_para8">Within the overall Lisbon agenda, the European Employment Strategy (EES) provides a framework for reaching key Lisbon employment rate targets. Under the EES, member states develop their national employment strategies and policies in the light of the shared priorities agreed at EU level. For the UK these include providing appropriate guidance in the context of initial training and lifelong learning, modernising the apprenticeship system, tackling poor basic skills and promoting better access to learning for adults, including through the promotion of e-learning. These are all being addressed in the Skills Strategy, which will therefore contribute to the EES by equipping workers in this country with the skills they need for lifetime employability and providing other member states with a model for how to develop the skills base demanded by the modern labour market.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30901w15.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 My Department will establish the Strategic Communications Group in the near future so that a communication and marketing plan for skills can be agreed by the end of this year, as set out in the Skills White Paper.

<P>
<a name="30901w15.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Boswell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills how he defines <i>(a)</i> low skills equilibrium and <i>(b)</i> high skills equilibrium as referred to in the Skills White Paper.  [126797]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30901w15.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 The low skills equilibrium theory is where, due to adaptation over a number of years to the poor availability of skills in the work force, UK companies often engage in producing more basic, less customised and less skill intensive products than their competitors overseas. This reduces the incentives for individuals and employers to acquire skills, thus becomes self-reinforcing. As we set out in the Underlying Evidence paper for the Skills Strategy that we published in March, it is a vicious circle of low skills, low wages and consumer demand for cheap products and services. The Skills Strategy White Paper makes no reference to a high skills equilibrium.

 The Department for Education and Skills produces a Regulatory Impact Assessment where a proposed policy is likely to have an impact on business, charities and the voluntary sector. The Regulatory Impact Assessment includes an environmental impact appraisal where this is deemed appropriate. Since June 2001, none of the Department's Regulatory Impact Assessments have included an environmental assessment.

<a name="30901w16.html_para0">The Department also has additional procedures in place to ensure environmental appraisal of policy. Examples of policy issues that have included appraisal of environmental impacts are: guidance to schools in England on energy and water; obtaining accreditation for environmental management of one of our headquarters sites to 'an international standard'; and, in the curriculum, the Growing Schools initiative.
<P>

<a name="30901w16.html_para1">We have not published information on these appraisals.

 The Youth Cohort Study shows that around nine in 10 young people who achieve two or more A-levels by 18 progress to Higher Education by the time they are 21. Differences in participation rates between different social class groups largely reflect differences in prior attainment.

It found that among those who were qualified to enter higher education but had decided against going the main reasons were because they wanted to start work, because they did not need a higher education qualification for their chosen career or because of the expected costs involved.

The evidence shows that non-completion is a complex process that cannot normally be explained by any single factor.

By the end of the decade they want to move towards half of all 18&#150;30 year olds participating in HE, but within that target they are committed to ensuring that all those who can benefit from HE will be willing and able to do so, regardless of their background. 'Aimhigher' is the brand name for a range of initiatives through which Government and their key partners aim to widen participation in HE. HEFCE has allocated &#163;265 million to higher education institutions in 2003&#150;04 for widening access and improving retention. This figure recognises the additional costs of supporting students from non-traditional backgrounds and thereby increases the likelihood that they will complete their courses successfully.

We will continue to provide a tuition fee remission grant and, from autumn 2004, full-time HE students with parents on the lowest incomes will be eligible for a new HE Grant of up to &#163;1,000 a year for living costs. No student or parent will have to pay any up-front tuition fee&#151;they can defer paying these until after they graduate. We are also raising the level of repayment from &#163;10,000 to &#163;15,000 to reduce the levels of repayment for all graduates.

<sup>(27)</sup> There are discontinuities in the time series caused by Local Government Reorganisations. Also, UCAS do not hold domicile breakdowns for all new authorities in the year that reorganisation took place and so some participation rates for new authorities are not shown until the following year.<P>

<P>

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. Participation rates have been calculated using the 17-year-old population from the previous year to reduce the distortion caused to LEA populations by the migration of students to their place of study. However, any migration, for whatever reason, at age 17 will affect the rates shown here, particularly between authorities that are geographically close, for example in the London area.<P>

2. Accepted applicants with unknown English domiciles are excluded from the figures.<P>

3. Population figures relate to persons aged 17 as at 31 August in the year prior to entry, counts taken at the following 1 January; accepted applicants are aged 18 at 30 September in the year of entry.<P>

 As a result of a report by the Parliamentary Ombudsman on a complaint from a learning provider, the Department has decided, in line with Government Accounting guidance, to offer reimbursement to registered Individual Learning Account (ILA) learning providers, including further education colleges, in respect of those learners who properly applied to open accounts before 24 October 2001; were committed to purchase ILA eligible learning with a specific learning provider; and who had not been issued with account numbers by the time the system closed down at 6.30 pm on 23 November 2001, subject to the provision of appropriate evidence.
<P>

<a name="30901w18.html_para0">All learning providers who were active in the period leading up to the closure of the programme have been invited to claim against these criteria.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what representations he has received since November 2002 in connection with the reintroduction of a scheme for individual learning accounts <i>(a)</i> in favour and <i>(b)</i> opposed to its revival; what safeguards were suggested to prevent fraud and waste; what responses he has sent to those making representations; and if he will make a statement on reasons for not proceeding with a successor scheme.  [126799]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30901w18.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 Since November 2002 I have received 10 letters on the future of Individual Learning Accounts (ILAs), and replied to 6 Parliamentary Questions about ILAs. In addition, some of the 83 responses to our "Developing a National Skills Strategy and Delivery Plan: Progress Report" published on 26 March, including the responses from the CBI and TUC, covered ILA. Correspondents often supported some, but not all, characteristics of ILA, and a number of comments have been mutually contradictory. For example some wished to keep the wide range of providers in the original ILA scheme because they believed that that increased learner choice; others wished to restrict the range of providers to minimise wasteful competition between them and to protect quality. It is, therefore, not possible to categorise representations as simply in favour of, or opposed to, ILA; opinions are usually qualified. What is clear is that the principles of the ILA scheme are still widely supported.
<P>

<a name="30901w18.html_para2">As to safeguards, many correspondents suggested that fraud and waste in ILA would be minimised if the assessment process for learning providers was more rigorous. I agree with this view.

To date, five learning provider cases are concluded, resulting in either successful prosecutions or recovery of funds.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30901w18.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 Local education authorities and schools are required under the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 to plan strategically to increase the accessibility of schools to disabled pupils and to produce accessibility strategies and plans. The planning duty includes access to the physical environment, to the curriculum and to written information in alternative formats. It is up to local education authorities and schools to decide how they fulfil those duties and which resources to use with pupils, including disabled pupils, whether or not those resources come from abroad. In June 2002 guidance entitled "Accessible Schools: Planning to increase access to schools for disabled pupils" was made available to local education authorities and schools on carrying out these duties.

 Support for intermediate skills at level 3 will be focussed on those in priority sectors and to meet specific regional skills needs. Criteria for targeting the level 3 support will be determined in consultation with the Sector Skills Development Agency, the Learning and Skills Council and the Regional Development Agencies.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills whether it is his policy to offer a renewed entitlement to free learning at level 2 to people whose previous skills have become obsolete.  [126804]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30901w19.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 The entitlement to free provision for level 2 learning announced in the White Paper "21st Century Skills: Releasing Our Potential" is for those without a qualification at that level. Decisions about the use of public funds for learning in addition to the level 2 entitlement will take account of the needs of those without higher level technical and craft skills and people who are re-skilling for new careers or returning to the labour market. We will consider the question of issue of old or obsolete qualifications which will be examined as we implement the overall Skills Strategy.

 There are no plans to change any of the existing DfES Public Service Agreement targets following the changes announced on 13 June, which bring together in this department lead responsibility in Whitehall for policy on children and the family. Work is ongoing to map the various targets which the DfES will inherit from other Departments as a result of its new responsibilities. A full revised list of targets will be laid in the Library of the HOC in due course.

 Regional Development Agencies were asked to lead on creating Frameworks for Regional Employment and Skills Action in each region and to have them in place by October 2002. The Frameworks were initiated by this Department, the DTI and the Department of Work and Pensions and enable key partners and agencies to agree shared priorities and actions to address skills and employment issues at regional level. A Regional Employment and Skills Forum made up of all the key partners and agencies has been established in each region and is responsible for overseeing the production, implementation, monitoring and updating of each Framework.

 In 2003/04, HEFCE is allocating a total of &#163;1,042 million in recurrent research funding to English higher education institutions&#151;an increase of 10.9 per cent. compared with 2002/03. The funding further increases in 2004/05 and 2005/06 by &#163;107 million and &#163;246 million respectively. In addition, HEFCE provided over &#163;26 million through the Higher Education Innovation Fund (HEIF) this year to support universities in commercially exploiting their research. HEIF resources will be consolidated into a permanent stream of funding and increase by &#163;80 million and &#163;90 million in 2004/05 and 2005/06 respectively. HEFCE is also allocating &#163;16 million in the next two years to establish 20 Knowledge Exchanges to help direct this activity within regional networks.




<P>
<P><I>1 Sept 2003 : Column 756W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="30901w21.html_para0">HEFCE allocated research funding according to the quality and volume of research departments that were rated 4 and above in the 2001 Research Assessment Exercise (RAE) and an additional &#163;20 million to departments that were rated 5* in both the last two RAE's. A further &#163;20 million is also available as capability funding to departments that were rated 3a or 3b in seven specific subject areas, to provide extra support so the research base can improve to match that in the more established fields.
<P>

<a name="30901w21.html_para1">In the 2001 Research Assessment Exercise, 23 per cent. of departments in England received a 4 rating. In line with our policy set out in the Higher Education White Paper, HEFCE has re-balanced the funding levels between ratings for 2003&#150;04 to ensure better resourcing for, and improved quality of, the best research. This has meant a reduction in funding for 4 rated departments from &#163;139 million in 2002&#150;03 to &#163;118 million in 2003&#150;04.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30901w21.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Hancock: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what assessment he has made of the impact of <i>(a)</i> the increase in National Insurance contributions and <i>(b)</i> the new formula spending share, on school budgets in (i) Portsmouth and (ii) the rest of Hampshire; and if he will make a statement.  [126182]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30901w21.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 The Department does not collect information on the distribution of teaching salaries by school or by local education authority. It is therefore not possible for us to calculate the additional cost of the increase in National Insurance contributions for each local education authority. However, nationally, the increase in additional resources provided for education of &#163;2.7 billion more than match the pressures faced by schools and local education authorities.
<P>

<a name="30901w21.html_para2">In introducing the new funding system in 2003&#150;04, our aim has been to produce the best possible match between the distribution of funds and the differing circumstances and needs of local education authorities. The formula provides the same funding for all comparable pupils right across the country. So the new system consists of a basic amount per pupil&#151;which is the same everywhere&#151;with top-ups for pupils with additional educational needs (again the same per pupil everywhere), and for area costs for salaries, recruitment and retention. Authorities which have more deprived pupils and/or receive extra funding to take account of the high costs of recruiting and retaining staff in their area, receive a higher level of funding overall than those which have comparatively low levels of deprivation and/or do not receive additional funding for area costs. But all authorities received an increase of at least 3.2 per cent. per pupil after taking account of the changes to teachers' pension contributions and the additional &#163;28 million grant provided to authorities ensured a minimum effective increase per pupil of 3.2 per cent. per pupil taking account of changes to the Standards Fund. Local education authorities are responsible for deciding the amount of funding available for the Schools Budget.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills (1) what plans he has to change the criteria for measuring school socio-economic position from the percentage of children receiving school meals; and if he will make a statement;  [125225]
<P>
<UL>(2) what assessment he has made of the effect on comparisons for schools socio-economic position of a drop in the number of children receiving free school meals; and if he will make a statement.  [125226]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30901w21.html_spnew4"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 The Department's Annual Schools' Census (ASC) collects information on the numbers of pupils 'known to be eligible for free school meals (FSM)' as a consequence of local authorities (and schools) legal duty to provide them. The ASC does not collect any other information on the socio-economic circumstances of individual pupils or, in aggregate, of schools.
<P>

<a name="30901w21.html_para3">The Department is investigating whether information from other departments' datasets can be linked in ways which preserve necessary data confidentialities but provide measures additional to FSM that improve the appropriateness and robustness of socio-economic comparisons of schools.
<P>

<a name="30901w21.html_para4">There has been a trend downward over the last few years in the numbers of children 'known to be eligible for FSM', due in part to increased employment. About 80 per cent. of children who are entitled to make a claim for a free meal do so, but the rate varies from school to school over time depending on pupil and parental preferences and economic circumstances. Direct, and fair, interpretations of FSM comparisons within and between schools are therefore complicated and complex.
<P>

<a name="30901w21.html_para5">The Department's "Autumn Package of Pupil Performance Information" has shown since 1996 national attainment benchmarks for groups of schools with broadly similar levels of FSM. These are used by schools to gauge their recent relative performances and by OFSTED in discussions with schools during inspection. Schools compare their performances with those of schools in adjacent benchmark groups and bring to bear their detailed knowledge of pupils and their schools in those discussions.

<i>[holding answer 9 July 2003]:</i> In the past two years, the Department has received letters expressing concerns over sex education in Leeds and Barking and Dagenham. In each case the correspondents were advised that headteachers and governors are responsible for making decisions about sex education in schools, in consultation with parents. In the first instance concerns should be raised with the schools. Governing bodies must ensure that teaching materials and programmes used for sex education are in accordance with the framework for Personal, Social and Health Education; and that inappropriate materials are kept out of the classroom. Consulting pupils and their families will help establish what is appropriate and acceptable to them. Where schools work within the SRE guidelines and consult effectively, parents should be reassured about the content of lessons.

In 2002, the number of points assigned to each GCE/VCE A/AS qualification and VCE Double Award changed to reflect the UCAS tariff. Figures for 2001 are provided on both bases.<P>

An asterisk (*) in the table indicates that the differences between performance averages of maintained schools and Sixth Form Colleges are statistically significant at a 95 per cent. level. Differences between schools and colleges in their number and circumstance and differences within institutions in terms of student composition have not been taken into account in determining statistical significance.<P>

<a name="30901w22.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Hancock: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what the level of student debt was in each of the last three years for which figures are available; and what projections he has made for each year up to 2010.  [126815]

 Borrowers are liable to repay their loans from the April following graduation or otherwise leaving their course. Students who started their course from the 1998/99 academic year will repay income contingent loans. Loans for those who started their course before 1998/99 are repayable on a mortgage style basis. The table shows estimates of average student loan debt at the point at which they entered repayment status for borrowers who became liable to repay their loans in financial years 2000&#150;01 to 2002&#150;03.
<P>

<a name="30901w22.html_para2">New student support arrangements were introduced from academic year 1998/99. Most new students in that year (apart from specified exceptions) received support for maintenance expenditure through means-tested grants (about 25 per cent. of the support available) and non means-tested student loans (about 75 per cent. of the support). From 1999/2000, students who entered higher education after 1998/99 received support for maintenance expenditure through loans. About three quarters of the value of these loans is not subject to means-testing. The repayments on these loans are on an income contingent basis.
<P>

<a name="30901w22.html_para3">Students who started their course up to 1997/98, and those who entered in 1998/99 under the existing arrangements, are eligible for mortgage style loans; the ratio of support for these students is roughly 50 per cent. means-tested grant and 50 per cent. non means-tested loan.
<P>

<a name="30901w22.html_para4">The first cohort of students on a three-year degree course who entered higher education under the new student support arrangements became liable for repayment in April 2002. That, and earlier, cohorts includes a disproportionate number of students on shorter courses as well as those who have left higher education before completing their courses. Therefore the average level of debt will not be representative of the average debt experienced by those who complete their courses.

<a name="30901w22.html_para6">Data on debts for which there is no public subsidy, such as overdrafts and credit cards, and informal debts to family and friends, are not held centrally.
<P>

<a name="30901w22.html_para7">Future student debt will depend on a range of factors, including the amount of loan students take out. After 2005/06, debt will be influenced by the borrowing behaviour of those students eligible for the HE grant. After 2006/07, student debt will also depend on the fee levels charged by universities to their full-time undergraduates, and the extent to which those students exercise the new option to defer those fees.

 The available information comes from the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS) and covers deferred entry for full-time accepted applicants to first degree and HND study in the UK. Figures are in the table. Students who defer their application to UCAS because they are taking a gap year are therefore excluded.

 <i>[holding answer 16 July 2003]:</i> The table shows the cumulative balance at the start of each financial year of mortgage style student loans in the UK and in public ownership where repayment has been deferred. There is no concept of deferment from those with income contingent loans who repay through the tax system&#151;repayments are not collected from those earning below the threshold, i.e. &#163;10,000 in financial year 2001&#150;02.

 <i>[holding answer 14 July 2003]:</i> The answer to the hon. Member's earlier question was being processed in the usual way and was answered at the earliest opportunity. Provisional statistics on teacher numbers and teacher vacancies at January 2003 were published in April in Statistical First Release 10/2003. In May this year, in response to concerns about the difficulties some schools are facing as a result of changes to the funding arrangements, my Department liaised with local education authorities (LEAs) to make a broad assessment of the extent to which schools were making changes in their teaching staff complements, including making teachers redundant, and the possible reasons for such changes, including falling rolls. This was based on the best information available to local education authorities (LEAs) at that time; many told us that definitive information was not available and that the situation was changing rapidly as schools finalised their budgets and their staffing. In addition they advised that a significant number of the redundancy notices were 'protective' and were likely to be withdrawn as the situation within schools and the LEA became clearer.

 Following consultation on the Pensions Green Paper, which was published by the Department for Work and Pensions last December, raising the pension age for teachers and other public servants from 60 to 65 is one of the measures being taken forward. This reflects both increased life expectancy and the fact that many people want to work longer and build up their pensions.
<P>

<a name="30901w25.html_para4">Details of how and when the changes might be introduced for new entrants to the Teachers Pension Scheme and the transitional arrangements for existing scheme members remain to be worked out. These will be considered alongside changes to improve scheme benefits, and there will be a wide-ranging review of the scheme involving full consultation with union and employer representatives. All of the issues associated with an increase in the pension age of members of the Teachers' Pension Scheme will be considered during the review. A change for new entrants is unlikely before 2006 and will be much later for existing staff.

Pension benefits earned before the new arrangements start will not be affected. Whatever changes are made will not affect pension benefits already earned from past service.
<P>
<BR>
Teachers will still be able to retire at, before or after 60 as they do now. At retirement, pension and lump sum benefits will take account of the number of years of service the teacher has worked before and after the changes were introduced.
<P>

These changes will be talked through fully with teachers and their union representatives, as well as with employers. Unions will be part of this process and there will be a full consultation exercise before any changes are made to the Teachers' Pension Scheme.

The High Court and county court may impose a fixed prison sentence, not exceeding two years (two months in the magistrates court). A fine not exceeding &#163;2,500 may also be imposed. The court may also change the residence of the child from one parent to the other. In considering any penalty, the courts take into account its likely impact on the child's welfare.

The committee has also had preliminary discussions of other matters that could lead to Commission decisions, such as the Commission's current discussions with the United States' authorities about the disclosure of airline passenger information. The Commission keeps the committee informed about a wide range of matters relating to data protection. These have included: the activities of the working party of data protection supervisory authorities set up under Article 29 of the Directive; the appointment of the European Data Protection Supervisor; and the Commission's first report on the implementation of the Directive.

 The Department for Constitutional Affairs is fully committed to providing equality of opportunity and valuing diversity in everything it does. Our Race Equality Scheme was published by the Lord Chancellor's Department (as it then was) in May 2002 and sets out the action the Department will take to meet its statutory duties under the Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000. The Scheme identifies the policies and functions of the Department that have a high relevance to meeting the general statutory duty and outlines the programme of action that is being undertaken in each case in order to meet that duty. Diversity awareness training has been provided for all permanent staff and we have incorporated diversity awareness into induction training for new staff. In accordance with the requirements of the Act we will publish a summary of the assessments, consultation exercises and monitoring we carry out and this will be included as part of the Equality and Diversity Annual Report. We will conduct a review of the Scheme in 2004 to assess which of our functions and policies are relevant to meeting the statutory duties and will publish a revised Scheme by 1 April 2005.

[126566]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30901w29.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Rammell: </B> 
 The Russian Government have not requested permission for the Defence of the Arctic Region medal (DSARM) to be officially recognised by the Government since 19 November 2002.
<P>

<a name="30901w29.html_para1">The Foreign and Commonwealth Office is aware that British veterans of the Second World War Arctic Convoys feel strongly about this issue and are keen to accept the Russian medal. We are sympathetic and keen to give a positive response should the Russian Government formally seek the Government's authority to award the DSARM to British citizens.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what action he is taking to ensure that military equipment manufactured in the UK is not used by oppressive regimes or politically unstable countries.  [126232]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30901w29.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Rammell: </B> 
 The United Kingdom has one of the strictest and most transparent arms export licensing systems of any country. All export licence applications are rigorously assessed on a case-by-case basis against the consolidated EU and national arms export licensing criteria, taking account of the circumstances prevailing at the time and other announced Government policies. Our criteria clearly set out our commitment to take account of the risk that exports might be diverted within the buyer country, re-exported under undesirable conditions, used for internal repression or external aggression, or to abuse human rights.
<P>

<a name="30901w29.html_para2">This Government continues to strengthen strategic export controls. The Export Control Act's secondary legislation is to be laid in October. It will introduce tough new controls on trafficking and brokering, the intangible transfer of military technology, and technical assistance. It is a significant step forward. It will ensure the UK cannot be used as a base for irresponsible trade in arms to undesirable destinations.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30901w29.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 I visited Indonesia on 3&#150;4 June 2003, and raised the issue of British-supplied military equipment with President Megawati and senior members of the Indonesian government. I reminded them of the assurances that British built military equipment should not be used offensively or to violate 



<P>
<P><I>1 Sept 2003 : Column 791W</I><P>
human rights, and warned of the possible consequences for defence sales and defence relationships if there was a breach of the assurances.
<P>

<a name="30901w29.html_para3">Our Embassy in Jakarta regularly raises the assurances with the Indonesian Government, including senior military contacts. Our Embassy receives information from as wide a range of sources as possible, as well as from the Government, to monitor the use of British-built equipment. These include international agencies, NGOs, other observers and the media.
<P>

<a name="30901w29.html_para4">We have had no confirmed reports that British-built military equipment has been violating the assurances, but are monitoring the situation. We will follow up all credible allegations on the misuse of British-military equipment.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what the grades were of the civil servants, and what the total cost was of, the visits of two groups of civil servants to San Francisco to inspect the British Consulate, broken down by <i>(a)</i> travel, <i>(b)</i> subsistence and <i>(c)</i> other costs; how many other properties they inspected; and what length of time was taken for the two visits.  [121456]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30901w29.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Rammell: </B> 
 The first visit took place in March 2002 and the second in March 2003.
<P>

<a name="30901w29.html_para5">The first comprised three D Band (Home Civil Service Principal equivalent) officers from different sections of our estate departments in Croydon. Two visited for five working days, and one for two, to inspect properties the Post had short-listed as potentially suitable as a new Residence. The cost of the three return flights was &#163;11,986. Subsistence totalled &#163;2,031. There would also have been some minor local expenditure on transport within San Francisco and photocopying.
<P>

<a name="30901w29.html_para6">The second visit also comprised three people: one from the Senior Management Structure (SMS) of the FCO, one D Band officer and one external adviser. The combined cost of air fares was &#163;11,612. The SMS officer and the Estate Adviser spent five days in San Francisco but the D Band officer remained for a further six days (including the weekend) for a detailed technical investigation of the property selected. Subsistence totalled &#163;4,026. Sundry expenditure including telephone calls totalled approximately &#163;55. Local transport was arranged and paid for by the Consulate-General and the total cost is not readily available.

<P>
<a name="30901w29.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The two biggest investors in Burma, BAT and Premier Oil, have been asked to withdraw their investment in Burma. I have made clear that our policy is not to encourage UK companies who trade or invest in Burma while the regime continues to suppress the basic human rights of its people. All British companies that inquire about the prospects either for trade with or investment in Burma are informed of this policy.

 According to figures from HM Customs and Excise, the value of apparel and clothing accessories imported in to the UK from Burma in 2002 was approximately &#163;50 million. In 2001 the value of such imports was approximately &#163;52 million.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30901w29.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 We have long been at the forefront of EU action to maintain and increase targeted pressure on the Burmese regime. We are currently pursuing with EU colleagues what additional economic and diplomatic action is required to ensure that national reconciliation, respect for human rights and democracy becomes a reality in Burma. Burma is not currently on the agenda for the EU Foreign Ministers meeting on 21 July. However, Burma will be a key focus during discussions at the ASEM Foreign Ministers Meeting on 23&#150;24 July.

 The Governor of the Cayman Islands discussed a number of different issues with the Chief Justice and representatives of the Cayman Islands Government following the early ending of the Eurobank trial. The Financial Reporting Unit continues temporarily to operate under an Acting Head, and the Cayman Islands Solicitor General is Acting Attorney General pending the appointment of a successor.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what assessment he has made of the UN Security Council report alleging exploitation of natural resources from Congo by other countries involved in the current conflict.  [126701]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30901w30.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 The UN Expert Panel on the Illegal Exploitation of Natural Resources and Other Forms of Wealth of the Democratic Republic of Congo made a first report in October 2002. The panel's mandate was extended with our support earlier this year. The Panel will present their interim report to the Security Council on 24 July. We are still assessing the interim report, which was recently published on the UN website.

<P>
<a name="30901w30.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Caton: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what action he is taking to ensure that British-based industrial users of coltan from the Democratic Republic of Congo are not purchasing smuggled coltan.  [126702]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30901w30.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Rammell: </B> 
 We recognise that the exploitation of natural resources contributes to the underlying economic causes of conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). As permanent members of the UN Security Council, the UK supported Resolution 1457 (2003) which reiterates the Security Council's commitment to take appropriate action to help put an end to the illegal exploitation of the resources of the DRC. We continue to uphold EU sanctions (an arms embargo and visa restrictions) and support related action in the UN. There are currently no restrictions on the import of coltan into the UK. However, in the case of undeclared imports of coltan into the UK, HM Customs have powers to seize the goods as with other illegal exports.
<P>

<a name="30901w30.html_para0">The UK is exploring how to improve governance of natural resource extraction, including through the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative backed by my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister.

<P>
<a name="30901w30.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Caton: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what assessment he has made of the impact of <i>(a)</i> smuggling and <i>(b)</i> sale of coltan from Congo by armed forces from (i) Rwanda, (ii) Uganda and (iii) Burundi on the human rights situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo.  [126704]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30901w30.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Rammell: </B> 
 The UN Expert Panel report on the Illegal Exploitation of Natural Resources in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), published in October 2002, provides extensive details of the widespread exploitation of the DRC's natural resources, including coltan. The report states that elite networks linked to the governments/militaries of the DRC, Rwanda and Uganda are the main players in the smuggling and/or sale of coltan; Burundi's role is small in comparison. Such exploitation continues today, with the active co-operation of the various rebel groups operating in the eastern part of DRC. The human rights of many citizens of the DRC have already been severely eroded by many years of violent civil war and the ensuing chaos. The trade in coltan has played a part in this conflict.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs how many bottles of <i>(a)</i> wine and <i>(b)</i> other alcoholic beverages there were in the Government wine cellar, managed by his Department, in each of the last 10 years; and what his estimate is of the value.  [122847]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30901w31.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Rammell: </B> 
 The Government wine cellar contains a mix of fine wines, beverage wines and spirits and liqueurs. Stock levels vary but generally the cellar contains approximately 37,000 bottles, of which fewer than 700 are spirits or liqueurs. There has been no significant variation in the stock levels since 1993. It is not possible to give a break down of the ratio of wines to spirits, etc over the last 10 years without incurring disproportionate costs.
<P>

<a name="30901w31.html_para5">Fine wines are bought young and then stored until ready for use, enabling aged wines of excellent value to be used by the Government for their hospitality needs. The value of the stock is subjective and bears no relation to the purchase costs. The current value of the stock is estimated to be in the region of &#163;1.7 million.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what representations the Government has made in respect of article 23 of the basic law of Hong Kong to the Government of the People's Republic of China.  [123024]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30901w31.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Rammell: </B> 
 Article 23 of the Basic Law states that the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) shall enact national security legislation "on its own". We have therefore made frequent representations to the SAR Government on this issue, including at Ministerial level.
<P>

<a name="30901w31.html_para6">We have also discussed the issue with the Chinese Government. I did so with Chinese Assistant Foreign Minister Zhang Yesui in January and my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary did so on 25 June with visiting Chinese Foreign Minister Li Zhaoxing. On 21 July, during his visit to China, my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister discussed Article 23 with Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao.
<P>

<a name="30901w31.html_para7">On 16 July I issued my fourth statement about Article 23, in which I welcomed the significant amendments to the legislation made by the SAR Government on 5 July.

This had been one of the main concerns of the

<P>
<P>
<a name="30901w31.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Rammell: </B> 
 Negotiations took place between the UK and China about Hong Kong's special status prior to the return of Hong Kong to Chinese sovereignty on 1 July 1997.
<P>

<a name="30901w31.html_para8">Since then, there have been regular exchanges at Ministerial and official levels. During those, the situation in post-handover Hong Kong has frequently been discussed. Both sides agree on the importance of maintaining the principles of the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration on Hong Kong which provides Hong Kong with a high degree of autonomy under the 'One Country, Two Systems' principle.
<P>

<a name="30901w31.html_para9">My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary reports regularly to Parliament on the implementation of the Joint Declaration. The most recent such report was published on 16 July (Cm 5864). Our assessment continues to be that, generally, 'One Country, Two Systems' is working well in practice.
<P>

<a name="30901w31.html_para10">We have a strong, forward-looking bilateral relationship with Hong Kong, a key partner for the UK in the Asia-Pacific region. Given Britain's role as a joint signatory of the Joint Declaration, we maintain a close interest in developments in Hong Kong.

 On 16 July we published our latest report to Parliament, which reported on a number of important developments in Hong Kong in the first half of the year (Cm 5864). Our overall assessment is that, generally, the "One Country, Two Systems" principle continues to work well in practice.
<P>

<a name="30901w31.html_para11">On the same day, I issued my fourth press statement about the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) Government's moves to introduce national security legislation under Article 23 of the Basic Law.

 On 16 May, the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) issued an Order disestablishing the Ba'ath Party. This Order removes and bars all members of the Ba'ath Party at the rank of Senior Member and above from positions of authority in the future. All Ba'ath Party members suspected of criminal conduct will be investigated and, if necessary, detained.

 We are aware of reports of people in the area of the Al Tuwaitha nuclear facility having looted drums and containers, emptied low-enriched uranium from them, and taken the containers off to use for water storage. The site has now been secured, and the radio-active material there sealed in concrete. There is minimal likelihood of further looting. Initial indications are that there is little or no immediate radiation sickness evident in the population, but there may be longer term health risks to people who have been exposed to radiation. A task force has been set up in Baghdad to take forward action on recovering radio-active material that has been taken from the site, and monitoring the long-term health of people at risk of exposure to radiation.

<a name="30901w35.html_para1">In all cases, the EU country concerned consulted EU partners before issuing visas. The EU's Common Position of February 2002. imposing sanctions on Zimbabwe, specifically allowed member states to grant exemptions where "travel is justified on the grounds of humanitarian need, including religious obligation, or on grounds of attending meetings of international bodies or conducting political dialogue that promotes democracy, human rights and the rule of law in Zimbabwe". This clause was made more explicit when the Common Position was rolled over in 2003, to state that a member state shall grant a visa when it is "bound by an obligation of international law". In all these cases, the EU country in question had a legal obligation to grant visas.

<a name="30901w35.html_para2">In the case of the attendance of Robert and Grace Mugabe and Stan Mudenge at the France-Africa summit in Paris in February 2003, France argued for an exemption to be granted under article 3.3 of the Common Position, where travel is justified on the grounds of conducting political dialogue that promotes democracy, human rights and the rule of law. We did not want Robert Mugabe at the France-Africa summit in Paris. We made this clear to the French Government, at various levels as well as to other EU partners. The meeting took place two days after the EU sanctions on Zimbabwe were due to expire. Our priority then was to ensure a roll-over of those sanctions. The roll-over required a consensus among EU member states. This was achieved on 18 February 2003.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what the Government's policy is on the use of phosphates and nitrates in agriculture; and what action the Government is taking in regard to chemical run-off from farmland.  [126727]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30901w35.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The Government's policy on the use of phosphates and nitrates is that they should be applied in accordance with good nutrient management practice, and in compliance with legal requirements. This ensures that the necessary quantities of nutrients are available when required for uptake by the crop and that losses to the environment are minimised. Defra supports the Fertiliser Advisers Certification and Training Scheme which trains and certifies people who advise farmers and growers on the appropriate use of fertilisers. Details on the optimum rate and timing for spreading phosphates and nitrates are contained within Defra booklet RB209 'Fertiliser Recommendations for Agricultural and Horticultural Crops'. Adoption of these recommendations helps to 



<P>
<P><I>1 Sept 2003 : Column 820W</I><P>
reduce the risk of applying more nutrients than the crop needs and thereby minimises the risk of run off. There is evidence that farmers are following these recommendations. Application rates of nitrogen, phosphate and the other major nutrient, potash have been lower in the past decade than in the 1980s, despite an increase in crop production.
<P>

<a name="30901w35.html_para6">The statutory Water Code (Defra PB0587) provides further essential guidance on the use and handling of fertilisers to minimise the risk of nutrient losses to water. Farmers operating in Nitrate Vulnerable Zones are obliged to implement Action Programme Measures, which are based largely on the Water Code.
<P>

<a name="30901w35.html_para7">Defra is currently undertaking a review of the problem of diffuse pollution of water by agriculture, to identify the most cost effective way to achieve further reductions in pollution to comply with the Water Framework Directive and safeguard conservation sites.
<P>

<a name="30901w35.html_para8">In collaboration with the EA and industry, Defray is developing a software tool to provide nutrient management decision support for farmers and advisers. The first version of the tool should be available next year, both as a module of existing farm management software packages and as a free stand-alone version.
<P>

<a name="30901w35.html_para9">The Government encourages the use of manure as a valuable fertiliser thus helping to reduce the use of chemical fertilisers. One of the ways in which this is done is through the availability of the MANNER (Manure Nitrogen Evaluation Routine) Decision Support System which helps farmers accurately predict the fertiliser nitrogen value of organic manures on a field specific basis.
<P>

<a name="30901w35.html_para10">Defra agri-environment schemes such as Environmentally Sensitive Areas (ESAs), the Countryside Stewardship Scheme (CSS) and the Organic Farming Scheme (OFS) fund management options which involve the reduction of input levels to grassland and arable farming systems. They also contain options such as buffer strips which benefit resource protection. ESAs and CSS are currently being reviewed in consultation with partners with a view to introducing a new scheme in 2005. It is proposed that resource protection should be an important objective of the new scheme.
<P>

<a name="30901w35.html_para11">In addition, Defra is currently piloting a new Entry Level Scheme which aims to introduce simple yet effective environmental measures across a wide area of farmland. The pilot scheme includes options to prepare nutrient and manure management plans and other on-farm management which will deliver resource protection benefits. Following an assessment of the pilot scheme we intend to draw up proposals to roll it out across England in 2005.

1. Columns <i>(a)</i> & <i>(c)</i> are compiled from data published in the Chief Veterinary Officer's annual reports on Animal Health.<P>

2. Column <i>(b)</i> is compiled from data available from Defra's computer systems. Base data for 1993 and 1994 cannot be validated, and figures for all years cannot be reconciled with published data and have therefore been rounded. The figures show the number of cases where TB was not confirmed (rather than 'negative' cases). Post mortem examinations are less than 100% sensitive so failure to detect visible lesions or culture Mycobacterium bovis (M. bovis) from samples does not confirm the absence of infection or that the animal has not been exposed to M. bovis. The figures also include cases where culture results are still outstanding and where samples were not taken.<P>

3. In 2001, the TB testing and control programme was largely suspended due to the foot and mouth disease (FMD) outbreak. Since testing resumed in 2002, resources have been concentrated on herds with overdue TB tests that would have had a longer period in which to contract the disease. Also the proportion of 



high risk herds being tested post-FMD is greater than that prior to the outbreak. As a result, the numbers of TB reactors identified and slaughtered in 2001 and 2002 are not comparable with previous years.<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what recent discussions she has had on the efficacy of skin tests for bovine TB; and what assessment she has made of the benefits of blood tests for bovine TB.  [126336]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30901w36.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The single intradermal comparative cervical test (SICCT) is the only skin test currently used in Great Britain for the detection of TB in cattle. This test and the less specific single intradermal test (SIT) were, until recently, the only TB tests officially recognised by the European Union for use in cattle. The skin tests, along with the application of disease control principles, have achieved TB eradication in many countries.
<P>

<a name="30901w36.html_para4">Last October, we begun a field evaluation of the gamma-interferon test, an in-vitro assay that measures the immune response to M. bovis of T-cells in cattle blood. This laboratory-based blood test was officially recognised by the EU in July 2002, but only for use as a supplement to the SICCT in TB affected herds. The test is considered more sensitive than the SICCT, but less specific, meaning that it results in a higher probability of false positives. For this reason, the gamma interferon test cannot be used as a screening test for TB for the time being.
<P>

<a name="30901w36.html_para5">Diagnostic tests are never 100 per cent. accurate and there is often a trade-off between sensitivity and specificity. Although the gamma interferon test is not sufficiently specific to replace the SICCT, the use of the two tests in parallel has the potential to significantly increase the detection of infected cattle in herds where TB has been confirmed.

 Defra, as scheme regulator, has no plans to intervene in UK Emissions Trading Scheme (UK ETS) market activity. Like any market, the UK ETS allowance price is determined by actual supply and demand of allowances. Participants in the scheme are likely to trade based on profit maximisation decisions and so it is unlikely that prices would drop to a level at which market activity ceases. For a one year old voluntary scheme, there has been an encouraging amount of liquidity and stability in the fledgling market.

 <i>[holding answer 16 July 2003]:</i> In general, single payment entitlements will take the form of a designated amount per hectare for certain number of hectares and be allocated on the basis of farmers' average claims under the existing CAP direct aid schemes in the reference period 2000&#150;02. The annual claim for payment against each entitlement will need to be accompanied by an eligible hectare, which may be on the holding that gave rise to the entitlement or on any other holding in the same member state. We expect "eligible hectare" to be defined as any agricultural area of the holding taken up by arable land and permanent pasture except areas under permanent crops, forests or used for non-agricultural purposes. Cross-compliance conditions will apply to those hectares and all other agricultural land on the holding. Those rules and restrictions will apply to tenants and non-tenants alike.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30901w37.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Bradshaw </B> 
<i> [holding answer 16 July 2003]:</i> Farmers, whether tenants or owner occupiers, will be able to sell the single payment entitlements allocated to them once they have fulfilled the relevant conditions in claiming payment on at least 80 per cent. of those entitlements in one year. Sale may also be possible once entitlement holders have voluntarily given up to the national reserve all the entitlements that they have not claimed in the first year of operation of the single payment scheme. Landlords of tenant farmers will only be able to sell entitlements that they are either allocated to them in their own right as a result of claims for CAP direct aids during the scheme reference period or purchased by them once the scheme is introduced. All sales may take place with or without land and will only be permissible if they are to another farmer within the same member state.

 The proposals for Common Agricultural Policy reform were agreed on 26 June.

 The role of the DWI is to audit all the statutory water companies in England and Wales. The companies are required to undertake sampling and analysis of public water supplies in accordance with the Water Supply (Water Quality) Regulations 1989 and subsequent amendments. These Regulations set out the frequency of monitoring, the locations where the samples have to be taken and the standards that have to be met. The regulatory standards incorporate those set out in the EC Directive on the quality of water intended for human consumption (80/778/EEC), which in turn are based on the World Health Organisation guideline values for drinking water quality. There are currently 26 water companies. In the last six years water companies have only experienced occasional failures of a standard. The level of compliance for all water companies rose from 99.75 per cent. in 1997 to 99.87% in 2002. The WHO guideline values for various constituents of drinking water, including certain minerals, represent the concentration of a constituent that does not result in any significant risk to consumers' health, usually over a lifetime of consumption.

 The Government is currently considering whether a national scheme for fallen stock is viable and will be making an announcement about this shortly.
<P>

<a name="30901w40.html_para0">In response to the consultation exercise carried out in May, around 33,000 livestock farmers in England expressed interest in joining a subscription scheme, just over 30 per cent. of those who were consulted.
<P>

<a name="30901w40.html_para1">If a scheme were to go ahead Defra has said that it would be prepared to contribute up to &#163;5 million in the first year decreasing to zero by the end of the third year. This is in addition to the &#163;30 million that the Government already pays for collecting and disposing of cattle for BSE testing purposes.

 The Strategy Unit project on the UK fishing industry aims to be completed by the end of the year, when its final report will be published.
<P>

<a name="30901w40.html_para2">A consultation paper has already been published on the unit's website www.strategy.gov.uk. This builds on, and follows, a series of face-to-face meetings with industry representatives across the UK.

 52 of the 68 salmon drift netsmen remaining in the North East coast salmon drift net fishery have accepted a voluntary compensation scheme to give up their drift net licences to reduce exploitation of this mixed stock. The scheme was open only to those who held a drift net licence to fish off the North East coast of England. The Government are contributing &#163;1.25 million over the years 2003&#150;04 with the remainder of the &#163;3.4 million needed to fund this buy-out being raised by private interests.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (1) what estimate she has made of the number of fishermen who will lose

<P><I>1 Sept 2003 : Column 838W</I><P>
their jobs due to new regulations introduced under the Restrictive Shellfish Licensing Scheme in <i>(a)</i> Wales and <i>(b)</i> the UK;  [126822]

<P>
(3) whether compensation will be paid for the loss of fishermen's incomes arising from the Restrictive Shellfish Licensing Scheme; and whether there will be separate provision for Welsh fishermen.  [126824]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30901w40.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 All fishermen with a fishing vessel licensed by one of the four Fisheries Departments in the UK, will be given an entitlement to fish for crabs, lobsters and crawfish under the Restrictive Shellfish Licensing Scheme subject to demonstrating that they have landed and sold more than 200kg of lobsters or crawfish, or 750kg of crabs in a 12 month rolling period between 1 January 1998 and 31 December 2002. Those fishermen with a licensed fishing vessel who do not meet the criteria will nevertheless be entitled to catch 5 lobsters and 25 crabs per day. It is not expected that employment for fishermen in Wales or the UK will be at risk as a result of these arrangements.
<P>

<a name="30901w40.html_para3">This Department has no plans to provide compensation for fishermen who do not qualify for the Scheme. By preventing excessive effort increases in the future which would threaten crab and lobster stocks, the Scheme should in fact help to maintain the employment of fishermen whose livelihood depends on them.
<P>

<a name="30901w40.html_para4">The possibility of course exists to vary the requirements of the Scheme in future: the additional information we shall be obtaining on shellfishing activity as a result of the Scheme will enable us to consider, in consultation with interested parties, how this might be done.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30901w40.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The Welsh Assembly Government has been fully involved in all stages of the development and implementation of the Restrictive Shellfish Licensing Scheme.
<P>

<a name="30901w40.html_para5">Representations have been received from the North Western and North Wales Sea Fisheries Committee, South and West Wales Fishing Communities Ltd., and a number of Welsh fishermen. These relate to the eligibility criteria for the scheme and how this will impact, in particular, on those who fish on a seasonal basis for shellfish.

 A budget of &#163;156 million has been made available to tackle fuel poverty in the current financial year. This will enable continued delivery of energy efficiency measures to some of the most vulnerable members of society. It will also help us to achieve our PSA target of assisting 600,000 households between 2001 and 2004.
<P>

<a name="30901w40.html_para6">Government's first Annual Report on Progress under the Fuel Poverty Strategy showed good progress in the reduction of the number of households in fuel poverty.

 The public debate on GM issues ('GM Nation?') is being managed by an independent steering board at arm's length from Government. The public phase of the debate was launched on 3 June and was followed by six regional launch events. Further local meetings have been organised throughout the UK by organisations and individuals, and the public were also able to participate via the interactive debate website. As of 11 July, over 17,000 feedback questionnaires had been received. The Steering Board is due to submit its report to Government in September.

<a name="30901w41.html_para2">The public debate is one strand of a wider GM dialogue announced by the Secretary of State last July, which also comprises a Science Review and a study by the Strategy Unit into the overall costs and benefits of GM crops. The Strategy Unit's report was published on 11 July; the report is available online at www.strategy.gov.uk and a copy has also been placed in the Library. The report of the science review was 



<P>
<P><I>1 Sept 2003 : Column 841W</I><P>
published on 21 July. Both the Strategy Unit and the Science Review panel have invited comments on their reports. The Food Standards Agency also published its report on "Consumers views on GM food" on 16 July, which represents the FSA's contribution to the public debate.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment she has made of the implications for the Government's direction that brownfield or derelict land assets be used as a priority before greenfield sites of the High Court judgement by Mr. Justice Sullivan on 8July on the case brought by Laing Homes over a site near High Wycombe.

 The judgment in R (Laing Homes Ltd.) v Buckinghamshire County Council & the Secretary of State for the Environment Food & Rural Affairs (third party) (2003) concluded that village green rights could not be established in the particular circumstances of that case, because the land to be registered had been used to cultivate, and harvest, an annual hay crop.

 Under the Landfill (England and Wales) Regulations 2002, that implemented the technical and regulatory components of the Landfill Directive, all hazardous waste as defined in the Regulations will require treatment prior to landfill from July 2004.

 None; no general rules have been made under Article 11(1)(a) of the Waste Framework Directive which would enable a landfill site to operate under the terms of an exemption from waste management licensing. The derogation in the Landfill Directive for landfills serving islands and isolated settlements was not taken up for England because no existing sites met the criteria and any future site in these locations should meet the full requirements of the Directive.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30901w42.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Government is committed to reducing the UK's reliance on landfill, which makes little practical use of waste and is a missed opportunity to recover value from waste. The landfilling of waste sits at the bottom of the waste hierarchy and in Waste Strategy 2000 and its subsequent response to the Strategy Unit Report "Waste Not Want Not" Government has set out a range of policies to promote the reduction, re-use, recycling and recovery of waste in order to divert it from landfill. The demand for landfill in 2010 and the availability of landfill sites to deal with that demand is therefore impossible to predict, although the impact of Government policies, including the targets in the proposed Landfill Allowance Trading Scheme should result in lower demand.

[126169]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30901w42.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Until recently, landfill sites were licensed under the Waste Management Licensing Regulations 1994. Under this system, the Environment Agency is obliged to ensure that, when issuing a waste management licence, the activities to which the licence relate do not cause pollution of the environment, harm to health or serious detriment to the amenities of the locality. The Agency is also obliged to modify the conditions of the licence if it appears that these impacts could be caused by the continuation of the landfill activities. If remedial measures are needed, it is for the licence holder to cover the cost of these, and the cost will 



<P>
<P><I>1 Sept 2003 : Column 846W</I><P>
vary depending on the nature of the works needed. No national figures have been collated on the actual numbers of landfills where modifications specifically to tackle pollution have taken place.
<P>

<a name="30901w42.html_para1">The Landfill Directive introduced stringent new standards for landfill sites to protect the environment. The Environment Agency has begun re-permitting all landfill sites under the Landfill (England and Wales) Regulations 2002. The programme is expected to be completed by March 2007. As part of this process, all operational sites needed to submit a Conditioning Plan to the Agency by July 2002 which gave an outline of the measures that need to be taken by each site to meet the new standards. These plans are available on the Agency's public register.
<P>

<a name="30901w42.html_para2">The Government assessed the cost of meeting the Landfill Directive in a Regulatory Impact Assessment. We estimated that the Directive brought forward a number of requirements that will add between &#163;2.20 and &#163;4.40 per tonne to the mean cost of waste disposal, with costs ranging from &#163;0 to &#163;120 per tonne for specific waste streams. These costs will largely be passed back to the waste producers, reflecting the polluter pays principle, and will provide a further incentive to waste producers to reuse, recycling or otherwise minimise their waste production.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30901w42.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Bradshaw </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 16 July 2003]:</i> As a result of the Thomsen European Court of Justice (ECJ) judgment, quota holders, irrespective of status, who are no longer in active milk production will, by 31 March 2004, have to sell their milk quota, resume production, or otherwise have their quota confiscated. Where quota is confiscated, under the current UK legislation the quota holder has six years in which to resume production and thus have the quota restored. The new European Council quotas regulation, which is still under negotiation, provides for this period to be reduced to two years. Currently, only the quota holder may apply for restoration of quota but we are considering amending UK legislation to allow anyone with an interest in the holding/quota to apply.
<P>

<a name="30901w42.html_para4">Although representations have been made to the Department with regard to landlord/tenant issues in the light of the Thomsen judgment, it is not for Defra to intervene in cases where private tenancy agreements give rise to quota disputes between landlords and their tenants.

<P>
<a name="30901w43.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Hancock: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will make a statement on the Department's role in the monitoring of releases of radioactivity.  [126359]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30901w43.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Environment Agency, which is a non-departmental public body sponsored by Defra, authorises releases of radioactivity to the environment from nuclear licensed sites and non-nuclear premises in England and Wales. Authorisations specify limits on the amounts of radioactivity that may be discharged. The Environment Agency requires nuclear site operators to carry out monitoring of their own discharges and of the environment in the vicinity of their sites, to demonstrate the effectiveness of these controls.
<P>

<a name="30901w43.html_para2">The Environment Agency also commissions independent check sampling of authorised discharges and conducts a comprehensive programme to monitor radioactivity in the environment resulting from such discharges. Results have been published annually by the Environment Agency in its report "Radioactivity in the Environment", copies of which are in the Library. From 2003, the results will be published in "Radioactivity in Food and the Environment" (RIFE), which will be a joint publication between the Environment Agency, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency, Department of Environment, Northern Ireland and the Food Standards Agency.
<P>

<a name="30901w43.html_para3">Defra co-ordinates the monitoring of radioactivity in air, rainwater and drinking water at locations throughout the UK and submits the results to the European Commission in compliance with Articles 35 and 36 of the Euratom Treaty. The results are included in "Radioactivity in the Environment" and will be included in RIFE from 2003. The Food Standards Agency carries out its own extensive programme of monitoring radioactivity, to ensure that discharges do not adversely affect food safety, and it submits data to the Commission on radioactivity in dairy milk and a typical mixed diet. The Food Standards Agency and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency have jointly published their monitoring results annually in RIFE, copies of which are in the Library.
<P>

<a name="30901w43.html_para4">Defra is also responsible for operation and maintenance of the Radioactive Incident Monitoring Network (RIMNET) which is designed to detect radioactivity released as a result of an accident outside the UK. RIMNET continuously monitors gamma radiation at 93 locations throughout the UK and raises an alert if pre-set levels are exceeded.
<P>

<a name="30901w43.html_para5">The great majority of radioactivity in the environment arises from natural sources, such as the release of radon gas from the ground. Radon can accumulate in buildings and may contaminate private water supplies in some areas of the UK. Defra conducts an ongoing measurement programme of radon in homes 



<P>
<P><I>1 Sept 2003 : Column 852W</I><P>
and has carried out research in partnership with West Devon borough council into the levels of radon in drinking water from private boreholes and wells.

<P>
<a name="30901w43.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Syms: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what recent assessment she has made of the likelihood of achieving a household recycling rate of 25 per cent. by 2005.  [125040]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30901w43.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The provisional estimates from the Department's "Municipal Waste Management Survey" for 2001&#150;02 show that 12.4 per cent. of household waste in England was recycled or composted in that year. We are planning to meet our targets for 2005.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30901w43.html_wqn8"><B> Sue Doughty: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will set <i>(a)</i> national and <i>(b)</i> local statutory targets for waste minimisation; and if she will make a statement.  [125122]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30901w43.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Strategy Unit in its Report, "Waste Not Want Not", recommended that Defra in conjunction with ODPM and others should develop proposals for alternative indicators that incorporate success in reducing waste volumes&#151;for example, new combined minimisation and recycling targets for local authorities.
<P>

<a name="30901w43.html_para6">In its response, published on 6 May 2003, it recognised that progress must be made towards reducing waste. However, before considering whether to set waste reduction targets for local authorities, the Government will consider what levers local authorities have for reducing waste and whether, in fact, a reduction target is an effective means of encouraging waste reduction.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30901w43.html_wqn9"><B> Sue Doughty: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will raise the national targets for recycling of household waste to <i>(a)</i> 35 per cent. by 2010 and <i>(b)</i> 45 per cent. by 2015; and if she will make a statement.  [125123]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30901w43.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 In Waste Strategy 2000 the Government set a target of recycling or composting at least 30 per cent. of household waste by 2010 and 33 per cent. by 2015. The Strategy Unit report, "Waste Not Want Not", published in November 2002, recommended higher national recycling targets of 35 per cent. by 2010 and 45 per cent. by 2015. We recognise that national recycling rates higher than the current targets are both possible and desirable. The Government response to the Strategy Unit report commits us to reviewing the national recycling targets in the light of progress made by local authorities in meeting their 2003&#150;04 targets.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30901w43.html_wqn10"><B> Sue Doughty: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs which materials will be included in the review of a ban on the landfilling of recyclable products due to be carried out in 2006.  [125125]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30901w43.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 There is currently no ban on landfilling of recyclable materials and no review of a ban is due to be carried out in 2006. However, the Strategy Unit's Report, "Waste Not, Want Not", recommended that Defra and DTI should review the case for a ban on the 



<P>
<P><I>1 Sept 2003 : Column 853W</I><P>
landfilling of recyclable products in 2006&#150;07, and at the same time, consider the case for a similar ban on incinerating recyclable products.
<P>

<a name="30901w43.html_para7">In their response to the Report, the Government said they would like to see increased utilisation of valuable resources which are currently wasted but many materials will only be recycled if there is demand for them. Developing sustainable markets for recyclable materials is, therefore, an important prerequisite to a ban&#151;the Government do not want to create a new problem by requiring the long-term storage of recyclable materials for which markets have not been developed. The Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) was created to help develop these markets and the Government will continue to support WRAP'S role in market development. It would be preferable to avoid bans until other, more flexible, options have been exhausted.
<P>

<a name="30901w43.html_para8">However, the Government will review progress in market development and recycling rates in 2006&#150;07, and reconsider the case for banning disposal of recyclable products or materials then. The Strategy Unit has specifically mentioned a ban on biodegradable material if the other instruments designed to meet Article 5 of the Landfill Directive are failing to make progress. The system of tradable landfill allowances being set up under the Waste and Emissions Trading Bill will progressively reduce the amount of biodegradable municipal waste being disposed of to landfill.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30901w43.html_wqn11"><B> Sue Doughty: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will make a statement on Government waste minimisation programmes to <i>(a)</i> increase the number of households that practise composting, <i>(b)</i> promote reusable nappies, <i>(c)</i> promote a reduction of waste from supermarket purchased products and <i>(d)</i> create an innovation fund to develop innovative ways to deal with waste.  [125129]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30901w43.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 In accordance with the recommendations of the Strategy Unit, the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) will be taking forward a number of waste minimisation activities as part of Defra's new Waste Implementation Programme (WIP). These include a targeted national home composting programme to promote best practice and partnership working among local authorities, the development of a re-useable nappy service with a programme of support for SMEs, a major retailer initiative working with the top five supermarket chains and a waste innovation fund to provide resources to support innovation by retailers and others in areas such as minimising material used in consumer products. The budget to deliver these measures is &#163;8 million in 2003&#150;04.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30901w43.html_wqn12"><B> Sue Doughty: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what the objectives of the Recycling and Organics Technical Advisory Team are; who the members of the team are; how they were selected; and if she will make a statement.  [125130]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30901w43.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 In accordance with the recommendations of the Strategy Unit, the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) will be taking 



<P>
<P><I>1 Sept 2003 : Column 854W</I><P>
forward a kerbside recycling best practice programme. This programme will include the development of a Recycling and Organics Technical Advisory Team (ROTATE) whose objective will be to provide a national centre of excellence available as an advisory service to local authorities needing to implement and improve kerbside recycling, with some emphasis on organics collection systems and complementary support on Civic Amenity and bring site development.
<P>

<a name="30901w43.html_para9">The ROTATE team will be made up of a combination of in-house staff at WRAP and specialist external advisors. Staff recruitment is currently under way for the ROTATE Team Manager, and specialist advisers will be appointed through a competitive process, drawing on a range of appropriate expertise from the United Kingdom and overseas.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30901w43.html_wqn13"><B> Sue Doughty: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what role the Government will have in setting measurable targets for increasing public awareness and participation in recycling and waste minimisation activities which the Waste Resources Action Programme is undertaking as part of the Waste Awareness Programme; and if she will make a statement.  [125131]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30901w43.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Defra will work closely with the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) to define a number of output measures against which the progress of the education and awareness programme will be measured.
<P>

<a name="30901w43.html_para10">There are two elements to target setting for the WRAP'S education arid awareness programme. First, the setting of targets related to the national awareness programme and second, targets for raised awareness and improved participation in kerbside schemes related to support for local authority programmes.
<P>

<a name="30901w43.html_para11">A detailed review is being conducted by WRAP on target setting as part of an intensive first period of investigation and planning. WRAP will also call on a number of recent examples of good practice in communication campaigns that could assist in informing target setting, such as the work conducted by Rethink Rubbish in various local authorities across England.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30901w43.html_spnew14"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 In accordance with the recommendations of the Strategy Unit, Defra will be taking forward a new technologies workstream as a part of the new Waste Implementation Programme.
<P>

<a name="30901w43.html_para12">This workstream will deliver a number of objectives to overcome barriers to the successful development and take-up of alternative waste management technologies which reduce the environmental impact of waste disposal in England.
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if the Government will introduce penalties for local authorities which fail to meet the Government's statutory targets for recycling.  [125137]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30901w43.html_spnew19"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Government's statutory targets for recycling have been set under the Best Value regime. The Secretary of State has powers under section 15 of the Local Government Act 1999 to act where local authorities are failing to deliver best value. The way in which these powers 



<P>
<P><I>1 Sept 2003 : Column 857W</I><P>
would be used in support of Statutory Performance Standards for recycling and composting of household waste is set out in Annex A of "Guidance on Municipal Waste Management Strategies" (DETR March 2001), which can be found on Defra's website at: http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/waste/management/guidance/mwms/10.htm or in the Library of the House. The protocol to which Annex A refers has been agreed with the Local Government Association setting out the principles under which these powers will be used, and has been revised recently.
<P>

<a name="30901w43.html_para23">The Government have made it clear that they will work with local authorities to ensure that such failures are minimised, and that intervention will be the exception. The powers would be used predominantly to achieve improvements in service delivery, as opposed to tackling procedural failures. The nature and severity of the intervention will vary, and need to reflect several factors such as the amount by which the standard is missed, the steps a local authority had taken to achieve the standard, external factors such as problems with a market for a particular material, or unusual occurrences such as the recent fuel crisis and the likelihood of the local authority meeting the standard in the immediate future. If there was evidence to suggest that a local authority was not taking the right sort of steps in respect of its waste management duties generally, or its recycling standards in particular, then Ministers have made clear that they will take that very seriously.

<a name="30901w45.html_para2">The amount of hazardous waste sent to landfill in future years is affected by a number of factors, and it is difficult to predict the relative impact of these factors with any accuracy. The factors include the clear likelihood that the number of hazardous waste landfills after July 2004 will reduce significantly as a result of requirements in the Landfill Directive. The directive requirements, including the ending of co-disposal in July 2004, the requirements of the waste acceptance criteria, and the need for pre-treatment before wastes are landfilled will also increase the cost of disposal of hazardous waste, which in turn is likely to provide a greater incentive for the reduction of the amount and hazardousness of waste at source. Set against these factors are the impacts of changes to the European hazardous waste list adopted in January 2002 which introduce a number of new waste streams as hazardous.
<P>

<a name="30901w45.html_para3">The Government have established a Hazardous Waste Forum for all relevant stakeholders to discuss these issues and those relating to the provision of treatment capacity for hazardous waste.

<P>
<a name="30901w45.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The technical and regulatory requirements of the Landfill Directive, including the provisions of Articles 8 and 10, were implemented by the Landfill (England and Wales) Regulations 2002. Ensuring that financial provision is available is a requirement on the landfill operator. The Environment Agency sets out a range of mechanisms that it considers to be adequate to meet the financial provisions requirement in its Waste Management Licensing Financial Provision Manual. Landfill operators due to be re-permitted under the terms of the Landfill Directive were informed of this position in November 2002.
<P>

<a name="30901w45.html_para4">Discussions are taking place between the Government, the Environment Agency and the industry about how the requirement of Article 8 of the directive might best be satisfied given the various aims of the Landfill Directive and the particular need to ensure appropriate safeguards against insolvent operators are

in place. We have not yet made an assessment of the costs as this is dependent on the outcome of these discussions.
<P>

<a name="30901w45.html_para5">In the meantime, the Environment Agency did commission work on the long-term liability that landfills pose to England and Wales. Part of this work, carried out by AEA Netcen, calculated that the net present value of landfill liabilities (ie the closure and aftercare costs of completed landfills) up to 2020 would be between &#163;3-&#163;3.5 billion.
<P>

<a name="30901w45.html_para6">Article 10 of the directive is concerned with passing on the full costs of landfill to waste producers. To meet this, the regulations place a requirement on the operator of a landfill. This makes it a condition of the permit issued for the landfill, that the charges the operator makes for the disposal of waste at the landfill covers a number of aspects. These include the setting up and operating of the landfill, the costs of the financial provision and the estimated cost for the closure and aftercare of the landfill for a period of at least 30 years from its closure. Passing the full cost to the waste producer upholds the 'polluter pays' principle.

 No assessment has been made to date of the impact of the statutory recycling targets on either local authority waste strategies or the collection of green waste.
<P>

<a name="30901w45.html_para9">Under DEFRA's Waste Implementation Programme a Local Authority Support Team has been set up to support local authorities. As part of its work, the Team is reviewing Municipal Waste Strategies, Waste Local Plans, Regional Waste Strategies arid emerging Spatial Strategies. It is intended that the Team will then give Local Authorities useful feedback on any elements within the waste strategies which might suggest that they will not reach their statutory recycling targets and on ways of addressing such problems.
<P>

<a name="30901w45.html_para10">The number of households with a green waste collection rose from 1.6 million in 2000&#150;01 to 3.1 million in 2001&#150;02. The percentages of waste collection or unitary authorities collecting some green waste similarly rose from 17 per cent. in 2000&#150;01 in 2002&#150;03. We believe that the establishment of recycling targets will have been a contributing factor in bringing about this increase.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs how much was given in grants by her Department for research and development relating to waste management in each year between 1998 and 2002; and how much is allocated for such research in each year from 2003 to 2005.  [126877]<P>

<a name="30901w45.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Department funds research into waste directly, and indirectly through a number of bodies such as its NDPBs. Funding is shown in the following table.
<P>

<a name="30901w45.html_para11">Defra's new Waste Implementation Programme team funding will be allocated to projects in accordance with a three year strategy, which will be drawn up following a review of existing research provision and the identification of future research requirements, supervised by a new Information Advisory Group chaired by Defra and including key non-Defra stakeholders.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what research she has commissioned into the environmental impact of water use by consumers since 1997; what estimates have been made of future years; and if she will make a statement.  [126181]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30901w46.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Environment Agency has the duty to secure the proper use of water resources, ensuring that there is a balance between the needs of water consumers and the environment. As part of its research programme, the Environment Agency commissions applied research aimed at furthering the understanding of the complex link between water flows and levels and the ecology of rivers, lakes and wetlands.
<P>

<a name="30901w46.html_para0">In 2001 the Agency published national and regional strategies, "Water Resources for the Future", which identified areas where abstraction is believed to be unsustainable.
<P>

<a name="30901w46.html_para1">In 2001 the Environment Agency also published "A scenario approach to demand forecasting" which considered how future water use could be influenced by different socio-economic futures.

<P>

<a name="30901w46.html_para3">Since the Water Summit in 1997, Ofwat has set water companies annual leakage targets. This mechanism has achieved a significant reduction in leakage, both on the distribution network and customers' supply pipes. Most companies are now at, or close to their Economic Level of Leakage. This is the level at which it would cost more for a water company to further reduce its leakage than to use an alternative source of water. Water company leakage data are published annually by the Director General of Water Services in the "Security of supply, leakage and the efficient use of water" reports, copies of which are available in the Library of the House. Companies' leakage performance for 2002&#150;03 will be published at the end of this month.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what the Government's policy is on dealing with wild mink in the countryside.  [126766]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30901w46.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 American mink are an invasive non-native species and were introduced into Great Britain for fur farming in 1929. Release of mink into the wild is prohibited under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. Their population has continued to increase in range and numbers it is thought the rate of increase is declining.
<P>

<a name="30901w46.html_para4">The responsibility for the control of feral mink rests with those people most likely to benefit from such control, that is, individual landowners and occupiers. It is entirely at their discretion as to whether they wish to take such action against mink on their land.
<P>

<a name="30901w46.html_para5">However, predation by mink has been a factor in the decline of our native water vole population. The Government's Biodioversity Action Plan (BAP) for water vole encourages humane control of mink where they pose a threat to water vole populations.
<P>

<a name="30901w46.html_para6">There are various initiatives under way, limited geographically and financially, including some mink trapping in river catchments, supported by combinations of the Environment Agency (the lead organisation for the water vole BAP), English Nature and the local Wildlife Trusts, and other conservation organisations. These aim for local suppression of mink numbers, for example to assist water vole populations, rather than eradication.
<P>

<a name="30901w46.html_para7">Defra has no current plans for an eradication programme given the wide distribution of mink and the costs associated using current techniques for control.

 Japan is the lead nation on Disarmament, Demobilisation and Reintegration (DDR). In conjunction with the Afghan Transitional Administration and the International Community, Japan has set up the Afghanistan's New Beginnings Programme (ANBP) to implement demobilisation and reintegration programmes as part of security sector reforms. ANBP is a three-year programme estimated to cost $127 million, with an initial budget for the first year of $33 million.
<P>

<a name="30901w46.html_para8">At the recent Tokyo Conference on Disarmament, Demobilisation and Reintegration, more than $50 million was pledged by international donors. This is a good start. However, we must keep working on securing financing throughout the process. DFID, working closely with FCO and MOD, are also funding a Disarmament, Demobilisation and Reintegration expert, who has been seconded to the UN in Kabul, to assist with Security Sector Reform.

 The estimated cost of the project which was reported in the original World Bank/International Finance Cooperation Project Appraisal Document (April 2000) was US$3.7 billion, the majority of which is being provided by the private sector.

<P>
<a name="30901w47.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Hoyle: </B> 
To ask the Minister of State, Department for International Development what measures the Department is taking to tackle <i>(a)</i> illegal trafficking of children, <i>(b)</i> exploitation of children through child labour and <i>(c)</i> the commercial sexual exploitation of children.  [126861]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30901w47.html_spnew3"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 The trafficking of children is part of a wide range of issues relating to the migration of poor people to better their lives, and to their vulnerability to national and international smugglers and traffickers. Trafficking is an international problem requiring co-ordinated action. DFID's aim is to work to eliminate the poverty and social injustice that can lead to such abuse. Through our programmes to promote sustainable development and end poverty, DFID is helping to reduce the circumstances that give rise to this appalling trade, and which make women and children especially vulnerable. With other Government Departments, we are supporting the efforts of Governments and international agencies to strengthen social protection and justice in line with international treaties.
<P>

<a name="30901w47.html_para1">For example, in south-east Asia, we are supporting the International Labour Organisation's work to reduce the trafficking of women and girls, many of whom would enter the sex industry, in Laos, Thailand, China (Yunnan), Cambodia and Vietnam. It involves a number of activities to raise awareness and prevent the trade. In the Balkans, we recently supported the International Organisation for Migration in training the various agencies dealing with the victims of trafficking, including police, social workers and the legal profession, in order to create and disseminate models of good practice.
<P>

<a name="30901w47.html_para2">The Government are also committed to helping to eliminate child labour, particularly the worst forms such as child slavery and all forms of abusive or exploitative work. Many programmes supported by DFID help end

<P>
<P>
<a name="30901w47.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Lazarowicz: </B> 
To ask the Minister of State, Department for International Development what assessment the Department has made of the role of commodity stabilisation mechanisms in future trading relations between the European Union and developing countries.  [126259]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30901w47.html_spnew4"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 A number of commodity stabilisation mechanisms (including buffer stocks arrangements and export quotas) have been employed in the past, generally within the framework of International Commodity Agreements concluded between producer and consuming countries. In general, these mechanisms have not been successful and their practical limitations have been clearly demonstrated in practice.
<P>

<a name="30901w47.html_para3">Consequently, the UK is not supportive of direct intervention in commodity markets through globally imposed or similarly orchestrated measures designed to maintain or stabilise commodity prices. Rather, the UK favours initiatives that are voluntary, transparent, financially self-sustaining and which minimise market distortions.
<P>

<a name="30901w47.html_para4">DFID therefore does not intend to undertake any formal re-assessment of the potential role of commodity stabilisation mechanisms in future trading relations between the European Union and developing countries. Moreover, it is DFID's view that other institutions, such as the European Commission or the Common Fund for Commodities, might be better placed to conduct any such future assessment.

foreign direct investment to the poorest nations of the developing world; and what international mechanism the Government supports to facilitate this.  [126239]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30901w48.html_spnew1"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 The Government believe that, alongside domestic private investment, more quality, productive foreign direct investment is essential for growth and poverty reduction in developing countries. DFID supports a wide range of international efforts directed at improving the overall investment climate for such investment. These include support for: Comprehensive Investment Climate Assessments by the World Bank Group and the Commonwealth Business Council, which help to identify investment obstacles in particular countries; research by the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and NGOs on the benefits and costs of foreign direct investment; and the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) programme of technical assistance, which helps developing countries build their capacity to better understand, attract and regulate foreign investment. The Government also believe that an international investment agreement negotiated in the World Trade Organisation (WTO) could complement these and other initiatives aimed at facilitating foreign investment flows to developing countries.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30901w48.html_spnew2"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 In 1999, the UK Government led the way in securing the revision of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) framework to ensure that it provides these countries with a permanent solution to their debt problem and frees up resources to tackle poverty. The merit of the new framework is that countries qualify for debt relief if their debts exceed either 150 per cent. of their annual export earnings or 250 per cent. of Government revenues, whichever gives the greater amount of debt relief. Relief is provided to bring each country's ratios down to these levels. The reduced debt sustainability ratios under this new framework have allowed more countries to benefit from the enhanced HIPC initiative, with deeper levels of debt relief.

 The aim of the national immunisation campaign is to vaccinate 4.2 million children under the age of five against preventable diseases. Before the conflict, 98 per cent. of children under the age of five in Iraq were vaccinated for polio, and 92 per cent. for measles. Routine immunisation of children was suspended from the start of military action on 20 March 2003. An estimated 210,000 children were born in Iraq between then and mid-June. To rectify the break in the immunisation programme a number of national immunisation days have been announced by the Ministry of Health. The first took place on 22 June. Further national immunisation days are due to be held over the coming weeks. UNICEF reports that sufficient vaccines are now available in Iraq for six to eight months of routine immunisation activities.

relief alone cannot deliver the resources needed to meet the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).

<a name="30901w49.html_para5">The Pan African Parliament and the Peace and Security Council each require 27 ratifications to be established. This was not achieved at the AU Summit. However, more countries did ratify: the Pan African Parliament now has 17 signatures and the Peace and Security Council 15 (although this number may have increased since the Summit). In the event of the Peace and Security Council receiving 27 ratifications before the next AU Summit, the Assembly mandated the Executive Council to elect the membership of the Peace and Security Council. No decision was taken on the location of the Pan African Parliament. The Assembly also adopted the Draft Protocol on the Court of Justice of the AU, which is now open to ratification by member states.

 Since 1988 the chief recruitment method of the Lord's Resistance Army has been the abduction and forced conscription of children. UNICEF Uganda estimate that 20,400 children have been abducted since 1990 and 6,000 of them are still unaccounted for. DFID supports the work of a number of indigenous civil society groups working for peace, including the religious and traditional leaders.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Causes of death in England and Wales were coded to the Ninth Revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9) from 1979 to 2000. Cerebrovascular diseases, which includes stroke and related conditions, were coded to 430&#150;438. In the Tenth Revision (ICD-10), introduced in 2001, the same conditions are coded to 160&#150;169. However, the way in which the underlying cause of death is selected from the conditions written on the certificate changed in ICD-10. This led to an increase of approximately 13% in the number of deaths attributed to cerebrovascular diseases in men and 9% in women. Time trends should therefore be interpreted with caution. The effects of the change in classification has been described in detail in ONS publications.i<sup>,</sup>ii</FONT></UL>

<P>
<P>
<a name="30901w53.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The Ministry of Defence is not considering any proposals to build two Future Aircraft Carriers capable of carrying only 20 aircraft.
<P>

<a name="30901w53.html_para0">The Future Aircraft Carrier programme is currently midway through its Assessment Phase. This phase is intended to reduce risk in emerging design solutions and balance the key parameters of performance, time and cost in order to best meet our developing capability requirements, both in terms of the ships themselves and in the aircraft they will operate. The current forecast cost estimate for the Demonstration and Manufacture (D&M) contract is around &#163;3 billion. Our target In-Service Dates for the two carriers remain 2012 and 2015 respectively and these will be confirmed prior to the award of the D&M contract, currently planned for Spring 2004.

 In the Strategic Defence Review published in 1998, it was envisaged that the two new Future Aircraft Carriers would be in the order of 30,000&#150;40,000 tonnes and be capable of carrying up to 50 fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters. The intention, as with any other new equipment project, has always been to refine the design during the assessment phase in order to best meet our developing capability requirements. The Carrier programme is currently midway through this assessment phase. The key specifications will be determined in capability terms prior to the award of the demonstration and manufacture contract, currently planned for Spring 2004.

 The Future Aircraft Carrier (CVF) programme is currently in its assessment phase and we have not yet placed a contract for the construction of the vessels. As my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence announced on 30 January 2003, the best means of delivering the carrier programme is via an alliance approach involving BAe Systems as preferred prime contractor with responsibility for project and shipbuilding management, Thales UK as key supplier of the whole ship design, and the Ministry of Defence. That remains our view. Subject to reaching a satisfactory outcome to the final stage of the assessment phase and to contractual negotiations, we plan to reach the final investment decision for award of the Demonstration and Manufacture contract in spring 2004.

<a name="30901w53.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The Future Aircraft Carriers, CVF, will have the primary role of providing the United Kingdom with a flexible expeditionary offensive air capability.

<P>

<a name="30901w53.html_para2">With the increasing likelihood of future operations being conducted by forces far from home bases and without the guarantee of host nation support, CVF will form a major element of our Joint Rapid Reaction Forces.

 <i>[holding answer 12 June 2003]:</i> Service personnel are entitled to the full use of NHS hospitals on the same basis as other United Kingdom citizens if appropriate military provision is not available. They will therefore benefit from the sustained investment through the NHS Plan which will reduce waiting times. Provision for accelerated diagnosis, treatment and rehabilitation to return Service personnel back to fitness faster than would otherwise be the case is available through Service Level Agreements (SLAs) with NHS Trusts that host the Royal Centre for Defence Medicine (RCDM) in Birmingham and Ministry of Defence Hospital Units (MDHUs). These SLAs also include provision for fast-track out-patient appointments if Service personnel are needed for immediate operational deployment. In addition, in 2003&#150;04, up to &#163;8 million for accelerated diagnosis, treatment and rehabilitation is available for use in the NHS or, as appropriate, with private healthcare providers. A pilot scheme for fast-tracking orthopaedic cases is currently being run at MDHU Northallerton. Finally, the joint MOD/Department of Health Reception Arrangements for Military Patients (RAMP) ensure that in times of conflict casualties are returned to the UK and receive the care that they need in NHS hospitals.

 The decision to reduce the number of Challenger tanks in Iraq to a single squadron, deployed with 19 Mechanised Brigade, was taken for purely operational reasons. The rest have been withdrawn since there is only a very limited security role for them following the end of the conflict with Saddam Hussein's regime.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will make a statement on procedures followed by his Department in notifying next of kin of deceased service personnel; what advice is given in respect to the speed with which next of kin must be informed of their bereavement; which personnel are involved; and what efforts are made to ensure that details are not released to the media in advance of the notification of the next of kin.  [126102]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30901w54.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Caplin: </B> 
 There are well established procedures for the reporting of casualties and missing personnel. The overriding principle is to minimise distress to bereaved families and to ensure they received timely and accurate information. However, it does take time to establish the necessary details, particularly in operational circumstances. With plentiful sources of immediate communication and close media interest, inevitably there is a risk that families will learn of an incident before they are formally notified. The Ministry of Defence endeavours to minimise this risk. An officer is despatched to inform the family as soon as the relevant details have been established. Normally the officer would be from the relevant unit or parent establishment, but where a family lived a significant distance away, consideration would be given to using an officer from a closer unit (preferably, although not necessarily, of the same Service) or the civilian police. Service officers selected to notify families are senior and experienced; often the unit commander or deputy will conduct this important and difficult duty themselves.

 Preventing transmission of disease is an important element of force health protection for troops participating in military action, including those who deployed to the Gulf. We seek to achieve this through a combination of medical intelligence to identify threats from endemic diseases and potential biological warfare agents; appropriate medical countermeasures, such as vaccination and antimalarial drugs; and physical protection measures, such as insecticide impregnation of uniforms and use of mosquito nets and appropriate insect repellents. In addition, educating personnel in the use of good hygiene and sanitation practices and enforcement of appropriate Health and Safety regulations play an important part.

<a name="30901w56.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 We take our obligations under International Law and the Laws of Armed Conflict to avoid collateral damage and excessive military casualties very seriously. Any loss of life, particularly civilian, is deeply regrettable, but in a military operation the size of Operation Telic it is also unavoidable. Through very strict rules of engagement, the use of precision munitions and the tactical methods employed to liberate Iraq's major cities, we are satisfied that the coalition did everything possible to avoid unnecessary casualties. We do not, therefore, propose to undertake a formal review of Iraqi casualties sustained from 19 March to 1 May.

 As of 27 July, the United Kingdom and Multi-National teams have destroyed 323,149 items of explosive ordnance, of which 211,550 were small arms ammunition. Non Government Organisations have recovered 180,353 items of explosive ordnance, of which 58,744 have so far been destroyed. The rest are in storage awaiting disposal.

 There is no means of knowing how many Iraqi children have been killed while dismantling Iraq's munitions. Coalition forces have, however, made significant efforts to educate local populations about the dangers of unexploded munitions. The United Kingdom and other coalition Explosive Ordnance Disposal teams in the UK's area of responsibility have completed over 1,000 disposal tasks and destroyed over 100,000 individual munitions. The Theatre Mine Risk Education (MRE) plan has been developed with the support of UNICEF and the ICRC. A poster and leaflet campaign has been carried out; head teachers in Basrah have been briefed; and military teams are delivering Mine/UXO awareness training to primary and secondary schools daily, using material approved by the ICRC.

 The Oil Ministry is located in Baghdad and has never fallen within the United Kingdom area of responsibility.

Certain sites within the UK area of responsibility are currently being guarded by UK Forces including key government buildings and public record offices. Overall, our approach is to re-establish local police and guard forces that will initially be trained and overseen by UK forces.

<sup>(68)</sup> On 25 October 1999, the Secretary of State for Defence announced in Parliament events that were to replace the Royal Tournament&#151;the Defence 2000 series&#151;25 October 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 696&#150;97. The Defence 2003 exhibition, under the leadership of the Royal Air Force, which was scheduled to take place at the Royal International Air Tattoo (RIAT) at RAF Fairford from 18 to 20 July, has been postponed by 12 months because of recent operational pressures. The RIAT itself will, however, go ahead as planned, with significant participation by RAF aircraft.<P>

 The Framework Ballistic Missile Defence Memorandum of Understanding (BMD MoU) signed on 12 June 2003 sets out the overarching structure for government-to-government collaboration between the United Kingdom and the United States on missile defence. It establishes and defines a framework within which specific activities, to be set out in Annexes to this MoU, can beundertaken. This includes activities already under way under the pre-existingStrategic Defence Initiative MoU. The BMD MoU itself provides no authorityfor placing contracts and no assessments were undertaken of the potential value of contracts resulting from collaborative projects that are in progress now, or may be undertaken in the future.

<a name="30901w57.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Caplin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 15 July 2003]:</i> On the completion of the combat phase of the campaign in Iraq, units which had a role in the stabilisation and rebuilding phase remained in theatre. Reservists serving with those units remained with them. Units which did not have a role in the stabilisation and reconstruction phase returned to the United Kingdom and, in the main, the reservists attached to them returned with their units; however, some reservists from these units with scarce and badly-needed skills were re-deployed to other units in theatre which had shortfalls.
<P>

<a name="30901w57.html_para7">Regular members of two units, 33 and 34 field hospitals, returned to the UK shortly after the cessation of hostilities in order to take on another operational role and for a period of leave before re-deploying back to theatre. Reservists who were attached to 34 field hospital, and had skills required for the continuing operations, remained in theatre to complete up to six months' deployment.
<P>

<a name="30901w57.html_para8">Reservists called out for the current operations in Iraq have been advised that their deployments will be for up to six months; the end of tour date for their units has not yet been decided but is unlikely to be more than six months after deployment. The expectation is that all reservists will return with their regular units.

<a name="30901w58.html_para0">We are aware that difficulties over pay or allowances were experienced by a small number of Territorial Army personnel during their period of mobilisation. In most instances, these were the result of administrative delays in the processing and passing of key information to the Army Pay computer systems. Reports from units indicate that a small number of reservists had a short delay before payment of their Reservists' Hardship Allowance and Reservists' Standard Award because the paperwork had to be manually assessed and there were some instances of incomplete or missing paperwork.

<i>[holding answer 16 July 2003]:</i> An environmental and sustainability appraisal was undertaken by the RAF in relation to the Strategic Review for RAF Lyneham, RAF Brize Norton and RAF St. Mawgan. In addition, the Ministry of Defence's Directorate of Economic Advice produced an assessment of the economic impact of a decision to close RAF Lyneham. A copy of these documents will be placed in the Library of the House. A regional impact assessment was carried out in relation to the Strategic Review which included an assessment of the socio-economic effects of the various options being considered by the Review.

<i>[holding answer 25 June 2003]:</i> Armed Forces personnel who are found guilty of criminal charges requiring imprisonment are detained within Her Majesty's Prisons. There are no separate "military prisons". However, detention facilities are available at guardrooms in units and establishments in the United Kingdom and elsewhere in the world. When it is necessary to hold an individual in custody pending their trial or sentencing, they are usually held at a local detention facility. An average of around 1,000 personnel per year have been held at the Military Corrective Training Centre (MCTC) in Colchester. The following table gives the number of attempted suicides, suicides, and incidents of self harm of members of the armed forces either in custody or awaiting a custodial sentence at the MCTC in Colchester. Information on members of the Armed Forces held in custody elsewhere is not held centrally and could only be provided at disproportionate cost.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what efficiency savings have been achieved by the Training Group Defence Agency in each year since 1998&#150;99.  [126146]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30901w59.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Caplin: </B> 
 Efficiency targets for the Training Group Defence Agency (TGDA) were set as input targets for the years prior to Financial Year 2002&#150;03. Achievement was &#163;20.354 million in FY 1999&#150;2000 and &#163;6.441 million in Financial Year 2000&#150;01.
<P>

<a name="30901w59.html_para0">In Financial Year 2002&#150;03 efficiency targets and measurements were presented to and approved by the PSX, which enabled the efficiency PSA to be expressed in output terms. The target for Financial Year 2002&#150;03 was to reduce the average cost of a trainee to &#163;180,560. This was achieved.
<P>

<a name="30901w59.html_para1">Following the QQR and associated revaluations of assets, which would distort absolute figures, the definition of efficiency was reviewed and restated as a percentage reduction compared with the initial baseline set as the outturn from Financial Year 2000&#150;01. This declared mat TGDA would achieve a 0.75 per cent. per annum reduction in the average cost of a recruit graduating from initial specialist training.
<P>

<a name="30901w59.html_para2">In Financial Year 2002&#150;03, TGDA met the 0.75 per cent. target and believe that they have achieved a slightly greater reduction that the target set. This will be validated once year end accounts are completed.

 I refer the hon. Member to the answer I gave him on 23 June 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 539W. The Adjutant-General, who is responsible for pre-1900 British war graves, earlier this year funded a study by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission into the costs of restoring and maintaining those graves in South Africa.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30901w59.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Bellingham: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health what the expected cost to industry is of the Food Supplements Regulations (England) 2003; how many food supplements and nutrients are to be removed from sale as a result of the regulations; and what assessment her Department has made of British manufacturers' and retailers' representations on the regulations.  [121909]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30901w59.html_spnew5"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 The United Kingdom has no choice but to implement the Food Supplements Directive in order to fulfil its obligations under the European Community treaty. The Food Supplements (England) Regulations 2003 take full advantage of all the flexibility available to member states in implementing the legislation, which has been welcomed by British manufacturers and retailers of food supplements.
<P>

<a name="30901w59.html_para5">The costs to the British food supplements industry will result from mandatory new labelling requirements in the Directive, from reformulation of products where necessary, from dossier preparation where industry chooses to do this and from possible future loss of products from the market. The Government's assessment of the costs associated with implementing the Directive, including those due to removal of products from sale, are set out in the Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA). Copies have been placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="30901w59.html_para6">The Food Standards Agency does not hold information about the numbers of food supplement products on the UK market. According to information provided by industry, Annex I of the Food Supplements Directive excludes from use six minerals that are currently used in products marketed in the UK and around 300 chemical forms of vitamins and minerals currently used in products on the UK market are not 



<P>
<P><I>1 Sept 2003 : Column 923W</I><P>
included in Annex II. However, these may continue to be used in food supplements after 1 August 2005 provided the criteria in Article 4(6) of the Directive are met.
<P>

<a name="30901w59.html_para7">Many groups have expressed concerns about the potential impact of the Directive, and hence the implementing Regulations, on the UK market. The Government understand these concerns, many of which are also set out in the RIA. Given anxieties about the cost of dossier production and the timescale for dossier submission, the need for a meeting with European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to discuss requirements for dossier content has now been agreed, following representations from the Food Standards Agency. The EFSA and relevant parties will meet to discuss the potential for simplified dossiers. The European Commission supports this move.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30901w59.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Tyrie: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health what assessment he has made of the implications for <i>(a)</i> specialist manufacturers, <i>(b)</i> specialist retailers and <i>(c)</i> consumer choice of the requirement to remove from the market nutrients and nutrient sources which are not listed as acceptable for such use in the Schedules to the proposed Food Supplements (England) Regulations 2003.  [124161]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30901w59.html_spnew6"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 The United Kingdom has no choice but to implement the Food Supplements Directive in order to fulfil its obligations under the European Community treaty. The Food Supplements (England) Regulations 2003 take full advantage of all the flexibility available to member states in implementing the legislation.
<P>

<a name="30901w59.html_para8">The Government recognise that some products may be lost from the UK market from 1 August 2005 because of restrictions on nutrient sources which will apply from that date. However, it is not yet possible to fully assess the implications of the Directive for specialist manufacturers, retailers and for consumer choice since these will depend upon future developments on lists of permitted nutrients and nutrient sources and on maximum limits for vitamin and minerals in food supplements.

 The NHS Plan set out the intention to make available authoritative guidance on all aspects of National Health Service Cancer Care.

<a name="30901w60.html_para13">The guidance programme initially focused on the three commonest forms of cancer (breast, colorectal and lung cancer).

<P>
<a name="30901w61.html_spnew2"><B> Dr. Ladyman  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 14 July 2003]:</i> I believe this question refers to standard 31.7 of the care homes for adults (18 to 65) standards, which says that volunteers should supplement and not replace paid staff and that volunteers should not undertake tasks which are the responsibility of paid staff. The equivalent standard in the care homes for older people standards is 36.5.
<P>

<a name="30901w61.html_para3">The intention of these standards is to ensure that volunteers are not used to enable a care home to avoid employing suitably qualified, competent and experienced staff in numbers appropriate to meet the assessed needs of the residents. There is no intention in either standard to prevent volunteers assisting with lifting residents in the care home where this is appropriate and subject to the Manual Handling Operations Regulations 1992 being taken into account.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30901w61.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 There are elements within the electronic transmission of prescriptions (ETP) systems that general practitioner practices that participated in the pilots could continue to use as part of the electronic prescribing process. This arrangement will likely to be subject to agreement between the practices and pilot consortia. It will not be possible however to transmit the prescription electronically using a GP's electronic signature as the temporary legislation to enable the ETP pilots to use electronic signatures was put in place for the pilots only. The Prescription Pricing Authority will continue to receive electronic prescriptions for payment processing until 30 September 2003 to ensure that patients who have signed up for the pilot do not experience difficulties in obtaining their prescriptions and that they are clear about the arrangements for receiving their medicines once ETP transmission has ceased. After 30 September 2003, participating GPs will revert to the manual process.

<i>[holding answer 2 July 2003]:</i> There are many measures already in place to help women who suffer from endometriosis. We are determined to improve the awareness of endometriosis and provide funding to the National Endometriosis Society, through the Section 64 general grants scheme towards their core activities. We are also providing &#163;39,000 to the society to produce information leaflets. One leaflet is for women to encourage those with symptoms to discuss with their general practitioner and another is for GPs to highlight the symptoms so they can refer women for investigation and treatment.
<P>

<a name="30901w62.html_para0">We support GPs, knowing more about endometriosis. The National Institute for Clinical Excellence released a guide to the National Health Service in 2001 on appropriate referral practice. The referral advice covers eleven common conditions and has been developed as an educational resource for local health communities to develop their own local service guidelines. The advice is structured to provide clinical criteria on which to assess the urgency of referral across the range of conditions. Although endometriosis is not one of the conditions included in the advice, this might help give us an effective way of offering referral guidance to GPs on endometriosis among the range of other common conditions. We also want to see gynaecologists undertaking continuing professional development so they are kept abreast of the latest knowledge and best practice.

It is the role of the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) to produce clinical guidance rather than the Department of Health. NICE is undertaking a referral practice project on advice to general practitioners about referring common conditions, the results of which should give us an effective way of offering referral guidance to GPs on endometriosis and other common conditions.

<P>

<a name="30901w62.html_para5">The MRC always welcomes high quality applications from the scientific community for support into any aspect of biomedical research and these are judged in open competition with other demands on funding.

<a name="30901w62.html_para6">The Department of Health funds research to support policy and the delivery of effective practice in the national health service. The Department also provides NHS support funding for research commissioned by the research councils and charities that takes place in the NHS.

They take account of the burden of disease, potential benefits and departmental objectives, as well as the responsibilities and work of other research funders. As an outcome of these on-going processes, the Health Technology Assessment Programme recently published the report of a research project on the management of menorrhagia, which is sometimes associated with endometriosis.

 Feedback from the independent complaints advocacy service (ICAS) pilots has been collected in two ways. Statistical data were collected from the ICAS pilots on a quarterly basis and the information received from the second quarter provided information for tenderers of the new service on volumes of caseload broken down into levels of complexity of complaints. Qualitative analysis of regular ICAS pilots' reports and regional meetings of ICAS pilots informed the tender requirements by raising issues such as working to consistent national standards and the need for arrangements with specialist providers for complex casework. A final evaluation of the pilots is now under way and will build on feedback on issues such as relationships with national health service complaints and patient advocacy liaison services departments, as well as best ways for working with vulnerable groups. A final report will be published in October 2003 and will inform on-going service provision by the new ICAS providers as well as the Commission for Patient and Public Involvement in Health with its role of monitoring the ICAS service.

<P>
<a name="30901w65.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Godsiff: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health what impact the introduction of the Medicines for Human Use (Clinical Trials) Regulations in May 2004 will have on trials of new treatment regimes carried out by researchers in hospitals and universities; and if he will make a statement on how the directive will be implemented in the UK.  [126828]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30901w65.html_spnew0"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 The draft regulations are to transpose into United Kingdom law, Directive 2001/20/EC on approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the member states relating to implementation of good clinical practice in the conduct of clinical trials on medicinal products for human use. Consultation on the draft regulations closed on 16 May 2003. The Medical Research Council's (MRC) response is available in full on its website. Its assessment reflected the main concerns expressed by the charitable and public sector.
<P>

<a name="30901w65.html_para0">The Department of Health and the MRC have agreed jointly to lead a project to clarify the arrangements for publicly funded clinical trials involving medicines in the UK. It will draw up practical advice to enable publicly funded clinical trials involving medicines to comply with the law while making best use of existing good practice, minimising additional bureaucracy and making maximum use of public resources to avoid unnecessary expense.
<P>

<a name="30901w65.html_para1">The project is about to start, under the chairmanship of Professor Kent Woods, Director of the national health service health technology assessment programme. It will draw extensively on expert advice from trialists and from the charitable and public sector.
<P>

<a name="30901w65.html_para2">Member states are required to implement the Directive fully by 1 May 2004. I announced that the process of developing the regulations should be completed some time after Parliament reconvenes in October, with the aim of an update around that time.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30901w65.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The Department of Health does not collect information on sick pay or injury benefits centrally as these are matters for individual national health service employers. Information for individual NHS trusts should be available locally.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30901w65.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 All staff in the national health service have access to confidential counselling services and best practice is that staff are offered counselling after accidents and injuries. Referring employees to occupational health or infection control staff, who will carry out the necessary tests to ascertain whether there has been any transmission of a blood borne virus, is usually done during working hours, as is counselling. There is no centrally held data available on the exact cost of counselling services provided by NHS employing organisations.
<P>

<a name="30901w65.html_para9">The Department of Health does not collect data on individual litigation cases. "The National Audit Office Report A Safer Place to Work&#151;Improving the Management of Health and Safety Risks to Staff in NHS Trusts", estimated that compensation payments cost the NHS &#163;1.5 million in 2001&#150;02. The average compensation payment negotiated by UNISON with NHS employers for needlesticks injuries that do not result in the transmission of blood borne viruses is currently &#163;2,000.

[127005]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30901w65.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B>

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what emotional and psychological support is provided to nurses and other health care staff who are concerned about having been infected with a blood-borne virus contracted through needle stick injury.  [127006]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30901w65.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 National health service staff who experience a needle stick injury which they believe may result in their being infected with a blood borne virus are referred to infection control staff who carry out the necessary tests and provide advice and counselling. If the health care worker concerned requests it, they will also be referred to a counselling service.

 Since it was established in April 2001, the National Health Service Leadership Centre has drawn up development portfolios for chief executives, executive directors and clinical staff across the NHS. Most recently a development portfolio has been developed with the NHS Appointments Commission for chairs. These programmes are designed to provide focused development and have helped to track the careers of some senior staff in the NHS. More recently, the Leadership Centre has established a career development and succession planning scheme known as 'NHS Leaders'. This is intended to build and strengthen leadership across the NHS; to ensure that all senior leaders have personal development plans and are supported in their career development; to provide information to support appointments and succession planning; and to provide tailored development for newcomers to improve the performance of the NHS. A database of all senior leaders has also been compiled which will track the careers of these leaders.

<P>
<a name="30901w66.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 Entitlement to national health service hospital treatment is based on residence in the United Kingdom. People who are not normally resident in the UK are subject to the provisions of the National Health Service (Charges to Overseas Visitors) Regulations, as amended, in 1991 (SI No. 438), 1994 (SI No. 1535), 2000 (SI No. 602), 2000 (SI No. 909).
<P>

<a name="30901w66.html_para9">The regulations place a responsibility on NHS trusts to establish a patient's residence. All patients should be asked, as a routine part of the admissions procedure, about their residence in the UK. A more detailed interview follows if it appears that they may be liable to charges. The Department of Health issued guidance to the NHS on this in 1988. Updated guidance was issued on 27 July 2003.

 Overseas residents visiting the United Kingdom are eligible for free emergency or immediately necessary treatment from a primary care provider. For other primary medical care general practitioners or personal medical services, providers may accept such people as registered patients or as fee paying private patients. The Government expect general practice to exercise this discretion with sensitivity and due regard to the circumstances of each case. NHS walk-in centres routinely charge overseas visitors for use of the service.

 Good progress has been made since the national health service prostate cancer programme was launched on 6 September 2000, setting out the Government's approach to improving prostate cancer services in England and Wales.
<P>

<a name="30901w67.html_para15">As part of the prostate cancer risk management programme (PCRMP), evidence-based primary care resource packs were sent to all general practitioners in England from 23 September 2002 to aid them in counselling men who are worried about prostate cancer, ensuring the men make an informed choice about whether or not to have a prostate specific antigen (PSA) test.
<P>

<a name="30901w67.html_para16">Other elements of the PCRMP include ensuring that a systematic and standardised follow-up pathway is available for individuals whose test result is above the PSA threshold and action to improve the quality of laboratory testing of PSA samples. Primary care and laboratories were informed of the related recommendations from the scientific reference group, which supports the PCRMP in September 2002.

This is a twenty-fold increase compared with 1999&#150;2000. Two National Cancer Research Institute prostate cancer research collaboratives have been established in Newcastle and London. Funded research includes studies on various treatments for prostate cancer, improving the PSA test and ethnic differences in prostate cancer incidence. The National Cancer Research Institute considered prostate cancer as part of its Strategic Analysis in 2002, but made no specific recommendations.
<P>

<a name="30901w67.html_para18">The Department is funding a Section 64 grant to the Prostate Cancer Charity to increase availability of further information about prostate cancer.

<sup>(84)</sup> Rates calculated using numbers of deaths coded under ICD9 adjusted to be on the same basis as ICD10&#151;see Note B below:<P>

<P>





Note B: Causes of death in England and Wales were coded to the Ninth Revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9) from 1979 to 2000. Cerebrovascular diseases which includes stroke and related conditions, were coded to 430&#150;438. In the Tenth Revision (ICD-10), introduced in 2001, the same conditions are coded to 160&#150;169. However, the way in which the underlying cause of death is selected from the conditions written on the certificate changed in ICD-10. This led to an increase of about 13 per cent. in the number of deaths attributed to cerebrovascular diseases in men and 9 per cent. in women. Time trends should therefore be interpreted with caution. The effects of the change in classification has been described in detail in ONS publications.<P>

<a name="30901w69.html_para1">Further evidence of the benefits of regular physical activity, including walking, will emerge from the forthcoming local exercise action pilots (LEAP) that are being developed with Sport England and the Countryside Agency. The LEAP programme will test different evidence based community approaches to increasing access to, and the levels of physical activity, with a particular focus on hard to reach and at risk groups. Walking will be a feature of several of the LEAP pilots and will be included in the evaluation of the whole programme.

<a name="30901w69.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The Department does not accept that achieving Working Time Directive compliance by itself will lead to the closure of services. On 17 July strategic health authorities were asked to ensure that every hospital prepares a local action plan by the end of this year to achieve compliance and maintain local services. Those trusts facing the greatest challenges will have priority when postgraduate deans allocate 1,500 additional specialist registrar training places available this year. Maternity and accident and emergency services will be included in this process.

 <i>[holding answer 30 June 2003]:</i> The Government made it clear when the original &#163;12 fee was announced that it was our intention that the Criminal Records Bureau would be self-financing in the medium term. That remains our objective. However, in the short term, the costs of the CRB will continue to be met by a combination of fee receipts and contributions from the Home Office, the Department of Health and Department for Education and Skills. The CRB is expected to achieve full cost recovery from 2005&#150;06.
<P>

<a name="30901w69.html_para2">In view of the need to maintain an even as possible demand for the Disclosure service it was not possible to consult on the fee increase in advance of the announcement on 5 June.
<P>

<a name="30901w69.html_para3">Responsibility for paying the fee rests primarily with the individual applicant, although it is open to the employer to reimburse the cost. Disclosures will continue to be issued to volunteers free of charge.
<P>

<a name="30901w69.html_para4">A Regulatory Impact Assessment which assesses the impact of the fee increase for the voluntary and business sectors has been placed in the Library. In line with normal practice, a further assessment would be undertaken to accompany any future increase in fees that was above inflation.

<a name="30901w70.html_spnew2"><B> Caroline Flint: </B> 
 There were no pilot schemes for antisocial behaviour orders (ASBOs). They were introduced across the whole of England and Wales under the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 on 1 April 1999. In the period to 31 March 2003, the courts reported 1,112 ASBO's had been made.
<P>

<P>

<a name="30901w70.html_para4">The Police Reform Act 2002 introduced interim orders, orders on conviction in criminal courts and orders in county court proceedings, enabled the British Transport Police and registered social landlords to apply for ASBOs and extended the area an ASBO can cover to any defined part or the whole of England and Wales.
<P>

<P>
<a name="30901w71.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 The Home Office has always acknowledged the need to improve the accuracy and presentation of the recorded crime statistics. Two important reviews were published in July 2000 which dealt with both these points, and a range of other matters.
<P>

<a name="30901w71.html_para1">The first was the "Review of Crime Statistics" (the 'Simmons Review'), which made a total of 66 recommendations. The report set out clearly some of the problems with the arrangements in place at that time and provided a blueprint for a system of crime statistics in England and Wales designed to overcome those problems and to provide a clearer and more reliable set of crime data. A group was established to oversee this review and to ensure that the recommendations were 



<P>
<P><I>1 Sept 2003 : Column 969W</I><P>
sound, and that group received cross-party support. The full review and the conclusions of this expert group, which asked only that the recommendation relating to establishing an index of crime not be implemented, are available on the Home Office website.
<P>

<a name="30901w71.html_para2">The second report was a thematic inspection report by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC), entitled "On the Record". One of the conclusions of that report was that interpretation of the Home Office Counting Rules for recording crime by police forces was inconsistent and made it hard to establish the degree to which differences in crime rates were simply due to recording factors, or represented a real change in crime.
<P>

<a name="30901w71.html_para3">As a result of both of these reports, the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) developed the new National Crime Recording Standard. The Standard aims to promote a greater consistency between police forces in the recording of crime and to take a more victim oriented approach to crime recording.
<P>

<a name="30901w71.html_para4">The National Crime Recording Standard was adopted nationally with effect from 1 April 2002. However, the work to establish standards for recording and greater consistency is on-going. In .addition, a new audit regime has been introduced, overseen by the Police Standards Unit in the Home Office and carried out on their behalf by the Audit Commission. The audits are designed to ensure that forces are implementing the Standard and applying the Counting Rules correctly. In addition, Force Crime Registrars are encouraged to undertake their own internal audits, and guidance has been provided to ensure that any such auditing is robust.
<P>

<a name="30901w71.html_para5">A further data source is the British Crime Survey (BCS). The BCS is considered to be the most reliable measure of personal and household crime in England and Wales and significant improvements have been made to the Survey recently. The Survey has increased its sample size from 20,000 interviews to 40,000 and it is now conducted on a rolling year basis. The BCS also includes those crimes that are not reported to or recorded by the police. While the BCS does not claim to count all crimes in England and Wales, it does provide a consistent measure of trends from one year to the next in those crimes of greatest concern to members of the public.
<P>

<a name="30901w71.html_para6">With regard to the presentation of crime statistics, the Review of Crime Statistics recommended that the recorded crime statistics and the British Crime Survey should be considered together. They are complementary series that, taken together, provide a better picture of crime than can be obtained from either series alone. The publication of the data in this way ensures that the public has available the most comprehensive picture of crime in a single volume and at the same time.
<P>

<a name="30901w71.html_para7">Figures from both sources were published together for the first time in July last year in "Crime and England and Wales 2001&#150;02" (Home Office Statistical Bulletin 07/02). The second combined volume covering the period 2002&#150;03 has been published and copies are available in the Library. We believe that this publication provides the best and most comprehensive presentation of the latest position on crime in England and Wales.

<a name="30901w71.html_para8">Due to the introduction of the new National Crime Recording Standard, this publication makes necessary adjustments to the recorded crime figures in order to present a more accurate picture of the real trends in crime underlying the recording changes. The Home Office Research Development and Statistics Directorate has published a further report, entitled "National Crime Recording Standard (NCRS): An Analysis of the Impact on Recorded Crime" to explain how these adjustments have been derived, and the impact both nationally and in individual police forces.
<P>

<a name="30901w71.html_para9">As police forces have now had a full year in which to implement the new standard, and as the research report shows that the impact of the new standard appears to be complete for our main target crimes, I am announcing that this is the last occasion on which we will make these adjustments to the recorded crime figures.
<P>

<a name="30901w71.html_para10">The Home Office is committed to continually improving both the accuracy and presentation of the statistics on crime, and will continue to make necessary changes to those statistics in order to do so in future.

 A copy of the Criminal Cases Review Commission's 2002&#150;03 Annual Report is available from the Library (and also at: www.ccrc.gov.uk). This sets out that the Commission's case review process is divided into several discrete Stages. Stage 0 is for initial inquiries, Stage 1 to assess eligibility for a review, Stage 2 screen to expedite those cases that can be reviewed with only modest caseworker effort. Stage 2 involves those cases requiring resource intensive reviews. A few of these will proceed to Stage 3, which requires the formal appointment of an Investigating Officer. The main build up of cases awaiting review therefore occurs at Stage 2 and the Commission has provided an analysis of this. The table and graph indicates the length of time as at 30 June 2003 that in custody cases (to which the Commission gives priority) and at liberty cases have been awaiting the allocation of a caseworker prior to the start of a Stage 2 review. table and graph indicates the length of time as at 30 June 2003 that in custody cases (to which the Commission gives priority) and at liberty cases have been awaiting the allocation of a caseworker prior to the start of a Stage 2 review.

 The priority for the Criminal Records Bureau is to ensure that the demand for higher level disclosures is fully met; to this end we have announced proposals for the introduction of checks on care workers starting in October. The Basic Disclosure service will not be introduced until this objective has been achieved. Moreover, we are considering the Independent Review Team's proposal that applications for Basic Disclosures should be routed through Register Bodies.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many additional cases he estimates will be brought to courts in London as a result of the enforcement uplift project; and how many of these cases he estimates will be dismissed.  [124968]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30901w73.html_spnew0"><B> Paul Goggins: </B> 
 London Probation Area's uplift project is intended to bring their performance on enforcement in line with National Standards so as to ensure that offenders who fail to comply with the requirements of an order or licence are returned to court quickly.
<P>

<a name="30901w73.html_para0">Latest sample monitoring (for the period April to May 2003) shows that London are meeting the enforcement standard in 53 per cent. of relevant cases compared with the national target of 90 per cent. The uplift therefore requires an improvement of 37 percentage points, or an increase of 59 per cent. in the number of cases currently enforced in order to meet the target. This would equate to approximately 250 additional cases per month.
<P>

<a name="30901w73.html_para1">Rigorous enforcement leads to greater compliance, so the number of cases brought to court would reduce as levels of compliance increased.
<P>

<a name="30901w73.html_para2">Based on statistics for London courts for the year 2001 (the latest for which data are available), we would estimate that few if any cases brought before the courts for breach of a community sentence would be dismissed. The 2001 figures for London and for England and Wales are given in the table.

 European Health and Safety Week in October 2002 was focused on psycho-social issues, including stress. The Health and Safety Executive, the sponsoring body, has not retained a complete record of organisations, including police forces, who participated in events supporting the Week's aims. However among forces in England and Wales that received regional or national awards for their activities, the total cost to those forces was estimated to be approximately &#163;10,500. This figure does not include the personnel hours spent organising events, and the abstraction time of those police staff who participated.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department pursuant to his answer of 3 June 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 667W, on flight attendants, for what reasons flight attendants are not required to obtain a Criminal Records Bureau check; and what plans his Department has to require flight attendants to have such checks.  [124027]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30901w74.html_spnew1"><B> Paul Goggins: </B> 
 The Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) issues Standard Disclosures in respect of positions falling within the Exceptions Order to the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974 and in the case of Enhanced Disclosures those positions also falling within s115 Police Act 1997. Flight attendants are not explicitly provided for in either of these two pieces of legislation. Nevertheless, depending upon the exact duties of individual flight attendants, they may on a case by case basis fall within the definition of a 'regulated position'. However, due to the nature of the organisations for which they work, there is no statutory obligation for them to be checked against the lists maintained by the Department of Health and the Department for Education and Skills of those individuals considered unsuitable to work with children. Therefore, there is no requirement in legislative terms for flight attendants to obtain a CRB Standard or Enhanced Disclosure.
<P>

<a name="30901w74.html_para1">The CRB is not responsible for imposing and enforcing requirements for obtaining CRB Disclosures. This responsibility lies with the Government Department or licensing/regulatory authority that regulates or has a supervisory role over the industry sector concerned.

<P>
<a name="30901w75.html_spnew2"><B> Paul Goggins: </B> 
 Significant efforts are being made across the prisons estate to reduce the number of absconds. This includes improvements to prisons' physical conditions, and the provision of better regimes with more purposeful activity.
<P>

<a name="30901w75.html_para2">At Kirkham prison an Abscond Prevention Group is examining and introducing a range of measures including: improved fence patrols; the feasibility of infra-red cameras; improvements to the establishment's intelligence systems with additional staff being used in the sifting and collation of intelligence data; and improved communications with the police.
<P>

<a name="30901w75.html_para3">At Wealstun, lighting and cameras covering the establishment's boundaries have been increased and staff are also working to ensure that reception procedures are strengthened, with induction interviews taking place prior to the prisoner's first night at the prison, in order to help prisoners settle in as quickly as is possible. Efforts are also being made to replace any old or sub-standard accommodation.

 National figures show that in the period April 2002-March 2003, 82 per cent. of victims of offenders who had committed serious sexual or violent offences were contacted within the eight week target, compared with 63 per cent. for the previous year. In London, 46 per cent. of victims were contacted within the eight week target compared with 22 per cent. the previous year; London Probation Area's performance for the first quarter of this year has shown a significant improvement, rising to 72 per cent. for January to March 2003. Part of the reason for this improvement is the resolution of difficulties in the London Probation Area receiving victim contact information promptly.

 <i>[holding answer 8 July 2003]:</i> Support from the Home Office is equally available to all prisoners' families and is not affected by any allegation that an individual is a victim of a miscarriage of justice.
<P>

<a name="30901w75.html_para6">The Home Office no longer has responsibility for reviewing the convictions of prisoners. The Home Secretary's powers to consider alleged miscarriages of justice came to an end on 31 March 1997. These were replaced by new powers vested in an independent body, the Criminal Cases Review Commission, which has a main responsibility under the Criminal Appeal Act 1995 to review suspected miscarriages of justice, and to refer a conviction, verdict, finding or sentence to the appropriate court of appeal when the Commission considers that there is a real possibility that it would not be upheld. Any family member can apply to the Commission on behalf of someone believed to be a victim of a miscarriage of justice. (The Commission will 



<P>
<P><I>1 Sept 2003 : Column 984W</I><P>
not generally review a case until the normal appeal process is exhausted). We would carefully explain this to family members writing to the Home Office and redirect them to the Commission.
<P>

<a name="30901w75.html_para7">The Home Office is funding the Royal Courts of Justice Citizens Advice Bureau's Miscarriages of Justice Project which supports prisoners, who have had their convictions referred back to the Court of Appeal by the Commission, in the period leading up to their release and for up to six months after. This service would extend to providing advice on Family/Relationship issues.
<P>

<a name="30901w75.html_para8">An individual whose conviction is overturned may be eligible for statutory or ex gratia compensation for a wrongful conviction and can apply to the Home Office. Both schemes are concerned only with the suffering of the victim of the wrongful conviction, so neither makes provision for compensation for the suffering of any relative or other third party. However, in deciding the amount of any compensation award made to an individual, the assessor will take into account the costs of prison visits and of any family campaign to get the conviction quashed.

<P>
<a name="30901w75.html_spnew8"><B> Caroline Flint: </B> 
 The Stewart Report did not refer to Terrestrial Trunked Radio (TETRA) masts. It focused on mobile phones and only listed TETRA as one of the existing standards for mobile communications.
<P>

<a name="30901w75.html_para9">There are no health concerns specific to TETRA masts. Operators must ensure that emissions from radio masts are below international health and safety guidelines in areas accessible to the public. Independent checks have confirmed that this is indeed the case for TETRA masts used for the new police radio communications system.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30901w75.html_spnew9"><B> Caroline Flint: </B> 
 Following the concerns raised in the Stewart report on "Mobile phones and health" about amplitude-modulated signals, we took expert advice from the National Radiological Protection Board's Independent Advisory Group on Non-ionising Radiation (AGNIR). Their report on "Possible health effects from Terrestrial Trunked Radio (TETRA)" concludes that

<a name="30901w75.html_para10">The AGNIR report also confirms that

<P>

<a name="30901w75.html_para11">The AGNIR experts made recommendations for long-term research to address remaining areas of uncertainty. We have taken this forward with an

<P><I>1 Sept 2003 : Column 985W</I><P>
extensive research programme. Results to date show that TETRA technology has no effect on calcium exchanges in cells&#151;the main concern of the Stewart report. They also confirm that all Airwave equipment fully complies with international health and safety guidelines. We have recently announced a &#163;5 million health monitoring study of police Airwave users.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30901w75.html_spnew10"><B> Caroline Flint: </B> 
 Airwave, the new radio communications system for the police service, is based on Terrestrial Trunked Radio (TETRA) technology. The Airwave framework arrangement under the Private Finance Initiative is in place until 2019. The Government initially committed &#163;550 million of central funding to the Airwave programme, which is also funded locally by police authorities. Options for funding Airwave in the longer term are under review.

<P>
<a name="30901w75.html_spnew11"><B> Caroline Flint: </B> 
 Airwave, the new radio communications system for the police service, is based on Terrestrial Trunked Radio (TETRA) technology. On the recommendation of independent experts, we asked the Radio-communications Agency to carry out audits of Airwave base stations, as they already do for mobile phones masts. 12 audits have now been completed. The results confirm that emission levels from Airwave base stations are hundreds of times less than international health and safety guidelines in areas accessible to the public. Results will shortly be available on the Radio-communications Agency website.

<P>
<a name="30901w76.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 Data on the number of injuries sustained in muggings and robberies in the specified years is not published. However, the British Crime Survey (BCS) is able to provide trend estimates of the number of incidents of mugging and robbery in England and Wales (Table A), additionally the BCS also collects information on the proportion of violent incidents involving injury (Table B). Violent incidents from the BCS can be classified into a violence typology comprising domestic, mugging, stranger and acquaintance incidents. Violent crime from the BCS can also be separated into robbery, wounding, common assault, and snatch theft. The information regarding injuries sustained for this latter breakdown is not published prior to 2001&#150;02 BCS interviews. Mugging is a popular rather than a legal term, comprising robbery, attempted robbery and snatch theft from the person. The BCS does not cover incidents against those aged under 16, nor those not living in private households.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department (1) how many prisoners have been denied parole in each of the last five years on the sole basis that they deny their guilt; if he will make it his policy to end this practice where risk of re-offending is deemed minimal; and if he will make a statement;  [121626]

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what the cost has been of the policing of the Peace Watch demonstration at Gate 10, RAF Fairford; what proportion of this cost was paid for from the Gloucestershire Constabulary budget; how many <i>(a)</i> demonstrators and <i>(b)</i> police were present on each day of the demonstration; and who authorised the notices warning of the authorisation of deadly force to be placed on fences at RAF Fairford.  [124194]<P>

<P>
<a name="30901w76.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 The Chief Constable of Gloucestershire Constabulary informs me that he is not able to identify separate costing for policing the Peace Watch demonstration at Gate 10. My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary has agreed to pay special grant towards the additional costs of policing operations at RAF Fairford.
<P>

<a name="30901w76.html_para9">I understand that for the duration of the Peace Camp there were between 20 and 30 demonstrators. As a general rule there was a unit of one sergeant and six constables in the vicinity of the Peace Camp. Under US service regulations it is normal procedure to place warning notices in particularly sensitive areas within military establishments. Thousands of these notices are used by US military forces around the world to delineate sensitive areas. The reference to the authorisation of deadly force, placed on internal fences only, did not intend to imply that any blanket pre-authorisation had been given.

<i>[holding answer 17 July 2003]:</i> My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary has set a target of 132,500 police officers in 2004. Police strength is already at record levels. The latest figures show that as at 31 December 2002 there were 132,268 police officers in England and Wales. The Crime Fighting Fund (CFF) provided the resources for forces to recruit 9,000 officers over and above their previous plans in the three years to March 2003. Funding for the continued employment of those officers has been provided in 2003&#150;04. In addition, the CFF is providing funding to support the recruitment and training of a further 650 officers in 2003&#150;04, funded at 75 per cent. of pay costs.
<P>

<a name="30901w77.html_para2">We are on course to achieve our target number of 2,500 Community Support Officers (CSOs) by the end of this financial year (2003&#150;04) and are aiming to have 4,000 CSOs in place nationwide by the end of 2005&#150;06.
<P>

<a name="30901w77.html_para3">The 2004&#150;05 funding allocation is currently under consideration. The amounts in respect of years 2005&#150;06 and 2006&#150;07 will be dependent on the outcome of the SR 2004 Government Spending Review exercise.

 The Prison Service's efforts to reduce the numbers of self-inflicted deaths in prisons are supported by a number of broader approaches for which money is allocated. These include addressing the effects of handling larger numbers and throughput of prisoners, the development of detoxification regimes,

and considerable Department of Health resources allocated over the next few years to extend mental health in-reach support arrangements for prisoners.
<P>

<a name="30901w77.html_para4">The Prison Service is in the final year of a three-year strategy to develop policies and practices to reduce prisoner suicide and manage self-harm in prisons. The programme includes a series of inter-related projects aimed mostly at improving relevant pre-custody practices; reception, first night and induction arrangements; inter-agency information exchange; prisoner care; detoxification; prisoner peer support; and strengthening investigations into deaths in custody. Investment of over &#163;21 million for the three years from April 2001 focuses on physical improvements and trials at six sites (Birmingham, Eastwood Park, Feltham, Leeds, Wandsworth, Winchester) and on full-time suicide prevention coordinators in the prisons where the risks are highest.

<P>

 We are committing significant funding to modernising and increasing the capacity of the prison estate. Funding has been provided for 2,820 additional prison places to be built at existing prisons. Two new prisons will also be opened at Ashford and Peterborough. Together with building programmes in progress, such as 400 additional places at Birmingham, the total useable capacity of the Prison Service estate will increase to around 78,700 by 2006.
<P>

<a name="30901w77.html_para17">In addition, the Criminal Justice Bill outlines a range of new sentencing options, including: the introduction of two 'intermediate' sanctions &#151;'Custody Minus' and 'Intermittent Custody' which will allow offenders to retain employment and family contact during the week while being held in custody at weekends. These are options for sentencers which avoid the unnecessary use of full-time custody.
<P>

<a name="30901w77.html_para18">We have also recently extended the successful Home Detention Curfew (HOC) scheme to four and a half months. HDC, by enabling prisoners to be released early but while still being subject to restrictions placed on their liberty, facilitates a smoother and more effective integration back into society.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what the average cost per annum of imprisoning one offender was in the last year for which figures are available, broken down by <i>(a)</i> cost of incarceration, <i>(b)</i> cost of policing and <i>(c)</i> cost of judicial system and sentencing; and if he will make a statement.  [126927]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30901w77.html_spnew15"><B> Paul Goggins: </B> 
 The average cost to the Prison Service per prisoner in 2002&#150;03 was &#163;36,268 per year.
<P>

<a name="30901w77.html_para21">The police spent on average &#163;830 responding to each recorded crime in 2002&#150;03, although this varies significantly by the type of incident. Based on Police detection rates the cost per detection is approximately &#163;3,500, however this includes some police activity on unsolved cases.
<P>

<a name="30901w77.html_para22">The cost of processing an offender sentenced to custody through the Criminal Justice System is estimated at around &#163;1,035 for 2000&#150;01. This included costs of the courts, legal aid, the Crown Prosecution Service and some Probation Service costs.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will place in the Library the risk assessment procedures used to assess prisoners' suitability for transfer to <i>(a)</i> category D prisons and <i>(b)</i> Kirkham Open Prison.  [125477]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30901w77.html_spnew16"><B> Paul Goggins: </B> 
 The definition of a category D prison is one that holds "prisoners who can reasonably be trusted in open conditions". Sentenced prisoners may be assessed for category D conditions either on initial categorisation following sentencing or during their sentence following a review of their security category.
<P>

<a name="30901w77.html_para23">The initial categorisation procedures use an algorithm to indicate a provisional security category for each individual prisoner. The algorithm takes account of: current offence(s), sentence length, previous offending, previous escapes or absconds and previous breaches of non-custodial disposals. An assessment is then made of this provisional category to determine whether it is appropriate. In the case of prisoners indicated for category D, this may typically include issues such as: current drug use; previous breaches of bail; the nature and circumstances of what may appear a fairly minor offence or vulnerability to bullying or coercion.
<P>

<a name="30901w77.html_para24">Prisoners have their security category reviewed at regular intervals. Those serving 12 months to less than four years are reviewed at six monthly intervals; those serving a determinate sentence of four years or more are reviewed annually. Prisoners may be reviewed more frequently than is warranted by their circumstances. The recategoristaion process places primacy on consideration of risk. The prisoner must be able to demonstrate a significant reduction in risk (to the public and/or of escape/abscond) to warrant recategorisation to conditions of lower security. Where category D is indicated as appropriate in terms of risk, consideration is then given to other issues that might suggest that the prisoner is otherwise unsuitable for open conditions. These might be issues of control, health care requirements or the need to complete educational or offending behaviour programmes. A fundamental review of categorisation is currently under way. Among other things, the review will be looking at the procedures for placing prisoners in conditions of low security.
<P>

<a name="30901w77.html_para25">These procedures apply to all prisons in England and Wales. Kirkham accepts prisoners who have been categorised D either by the local prisons or the training prisons. The prison does not accept prisoners who are serving, or who have served, a sentence for sex offences. Other prisoners who may have special requirements or present particular problems are considered on an individual basis for return to the closed estate.
<P>

<a name="30901w77.html_para26">I am arranging for a copy of the risk assessment form for a move to a prison of a lower security category and the assessment criteria for Kirkham prison to be placed in the Library.

<a name="30901w77.html_spnew17"><B> Paul Goggins: </B> 
 The information requested is not collated centrally and can be obtained only at disproportionate cost. The names and details of prisoners who have absconded are reported to the police as soon as possible after they event. The local police make inquiries in an attempt to find the absconder and ensure that police forces across the country are informed that the prisoner has absconded and is unlawfully at large. It is not necessary for a court to issue an arrest warrant.

 The National Probation Service for England and Wales (NPS) was established by the Criminal Justice and Court Services Act 2000 and came into existence on 1 April 2001. The NPS consists of 42 Local Probation Boards and a central administrative function provided by the National Probation Directorate (NPD).
<P>

<a name="30901w78.html_para0">Although the NPS does not produce a single service-wide annual report, each of the 42 probation boards is required under the Act to submit after the end of each financial year ending 31 March an annual report to my right hon.

 The confiscation powers in the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 are triggered by offences committed after the provisions were brought into force on 24 March 2003, so it will be a while before cases are dealt with by the Crown Court in numbers. To date, two confiscation orders with a value of &#163;53,000 have been made against convicted offenders in England and Wales. The value of cash seizures made under the new provisions in the Act which came into effect on 30 December 2002, and which are not dependent upon a conviction, is &#163;28.5 million. In addition, the Assets Recovery Agency has obtained freezing orders from the High Court in London and Belfast on five civil recovery cases with a total value of &#163;5.9 million.

 Strip searching of women prisoners is conducted in accordance with procedures outlined in the Security Manual. There is particular emphasis on ensuring that the dignity of the prisoner being strip searched is protected as far as is possible. To this end, male members of staff are not allowed in the general area where strip searching is undertaken. The prisoner is never totally naked and staff are required to be sensitive to the feelings of the prisoner.
<P>

<a name="30901w79.html_para9">Where women or girls are menstruating and are using sanitary protection in the form of pads, the prisoner removes the pad from her underwear herself and places it in a specially provided sanitary bin. The search is conducted swiftly and fresh pads are available to the prisoner once the search is completed.

 Mental health care issues, including Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and attention deficit disorder (ADD) are regularly discussed by staff in both departments in order to carry out the commitments for mental health in the NHS Plan. The NHS Plan includes provision for prisoners and a total of &#163;10 million is being invested in 2003&#150;04 to improve mental health services for them. Mental Health needs assessments were carried in all prison establishments last autumn to better gauge that need. By 2004 some 94 prisons, including all male local prisons and the majority of women's local prisons and young offender institutions will have received funding for community mental health in-reach teams to provide more comprehensive services for prisoners with severe mental health problems.
