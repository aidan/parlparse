 The House administration is responsible for 16 of the recommendations from the Speaker's Conference on Parliamentary Representation, on which good progress has been made. For example, since the previous response on this issue (29 October 2010), the proposal for Members being able to vote accompanied by their babies under a year old has been addressed through agreement in principle on nodding through such Members and practical ways of introducing that initiative are being developed; workplace equality networks have been set up to support Members and others on the estate; and more information is about to be published on the internet on accessibility in Parliament. Some of the report's recommendations fall within the purview of the House of Commons Single Equality Scheme, and will be reflected in the update to the Commission on that scheme in the autumn.</p>

            <p class="tabletext">I have already provided you with the average number of TriStar aircraft available per month during 2010. The figures in the tables below show the availability expressed as a percentage of the forward fleet that was categorised as fit for purpose, which I hope you will find helpful. I have also added figures for the first three months of 2011 in order to bring the information as up to date as possible. As there is always an expectation that some maintenance tasks will be carried out and the fleet numbers are small, the figures would never reach 100%. The Forward Fleet comprises aircraft which are serviceable and those which are short-term unserviceable, and could therefore be recalled if needed at short notice. Fit for purpose (FFP) aircraft include only serviceable aircraft available to the front-line commands for operational and training purposes.</p>

I visited Colombia in May and took the opportunity to emphasise to President Santos the importance we continue to place on human rights. During my meeting with Vice President Garzon he reassured me of the determination of the Colombian Government to create a culture of zero tolerance for human rights violations'. I expressed our full support, but also stressed that much remained to be done. There are some signs of improvement; extrajudicial killings have reduced significantly over the past two years and a Victims and Land Restitution Bill which will return land to those from whom it was forcibly removed was recently signed into law. Despite these positive advances significant challenges remain. We will continue to raise our human rights concerns with the Colombian Government, including in relation to individuals who have been detained for long periods without trial.</p>

I also announced that my plan to consult on improvements to the buying and selling process of park homes to prevent the unacceptable practice of the blocking of lawful sales by unscrupulous site owners and to provide an effective means of redress for residents where this happens. In May my officials and I met with key industry and resident partners, and my officials met separately with local authority partners and representatives of holiday caravan owners, to help inform the consultation and gain a better understanding of the expectations and aspirations of our partners in this sector of the housing market.

 The Department sponsors VisitBritain, which is charged with promoting Britain overseas, and VisitEngland, which is responsible for promoting England within the UK and to selected overseas markets. Total grant in aid in 2010-11 was £38.92 million, with £2937 million allocated to VisitBritain and £9.55 million allocated to VisitEngland. Funding is not apportioned by VisitBritain on a national or regional basis and it is not possible to disaggregate a specific England spend. Funding is not apportioned by VisitEngland on a regional or area-specific basis and it is not possible to disaggregate a specific Yorkshire and Humber spend, but the area is an important asset in the overall England offer and receives significant coverage in VisitEngland's marketing campaigns.</p>

                     <sup>(1)</sup> New amount owed is the sum of amounts imposed in the courts plus net transferred amounts
<sup>(2)</sup> The amount paid is monies received by the courts against any outstanding fine irrespective of age and will not necessarily be for fine amounts imposed in the same period.
<sup>(3)</sup> The payment rate is calculated by dividing the amount paid to HMCTS over a financial year by the new amount owed less the value of fines legally and net administratively cancelled for the same period.
<sup>(4)</sup> The payment rate excluding administratively cancelled is only available from 2005 only. Prior to that the data are not comparable due to changes in the way the payment rate was calculated. The payment rate excluding administratively cancelled is calculated by dividing the amount paid to HMCTS over a financial year by the new amount owed less the value of fines legally cancelled for the same period.
<sup>(5)</sup> April to December only.
<i>Notes</i>:
1. Financial penalties include amounts for fines, costs, prosecution costs, legal aid, victim surcharge, and compensation, unpaid fixed penalties, penalty notices for disorder that are transferred to HMCTS for enforcement.
2. Statistics on the amount paid are published by the Ministry of Justice in the statistical bulletins ‘Court Statistics Quarterly’ and ‘Judicial and Court Statistics’. The most recent published data relate to Q4 (October to December) 2010 and were published in Court Statistics Quarterly in March. The figures for Q1 (January to March) 2011 statistics will be published in Court Statistics Quarterly and revised statistics for 2010 (which are currently provisional) will be published on the 30 June 2011.

1. These data are presented on the principal offence basis.

Where the same sentence has been imposed for two or more offences the principal offence is the one for which the statutory maximum is most severe.

            <p class="tabletext">It is anticipated that the decision to close 22 Benefit and Contact Centres will save £14 million by 2015. It is not always possible to be specific about the savings that will be realised through the closure of individual sites. Hartlepool IIDB centre is a prime example as it is co-located with a Jobcentre that is not set to close. Under such circumstances Jobcentre Plus will negotiate with estate provider Telereal Trillium to achieve savings by handing back whole floors of a building or it will explore the inward co-location potential.</p>

 Everyone who claims employment and support allowance (ESA) will undergo periodic work capability assessments (WCA) to ascertain whether they still meet the conditions for the benefit. This is because entitlement to ESA is based on an individual's functional ability rather than the condition itself. Even individuals with lifetime impairments may be able to adapt to those conditions and take up some work. So it is important we can provide them with the right support to get back to work when it is appropriate.</p>

Those members of the G20 who are also part of the G8 agreed at the Deauville summit to improve the transparency of aid information.

 We encourage all donors to make their aid more transparent. The International Aid Transparency Initiative is a voluntary coalition of 19 major aid providers and 20 developing countries aiming to implement greater transparency. We will continue to encourage broader membership, including among emerging economies. We will press for aid transparency to be a key element of agreements at the Fourth High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness in Busan where traditional and non-traditional donors will come together to discuss how to deliver better results for poor people from our collective aid efforts.</p>

 My Department has completed three root and branch reviews of the UK aid programme, including in fragile contexts. The results of these reviews have been used to ensure all UK aid expenditure represents value for money for the UK taxpayer while bringing real benefits to the world's poorest people. All new DFID programmes, including those in fragile contexts, are now developed using a business case model, which puts value for money, results, and evidence about what works at the heart of the planning and evaluation processes.</p>

We are currently strengthening the existing processes in place for review of our programmes annually during implementation and at completion, which will place greater emphasis on results and value for money. The new approach will be introduced early in 2012 for all projects currently subject to annual review and for all projects newly-approved from January 2011.</p>

This way we are ensuring UK aid expenditure is open to public scrutiny. In addition, I have set up an independent body, the Independent Commission for Aid Impact (ICAI), to evaluate the impact of UK aid. ICAI are able to review any part of the UK aid programme including aid spent in fragile contexts.</p>

Notes:
1. The figures given in the table on court proceedings relate to persons for whom these of fences were the principal offences for which they were dealt with. When a defendant has been found guilty of two or more offences it is the offence for which the heaviest penalty is imposed. Where the same disposal is imposed for two or more offences, the offence selected is the offence for which the statutory maximum penalty is the most severe.
2. Every effort is made to ensure that the figures presented are accurate and complete. However, it is important to note that these data have been extracted from large administrative data systems generated by the courts and police forces. As a consequence, care should be taken to ensure data collection processes and their inevitable limitations are taken into account when those data are used.

 All victims of trafficking are offered a minimum 45-day recovery and reflection period. Some victims are UK nationals and some are EU citizens not subject to immigration control. Those that are subject to control may be eligible for a residence permit if their personal circumstances warrant them remaining in the UK or if they are co-operating with the authorities in a criminal investigation or proceedings.

               <a name="11062168001303"> As a demonstration of the importance we place on passenger clearance times, our targets and performance against them will be published this year (2011-12) as part of the Government transparency agenda. This will enable members of the public to be fully sighted on average passenger clearance times, based on samples taken across the UK's ports and airports. Our current target is to clear 95% of EEA passengers within 25 minutes of joining the queue and non-EEA passengers within 45 minutes. Current year to date performance sits at 98% and performance is closely monitored to ensure that deployment of resource is flexed to deal with increases in traffic and maintain overall passenger clearance times while ensuring the border remains secure.</p>

This will enable members of the public to be fully sighted on average passenger clearance times, based on samples taken across the UK's ports and airports. Our current target is to clear 95% of EEA passengers within 25 minutes of joining the queue and non-EEA passengers within 45 minutes. Current year to date performance sits at 98% and performance is closely monitored to ensure that deployment of resource is flexed to deal with increases in traffic and maintain overall passenger clearance times while ensuring the border remains secure.</p>

 A specific “at risk” flag common to all national police databases does not exist. However, flags do exist on some databases for example, ViSOR (Violent and Sex Offender Register), and there are other flags that could be considered as indicating an “at risk” status, e.g. suicidal. Furthermore, inclusion on some of the national police databases may in itself be considered indication that the individual is “at risk”, e.g. missing persons DNA database. Not all information from police computer databases is held centrally. These systems are operational tools which are not designed to produce the specific information requested.</p>

 The recent Government response to the fast-track review of Feed-in Tariffs confirmed the Government's intention to introduce new tariffs for solar photovoltaic (PV) installations of between 50 kilowatts (kW) and five megawatts (MW) and all stand-alone installations. We consider that, under the new tariffs, some schemes will continue to be viable, particularly under the new tariff for 50kW to 150kW projects. This, together with activity at the domestic scale, will contribute to the development of a viable PV industry in Great Britain.</p>

To improve life chances, we will tackle head-on the causes of poverty which underpin low achievement, aspiration and opportunity across generations. To help achieve these goals, the Department has introduced a number of initiatives specifically targeted at the most vulnerable children and families in our society:</p>

I believe, however, that schools are best placed to use their professional judgment to determine their own approach to sex education—including the resources they use to support their teaching—so that they can take account of the views of parents, the needs of the local community and the ethos of the school. We have made no assessment of the materials used in primary and secondary schools for the teaching of sex education, and have no plans to do so.</p>

               <a name="11062168002203"> All schools must have regard to the Secretary of State for Education's statutory guidance, “Sex and Relationships Education (2000)”, when teaching sex education. This is designed to protect pupils from teaching and materials which are inappropriate having regard to the age and religious and cultural background of the pupils concerned. Inappropriate images should not be used nor should explicit material not directly related to explanation.</p>

 The Department for Education does not collect data on the number of parental requests for authorised absence during term time. The Education (Pupil Registration) (England) Regulations 2006 state that head teachers may grant leave of absence during term time. The Department looks to schools themselves to consider each request as they can only be judged on a case-by-case basis taking into account individual circumstances.

 The current guidance “Schools, Parents and Parental Responsibility”, published in 2000 gives advice on the rights, under education law, of non-resident parents to be involved in their child's education. We know however that concerns have been expressed about this guidance. The coalition Government are reviewing schools guidance as part of their commitment to reducing bureaucracy. In reviewing this set of guidance we will seek to improve the clarity. New guidance will help all schools understand their legal obligations to provide information to parents about their child's progress, including that separated parents should be treated equally wherever possible.</p>

They are key settings for improving the health of children and young people. Good schools will be active promoters of good health in childhood and adolescence, including focussing on healthy eating, increasing physical activity and the provision of personal, social, health and economic (PSHE) education. Teachers may choose to explore awareness of medical conditions and their causes as part of PSHE education.</p>

However, all of these treatments are well established as being effective in a variety of different clinical settings for a range of different mental health problems. It is important that a variety of treatment options are available to clinicians, who are best placed to decide on the most appropriate treatment, or combination of treatments, on a case by case basis. Their decisions are informed by guidance produced by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence.</p>

 Monitor is an independent organisation charged with the authorisation of foundation trusts (FT) which are assessed by them following a strategic health authority (SHA) and Department of Health process, culminating in the Secretary of State's approval to proceed if appropriate. Monitor does not identify in advance those organisations who are unlikely to achieve FT status; this is the role of SHAs and the Department.</p>

 The remaining national health service trusts are working on Tripartite Formal Agreements with their strategic health authorities and the Department of Health. This work is required for all trusts as part of the application process, regardless of whether they have a private finance initiative (PFI) or not. When it has been finalised the agreement will be signed by all parties and the NHS trust will publish the agreement. The agreement will identify the issues the trust faces and the actions that will establish them as sustainable providers of high quality health care services. These developments will enable them to meet the demanding requirements needed to achieve foundation status. A list of the remaining NHS trusts has been placed in the Library for information.</p>

The CQC is aware of Southern Cross's proposals to save money through staff cuts and the risk that these cuts may directly affect the safety and quality of services. The CQC's primary concern is always to ensure the health, safety and welfare of people who use services. Though the CQC's responsive system of compliance monitoring, where there is any indication of increased risk of non compliance with the registration requirements, the CQC is following up through additional planned or responsive reviews to check compliance. Where the CQC finds non compliance it will act swiftly requiring improvements to be made within a specified time period.

 I take the “environmental, social and human rights guidelines set out in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's Common Approaches” to be the standards which should be used in an environmental review carried out pursuant to the Common Approaches. The guidelines apply, or do not apply, as the case may be, to individual projects. The Common Approaches contain within them a number of tests as to whether the guidelines should apply. Some are such that all transactions which the Export Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD) carries out within the terms of a particular scheme will fall outside the applicability of the guidelines. In other cases the individual terms of projects will have to be considered.</p>

               <a name="11062213000880"> Examples of schemes under which all transactions would fall outside the scope of the Common Approaches are those projects which benefit from official supported export credit with a repayment term of less than two years. This would include ECGD's new export working capital and foreign exchange credit support products.</p>

 We announced in May that we would discuss with interested parties .the issue of termination clauses in the context of further consideration of a possible new restructuring moratorium. Officials are currently engaged in that process. Any move to include other essential supplies in section 233 would have implications for the suppliers themselves and would need to be carefully considered in this context.</p>

Moreover, the Intellectual Property Office is pursuing a managed reduction in the stock of patent applications awaiting substantive examination. This is being achieved through matching resources to projected long-term demand, efficiency improvements, and selective use of overtime. The Office met its target of clearing all outstanding patent examinations older than 49 months by March 2011 and has been set a new target of reducing this figure to 42 months by March 2012.</p>
