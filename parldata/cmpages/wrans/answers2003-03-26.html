<P>
<P>
<a name="30326w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Greg Knight: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport for what reason and at whose expense a wooden fence is being erected adjacent to the southbound carriageway of the M1 motorway near junction 11; and what the total cost is of such work.  [104582]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30326w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The wooden fence is a noise barrier that will be provided next to both carriageways of the motorway through the centre of Luton.
<P>

<a name="30326w01.html_para0">We announced in March 1999 a new sift criteria to be used when assessing serious noise problems on existing trunk roads together with an annual ring-fenced budget to deal with locations identified.
<P>

<a name="30326w01.html_para1">The M1 at Luton qualifies as one of the sites under the criteria. The cost of the works is met from the ring-fenced budget which is managed by the Highways Agency. The first phase of the works at Luton will cost &#163;2.6 million. A later phase will extend the barriers on the southern and northern sides of the town. This phase is planned to be undertaken in 2004&#150;05 and will cost a further &#163;2 million.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30326w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Win Griffiths: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Wales if he will make a statement on the work of the Welsh Sub Group of the Coal Health Claims Monitoring Group chaired by the Parliamentary Under-Secretary.  [103376]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30326w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Touhig: </B> 
 On the most recent figures I have available, in Wales we have paid &#163;197 million under the respiratory disease scheme and &#163;83 million under the Vibration White Finger Scheme, with full and final payments having been made to 13,762 and 8,632 claimants respectively. In Bridgend over &#163;1.5 million has been paid out in respiratory disease payments and over &#163;760,000 has been paid to Vibration White Finger claimants.
<P>

<a name="30326w01.html_para2">Despite this significant and welcome progress, much remains to be done. The Government intends to keep up the pressure to get justice for our miners, their widows and their families, and I will continue to make every effort as part of this process. The Welsh Sub Group has seen the major stakeholders in the process working together in a highly constructive way, identifying real improvements to the system which have speeded up payments to miners in Wales and across the UK. It has also provided a model for similar groups across the UK.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30326w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Win Griffiths: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Wales if he will make a statement on the impact on Wales of the work of the Advisory Board of the Performance and Innovation Unit's Energy Review in the last three years.  [103368]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30326w01.html_spnew2"><B> Peter Hain: </B> 
 The Performance and Innovation Unit (PIU) Energy Review had a Sponsor Minister and Advisory Group. The Wales Office was represented on this group by my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales.
<P>

<a name="30326w01.html_para3">The PIU (now the Strategy Unit) published its energy review in February 2002. This was a key input into the development of the Government's Energy White Paper, which was published last month. The Wales Office was represented at both Ministerial and official level in the production of this key Government statement on the future of Britain's energy policy.
<P>

<a name="30326w01.html_para4">The Energy White Paper sets out a strategic vision for the development of energy policy across the UK as a whole. It clearly has important implications for Wales, as for other parts of the UK.
<P>

<a name="30326w01.html_para5">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry made an excellent statement to launch the White Paper on 24 February which was very clear on the implications for the UK as a whole.
<P>

<a name="30326w01.html_para6">That said, it is clearly crucial that key players in Wales engage in the delivery of the White Paper objectives. In particular, the White Paper welcomes the development by the National Assembly for Wales of a strategic approach to energy policy as it applies in Wales.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30326w01.html_spnew4"><B> Peter Hain: </B> 
 Since my appointment as Secretary of State for Wales in October 2002, I have visited Scotland once, in February 2003.
<P>

<a name="30326w01.html_para7">In line with exemptions 2 and 7 of the "Code of Practice on Access to Government Information", it is not the normal practice of Governments to release details of specific meetings or their content, as some of these discussions may have taken place on a confidential basis.

To ask the Secretary of State for Wales what plans Ministers in the Department have to <i>(a)</i> visit Scotland on official business, <i>(b)</i> announce public appointments and <i>(c)</i> make ministerial announcements in April.  [103663]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30326w01.html_spnew5"><B> Peter Hain: </B> 
 My Department's business during the campaign period preceding elections to the Scottish Parliament will be conducted in accordance with the Guidance on Conduct for Civil Servants in UK Departments in respect of elections to the Scottish Parliament and National Assembly for Wales, published by the Cabinet Office on 10 March.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30326w01.html_wqn6"><B> Paul Flynn: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Wales what appraisal he has made of plans to use tidal lagoons to generate electricity in <i>(a)</i> the Severn estuary and <i>(b)</i> off the north Wales coast; and if he will make a statement.  [103530]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30326w01.html_spnew6"><B> Peter Hain </B> 
: I have made no such appraisal, since such matters rest with my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry.
<P>

<a name="30326w01.html_para8">However, my hon. Friend will know that I am a keen enthusiast for renewable energy. The Severn estuary barrage was one of the issues that the Government examined during its consideration of the Energy White Paper. It is hugely expensive, but there are other opportunities for utilising tidal and wave power. The Welsh coast and the Severn estuary may represent such opportunities.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30326w01.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Win Griffiths: </B>

<P>
<P>
<a name="30326w01.html_spnew7"><B> Peter Hain: </B> 
 No formal complaints have been received.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30326w01.html_wqn8"><B> Llew Smith: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what plans he has to amend the Armed Forces Act 1955.  [104716]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30326w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 There is no Armed Forces Act 1955. The Army and Air Force Acts of that year and the Naval Discipline Act 1957 have a finite life, and Parliament considers their renewal every five years in the form of an Armed Forces Bill. This is also the main vehicle for amending the 1955 and 1957 Acts. The Armed Forces Act was last renewed in 2001.
<P>

<a name="30326w01.html_para9">All the procedures covered by the Service Acts are kept under review and it is envisaged that any proposals for further change that may be considered necessary would be included in the Armed Forces Bill due for introduction in the 2005&#150;06 session. We intend to introduce legislation to bring the three separate Acts together into one tri-Service Act, but whether it will be possible to include this in the 2005&#150;06 Bill will depend on the availability of parliamentary time.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30326w01.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. McNamara: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence at what phase in Army training a recruit is permitted to handle weapons containing live rounds without supervision; what <i>(a)</i> age and <i>(b)</i> other restrictions limit troops' access to lethal weapons; and in what circumstances an armourer may exercise discretion to refuse the issue of a weapon to a member of Her Majesty's forces.  [104898]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30326w01.html_spnew9"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 No recruits in initial training are allowed to handle weapons containing live rounds without supervision. As part of their training, all recruits have access to lethal weapons from the start of phase 1 training; the age limit is therefore effectively 16. However, all such recruits are fully supervised whilst handling such weapons. Within the Army, an Arms Storeman will refuse the issue of a weapon to a soldier if he or she is unaccompanied by a supervising NCO or if the weapon has not been ordered for training.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what plans he has to work with other European nations on the development of an unmanned aerial vehicle; and if he will make a statement.  [104231]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30326w01.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 United Kingdom unmanned aerial vehicles are being pursued through two programmes: Watchkeeper, which plans to deliver a tactical UAV in 2006; and the Future Offensive Air System (FOAS) programme within which we are assessing the feasibility of UAVs contributing to our future strike capability from about 2020 onwards. There are no plans to work with other European nations on the development of Watchkeeper, although we do share information regarding the acquisition, operation and support of UAV systems with a number of European countries. The FOAS programme plans to carry out some technology demonstration work within a six-nation collaborative European Technology Acquisition Programme comprising France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom.

<a name="30326w02.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The Halo Mk2 sound ranging system, procured to meet the Army's Advanced Sound Ranging Programme requirement, is deployed with British Forces in the Gulf. The Mk2 system is more capable than the Mkl in a number of ways, including: improved accuracy in locating potential targets; a faster response time and more robust hardware. The cost of this programme was around &#163;17 million which was within the original approval limit.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30326w02.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 United Kingdom forces, as part of the coalition, will, where they are able, deliver emergency humanitarian assistance to the people of Iraq until the post-conflict security situation stabilises sufficiently for civilian agencies to deploy. Such assistance would include provision of drinking water, food, shelter, and medical supplies. Preparations for this role have taken place with the assistance of experts from the Department for International Development.

 The next stage of the Watchkeeper programme, the Systems Integration and Assurance Phase, is estimated to be completed before the end of January 2004.

 There is no specific threat to reservoirs from terrorist.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30326w02.html_spnew11"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The stability of VX depends very much on its initial purity, the use of the appropriate stabilisers and the precise storage conditions utilised. Its shelf life as a chemical warfare agent can range from a few months to several tens of years. It should be noted that even partially degraded material may still pose a significant hazard.

<P>

<a name="30326w03.html_para0">Within the EU, we have taken a flexible and constructive approach to the current TRIPS negotiations and public health. Our aim has always been to find a solution that responds to the need for countries to have recourse when necessary to compulsory licensing, while not undermining the wider intellectual property framework that is essential for research into new medicines. Discussions came close to agreement late last year on the basis of a compromise text circulated before Christmas. We are working to secure agreement before the next WTO Ministerial meeting in Cancun in September.

 <i>[holding answer 24 March 2003]:</i> The Government is committed to ensuring all sectors are responsive to consumer needs, getting rid of unnecessary regulations that inhibit innovation. The Enterprise Act will strengthen the role of the competition authorities in tackling markets that do not work well for consumers and business. The OFT report 



<P>
<P><I>26 Mar 2003 : Column 223W</I><P>
provided a useful analysis of the market impact of the current control of entry regulations on consumers and competition and highlights the need for the present regime governing pharmacies to be updated. We have already taken steps to open up the pharmacy market by allowing for mail order and internet pharmacies. At the same time, the Government wants to see an increased role for community pharmacists in providing services to NHS patients and we are currently developing a new contractual framework to make that happen.
<P>

<a name="30326w03.html_para1">The Government needs to take into account wider policy objectives in responding to the OFT report. It argues for abolition of entry controls on the grounds that there would be consequent benefits for consumers in terms of reduced prices, improved quality of services and better access. We strongly support these objectives. We want to improve access and choice (including improving out-of-hours access for NHS patients) so that more NHS patients can use the skills of community pharmacists, who are trained clinicians, for advice, information and services. The OFT report also noted that in a more competitive environment problems could arise through the possible effect of deregulation on the ability of patients in some areas to access high quality pharmacy services, and that these problems could be addressed through targeted measures. It was not in the OFT's remit to examine how mechanisms such as the Essential Small Pharmacies Scheme could be developed to address a more competitive environment, and we therefore propose to examine these issues further before reaching a final decision on a balanced package which most effectively promotes competition, new entry and increased choice alongside our wider social and health objectives.
<P>

<a name="30326w03.html_para2">We therefore favour change to open up the market and improve quality and access without diminishing the crucial role that pharmacies play, especially in poorer and rural areas. The Government intends to come forward with proposals before the summer recess and will publish a progress report at the end of June. All changes will then be the subject of a full consultation.
<P>

<a name="30326w03.html_para3">The OFT report raises particular issues for the devolved administrations and they are making their own announcements today regarding their responses to the OFT recommendations.

<a name="30326w03.html_para4">The OFT's work on this area has taken forward our understanding of the impact on quality, innovation and consumer choice of the existing entry controls. Their regulatory challenge function is an important one. We look forward to receiving further reports on markets where regulation may be distorting competition.
<P>

<a name="30326w03.html_para5">As part of our work moving forward we will consider the impact of any changes on all sectors of the pharmacy market, including small businesses.

 No specific assessment has been undertaken in the UK on the environmental consequences of battery disposal.

<a name="30326w03.html_para10">A Government study (November 2000) 'Analysis of the Environmental Impact and Financial Costs of a Possible New European Directive on Batteries' concluded that as collection and recycling rates increase, heavy metals in batteries are progressively diverted from the municipal waste stream, thus preventing leaching of hazardous substances into the environment.

It will be for the main Committee to assess and decide upon the advice it receives from such sub-groups. CoRWM may also utilise other appropriate means of securing expert input, such as sponsored meetings and seminars.

CoRWM's objective is to recommend to Ministers the best option, or combination of options for managing the UK's solid radioactive waste that can provide a long-term solution, providing protection for people and the environment. The UK's waste inventory contains, or will contain, a wide range of high and low activity, short and long lived wastes. CoRWM's priority task is to recommend what should be done with the wastes for which no long-term management strategy currently exists&#151;that is, high and intermediate level waste now in storage or likely to arise over the next century or two, and some low level waste unsuitable for disposal at Drigg. However, for some of these wastes, the Nirex "Letter of Comfort" system has provided a framework which has enabled helpful progress to be made on conditioning and packaging. (Ministers have other sources of advice on other wastes for which a long term management strategy already exists but where there may be long or shorter term issues needing attention. CoRWM may wish to offer advice on these issues but this should not divert it from its priority task set out above.)
<P>

<a name="30326w04.html_para24">12. CoRWM will take a strategic approach to the review and assessment of options for the long term management of radioactive waste. It will start by gathering information and familiarising itself with the issues, including meetings and presentations as appropriate. The outline framework within which CoRWM is then expected to complete its work is:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(i) setting the framework for the review through identification, on the basis of sounding public and stakeholder views, of:
<P>
<BR>
 the inventory of materials to be covered (this will include not only the materials currently classified as waste liable to arise over the next century or so but also materials which may have to be managed as waste during that period, such as some plutonium and uranium as well as certain quantities of spent nuclear fuel);</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> the options for the long-term management of the various waste materials; and</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> the criteria against which each of the options being carried forward to the main assessment are to be assessed. (These criteria are likely to be wide-ranging, reflecting among other things, the potential risks involved, concerns been expressed by the public and stakeholders, and practicability of implementing each option.)</FONT></UL>




<P>
<P><I>26 Mar 2003 : Column 231W</I><P>

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> CoRWM should take the earliest possible opportunity to identify those options which have no realistic prospect of being implemented within the reasonably foreseeable future, so that the main effort during the assessment stage can be focused on those which are practicable.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(ii) implementation of the review. This will involve evaluation of each of the remaining options, for each of the wastes concerned, against the agreed set of criteria. The assessment will take account of existing information and any new research that CoRWM judges necessary. An initial assessment report will be produced by CoRWM and subjected to appropriate soundings of public and stakeholder group views. A final version will then be produced taking due account of the views expressed.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(iii) formulation of recommendations. The final assessment report will be used to formulate Committee recommendations to its sponsoring Ministers. We also anticipate that, during the course of its work, CoRWM will have acquired views relevant to subsequent stages of the policy programme. For example, the assessment of options will not consider potential radioactive waste sites; but it will raise sitting issues&#151;including whether local communities should have a veto or be encouraged to volunteer, and whether they should be offered incentives. CoRWM will need to consider these issues, and may want to make recommendations to Ministers on them.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>Formulation and agreement of work programme</i></FONT></UL>
<P>

<a name="30326w04.html_para25">13. CoRWM will prepare a detailed draft work programme, within this outline framework, that will enable it to deliver its recommendation to Ministers within the required timescales. The programme will include any proposed sub-groups or other activities or events that are likely to involve significant time and effort by the Committee. CoRWM will send this draft work programme to its sponsoring Ministers for discussion and agreement at an appropriate early stage of its work. Such discussion may lead to appropriate adjustment and refinement. In considering this programme, CoRWM and sponsoring departments and Ministers will be able to take account of the parallel work with Government in this area.
<P>

<a name="30326w04.html_para26">14. In familiarising itself with the relevant background and issues, CoRWM will make itself aware of the UK Radioactive Waste Inventory and the nature of current and expected future UK holdings of plutonium, uranium and spent nuclear fuel. It will take account of existing technical assessments and research into radioactive waste management, and reports arising out of the Defra and devolved administrations public consultation on radioactive waste. It will work closely with Nirex and other organisations with relevant experience and expertise. CoRWM is also recommended to meet and take presentations from appropriate key-player organisations and to visit a selection of key UK and, possibly, other European nuclear sites. It will also take a account of other relevant policy developments, including the UK energy review. In particular, it is recognised that CoRWM will need to engage with the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) and it's predecessor, the Liabilities Management Unit, given that the former's output will directly impinge on the long-term responsibilities of the NDA.
<P>

<a name="30326w04.html_para27">15. CoRWM is recommended to aim to complete its first phase (familiarisation work and proposals for the waste inventory, the waste management options, and the criteria to be used in their assessment) after about a year from the date of its appointment. It is thereafter 



<P>
<P><I>26 Mar 2003 : Column 232W</I><P>
recommended to aim for completion and reporting of the assessment work itself (the second phase) after about a further year. Provision of recommendations to sponsoring Ministers would follow as soon as possible after that.
<P>

<a name="30326w04.html_para28">16. CoRWM should indicate the timing proposed for its work in the draft work programme sent for discussion with sponsoring Ministers. The intent is that CoRWM's recommendations should be delivered around the end of 2005. If the Chair anticipates that CoRWM will be late in completing any current phase or overall delivery of its work programme, he or she should inform the sponsoring Ministers as soon as possible, together with an indication of whether and how the committee can catch up during any subsequent phases of its programme. CoRWM will agree with Ministers how to proceed so as to be able to carry its programme forward.
<P>

<a name="30326w04.html_para29"><i>Public engagement</i>
<P>

<a name="30326w04.html_para30">17. CoRWM must inspire public confidence in the way in which it works, in order to secure such confidence in its eventual recommendations. Hence, its work should be characterised by:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a transparency policy;
<P>
<BR>
an active programme of public and relevant stake holder group debate, using innovative appropriate techniques to ensure public involvement and support;
<P>

<P>

<a name="30326w04.html_para32">18. The Chair will be responsible for supervising the work of CoRWM and ensuring that its objectives are achieved. He or she will be the main point of contact with the public and the media, in presenting progress and answering questions. The Chair will meet Ministers on appointment, and then six-monthly to report progress. Notes of these meetings will be published. The Chair will provide an annual written report to Ministers, by 1 December, which he/she may be required to present to Parliament or Assembly representatives as appropriate. The report will set out, among other things, CoRWM's work programme, progress made, and costs incurred. Ministers will also appoint a Deputy Chair who can assist the Chair as the latter sees fit.

<a name="30326w04.html_para39">22. Sponsoring Ministers will provide CoRWM with resources&#151;both staff and financial&#151;to enable it to carry out its agreed programme of work. These will include a secretariat which will help CoRWM carry out its programme including, at the outset, providing reading material and arranging for further briefings and visits. The Chair and Members will have a collective responsibility for delivering the work programme within the agreed budget, although the Chair may request sponsoring Ministers for adjustment to this budget should this be considered necessary.

<a name="30326w04.html_para43">Under its terms of reference, CoRWM will be required to engage the public and stakeholder groups widely in the formulation of its recommendations. The Committee will itself decide how best to do this. However, to provide some initial ideas for CoRWM to consider, a workshop involving about 50 persons with relevant expertise of public and stakeholder engagement processes was held in Manchester on 10&#150;11 March 2003. University College London were appointed on a single tender basis to run the workshop. Their report of the workshop and its outcome will be published.

 Government are taking a number of steps aimed at reducing waste arisings and increasing re-use.
<P>

<a name="30326w05.html_para0">In agriculture, we have set up the Agricultural Waste Stakeholders' Forum to inform the development of the Regulations for applying the Waste Framework Directive to agricultural waste. The Forum's terms of reference include identifying and encouraging opportunities to reduce the production of agricultural waste and are available at http://www.defra.qov.uk/environment/waste/aqforum/index.htm
<P>

<a name="30326w05.html_para1">Re-use of construction and demolition waste, and some types of mineral waste that can be substituted for newly won aggregates, will be encouraged through exemption from the Aggregates Levy which was introduced on 1 April 2002 at a rate of &#163;1.60 per tonne for virgin aggregates. The Levy also encourages economy of use and less waste of aggregates at construction sites. Some funding from the Levy has also been set aside to fund projects which aim to minimise the demand for primary aggregates.
<P>

<a name="30326w05.html_para2">On commercial waste, Defra jointly with DTI, funds the Envirowise programme which provides free independent help and advice on environmental issues, resource efficiency and sustainable business solutions to UK companies. Waste minimisation and effective resource management are central to its aims. It is based on the principle that good environmental sense makes good business sense, and that companies can save money through resource efficiencies. Launched in 1994, Envirowise delivers its messages principally via a freephone national Helpline; On-site Resource Efficiency visits to small and medium sized enterprises by a Helpline advisor; training events; a website; and the dissemination of case studies and good practice guides. The Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) also includes removing the barriers to waste minimisation and re-use as part of its mission.
<P>

<a name="30326w05.html_para3">The Strategy Unit's report 'Waste Not, Want Not' made a number of recommendations on waste minimisation and re-use. The government is considering its response to these recommendations, which it aims to publish around the time of the Budget.

<a name="30326w05.html_para4">The reinstatement of Oil for Food is crucial since 16 million Iraqis rely on it. The traditional role of NGOs in post-conflict situations is to help deliver emergency services at community level using supplies provided by the UN system.

To achieve this, Afghanistan will require very effective international support. Donors and the Administration agreed at the Development Forum that this meant that donors must focus their aid on the priorities set out by the Administration in their budget. This assistance should be channelled through a blend of the most effective instruments, reflecting the limited absorptive capacity of each of them: direct funding of the Government through multi-donor trust funds, funding of UN programmes, and direct funding of NGOs and private sector contractors.

It is anticipated that the figures for Bangladesh will return to their earlier level of over &#163;70 million in 2002&#150;03, increasing to around &#163;80 million for the next three years.

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what steps she is taking to increase the effectiveness of the targeting at poverty reduction of EU development assistance.  [104573]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30326w06.html_spnew9"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 In 2003&#150;04 I expect my Department to spend over &#163;1 billion on EC development assistance, which, with some exceptions, under performs both in effectiveness and targeting on poverty reduction. The Commission spent only 43 per cent. of its official development assistance in 2001 in low-income countries and although an improvement from 38 per cent. in the previous year. The Government's aim is to ensure the Commission seeks to spend 70 per cent. of the development budget in low-income countries by 2006.
<P>

<a name="30326w06.html_para6">We have been working since 1997 to improve the effectiveness and poverty focus of EC development assistance. We welcome the positive steps that were taken by the Commission to reform the management of external assistance and are pressing the EC to continue and deepen the reforms. Prioritisation needs radical overhaul. Allocation decisions too often reflect the political consensus by the Council of Ministers and European Parliament to maintain spending at historical levels in middle-income regions, which reflect domestic or foreign policy considerations. We want to see the pledge, explicit in the EC's Development Policy Statement of November 2000, to focus on poverty reduction reflected in annual decisions over resource transfers.
<P>

<a name="30326w06.html_para7">We will continue to push for basing allocations on developmental needs of the poorest countries through all the channels available to us including the annual budget negotiations, the revision of the Asia and Latin America Regulation, the mid-term review of MEDA and the country strategy paper process which determines individual allocations. We have had some initial success eg in 2002 securing additional Euro100 million from the EC's External Actions Budget for Asia and a commitment of Euro1 billion for the rehabilitation of Afghanistan.
<P>

<a name="30326w06.html_para8">In the longer term the discussions of the Convention debate on the Future of Europe and forthcoming debates on the EU budget ceilings for the period 2007&#150;13 offer opportunities to reinforce the poverty efforts of the EC's external actions. I believe the EC should focus efforts on where they will be effective and can add value in their impact on economic growth and poverty reduction. Otherwise the EC should cut back its activities.

 The following table shows the funded and un-funded public sector pension schemes managed by the Department of International Development. The Overseas Service Pensions Scheme 1985 is the only funded pension scheme. The last actuarial valuation of the 1985 Scheme was carried out as at 30 September 2001. The market value of the Scheme's assets at that time was &#163;13.17 million. The valuation showed a surplus of &#163;1.8 million. The un-funded schemes are exempt from the formal valuations required by the Pensions Act 1995 and subsequent regulations.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30326w07.html_spnew1"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 As the 2002 pre Budget report made clear, from April 2003, around two thirds of the funding currently going through the landfill tax credit scheme will be allocated to additional public spending on sustainable waste management; the devolved administrations will have responsibility for spending within their countries. The PBR also set out that the remaining third will continue to be made available through a UK-wide reformed tax credit scheme, focusing on local community environmental projects. Our plans for reform of this successor tax credit scheme will be set out on a Budget timetable. My written statement of 3 February set out transition funding arrangements for waste management and recycling projects in England. The Devolved administrations are, as my statement made clear, responsible for their own transition arrangements.

 The Inland Revenue estimate that around 50 million end of year contribution returns are received each year. Around 4 per cent. of these contain incomplete or incorrect identifying details and cannot be allocated to an individual national insurance account without further information. Most of these non-matching items have no or little impact on people's benefit entitlements. The Inland Revenue works with employers to trace and match contributions, concentrating on cases where they are likely to have a significant impact on entitlement. Information about the value of these and number of contributions received

 The question of the accountability of military and police actions in Chechnya is one which is regularly raised with the Russian government.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister pursuant to his answer of 14 March 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 438W, on local government finance, which local authorities in Devon have suffered a cut in real terms in central Government funding as a result of increased national insurance contributions from 1 April and the proposals and initiatives within the new burdens principle; and whether the increase in national insurance is included in the new burdens principle.  [105036]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30326w13.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Raynsford </B> 
: A new burden is defined as any policy or initiative which increase the cost of providing local authority services. Under the new burdens arrangement Government Departments are responsible for fully funding the costs of their policies which impact on local authorities. The new burdens requirement does not apply to policies which apply the same rules to councils and to private sector bodies (for example a change in the rate of employers' national insurance contributions) except where those policies apply disproportionately to local government. The Government have however guaranteed an increase in grant of at least above the rate of inflation for all local authorities. The increases announced in SR2002 took into account all pressures, including the increase in national insurance contributions, along with the ability of local authorities to make savings. As a result total Government grant to local authorities has increased by &#163;3.8 billion in 2003&#150;04. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister estimates the change in national insurance contributions will increase local authorities' pay costs on average by 0.7 per cent. or some &#163;250 million.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30326w13.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Hendry: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister (1) what guidance he has given to local authorities about requiring new houses to be equipped with water sprinklers;  [103676]
<P>
<UL>(2) what tests have been carried out, monitored by his Department, in the effectiveness of water sprinklers in reducing the spread of fires;  [103675]
<P>
(3) how many deaths have occurred as a result of house fires in each of the past five years in houses <i>(a)</i> fitted and <i>(b)</i> not fitted with water sprinklers.  [103672]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30326w13.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Leslie: </B> 
 Guidance for local authorities and others on measures that will meet the fire safety requirements of the Building Regulations is given in Approved Document B (Fire safety). This currently does not suggest that new dwellings should be provided with residential sprinklers. However, the Building Regulations are kept under review and in April 2001 research was commissioned into the effectiveness of sprinklers in residential properties. This work is addressing a number of areas, including the undertaking of a series of experimental tests, which should assist with the identification of the potential effectiveness of such sprinkler systems. To date the tests that have been undertaken include 25 benchmark fire tests to evaluate the draft British Standard specification for residential sprinklers, BS DD 252, and eight fires staged in a converted three-bedroomed detached house as part of an experimental programme using realistic fires. Preparation for the final stage of this experimental programme is currently under way. The final results and conclusions from this work should be available around the end of the year.

 At the end of February 2003, the overall National Lottery Distribution Fund (NLDF) balance stood at &#163;3.24 billion, the lowest end of month total since October 1997. In addition, at the end of December 2002, the distributors collectively had made commitments totalling &#163;3.74 billion, significantly in excess of the amount held in the fund. This level of over commitment shows that the money resident in the NLDF does not constitute a 'reserve'.

The study also provided details of the average time spent in PE lessons, by years 2 (aged 7)&#150;11 (aged 16), per week.

 The &#163;100 million lottery funded people's network programme has enabled &#163;4,085 libraries in the UK to be connected to the internet, including all the libraries in Essex. This represents 99 per cent. of libraries in England, 95 per cent. in Scotland, and 100 per cent. in Wales and Northern Ireland. Only 39 English and 30 Scottish libraries, have still to be connected and we expect all but two of these to be online by summer 2003. This is a very significant achievement.

 It is not possible to assess separately the impact on the UK tourism industry of the outbreak of foot and mouth disease and the attacks on the US of 11 September 2001. However, the number of inbound visits to the UK fell by 9 per cent. between 2000 and 2001. Expenditure by overseas visitors to the UK fell by 12 per cent. over the same period.

In the outcome relating to LEA monitoring of attendance, the acronym "LEA" should read "LGA" (Local Government Association). The related action, to be found at page 23 of the report, explains that work on the joint DfES/LGA awareness campaign will begin from April 2003.

 Basic Aid Training is included in the curriculum as part of the framework for Personal Social and Health Education. No assessment has been made by the Department for Education and Skills of the benefits of first aid teaching in schools. The aim is to ensure that children are safe within and outside their school environment. At Key Stage 2 (ages 7&#150;11) children are taught about school rules, health and safety, basic emergency aid procedures and where to get help. Learning continues through Key Stage 3 and 4. At Key Stage 4 (ages 5&#150;16) young people learn to recognise and follow health and safety requirements and develop skills to cope with emergency situations that require basic aid procedures, including resuscitation techniques.

<sup>(7)</sup> New student support arrangements in higher education came into effect in September 1998. For the first year of the new scheme, eligible new entrants received support for living costs through both grants and loans. Grants, which were assessed against family income, on average formed about a quarter of the support available. All students were entitled to a non income-assessed loan, which comprised the remaining three quarters of support available.<P>

<P>

<sup>(8)</sup> New entrants to higher education in 1999&#150;2000, together with those who started in 1998&#150;99, received support for living costs solely through loans which are partly income-assessed. Grants for living costs are no longer available except for some limited allowances, e.g. for students with dependants; single parent students; and disabled students. Grants for students with dependants and single parent students are income-assessed but the Disabled Students' Allowance is not. From 1999&#150;2000 student loans have been made available to those aged 50&#150;54 who plan to return to work after studying. These loans are repayable on an income contingent basis.<P>

<P>

<sup>(9)</sup> Refers to loans advanced in the target year only, which include those students in their first, second, third and any subsequent year of their course. Includes hardship loans but excludes fixed rate loans of &#163;500 for part-time students introduced in September 2000.<P>

<P>

<sup>(10)</sup> Loans available to students who, apart from a few exceptions, entered higher education before academic year 1998&#150;99 and which are repayable on a mortgage style basis.<P>

<P>
<a name="30326w17.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Sheerman: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what plans he has to modify the age cap on modern apprenticeships.  [104094]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30326w17.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 Modern Apprentices aged between 16 and 24 are eligible for LSC funding support. The Government is considering the case for removing the age cap on MA funding and opening Advanced Modern Apprenticeships to suitably qualified or experienced adults, in line with Modern Apprenticeship Advisory Committee recommendations. We currently support the Rail Skills Award pilot for adult apprentices in the rail industry, and the LSC has local flexibility to fund some apprenticeship training for adults.
<P>

<a name="30326w17.html_para0">We will decide on the way ahead in the light of early operating experience in Wales and Scotland, where the age cap has already been lifted selectively, together with evaluation of current activity in England, and the availability of resources.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30326w17.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Webb: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what safeguards are in place to ensure that people whose National Insurance contributions are interrupted receive information about home responsibility protection; and what estimate he has made of the level of take-up of home responsibility protection among eligible carers and parents.  [102605]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30326w17.html_spnew1"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 People claiming Child Benefit are given full information about Home Responsibilities Protection (HRP) which includes advice as to whom in a couple should be the payee where HRP would be beneficial. However, the award of HRP for Child Benefit payees caring for a child under 16 is automatic and therefore the take-up for those entitled to HRP via this route will be 100 per cent. Most people caring for a severely disabled person will receive Invalid Care Allowance (ICA). People getting ICA will be credited with National Insurance contributions so they will not need HRP. Where ICA is not appropriate, or the carer decides not to claim it, various leaflets, including the PM9, specifically designed for carers, does give information about claiming HRP. Where the carer is receiving Income Support for a full tax year and is not required to register for work because of their caring activities, HRP will be available automatically. However, it is not possible to identify and provide specific information to people who give up work to care for a disabled person and who do not make any claims to benefit or inquiries about protection of their state pension, but the Department publicises the availability of HRP. From April, HRP will also be available to registered foster carers who do not currently get HRP by virtue of caring for a child of their own under 16.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. All figures are estimates and are taken from the Households Below Average Income (HBAI) series. From 1979 to 1993&#150;94 data are derived from the Family Expenditure Survey: single years for 1979, 1981 and 1987, two calendar years combined for 1988&#150;89, 1990&#150;91,1991&#150;92 and 1992&#150;93 and two financial years combined for 1993&#150;94; results are for the United Kingdom. From 1994&#150;05 to 2000&#150;01, data are derived from the Family Resources Survey and represents single financial years. The Family Resources Survey does not include Northern Ireland, and the latest year for which data is available is 2000&#150;01.<P>

2. Numbers are in millions. Estimates of numbers from the Family Expenditure Survey are not considered sufficiently reliable to be presented here.<P>

3. The estimates are sample counts, which have been adjusted for non-response using multipurpose grossing factors that, in the case of the Family Resources Survey, control for tenure, Council Tax band and a number of other variables. Estimates are subject to both sampling error and to variability in non-response. The income measure used is weekly net (disposable) equivalised household income (that is to say income that is adjusted to reflect the composition of the household).<P>

4. The estimates are presented on both a Before Housing Costs (BHC) and an After Housing Costs (AHC) basis in line with HBAI conventions. Figures are provided including the self-employed.<P>

 There is no question of blind, partially sighted or disabled people not being able to access their money after the move to Direct Payment. We are committed to ensuring that all people have reasonable access to their benefits and pensions and there will be a number of options available.
<P>

<a name="30326w17.html_para2">My Officials regularly meet with a number of representatives from Specific Interest Groups, including the RNIB, RNID and Disability Alliance to discuss all issues surrounding Direct Payment. We are aware of the concerns that have been raised with the Post Office about the design and accessibility of the post offices' PIN pads.

<a name="30326w17.html_para3">The Post Office has agreed that they need to make the PIN pad more accessible and user friendly. They will also be looking at other ways of accessing the Post Office card account that does not involve using a PIN pad. The Post Office are taking action to address the concerns raised and have invited RNIB and other disability groups to work with them. It is clear these issues have been recognised by Post Office Ltd. and are being taken seriously.

The figure is calculated by the Financial Services Authority and published monthly in the Office for National Statistics' Financial Statistics table 7.1L. Changes in the rate are triggered by a 0.25 per cent. move in the published figure.
<P>

<a name="30326w18.html_para5">We have no plans to change the current arrangements, which give effect to changes as quickly as is practicable. Once the information is received from the Office for National Statistics of an alteration in the interest rates, the Department immediately sets in motion the procedures to amend the relevant computer systems and legislation. Regulations are laid at least 21 days in advance of their coming into force to allow for proper parliamentary procedures to be followed. The same timetable applies when the standard interest rate increases as when it decreases.

We do not press the parent with care to provide information about the alleged other parent if there are reasonable grounds to believe that to do so may harm or distress the parent with care or any child living with him or her&#151;this is known as "good cause".</FONT></UL>

 Understanding how employment constraints facing lone parents in London compare to other areas is complex. We have commissioned research into this issue <sup>1</sup>  and this research found that lone parents in London reported the same barriers to work as lone parents elsewhere in the country.
<P>

<a name="30326w18.html_para8">The three main barriers to moving into work reported by lone parents are availability and cost of child care, concerns about financial uncertainty on moving into work and the cost of housing and council tax. We have introduced a number of measures to help lone parents to overcome these barriers, including the National Childcare Strategy and Tax Credits, which are helping to make work possible and make work pay.
<P>

<a name="30326w18.html_para9">We are continuing to examine the problems lone parents face when moving from benefit dependency into work and finding ways of helping them to overcome them. The New Deal for Lone Parents (NDLP) provides support tailored to the individual circumstances of lone parents, which takes into account any particular problems they face because of the area that they live in. NDLP has already helped over 160,000 lone parents move into work, including over 16,000 in London.

 The Pension Service will be writing to all pensioner households to explain pension credit and invite applications. By 31 March, letters will have been sent to all MIG households letting them know we will convert their payment to pension credit automatically. Between April and September 2003, invites will be issued to around 20 per cent. of pensioner households with the remaining households targeted between October 2003 and June 2004. This systematic approach will be supported by regional and national advertising.

 In order to become entitled to the basic State Pension, a person has to satisfy two conditions. The basic State Pension is available to both the employed and self-employed. In addition, anyone may make voluntary contributions, subject to a time limit, if this is necessary to build up entitlement.
<P>

<a name="30326w19.html_para11">The first basic State Pension entitlement condition is that a person has either: one qualifying year since 6 April 1975 which is derived from the payment of Class 1, 2 or 3 National Insurance contributions or from Class 1 contributions treated as paid; or paid 50 flat rate contributions at any time before 6 April 1975.
<P>

<a name="30326w19.html_para12">The second basic State Pension entitlement condition relates to the number of qualifying years a person has. Currently to get a full basic State Pension a man needs 44, and a woman 39, qualifying years. The number of qualifying years can be reduced if a person is entitled to Home Responsibilities Protection. The basic State Pension cannot be paid if a person has less than 25 per cent. of the qualifying years needed for a full State Pension.
<P>

<a name="30326w19.html_para13">A qualifying year for the basic State Pension is a tax year in which a person receives, or is treated as receiving, qualifying earnings of at least 52 times the National Insurance Lower Earnings Limit for that year.

<P>

<a name="30326w19.html_para16">The entitlement condition to the State Second Pension depends on the level of earnings a person has, or is treated as having, between the Lower Earnings Limit and the Upper Earnings Limit in any tax year from 6 April 2002.

<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions if he will list the <i>(a)</i> law enforcement and <i>(b)</i> other agencies involved in the investigation of benefit fraud; and what role his Department plays in co-ordinating their work.  [94008]<P>

<P>
<a name="30326w20.html_spnew1"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 The primary responsibility for the investigation of benefit fraud lies with Departmental investigators. Where appropriate, for example where the fraudster is committing other crimes that cross organisational boundaries, other law enforcement and public sector agencies provide assistance or work in partnership with our investigations.
<P>

<a name="30326w20.html_para1">The law enforcement agencies with whom we work in partnership to tackle benefit fraud include the police and Her Majesty's Customs and Excise. The Department and the Association of Chief Police Officers have recently signed an agreement setting out the principles for legitimate, mutual operational support, to enhance co-operation in the investigation of benefit crime.
<P>

<a name="30326w20.html_para2">Other agencies who provide assistance or work in partnership with our investigations include local authorities, the Northern Ireland Social Security Agency, the National Asylum Support Service, the Inland Revenue, Trading Standards, the Passport Agency, the Health and Safety Executive, the Immigration and Nationality Division, and the Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.
<P>

<a name="30326w20.html_para3">Co-ordination of all joint working is the responsibility of the Chief Investigation Officer, working as necessary with Regional Directors, to develop a unified approach with both local government and other Government Departments.

 Poverty and social exclusion are complex and multi-dimensional issues, affecting many aspects of peoples' lives&#151;including their living standards, health, housing, the quality of their environment and not just low income. The fourth annual 'Opportunity for all' report (Cm 5598) sets out the Government's strategy for tackling poverty and social exclusion and presents information on the indicators used to measure progress against this strategy. We do not publish forecasts of these indicators.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions pursuant to his answer of 13 February 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 969W, on top-up fees, whether the projected repayment of student loans will be made on a calculation of net gross income.  [101287]<P>

<a name="30326w20.html_spnew4"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="30326w20.html_para8">Loans for fees would be repaid on the same basis as student loans for maintenance. Student loan borrowers are currently liable to repay their loans at a rate of 9 per cent. on all additional income over &#163;10,000 a year. So for a graduate earning &#163;15,000 they will repay at a rate of 9 per cent. on &#163;5,000. The income taken into account in calculating student loan repayment is gross income (before deductions for tax, national insurance, or other payments deducted source, for example court orders).
<P>

<a name="30326w20.html_para9">We propose to increase the repayment threshold from &#163;10,000 to &#163;15,000 in April 2005.

<a name="30326w21.html_spnew0"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 Income-related benefits are intended to help people whose resources are insufficient to meet their day-to-day living expenses. Any income that is available to meet those expenses is normally taken fully into account. However, there is a special disregard in income-related benefits in respect of War Widow's Pension which was increased from &#163;5 to &#163;10 in April 1990. We believe that the current disregard strikes the right balance between acknowledging the special reasons for these pensions and prudent use of public funds.
<P>

<a name="30326w21.html_para0">In addition to the &#163;10 disregard referred to in the reply, local authorities have the discretion to disregard the full amount of War Widow's Pension in their calculation of entitlement to Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit.
