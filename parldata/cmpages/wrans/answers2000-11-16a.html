 The United Kingdom is strongly supporting the World Health Organisation (WHO) led Roll Back Malaria (RBM) initiative to achieve the goal of reducing the malaria burden by half by 2010. The RBM initiative provides the vehicle for concerted action by partners, especially in Africa, to deliver more widely the benefits of currently available methods of malaria control to the poorest. Overall UK developmental programme spending on malaria control activities increased to over &#163;19 million in 1999-2000 and is set to increase further. We have contributed &#163;12 million to WHO RBM this year alone. The UK is also supporting public-private partnerships to develop the new generation of affordable drugs required for malaria control in developing countries, both by direct funding to WHO for the Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV) initiative, the Lapdap product development programme and the Malarone donation.

The Department's office in Pristina liaises directly with the agency and with other donors, including EU member states, on reconstruction issues. The agency has made good progress on developing its 360 million euros programme of reconstruction activities in 2000 since its establishment in March. The United Kingdom's contribution to this programme is about &#163;39 million. In addition, we are providing &#163;5 million in bilateral technical assistance in this financial year.

A revised local authority finance regime was introduced from 1990-91, and thus prior years' figures are not directly comparable. Some of the resources allocated through the Single Regeneration Budget Challenge Fund and City Challenge are applied to housing, but this element is not distinguished in the allocations and is therefore not included. Allocations under the Capital Receipts Initiative over the period 1997-98 to 1999-2000 are identified separately in the table.

<a name="01116w03.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Simon Thomas: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions how much he has spent on the development of low carbon technology in each year since 1995.  [137214]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01116w03.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The Department has spent under its Energy Efficiency Best Practice programme in each year since 1995 the following amounts directly supporting Research and Development (R&D) into low-carbon technologies. On average an additional 30 per cent. has been spent each year on R&D related promotion. The amounts vary from year-to-year according to opportunities and programme priorities. For example, the number of quality R&D proposals put forward changes, the needs of energy users move between R&D and requirements for other types of support. In the last few years needs have focused on more impartial advice.

 My Department's expenditure on payments of bus fuel duty rebate to bus operators in England was &#163;222 million in 1998-99 and &#163;277 million in 1999-2000. Payments this year are expected to total about &#163;300 million.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what assessment he has made of the impact of EU directives on wildlife on SSSIs in England.  [138032]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01116w03.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 No assessment has been made of the general impact of EU directives on wildlife. However, two EU directives specifically address the protection of wildlife: Council Directive 92/43/EC on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora ("the Habitats Directive") and Council Directive 79/409/EC on the conservation of wild birds ("the Birds Directive"). These generally serve to reinforce the protection of wildlife in England. Under the directives, we have classified 83 special protection areas for birds and have submitted 148 sites to date for possible designation as special areas of conservation for inclusion in a network of sites of European importance. These sites are all already or will be notified as SSSIs, and benefit from special protection under the provisions of the directives.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what research has been conducted <i>(a)</i> into the quantity of aircraft fuel that is used while aircraft are (i) stacked and (ii) delayed due to air traffic control processes and <i>(b)</i> into the impact on the use of aircraft fuel of introducing a single European air traffic control system; and if he will make a statement. [138262]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01116w03.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 Air traffic control delays are, of course, imposed for safety reasons when there is a lack of en-route air traffic control or airport capacity. Stacking and en-route delays do exacerbate fuel burn, but the Government are unaware of any research undertaken to specifically calculate additional fuel burn due to these delays.
<P>

<a name="01116w03.html_para4">Much work has, however, been done across Europe to accommodate high rates of traffic growth safely while minimising air traffic delays. These efforts have resulted in delays in summer 2000 being comparable to summer 1998, but it is recognised that this record needs to be improved.
<P>

<a name="01116w03.html_para5">The reduction of air transport delays is one of the principal objectives of the European Commission's single European sky initiative. The recommendations arising from this initiative are to be presented to the December Transport Council. These are likely to include the need to improve civil/military co-operation and to strengthen the regulatory regime to compel European States to implement commonly agreed capacity enhancements in order to optimise airspace use, and hence reduce delays and fuel burn.

<a name="01116w03.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 At the time of the Roads Review in July 1998, we decided to take forward consideration of the A63 Melton Grade Separated Junction in Yorkshire. I can now confirm that following further work, including a full appraisal, and consultation with the regional planning body, the scheme has been added to the targeted programme of improvements. By removing three existing junctions the scheme will improve safety and reduce delays. It will also facilitate access to enable regeneration of a large area of brownfield land to the south of the A63 on the banks of the Humber. Draft orders for the scheme were published on 17 October.
<P>

<a name="01116w03.html_para19">Further additions to the programme will in general depend on the outcome of studies commissioned as a result of the Roads Review and priorities identified in the course of development of Regional Transport Strategies within the context of Regional Planning Guidance.
<P>

<a name="01116w03.html_para20">However, if the objectives of investment in trunk roads under the 10-Year Plan are to be delivered it is important that we make some immediate progress. Therefore, we have initiated consultations with regional planning bodies to consider possible targeted improvements to tackle problems on those parts of the core trunk road network not being considered within a study. As part of this exercise we will also consider whether decisions can be taken on taking forward some targeted improvements within the areas covered by studies without prejudicing the strategic context of the study in question or the emerging Regional Transport Strategy. Specific proposals for improvements will be evaluated using the New Approach to Appraisal to ensure they are consistent with our transport criteria of safety, economy, environmental impact accessibility and integration. We will make an announcement about the outcome of this exercise in the spring.
<P>

<a name="01116w03.html_para21">I can also confirm that work on the programme of 100 early action schemes to tackle localised safety and congestion problems on the trunk road announced at the time of the 10-Year Plan has begun. Copies of a leaflet showing the locations of these schemes have been placed in the Library.

<a name="01116w04.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The standard spending assessment for children's personal social services does not include a specific element relating to the placement of children in residential care. The SSA reflects differences between authorities in the potential need for all children's social services, based upon the socio-economic and health characteristics of each authority. It also reflects unavoidable variations in the costs of supplying these services.

<a name="01116w04.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Edward Davey: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health (1) how many school nurses were employed in each health authority in England and Wales in <i>(a)</i> 1979, <i>(b)</i> 1987, <i>(c)</i> 1997, <i>(d)</i> 1998 and <i>(e)</i> 1999; and if he will make a statement;  [137869]
<P>
<UL>(2) what proposals he has for adopting a benchmark for the provision of school nurses within a health authority in terms of the number of pupils per school nurse;  [137867]
<P>
(3) if he has received a copy of the report 'School Nursing within the Public Health Agenda' jointly published by the Community Practitioners' and Health Visitors' Association, the Queen's Nursing Institute and the Royal College of Nursing; and if he will make a statement;  [137866]

(4) what proposals he has to increase the total number of school nurses across England and Wales; and if he will make a statement.  [137868]
<P></UL>

<a name="01116w04.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 Data on the numbers of school nurses employed by health authority in 1987 are shown in the table. This information is not available for the other years. Information on numbers of school nurses after 1995 is not available due to a change in occupation codes used.
<P>

<a name="01116w04.html_para1">The school years offer an invaluable opportunity for the promotion of healthy living which sets the pattern for lifestyle and health status in adulthood. School nurses have an important role to play in meeting the needs of school-aged children and young people. The documents "Saving Lives", "Supporting Families" and "Making a Difference" identify and support a comprehensive programme of action for developing the public health role of school nursing. We look forward to receiving a copy of the report "School Nursing within the Public Health Agenda".
<P>

<a name="01116w04.html_para2">It is for health authorities and GP purchasers, with advice from professional colleagues, to determine benchmarks for the numbers, nature and levels of nursing staff and the training required to deliver cost effective school health services. The National Health Service Plan sets out increases in the numbers of nurses undertaking nursing training. Between now and 2004 there will be 5,500 extra nurses and midwives being trained each year than today and around 45,000 nurses and midwives will have come out of training. This means an increased supply of qualified nurses from which school nurses can be recruited and trained.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health, pursuant to his answer of 30 October 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 242W, on hospital staff assaults, how 



<P>
<P><I>16 Nov 2000 : Column: 737W</I><P>
many of the violent incidents against NHS trust staff in 1998-99 led to <i>(a)</i> prosecution and <i>(b)</i> conviction. [137968]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01116w05.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The information requested is not held centrally. The cross-Government National Health Service zero tolerance zone campaign, to stamp out violence against staff working in the National Health Service, has been strongly supported by my right hon. Friends the Home Secretary, the Lord Chancellor and the Attorney-General. The campaign makes clearer that employers need to work with the police, magistrates and the Crown Prosecution Service in order to apply a zero tolerance on violence against staff.
<P>

<a name="01116w05.html_para0">At the launch of the campaign last year, the Lord Chancellor said it was entirely legitimate for magistrates to respond decisively to a particular form of criminal behaviour, such as assaults on National Health Service staff, and to impose sentences which have deterrent components. New national sentencing guidelines issued to the Magistrates Courts in September underline our commitment to tackle violence against National Health Service staff. The guidelines now include as aggravating factors, to be taken into account when sentencing, whether the offence occurred in hospital or medical premises and whether the victim was serving the public.

<P>
<a name="01116w05.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 At the present time there are no formal proposals to merge the Harrogate Health Care National Health Service Trust and the York Health Services NHS Trust. Discussions between the North Yorkshire Health Authority and the trusts are ongoing concerning the future configuration of acute services. Should any proposals to change management structures come out of these discussions, they will be the subject of formal consultation.

 The National Service Framework for Older People, which is to be introduced from April 2001, will help to ensure that the health and social care needs of older people from all backgrounds are properly addressed.

 <i>[holding answer 14 November 2000]:</i> At 30 June this year (latest available figures) there were 3,713 patients who had been waiting 13 weeks or over for an appointment in West Surrey Health Authority following referral by a general practitioner.

<a name="01116w05.html_para3"><i>Letter from David Gould to Mr. William Ross, dated 16 November 2000:</i>
<P>

<a name="01116w05.html_para4">

<BR>
I am replying to your question to the Secretary of State for Defence asking if he will list the shipyards in the United Kingdom which are capable of building ships of the size of the future generation of aircraft carriers. This matter falls within my area of responsibility as Chief of Defence Procurement and Chief Executive of the Defence Procurement Agency.
<BR>
The competing Prime Contractors for the future aircraft carrier--BAE Systems and Thomson Naval Systems--have identified a number of UK shipyards with the potential capacity to participate in the build of the vessels. These include Harland and Wolff in Belfast, Swan Hunter on Tyneside, Cammell Laird at Birkenhead and the BAE Systems' yards at Govan and Barrow. Much will depend on the carrier design that is taken forward and the method of construction; consequently, other UK yard options have not been ruled out. Some of the yards identified by the Prime Contractors face potential build limitations or have access restrictions that could prevent whole-ship construction.
<BR>
We do not plan to award a contract for the build of CVF until 2004 and no decisions are planned at this stage on yard selection. Ongoing assessment work will include a thorough review of all UK facilities and will address yard suitability, construction/access limitations and the overall cost-effectiveness of potential build strategies.
<BR>
I hope this explains the position.

<P>
<P>
<a name="01116w06.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Quentin Davies: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what industrial action has been taken by Royal Fleet Auxiliary crews in the past six months; which ships were involved; and if he will make a statement.  [138431]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01116w06.html_spnew4"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 Industrial action involving Rail, Maritime and Transport Union (RMT) members of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary commenced in February this year following their rejection of the 1999 pay offer. The action was initially restricted to two days every fortnight; it then became weekly and, from 28 June, continuous. The RMT suspended the industrial action from mid August until the beginning of October to enable talks to take place at the Advisory Conciliation and Arbitration Service (ACAS).
<P>

<a name="01116w06.html_para10">The industrial action involved the refusal by RMT members to undertake certain tasks, such as cleaning officers' cabins, while ships were in port. The most significant measure was the refusal by deck and engineering personnel to carry out unmooring activity thereby preventing the ship from sailing.
<P>

<a name="01116w06.html_para11">Prior to the action becoming continuous on 28 June, no record of the ships affected was kept, principally because it was possible to adjust ships programmes to minimise the impact. Following that date, three ships were affected: RFAs Sir Geraint, Sir Bedivere and Fort Austin were prevented from leaving port for a period of between four to six weeks during the summer.
<P>

<a name="01116w06.html_para12">All operational commitments have continued to be met throughout the period of the industrial action.
<P>

<a name="01116w06.html_para13">While the industrial dispute arose following the rejection of the 1999 pay offer, the focus changed to a demand by the RMT for additional earned voyage leave (EVL). As part of the 2000 pay round, ratings were granted an additional eight days leave per year. Unfortunately, this was not considered by the RMT to be sufficient to resolve the dispute. However, I am pleased to be able to report that, following agreement in principle to the terms of reference of a working group to set in place a timetable for further improvements to leave, the RMT has now suspended the industrial action. I am also advised that the RMT has written to its members recommending that the industrial action is called off.

<a name="01116w06.html_para14"><i>Letter from Peter Ewins to Dr. Ian Gibson, dated 16 November 2000:</i>
<P>

<a name="01116w06.html_para15">

<BR>
I am replying to your three questions to the Secretary of State for Defence about the relocation of the Met Office. This matter falls within my area of responsibility as Chief Executive of the Met Office.
<BR>
As you know, the Under Secretary of State for Defence, Dr Lewis Moonie announced in the House on 9 November that the Met Office has chosen Exeter Business Park as its preferred site for relocation. Exeter was chosen from a shortlist of four sites that also included Beaufort Park in Bracknell, Shinfield Park in Reading and Norwich Research Park. These four sites were those that the Met Office believed could best meet its needs, following a thorough search and careful evaluation of potential sites throughout the United Kingdom.
<BR>
For Norwich to reach our short list of sites it had performed very favourably against our evaluation criteria. However, only one of the four short-listed sites could be chosen as our preferred site and when evaluating the business benefits and risks, including staff preference, financial appraisals, availability of land with planning consent, local access and other factors, Exeter was the clear choice. It was not an easy decision, but we are certain that Exeter is the best location from which to build a secure and successful future.
<BR>
In relative terms, the Norwich Research Park site had a number of strengths, notably the opportunities it offered for lower operating costs and improved living standards for our staff compared with the other sites in the Southeast. There would, in addition, have been good opportunities for collaboration with the University of East Anglia (UEA), which would also have been a valuable source of high quality graduate staff. Moreover, there was strong local political support and also from key organisations in the area, including Norfolk County Council, Norwich City Council, the Regional Development Agency and the University.
<BR>
The site also had some weaknesses in comparison to our preferred site. For example, there were serious doubts, raised at a late stage in the evaluation process, as to whether the site was actually available. We also had some concerns that the site was somewhat isolated on the fringe of the City and would not offer the profile we were seeking as a world-leading science based organisation. Moreover, our staff demonstrated a preference for Exeter. We have offered to give Norwich City Council's Chief Executive and her team a detailed de-brief in order that lessons may be learnt for similar initiatives in the future.
<BR>
We recognise the UAE's particular strength in the field of climate science and impact analysis and the importance of maintaining and strengthening the close working relationship we have with them. There are, of course, many other organisations throughout the United Kingdom and around the World with whom we have close links on a range of subjects, and others with whom we will develop links as we pursue our strategy of diversification into wider environmental services. With modern communications we are firmly of the view that such relationships can be achieved very well indeed from Exeter.
<BR>
As a trading fund agency, the choice of preferred site rested with me as Chief Executive and was made with the support of my Management Board, taking full account of the interests of the Met Office's customers--both in the public and private sectors--and our staff. This choice was made in the very best, long-term interests of the Met Office, following a thorough and rigorous evaluation process based on pre-determined criteria. I presented the choice of preferred site to both Dr Moonie and the Secretary of State for Defence who, having weighed all the issues, were content to endorse the decision.
<BR>
The two consortia with whom the Met Office is negotiating over the provision and ongoing maintenance of the new accommodation will now work up detailed proposals for the Exeter site. Tenders are due to be submitted by the end of February 2001 and a contract is expected to be placed by June 2001.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what the additional cost to public funds was in <i>(a)</i> legal costs incurred by the (i) Government and (ii) applicants and <i>(b)</i> damages awarded to the applicants by the decision to continue to contest cases relating to homosexuals in the armed forces (i) between 16 February 1996 and 1 May 1997 and (ii) after 2 May 1997.

<a name="01116w07.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 Compensation and legal costs have been paid in the four cases covered by the European Court of Human Rights judgment of 27 September 1999 and the figures are shown in the table. In addition, in light of the ECHR judgment, the Secretary of State for Defence authorised that settlement negotiations commence with those individuals discharged from the armed forces as a result of their homosexuality who had submitted Employment Tribunal applications and whose account is accepted as being substantially factually true. The level of compensation paid to those applicants who settled their cases during the periods in question, together with legal costs incurred by the Minister of Defence, are also shown in the table. Legal costs incurred by Employment Tribunal applicants are not normally recoverable from the Defendant and therefore the Ministry of Defence has no record of such costs. Settlement negotiations on the remainder of the outstanding cases remain ongoing.

 <i>[holding answer 26 October 2000]:</i> The total number of people employed in the press office is 27. This is comprised of five Senior Information Officers, 16 Information Officers, an Assistant Information Officer and a Chief Immigration Officer on attachment. In addition, there is an administrative support team of four people comprised of one Higher Executive Officer, one Administrative Officer and two Administrative Assistants.
<P>

This expansion has proved necessary to cope with the widened responsibilities and activities of the Home Office since May 1997 (including the larger programme of constitutional and other reforms) and a significant increase in calls to the press office over the last three years.
<P>

<a name="01116w07.html_para1">In addition there has been a one-off cost of refurbishing the press office and the provision of additional equipment and IT support which will be in the region of &#163;200,000.

 The European Council meeting in Tampere on 15 and 16 October 1999 decided that it would keep under constant review progress made towards developing the Union as an area of freedom, security and justice in line with its own conclusions ("the Tampere milestones"). It called on the Commission to come forward with an appropriate proposal for a scoreboard to that end. The Commission presented its scoreboard at the Justice and Home Affairs Council meeting on 27 March 2000, at which it was discussed by the Council. The scoreboard was designed to be regularly updated. The Commission produced a revised version of the scoreboard at the Justice and Home Affairs Council meeting on 29 May 2000. A further revised version is expected for the Justice and Home Affairs Council meeting on 30 November-1 December 2000.

 The Grotius programme, which is concerned with incentives and exchanges for legal practitioners, runs from 1996-2000. Following the Treaty of Amsterdam, which provided for judicial co-operation in the field of civil law to take place under the Treaty establishing the European Community and for judicial co-operation in the field of criminal law to take place under the Treaty on European Union, it will be necessary to split the Grotius programme in future. The Commission has proposed the extension of the Grotius programme in the area of civil law for the period of one year only, to enable consideration of its future and its relationship with other programmes, notably the Robert Schuman programme. In the area of criminal law, the Commission has indicated that it is considering proposing the extension of the Grotius programme for a period of two years.

 <i>[holding answer 8 November 2000]:</i> No. The current assessment system is working well and ensures that currently about a third of dependent students from lower income families do not make any contribution to tuition fees, and I expect this to rise to some two fifths from September 2001 as a result of a change to the contribution threshold. This is in the context of over 40 per cent. of all students making no contribution to tuition fees under the present system, rising to about 50 per cent. from September 2001. The new student finance arrangements that we introduced share the cost of higher education fairly between students, their families and taxpayers generally, and provide essential resources for investment in universities and colleges.

<BR>
As National Statistician and Registrar General for England and Wales I have been asked to reply to your recent question asking when the printing of the census forms for Wales and England began. (135154)
<BR>
The contractual arrangements for printing the forms were agreed in February 2000. The contract required printing of the forms for Wales to begin on 27 July. Printing of the Welsh language version of the household forms for Wales subsequently began on that date, followed by the printing of the English language version on 2 August.
<BR>
Details of the arrangements for the consultation on the 2001 Census in Wales have been widely publicised. The shape and content of the Census has been formulated in consultation with users through a structure of Advisory Committees, working Groups and topic-related sub-groups, Census News, information papers, the Internet and ad hoc public meetings. The assessment of the resulting business cases for census topics culminated in the Government's proposals set out in the White Paper in March 1999. In Wales in particular, formal consultation is carried out through the Welsh Census Users Network Group at which each of the 22 local government authorities in Wales is represented as well as a range of other public bodies and authorities. Additional bilateral consultation is carried out with the National Assembly for Wales and the Welsh Language Board.
<BR>
In addition to this extensive programme of consultation a major public rehearsal of the 2001 Census was carried out in April 1999, including coverage of around 7,800 households in Gwynedd and 6,900 households in Ceredigion.

Portschach in 1998. This initiative has been taken forward through the St. Malo UK-French Summit and the European Councils of Cologne, Helsinki and Feira.

 Over US$37 billion has been made available to purchase humanitarian goods under the Oil for Food programme since its inception in 1996. This year alone, Oil for Food revenue is expected to reach more than US$16 billion.
<P>

<a name="01116w13.html_para4">Figures for 1 November are no longer available. However, as at 13 November the UK had 208 contracts placed on hold, valued at approximately US$0.3 billion, which is less than 1 per cent. of the total value of Oil for Food revenue. The UK, as a responsible member of the UN Iraq Sanctions Committee, scrutinises contracts very carefully to ensure that goods are not supplied to Iraq in violation of Security Council resolutions. Holds are normally lifted after assurances have been received about the end-use or in-country monitoring of these goods. Since early October the UK has lifted holds on contracts valued at $200 million following confirmation that the goods will be subject to specific monitoring within Iraq.
<P>

<a name="01116w13.html_para5">It is noteworthy that at the end of October Iraq's bureaucracy was holding back the delivery of US$1.1 billion worth of goods already approved by the Sanctions Committee. Detailed information on the status of individual Oil for Food contracts are available from The Office for Iraq Programme's website (http://www.un.org/Dems/oip.html).

<a name="01116w15.html_para4">In consultation with other prosecuting agencies and leading external human rights experts, the CPS developed a comprehensive training course for CPS prosecutors. The training programme reached nearly 2,500 prosecutors and selected caseworkers before 2 October 2000.

 CPS prosecution policy is contained in the Code for Crown Prosecutors. The Code outlines the two-stage process in the decision to prosecute. The first stage is the evidential test, which states there must be sufficient evidence to provide a "realistic prospect of conviction". The second stage is the public interest test. The CPS will only start or continue when the case has passed both tests. The Code also states that each case must be considered on its own facts and merits.

 The Government recognise the contribution that the fitness industry makes to the overall economy and the wider health benefits of increasing participation. There are a number of different independent estimates of the specific economic benefits of the fitness and leisure industry based on estimates of the economic benefits of sport as a whole. However, these estimates tend not to be sensitive enough to give a reliable estimate of expenditure within specific sectors. I understand the Leisure Industries Research Centre at Sheffield Hallam University is currently developing a new model which aims to provide a more accurate picture of the economic impacts of different sectors of sport, including the health and fitness markets. Sheffield Hallam University is intending to publish the first results from this work shortly.

1. The start date shown is when the local authority is contacted with a request for information to assist with future planning of the inspection. The inspection start dates for inspections begun earlier than 1999 have been calculated as records did not hold actual start dates.<P>

2. The current Benefit Fraud Inspectorate programme includes another two Scottish local authorities which are currently being inspected and a further four inspections of Scottish authorities that are due to be carried out by autumn 2001.<P>

 The Vaccine Damage Payment (VDP) Act 1979 provides a single, tax-free payment for people who have suffered severe mental and/or physical disablement of 80 per cent. or more as a result of vaccination against one or a group of specified diseases following a claim made within six years of the date of vaccination or of a child reaching the age of two whichever is the later. The only changes to the eligibility rules which have been made since 1979 are the addition of mumps in April 1990 and haemophilus influenza type b (Hib) in May 1995 to the list of specified diseases.

<P>
<a name="01116w19.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 As my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Social Security has said in his statement on 9 November 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 451-55, the Department is examining measures which will reduce the complexity of the current system and encourage pensioners to claim their correct benefit entitlement.

<a name="01116w19.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Flynn: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security what is his latest estimate, making no allowance for behavioural change, of how many pensioner households will benefit from the Minimum Income Guarantee in 2050.  [138349]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01116w19.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Rooker </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 15 November 2000]:</i> Making no allowance for behavioural change, the figure remains at one in four--the same as given in the Pensions Green Paper "Partnership in Pensions" (Cm 4179).

<P>
<a name="01116w19.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Cox: </B>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01116w19.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 Some 2 million pensioners either as singles or couples receive the Minimum Income Guarantee. Figures for those who might be entitled but are not claiming were based on a 1 per cent. sample. We shall have a better estimate of those entitled but not claiming when the present take-up campaign is concluded, during which we are making direct contact with 2.3 million pensioners.

1. All amounts are in &#163; per week at July 1998 prices. They are rounded to the nearest &#163;1, although estimates are not necessarily accurate to this level.<P>

2. Estimates are for pensioner units. A pensioner unit is defined as a single (non-cohabiting) person over state pension age (65 years or above for men and 60 years or above for women), or a couple (married or cohabiting) where the man, defined as the head, is over state pension age. Estimates for pensioner couples are broken down by the age of the man.<P>

3. Estimates marked 'n/a' are not applicable. Single men and couples are only defined as pensioner units if the man is aged 65 years or above.<P>

4. Means-tested benefits are defined as Income Support, Family Credit, Council Tax Benefit, Housing Benefit and Social Fund Grants.<P>

5. Levels of means-tested benefit may be particularly affected by mis-reporting by survey respondents, as it is thought that receipt of State Retirement Pension and receipt of Income Support are often confused in the FRS.<P>

This will reduce to &#163;4.9 million per annum from January 2001 due to restructuring of payroll and expenses services as part of the Department drive to refocus resources on the front-line services.
