 When the amount of a claimant's capital is calculated in the income-related benefits, the value of a capital asset is reduced by the amount of any debt secured on it. No similar arrangement applies to unsecured debts of any type.

We are determined to ensure that absent parents meet their responsibilities and pay the maintenance they owe and we are looking closely at all aspects of the Agency to ensure that it delivers a modern, efficient and effective service to all its clients.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department if he will review the legislative provision for a maximum daily allowance to witnesses for loss of earnings to ensure that those appearing as witnesses are not out of pocket as a result.[15280]

<P>
<a name="71114w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The present provisions are intended to relieve hardship that may result from witnesses discharging their public duty by attending court to give evidence. I have no plans to change the present legislation. There is inevitably a tension between meeting the full costs of witnesses attending court and the limited public money available to do so. I believe the present provisions strike the right balance in recognising the discharge of a public duty and using limited public funds to best effect.

<P>
<a name="71114w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The Protocol on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland has the effect that the adoption of proposed measures under Title IIIa of the EC Treaty, which includes (under Article 73m) civil judicial co-operation, will not apply to the United Kingdom or Ireland unless those countries choose to take part in the adoption and application of such measures. If the Government decided to take part in the adoption of any such measure or to accept an existing measure the usual parliamentary scrutiny procedure would apply.

 Revenue Support Grant is an unhypothecated grant which is distributed to local authorities on the basis of Standard Spending Assessments (SSAs). An SSA is the Government's assessment of the appropriate amount of revenue expenditure which would allow an authority to provide a standard level of service, consistent with the Government's view of the appropriate amount of revenue expenditure for all local authorities. 



<P>
<P><I>14 Nov 1997 : Column: 680</I><P>
SSAs are not binding on authorities, which are free to decide how much to spend on any service. All personal social services SSAs, including figures on a per capita basis, are listed in the "Local Government Finance Standard Spending Assessment Handbook 1997-98", copies of which are available in the Library.

<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71114w02.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Milburn: </B> 
 The weighted capitation formula is used to set targets which then inform allocations. The formula does not determine allocations. These reflect our decisions on the speed at which health authorities are brought nearer to target through the distribution of growth. If a different formula had been used we might have distributed growth differently. It is therefore not meaningful to recalculate 1998-99 allocations hypothetically.




<P>

<P>

<a name="71114w02.html_para2">If the 1997-98 formula had been applied to North Essex health authority's target this would have been 2.86 per cent. greater.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>DERA does not undertake any training with the armed forces which involves the use of animals. Specifically, medical officers and the other clinical staff are not trained in technical practises using live animals. The Defence Animal Centre at Melton Mowbray does, however, train animals for military duties. In the 1996/97 financial year, a total of 370 dogs were trained for search and patrol duties, and 60 horses were trained for ceremonial duties.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>DERA carries out a number of research programmes involving the use of animals and aimed at providing the armed forces with safe and effective protection against specific operational hazards. During 1996, a total of 11221 animals were used. The species were: guinea pigs, hamsters, marmosets, mice, pigs, rabbits, rats, Rhesus monkeys, sheep and goats. To list all of the procedures would involve a disproportionate amount of effort.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>One of these programmes involves specifically clinical staff from the armed forces. A small number of medical officers from the Defence Medical Services are seconded to CBD to work with DERA staff on research into the management of battle injury and trauma.

 I hope to publish shortly the report of the research conducted by the City University into the operation of the compulsory purchase procedures. I will want to hear the views of interested organisations and persons on the findings of that research before considering whether any changes may be appropriate to the arrangements for compulsory acquisition and compensation.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment (1) what estimate he has made of the proportion of the response to his White Paper "Excellence in schools", which related to each of the chapters upon which comment was sought; and in each case, approximately what proportion of comment expressed <i>(a)</i> support for and <i>(b)</i> opposition to the approach outlined or described; [16055]

<P>

 We received over 8,000 responses to the White Paper of which some 3,500 were written responses to the full version. The remainder were a combination of tear-off slips and other forms of communication.
<P>

<a name="71114w08.html_para0">Of the 3,500, 138 were from Local Education Authorities and about 600, 2,100 and 700 came from representative organisations, schools and individuals respectively. A breakdown between grant-maintained and LEA-maintained schools is not currently available.
<P>

<a name="71114w08.html_para1">Most responses addressed issues from more than one chapter and many ranged beyond the specific questions posed. There was broad support for the contents of the White Paper.

 On 22 October we published a Green Paper, "Excellence for All Children: Meeting Special Educational Needs", which encourages local education authorities, other local agencies and business to work together to support the education of children with special educational needs. We are consulting on how to improve and develop such co-ordination.
