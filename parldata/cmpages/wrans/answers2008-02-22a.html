 To ask the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government what guidance has been issued to Gloucestershire County Council on the account to be taken of the flooding of summer 2007 in the setting of its council tax precept for 2008-09. [188187]</p>

 While Government have not provided guidance to local authorities on how they should set their council tax precept we have made it clear that we expect the national average increase in council tax to be substantially below 5 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_85"><a name="80222w0003.htm_para0"><a name="08022277001096">In July 2007 Communities and Local Government wrote to the chief executives of flood affected authorities to remind them of powers around council tax discounts and business rate relief that would enable them to provide financial relief to affected taxpayers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_86"><a name="80222w0003.htm_para1"><a name="08022277001097">In addition to any statutory council tax discounts that may apply to those forced out of their homes by flooding, local authorities have discretionary powers, under section 13A of the Local Government Finance Act 1992, to grant discounts of up to 100 per cent. to householders who have been affected.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_87"><a name="80222w0003.htm_para2"><a name="08022277001098">Local authorities can also consider whether non-domestic properties hit by flooding should be liable for empty property rates and/or whether to exercise their discretionary powers under section 49 of the Local Government Finance Act 1988 to grant hardship rate relief in respect of occupied or empty properties.</p>

 We are carrying out an initial sift of eco-towns proposals across Government and its agencies. This will give a preliminary indication of the sustainability and infrastructure potential of these schemes in relation to the criteria set out in the eco-towns prospectus, including their approach to transport and the environment. We are also contacting local authorities and regional bodies, in areas where schemes look to have the potential to go forward to a shortlist for consultation. We hope to publish this shortlist in early March 2008 for consultation with the public, wider stakeholders and local authorities.</p>

The Thames Gateway delivery plan announced a pan- gateway skills plan developed by the Learning and Skills Council to invest &#163;1.6 billion in teaching and learning, and &#163;850 million in new building for further education. The delivery plan also reiterated our commitment to a Thames Gateway guarantee of assured progression, ensuring that every level three course on offer in the Gateway leads directly to entry to a suitable level four course for learners who want to progress further.</p>

 The regulatory impact assessment published alongside &#145;Building a Greener Future&#146; policy statement in July 2007 (both available on the Department's website) indicates that the requirement to meet the zero carbon standard in new homes from 2016 will result in an additional amount of energy being sourced from renewable sources compared to a scenario without the policy. It also suggests that this additional amount of renewables as a result of the policy could be equivalent to around 1 per cent. of the total UK electricity demand by 2020. The modelling did not disaggregate capacity from on-site renewables.</p>

 Communities and Local Government consulted on the mechanism for the setting of guideline rents in the Housing Revenue Account (HRA) subsidy regime in August. The options consulted on were guideline rents predicated on a rent convergence date of 2011-12, or extending the convergence date to lower annual guideline rent increases. A decision on the preferred option (extending the convergence date to 2016-17, solely for the purpose of calculating guideline rents in the HRA subsidy system for 2008-09) was included in the HRA subsidy determination for 2008-09 which was issued in draft for consultation on 23 November 2007 and in final form on 15 January 2008.</p>

We regularly raise our concerns about the treatment of Baha'is with the Iranian authorities, bilaterally and through the EU. On 22 January, the EU presidency, with strong UK support, raised specific concerns about the treatment of the Baha'i community in Iran during a meeting with the Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In this meeting the EU expressed opposition to all forms of discrimination, in particular regarding freedom of religion. Most recently, on 7 February, the EU presidency issued a public statement expressing concern about the deteriorating situation of the Baha'i minority. We have also taken action at the UN; in December 2007 the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution about the human rights situation in Iran. The resolution, which was co-sponsored by the UK and all other EU member states, expressed very serious concern about increasing discrimination against religious minorities in Iran and the situation of the Baha'is in particular.

Basildon PCT, Thurrock PCT, Billericay, Brentwood and Wickford PCT merged to form South West Essex PCT. Epping Forest PCT, Harlow PCT and Uttlesford PCT merged to form West Essex PCT.<br>
The figures have been aggregated accordingly by the current organisation title.<br>
More accurate validation processes in 2006 have resulted in the identification and removal of 9,858 duplicate non-medical staff records out of the total workforce figure of 1.3 million in 2006. Earlier years&#146; figures could not be accurately validated in this way and so will be slightly inflated. The level of inflation in earlier years&#146; figures is estimated to be less than 1 per cent. of total across all non-medical staff groups for headcount figures (and negligible for full-time equivalents). This should be taken into consideration when analysing trends over time.<br>

This question has been answered on this basis. It means, for example, that some people who are UK nationals will be included in the total of &#147;foreign born&#148; and that people who are working but are above state pension age are not included.</p>

 At the national level, DFID is providing &#163;252 million to the Government of India&#146;s Reproductive and Child Health Programme (RCH II) which is tackling child ill-health and malnutrition through antenatal care, promotion of early breastfeeding, treatment of diarrhoea, and education on health and sanitation. DFID has also committed &#163;75 million to UNICEF to work in eight disadvantaged states to provide better services for undernourished babies and children. DFID also supports India&#146;s Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS), the main response of the Government of India to child malnutrition. We are providing  &#163;1 million to help redesign the programme so that it more effectively reaches its target of 36 million children under six and 7.7 million pregnant and nursing women.

The Government of West Bengal has launched a nutrition strategy targeting children under three in the state&#146;s six poorest districts.

<i> [holding answer 20 February 2008]:</i> 395 tonnes of gold were sold from the reserves between July 1999 and March 2002 and re-invested in interest-bearing foreign currency assets. Other central banks have adopted similar policies. The total proceeds were around $3.5 billion, equivalent to around &#163;2.3 billion (using exchange rates at the time of the sales). On 15 February 2008, the current market value of the gold sold was around $11.5 billion, equivalent to around &#163;5.8 billion.</p>
