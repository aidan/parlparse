 To ask the Minister for Women and Equality if she will make an assessment of <i> (a)</i> the account taken by local authorities of the gender equality duty in determining applications for the opening of lap-dancing clubs and <i> (b)</i> levels of use by local authorities of their powers to control the opening and regulation of such clubs.

 I have been asked to reply.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_34"><a name="90309w0001.htm_para0"><a name="0903097000065">Currently, lap dancing clubs are required to obtain a premises licence or club premises certificate for regulated entertainment and the licensing authority will consider such applications in accordance with its powers to control and regulate such clubs under the Licensing Act 2003. The Government do not collect specific information on decisions taken by licensing authorities relating to applications for lap dancing clubs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_35"><a name="90309w0001.htm_para1"><a name="0903097000066">On the 18 June 2008 the Parliamentary Under-Secretary at the Department for Culture, Media and Sport wrote to chief executives of local authorities on the subject of lap dancing clubs to seek their views on whether they considered their powers under the Licensing Act 2003 were sufficient to regulate and control the opening of lap dancing in their area. This attracted 117 responses, the majority of which felt that additional legislation should be introduced to provide controls which are specific to lap dancing and similar premises.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_36"><a name="90309w0001.htm_para2"><a name="0903097000067">In response, the Government have included provisions in the Policing and Crime Bill to reclassify lap dancing clubs as sex encounter venues under Schedule 3 of the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1982. This will give local authorities more powers to control the number and location of lap dancing clubs. It will also allow them to consider their obligations under the Gender Equality Duty when determining new applications if appropriate.</p>

The recorded level of uninsured drivers from this survey was 1.2 per cent. However, comparison of the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency&#146;s vehicle register and motor insurance database suggests the total figure of uninsured driving is likely to be higher. In 2005, a comparison of the two databases estimated that about 2.1 million licensed vehicles were being driven by uninsured drivers. The comparison looks at all vehicle keepers and motor insurance policies and does not rely on vehicles being spotted in use on the road. Further work continues on a more recent comparison of the two databases and is undergoing validity checks by departmental statisticians.</p>

number of acutely malnourished children is increasing but at 4.8 per cent. remains below internationally recognised emergency levels (10 per cent.) across the country.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_81"><a name="90309w0004.htm_para10"><a name="0903097000410">There are several important reasons for this resilience, notably the following:</p>

 UN figures suggest that seven million people will have received food aid in Zimbabwe by February 2009. The next harvest&#151;which will be collected in April&#151;is likely to be slightly better for those who managed to plant seeds. However, as a result of an NGO ban during the election period last year, distribution of agricultural inputs was delayed and some people were unable to access the fertiliser they needed for a good crop. While an accurate estimate of the harvest will be done in March, early projections suggest a similar scale of food insecurity is anticipated in 2009-10 with a peak before next year&#146;s harvest.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_83"><a name="90309w0004.htm_para12"><a name="0903097000414">The NGO ban and the failure of the Government of Zimbabwe to import their agreed quota of food have made this a particularly challenging situation.

 DCMS continues to take significant steps towards reducing administrative burdens arising from its legislation. The latest simplification plan, the third one produced by DCMS, sets out progress to date and details of the forthcoming measures that will be implemented during 2009. Details can be found at the following web address:</p>

This has been achieved in large part by the changes to the regulatory regimes under the Licensing Act 2003 and the Gambling Act 2005 which consolidated a number of separate pieces of legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_85"><a name="90309w0005.htm_para1"><a name="09030912000023">With the assistance of an expert panel last year, DCMS carried out a costing exercise of the Gambling Act 2005 using the standard cost model. This was a commitment from the previous plan and looked at the administrative costs of the previous regime compared with the new one established under the Act. It found that the administrative burden of the 2005 Act stands at &#163;17.4 million annually which is a reduction from the baseline of the previous regime which was estimated by PricewaterhouseCoopers to be &#163;74 million annually.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_86"><a name="90309w0005.htm_para2"><a name="09030912000024">In respect of the Licensing Act 2003, the savings to the industry from reduced administrative burdens, validated by an expert panel including industry representatives, is about &#163;99 million annually against a baseline established  <br>

 Entrance to the museums listed is free, with the exception of the Tate St Ives. Services offered by the museums are often free or where charges are made, they have fully reflected the reduction in VAT. Exceptions to this, where the museums have handled the rate change in VAT in different ways are summarised in the following list.

However, tour prices which would normally have increased in January 2009, were held at 2008 prices.

 Both the National Lottery Commission and Camelot aim to provide a fair, transparent and accountable procedure for handling complaints from whatever source and by whichever channel of communication they are received. Complaints received by the Commission are logged and considered by a consumer protection team which reports quarterly to the Commissioners. This allows for trends in complaints or unusual cases to be escalated within the Commission and the appropriate action to be taken. As a matter of course, for every complaint received, Camelot reviews whether lessons can be learned and, if practicable, these are then implemented.</p>

 The building was acquired following a property search to meet a need from the House of Lords for decant space to facilitate the development of the Millbank Island site and a requirement for additional space from the House of Commons. The property search had revealed a dearth of suitable accommodation at that time within an acceptable distance of the Palace of Westminster, 14 Tothill street being the only one available with sufficient space that met the criteria.</p>

That power does not extend to attaching a condition relating to the compliance by the licence holder of the provisions in the Mobile Homes Act 1983. Therefore, no local authority in England would be able to revoke a licence because of a breach of that act.</p>

The centres were set up last year with the final advice centre opening in December 2008. The regional advice centres provide a one-stop shop offering consumers a range of free and impartial advice on how to reduce their carbon footprint including energy efficiency, microgeneration and renewable energy, low carbon transport, water efficiency and waste reduction and a range of independent services that will help them action that advice.</p>

<i> [holding answer 4 March 2009]: </i>A number of Departments have already reported plans to install on-site generation technologies, some of which include microgeneration technologies. For example, the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform will be installing solar photovoltaic (PV) panels; the Department for International Development are undertaking two projects&#151;a wind turbine and a biomass installation; the Department for Work and Pensions plan to install a wind turbine; the Foreign and Commonwealth Office have plans for a biomass project and a wind turbine project; and HM Revenue and Customs plan a mixture of biomass and wind turbine projects.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_179"><a name="90309w0012.htm_para7"><a name="09030922000377">The current number of installations of onsite energy technologies is similar to that in 2007 when three Departments had renewable energy sources on-site. At that time, DEFRA generated 67MWhrs per year from solar thermal water heating. The Insolvency Service headquarters in London used a photovoltaic (PV) system which produces on average 9.1 kWhs a day and the MoD produced small amounts of renewable energy from off grid wind turbines/PV panels.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_180"><a name="90309w0012.htm_para8"><a name="09030922000378">There are 10 combined heat and power (CHP) schemes located on the Government estate registered with the Government's CHP quality assurance programme (CHPQA). In 2007-08 these 10 schemes produced just over 19 gigawatt hours of good quality CHP electricity. This represents around 0.1 per cent. of the 28,677 gigawatts electricity produced in total by good quality CHP plants in the UK in 2007. The Sustainable Development in Government (SDiG) report indicates that total CHP generated electricity consumed on the Government estate in 2007-08 was 311 gigawatt hours. 19 gigawatt hours of good quality CHP electricity generated on the Government estate represents around 6 per cent. of the total CHP electricity consumed on the Government estate in 2007-08.</p>

<i> [holding answer 5 March 2009]:</i><i> </i>The fees charged by an insolvency practitioner reflect the necessary level of specialist knowledge that the insolvency practitioner has to have to be able to take effective action in a wide range of unusual and complex situations. This expertise takes time and training to acquire.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_192"><a name="90309w0013.htm_para2"><a name="09030929000105">The Insolvency Rules 1986 determine how the remuneration of an office holder (liquidator/administrator/trustee etc.) is to be fixed and provide that such remuneration shall be fixed by reference to the time properly given to the administration, or as a percentage of the assets which are realised and distributed. In most insolvency cases it is for the liquidation or creditors&#146; committee to determine the basis for fixing the remuneration or, in the absence of such a committee, the creditors decide the matter. The Rules also make provision for the court to review the amount of remuneration charged.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_193"><a name="90309w0013.htm_para3"><a name="09030929000106">Statement of Insolvency Practice 9 provides regulatory guidance which insolvency practitioners must follow when seeking approval for their fees. Matters to be considered by the approving body (usually the creditors) include the effectiveness with which the insolvency practitioner has carried out his duties and the value and nature of the assets with which he has had to deal. In October 2004 the court issued a practice statement which provides guidance on matters that will be taken into account when the court is dealing with an application for review of remuneration.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_194"><a name="90309w0013.htm_para4"><a name="09030929000107">As the amount of remuneration is subject to review by the court my noble Friend the Secretary of State has no powers to investigate the amount of remuneration charged.

Data is also received from a number of independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes.

These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. Some of the increase in figures for later years (particularly 2006-07 onwards) may be due to the improvement in the coverage of independent sector activity.</p>

In terms of media coverage, the PCT recently published an article in its in-house magazine promoting the issue, and advising readers on ways to minimise medicine wastage (featured in December 2008 issue). The PCT is also conducting a &#145;returned medicine&#146; audit to establish what medicines are returned to community pharmacies and why. Linked to the nationally commissioned research, the university of York is helping analyse the results for Cumbria PCT and the findings are expected later this year.</p>

The Coefficient of Variation (CV) indicates the quality of an estimate, the smaller the CV value the higher the quality. The true value is likely to lie within +/- twice the CV - for example, for an estimate of 200 with a CV of 5 per cent. we would expect the population total to be within the range 180-220.<br>

1. Data are captured using different methods for each of the three services and the figures are not directly comparable on a tri-service basis.<br>
2. The Royal Navy (RN) figures for this answer were drawn from the centrally held RN Discipline Database and unlike previous returns this table includes charges of AWOL for periods of absence of less than 24 hours.<br>
3. The RN figures include Royal Marines subject to the Naval Discipline Act at the time of the offence.<br>
4. The RN figures do not include personnel who were convicted of AWOL and later dismissed at a hearing with AWOL not recorded as an offence being dealt with at that final trial.<br>
5. The Army figures include only those who were dismissed solely on the basis of AWOL (i.e. there were no other offences) but may include one or more counts of AWOL. They do not include instances where AWOL may have been recorded as subordinate to a more serious offence.<br>
6. The RAF figures are for those personnel reported as AWOL and later dismissed for any reason (i.e. not necessarily as a direct result of being AWOL).<br>

 Through Building Schools for the Future (BSF) and the Primary Capital Programme, all authorities will have the opportunity to review local provision strategically.

 All &#145;myplace&#146; projects have demonstrated that young people, particularly disadvantaged young people, have been and will be active participants in the design, development and management of the new facility.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_425"><a name="90309w0044.htm_para2"><a name="09030940005706">The Big Lottery Fund reports that it is disproportionate to cost to provide specific information at this notice about how many young people were involved in consultations on each of &#145;myplace&#146; projects; the dates the consultations took place; and how many young people are directly involved in the management of each of the projects. The Big Lottery Fund is able to report that &#145;myplace&#146; projects have engaged thousands of young people across the country through a variety of methods including local youth parliaments, councils or neighbourhood forums; through open consultation events, surveys and focus groups; and through their attendance at existing projects. &#145;myplace&#146; projects have also demonstrated that young people will continue to influence directly the ongoing management of the new facility. Proposed approaches include the use of youth forums, young people sitting directly on management committees, establishing shadow youth boards, appointing a young person as the project&#146;s assistant director and passing the governance of the whole project over to young people through the creation of a youth-led trust.</p>
