<a name="stpa_0">The specific prohibition on parking at a dropped kerb currently applies only in London, under section 14 of the London local authorities and Transport for London Act 2003. The penalty charge levels for contravening the prohibition in London are decided by the Mayor for London.

<a name="stpa_1">However, section 86 of part 6 to the Traffic Management Act 2004, once commenced, will allow this prohibition to apply in areas of England and Wales where civil enforcement of parking contraventions is exercised by the local traffic authority and appropriate application for these specific provisions has been made to the relevant national authority. The Secretary of State will be responsible for setting the level of penalties in England. The penalty level will be set when section 86 comes into force, which is currently expected to be in 2006.

 We are keen to ensure that the Project for the Sustainable Development of Heathrow (Project Heathrow) is taken forward in an open and transparent manner, and to communicate information about the project to local communities and their representatives.

Local authorities are represented on Project Heathrow&#039;s air quality technical panels. Information about the project has been on the Department&#039;s website www.dft.gov.uk/aviation/projectheathrow since last summer and we endeavour to keep this up to date as the project progresses.

<i>[holding answer 15 March 2005]:</i> Regulations provide for the release of vehicle keeper details from the register maintained by the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency to applicants who can demonstrate &#039;reasonable cause&#039; for their request. Legal advice is that the enforcement of parking restrictions on private property meets the &#039;reasonable cause&#039; criterion.

overall traffic noise level when light vehicles form most of the traffic stream. However, the effect on noise from large vehicles is more complex. While there are some decreases in maximum vehicle noise levels from large commercial vehicles due to reductions in their speeds, this can be offset by increases in noise from the bodywork of such vehicles as they pass over the humps and cushions. The net effect of these measures on the overall traffic noise depends on the proportion of large commercial vehicles in the traffic stream, and on the type of road hump installed.

<a name="50317w02.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_7">The environmental impact of road humps has to be considered against the need to improve road safety. Around 3,500 people are killed and a further 34,000 are seriously injured on our roads every year. Nearly 2,400 of these casualties are child pedestrians. Compliance with speed limits would reduce these unacceptable numbers, and experience shows that traffic calming measures such as road humps have significant safety benefits.

 The Stoke Hammond and Linslade Western Bypass was subject to the Department&#039;s appraisal requirements applicable at the time when relevant funding and approval decisions were taken. These requirements have changed over time. Alternative options and routes were considered, but not recommended, by the Public Inquiry into the Compulsory Purchase Orders held in 2003. Once a scheme has completed its statutory processes, the Department does not generally require an assessment of alternative options when the local authority submits a request for Full Approval and release of funding under the Local Transport Programme.

<p><a name="st_88"><a name="50317w09.html_spnew9"><b> Mr. Gareth Thomas: </b> 
 The geographical position of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, and related security considerations, meant that the initial Government of India (GoI) response to the relief and rehabilitation requirements of the area took longer than that for affected mainland areas. The GoI has allocated around &#163;100 million pounds in financial assistance to the islands following the tsunami. Considerable support has also been committed in terms of military personnel and logistical support. The GoI has also allowed NGOs (including international NGOs) access to a number of the islands to undertake relief and rehabilitation work. UNICEF and the United Nations Development Programme have a presence in the islands, and DFID is providing &#163;476,000 support to the Voluntary Health association of India (VHAI) to undertake relief work and livelihoods rehabilitation in Little Andaman.

 Asylum and human rights claims by Jamaican homosexuals are, like those of all claimants, from all countries, considered on their individual merits in accordance with our obligations under the 1951 UN Refugee Convention and the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR).

<i>[holding answer 16 March 2005]:</i> The five-year Immigration Strategy that we announced on 7 February contained details of our plans through e-Borders to introduce an electronic system of counting in and out visitors to the UK. Automated electronic checks will record people&#039;s movements to provide a greatly enhanced passenger movement audit with significantly more reliable inbound and outbound data information than any of the border agencies have been able to obtain in the past.

The departure information will provide vital management and intelligence information, which may then be reconciled against information held on failed asylum seekers (FAS). A number of other Government agencies, such as the Department of Health, Department of Work and Pensions and the Inland Revenue have also expressed an interest in the potential benefits of a comprehensive passenger movement record.

<a name="stpa_63">The benefits of introducing a system for reconciling a passenger&#039;s departure from the UK against his/her arrival works only with a fully integrated comprehensive system covering all passengers and routes (including air, sea and rail). Such a system is planned as part of the full e-Borders solution. It is not intended to issue identity cards to failed asylum seekers. However, by reducing the opportunity for failed asylum seekers to work illegally, ID cards will make it less practical to remain in the UK as a failed asylum seeker.

<p><a name="st_103"><a name="50317w12.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Charles Clarke: </b> 
 The probability that an offender will be reconvicted is strongly associated with a number of factors such as age and previous criminal history. It is not appropriate to compare reconviction rates over time as allowances need to be made for any change in the characteristics of offenders being given community-based sentences. For instance, if young offenders were proportionally more numerous in some years than they were in others, we would predict an increase in the actual rate as younger offenders are more likely to be reconvicted.

<a name="50317w12.html_para3">
Home Office Online Report 59/04 controlled for such changes in characteristics, and also excluded the impact of more rigorous enforcement of breaches by the Probation Service. It found that, when compared to the reconviction rate that is predicted given their characteristics, there was a reduction of 2 per cent. in the reconviction rate between 1997 and 2001 for adult offenders given community sentences, although this reduction was not statistically significant

In addition the independent Advisory Panel on Country Information provides rigorous external scrutiny of country information material produced by the Home Office and makes recommendations to help ensure that it is of the highest quality. The Advisory Panel rightly considered it essential that the Home Office&#039;s country information material should not only be objective in fact, but should also be perceived as being objective and have the confidence of all its users.

 Assessments on the impact of the Emissions Trading Scheme should be treated with caution. The impact on electricity prices is difficult to assess and is dependent on the carbon price, so for example at a carbon price of &#8364;5 per tonne of carbon dioxide the Department estimates that electricity prices to industry might increase by around 6 per cent. and prices to the domestic consumer by around 3 per cent.

<p><a name="st_158"><a name="50317w19.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Mike O&#039;Brien: </b> 
 The high spot gas prices at the end of February and beginning of March appear to have been caused by high demand and market concerns over supply tightness during cold weather across Europe. There were also technical problems reducing supplies from the North Sea and issues around the levels in short and medium term storage. Temperatures have now returned to at or above the seasonal average, and supply concerns have lessened. Spot prices have reduced accordingly, and we still have supplies in storage to meet another cold snap. The impact on manufacturing companies will vary extensively and depend on a variety of factors, including how much gas individual companies use and the exposure of a particular company to the spot price.

Notes:<br>

1. All figures are estimates and are taken from the Family Resources Survey (FRS). 2002&#150;03 is the latest year for which data is available.<br>

2. Questions on assets are a sensitive part of the FRS questionnaire and have relatively low level of response. Evidence suggests some under reporting of capital by respondents.<br>





3. A benefit unit is a single adult or couple living as married and any dependent children.<br>

4. The estimates are based on sample counts that have been adjusted for non-response using multi-purpose grossing factors which align the FRS to Government Office Region populations by age and sex. Estimates are subject to sampling error and remaining response bias.<br>

Notes:<br>

1. The main operation is the first recorded operation in the hospital episode statistics (HES) data set and is usually the most resource intensive procedure performed during the episode. It is appropriate to use main operation when looking at admission details, e.g. time waited, but the figures for all operations count of episodes&quot; give a more complete count of episodes with an operation. Cataracts operations defined as 071,072,074,075 (OPCS4 Procedure).<br>

2. A finished in-year admission is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider, excluding admissions beginning before 1 April at the start of the data-year. Please note that admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>

3. Time waited statistics from HES are not the same as the published waiting list statistics. HES provides counts and time waited for all patients admitted to hospital within a given period, whereas the published waiting list statistics count those waiting for treatment on a specific date and how long they have been on the waiting list. Also, HES calculates the time waited as the difference between the admission and decision to admit dates. Unlike published waiting list statistics, this is not adjusted for self-deferrals or periods of medical/social suspension.<br>

<p><a name="st_242"><a name="50317w28.html_spnew0"><b> Dr. Howells: </b> 
 We did not abolish the project. A private company, UK eUniversities Worldwide (UKeU), was formed to take forward the UK e-University project. It was intended that this should secure equal funding from public and private sector investment. In autumn 2003 the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) commissioned an independent review of the UKeU plans. In the light of changes in the global financial market, the fact that student recruitment had not met planned targets in the first year, and the lack of any immediate prospect of matching private investment, the Board of the HEFCE concluded that the opportunity cost of providing further funds was too high. HEFCE then sought discussions with UKeU on a restructuring of the company&#039;s activities. On hearing of HEFCE&#039;s decision, the UKeU board resigned. The HEFCE Board then decided that future HEFCE funding should be used to support the development of e-learning in universities and colleges themselves, placing emphasis on public good objectives.
