The line of the route and spreading room is not fixed permanently and the Bill enables Natural England to review these and propose changes to the Secretary of State (subject to the same system of consultation and representations as the original proposals) at a later date. Certain types of land are excepted from the right of access. The categories of excepted land are set out in Schedule 1 to the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 and they include buildings and their curtilage and land used for the purposes of a statutory undertaking. Land can become excepted from the right of access at any time if some change or development occurs so that it falls into one of the excepted land categories in Schedule 1. Where development is carried out under the General (Permitted Development) Order 1995, the land will be excepted if it falls into an excepted land category. Public rights of way are governed by a separate and different legal framework.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Justice pursuant to the answer of 9 February 2009, <i> Official Report,</i> column 1548W, on shoplifting: fixed penalties, what length of time should have passed before a previous shoplifting offence should be taken into account when considering whether to issue a second penalty notice; and whether the ability of the offender to pay is taken into account in deciding whether to issue a second notice.

 Further to the reply given on 9 February, the guidance is designed to help with the exercise of a police officer's discretion in issuing a penalty notice for disorder. No specific time period is set after which a further PND may be issued, but the guidance to forces makes clear that it will not be appropriate to do so where there has been another shoplifting offence in the recent past.</p>

 In order to set a benchmark for carbon emissions reduction, DCMS calculated a carbon footprint for the Department; the Royal Parks Agency and 16 non-departmental public bodies in 2008. Progress is being monitored by individual organisations and will be followed up by DCMS after March 2010 once an appreciable amount of data is available. Specific operational examples of reduction carried out by DCMS are the replacement of existing gas boilers with more energy efficient models and the installation of improved energy efficient light fittings, variable speed drives (systems for controlling the rotational speed of an alternating current electric motor) and air handling units. Our sponsored bodies are making similar adjustments to their operational procedures.

1. These inflows are consistent with the Treasury unemployment assumption. As such they do not represent an official Government forecast of inflows into jobseeker&#146;s allowance.<br>
2. Total inflow figures give financial year totals, as the claimant count assumption quoted in the pre-Budget report is also on this basis. They are the sum of inflows from April to March, that is, the figure labelled 2008-09 represents the total inflows from April 2008 to March 2009.<br>
3. Inflow figures as a result of the lone parent migration and work capability assessment are on a quarterly basis. They are the sum of inflows over the three months in a quarter, that is, the figure labelled April 2009 represents the total inflows in February, March, and April of 2009.<br>
4. The figures are based on the assumption that over the next few years jobseeker&#146;s allowance claimants will flow off benefit at a lower rate than today.<br>
5. Figures are rounded to the nearest thousand (and therefore are rounded to zero if less than 500).<br>
6. All figures relate to claimants in Great Britain.<br>

 The formula for calculating the amount of notional income assumed from capital in pension credit, known as tariff income, is not intended to represent any rate of return that could be obtained from investing capital.

<i> [holding answer 5 March 2009]:</i> No. For the purposes of the Pension Protection Fund, an insolvency event occurs if it is an event as described within the Pensions Act 2004. Section 121 of that Act sets out when an insolvency event occurs in relation to an individual, a company or a partnership. For a company, an insolvency event may, for example, occur when an administrative receiver is appointed or the company enters administration under the provisions of the Insolvency Act 1986.

The programme saw a reduction of 51 per cent. in firearms-related injuries and a 27 per cent. drop in all recorded firearm offences across the four TGAP areas.

The strategy framework aims to; intervene early to prevent offending, take action to reduce opportunity through situational crime prevention, and ensure that there is robust enforcement and action to reduce re-offending. These are all applicable to both urban and rural settings. The strategy, which has been built upon by the Policing Green Paper and measures in the Police and Crime Reduction Bill, placed real emphasis on local flexibility to tackle local priorities to allow local partners to tailor their response to reflect local need (where issues arising from an urban or rural setting might occur).</p>

The NFRC will also equip law enforcement agencies with a powerful intelligence tool and help form the basis of better prevention advice and alerts to fraud threats for business and the public.</p>

 The Local e-Government Programme ended in April 2006 and recent steps are designed to build upon the e-government infrastructure that is now place across England to help transform local services to better meet citizens' needs and expectations. This is in line with commitments in the 'Communities in Control' White Paper and the cross-cutting Service Transformation Agreement published in October 2007. For example, as part of service transformation activity, Communities and Local Government is currently supporting the sector through its Efficiency and Transformation Capital Fund to develop second generation local authority websites which embrace Web 2.0 features such as social networking and information sharing.</p>

Comprehensive family planning includes the provision of reproductive health services and the provision of services to prevent unsafe abortion. It is therefore not possible to disaggregate these figures.</p>

We will also provide &#163;100 million between 2008-09 to 2012-13 to support UNFPA&#146;s Global Programme for Reproductive Health Commodity Security (GPRHCS).</p>

This is because DFID has a number of funding channels for country programmes including budgetary support for health systems, direct government budgetary support and multilateral funding which may have as a sub-component the provision of family planning commodities and services contracted to MSI.</p>

 The objective of the Department for International Development&#146;s (DFID) support for the first phase of reconstruction, known as &#145;early recovery&#146;, is to help the most vulnerable people in Gaza rebuild their lives. We are currently assessing the best channels for such support. Options include assistance through the UN, the World Bank, the European Commission and non-governmental organisations. Our funding will help ensure delivery of basic services. As a first step, there is a need for large scale removal of rubble across Gaza. We have therefore allocated &#163;443,000 to the UN Mine Action Service (UNMAS) to clear unexploded ordnance from these sites.</p>

The Food and Drugs Administration concluded that no causal relationship could be established and that serious bacterial infections may occur with all types of abortion, whether spontaneous, surgical or medical. Similar cases of fatalities had not been observed in the UK or Europe. No new safety concerns were identified and no action considered necessary. We are also aware that the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists reviewed the clinical use of mifepristone in order to update their September 2004 guideline on &#145;The Care of Women Requesting Induced Abortion&#146;. This guideline recommends pre-abortion management for all types of abortion which includes infection screening and prophylaxis.</p>

<i> Assignment of Episodes to Years:</i><br>
Years are assigned by the end of the first period of care in a patient&#146;s hospital stay<br>
<i> Finished admission episodes:</i><br>
A finished admission episode is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider.<br>
Admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>
<i> Cause Code&#151;Blunt object, Sharp object and Gunshot Wounds:</i><br>
The cause code is a supplementary code that indicates the nature of any external cause of injury, poisoning or other adverse effects.<br>
HES has used the following ICD-10 external cause codes when referring to gunshot wounds and assault by sharp and blunt objects.<br>
<i> Blunt Object:</i><br>
Y00&#151;Assault by blunt object<br>
<i> Sharp Object:</i><br>
X99&#151;Assault by sharp object<br>
<i> Gunshot wound:</i><br>
W32.&#151;Handgun discharge<br>
W33.&#151;Rifle, shotgun and larger firearm discharge<br>
W34.&#151;Discharge from other and unspecified firearms<br>
X72.&#151;Intentional self-harm by handgun discharge<br>
X73.&#151;Intentional self-harm by rifle, shotgun and larger firearm discharge<br>
X74.&#151;Intentional self-harm by other and unspecified firearm discharge<br>
X93.&#151;Assault by handgun discharge<br>
X94.&#151;Assault by rifle, shotgun and larger firearm discharge<br>
X95.&#151;Assault by other and unspecified firearm discharge<br>
Y22.&#151;Handgun discharge, undetermined intent<br>
Y23.&#151;Rifle, shotgun and larger firearm discharge, undetermined intent<br>
Y24.&#151;Other and unspecified firearm discharge, undetermined intent<br>
Y35.0 Legal intervention involving firearm discharge<br>
Y36.4 War operations involving firearm discharge and other forms of conventional warfare<br>
<i> Data Quality:</i><br>
Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) are compiled from data sent by over 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England. The NHS information centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br>
<i> Assessing growth through time:</i><br>
HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. During the years that these records have been collected by the NHS there have been ongoing improvements in quality and coverage. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series.<br>
Some of the increase in figures for later years (particularly 2006-07 onwards) may be due to the improvement in the coverage of independent sector activity.<br>
Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example, a number of procedures may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and may no longer be accounted for in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.<br>
<i> Ungrossed Data:</i><br>
Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (ie the data are ungrossed).<br>

A finished admission episode is the first period of inpatient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. Finished admission episodes are counted against the year in which the admission episode finishes. Admissions do not represent the number of inpatients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>

The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 20 (14 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and seven prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data set and provides the main reason why the patient was admitted to hospital.<br>

 The national patient safety agency patient safety alert &#145;Clean Hands Save Lives&#146; issued in September 2008 (which has been placed in the Library) provides guidance for the national health service, and explains the benefit of using alcohol handrubs at the point of care. It states:</p>

 The Department has not allocated a specific budget for national health service apprenticeships. NHS organisations use their existing sources of income to cover any training and employment costs. Organisations in all sectors of the economy can access external sources of funding for apprenticeships, including funding from the Learning and Skills Council, but no data are held centrally on the external funding sources. The funding arrangements for future years are under review.</p>

Net current expenditure excludes income from client contributions and income items which count as expenditure from elsewhere in the public sector, such as contributions from primary care trusts.<br>
Residential and nursing care includes traditional residential and nursing care homes as well as supported and other accommodation. Supported and other accommodation includes other forms of registered accommodation where clients receive an element of both board and personal care, unstaffed (group) homes and adult placements/fostering.<br>
Domiciliary care has been defined as services helping the client to live at home, including direct payments, home care, day care, equipment and adaptations, meals and other non residential services. It also includes expenditure funded from the Supporting People grant that councils have classified as social services expenditure rather than housing expenditure.<br>
The information provided is derived from data collected annually on social services expenditure from CASSRs on the form PSS EX1. This collection has been the responsibility of the Information Centre since April 2005. Prior to this date, data was collected by the Department of Health.<br>
From the 2000-01 financial year, the PSS EX1 replaced both the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy Actuals return, which was discontinued after 1999-2000, and the detailed analysis previously collected by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister on the R03 expenditure return (this was reduced to a summary return with effect from 2000-01).<br>

 Since its creation on 3 October 2008, there is no record of Ministers in DECC having received representations from Lords Moonie, Snape or Taylor of Blackburn. In the same period, DECC has received one letter and three e-mails from Lord Truscott or his office, and sent one e-mail in reply concerning an invitation to me to address a meeting of members of the Royal United Services Institute on UK energy security issues.

 The Government are supporting a wide range of measures to stimulate the development of a portfolio of energy technologies, including renewables such as wind; wave and tidal; microgeneration and photovoltaics; and bioenergy. Public sector spending on energy technology research, development and demonstration was around &#163;151 million in 2007-08, of which some &#163;81 million was spent on renewables.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_768"><a name="90310w0046.htm_para0"><a name="0903115002281">The Government are also providing the market mechanisms and incentives to deploy these technologies. The Renewables Obligation (RO) currently provides all technologies with the same level of support. However, under reforms, to take effect&#151;subject to parliamentary approval&#151;on 1 April 2009, we are introducing measures to allow banding of the RO. This will provide the generation industry with greater incentive to develop and deploy those technologies which are currently further from commercial deployment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_769"><a name="90310w0046.htm_para1"><a name="0903115002282">We will also be introducing Feed-in-Tariffs (FITs) for small scale, low carbon electricity generation and a Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) using powers bought in through the Energy Act 2008 to provide financial assistance to organisations installing renewable and low carbon energy generating technologies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_770"><a name="90310w0046.htm_para2"><a name="0903115002283">In addition my Department will be launching an Office for Renewable Energy Deployment (ORED).
