<P>
<P>
<a name="90310w01.htm_wqn4"><B> Mr. Steinberg: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence (1) what plans he has to introduce testing for British Gulf War veterans using protocols recommended by Dr. Asaf Durakovic;  [74716]
<P>
<UL>(2) what discussions his Department has held with Dr. Asaf Durakovic; and if he will make a statement.  [74715]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90310w01.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson: </B> 
 Dr. Asaf Durakovic is Clinical Professor of Nuclear Medicine at Georgetown University, Washington DC. He discussed his current work in general terms with MOD officials at a meeting last month, when he explained that, in conjunction with others, he is carrying out a study into uranium levels amongst veterans of the 1990-91 Gulf conflict, in which a small number of UK Gulf veterans are participating. Our understanding is that Dr. Durakovic and his colleagues plan to publish their findings later this year: hence we look forward to seeing full details of the methodology they are using and the results obtained in due course.
<P>

<a name="90310w01.htm_para2">MOD continues to advise UK Gulf veterans who are concerned that their health has been adversely affected by service during the Gulf conflict, including by possible exposure to depleted uranium (DU), that they are entitled to seek a referral to the Gulf veterans' Medical Assessment Programme (MAP) for a full medical assessment. Any tests

which are considered clinically appropriate by the examining MAP physician, including those to detect the presence of uranium, will be arranged.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90310w01.htm_wqn5"><B> Mr. Davidson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence (1) if the Auxiliary Oiler contract is <i>(a)</i> on schedule and <i>(b)</i> proceeding to budget; and if he will make a statement;  [75125]
<P>
<UL>(2) what <i>(a)</i> detailed and <i>(b)</i> major changes his Department has sought to make to the design of the ships under the Auxiliary Oiler contract; what was the cost to his Department of such changes and what measures have been taken to ensure that costs do not increase on the contract; and if he will make a statement;  [75123]
<P>
(3) what stage the work on the Auxiliary Oiler contract has reached for <i>(a)</i> the first and <i>(b)</i> the second ship; and if he will make a statement.  [75124]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90310w01.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 Progress continues on the design, material procurement and construction of the two ships. Construction of the central section of the first ship, comprising four major blocks, is nearing completion. For the second ship, fabrication of units for the first major block has recently started. A small number of detailed design changes have been agreed, costing the MOD around &#163;0.5 million, mostly related to "Spend to Save" programmes to achieve reduction in through life operating costs. None of these changes affects the delivery schedule and the project remains within budget. The prime contractor is currently reviewing its overall work programme. The outcome of this review will be discussed with MOD officials shortly. It is not possible to state at this stage the extent to which this might result in delay to the deliver of the ships, although some slippage is anticipated.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90310w01.htm_wqn6"><B> Mr. Key: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence (1) in what ways he will reduce the burden of training on individual army units in the training cycle;  [75275]
<P>
<UL>(2) what plans he has to achieve a more balanced operational and training cycle for the United Kingdom's deployable divisions in the UK and in Germany.  [75273]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90310w01.htm_spnew6"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson: </B> 
 As part of the Strategic Defence Review, we plan to introduce by 2001 a new formation readiness cycle in which each deployable brigade will carry out a three year cycle with formation-level training, commitments and other tasks. This new cycle will enable units to achieve required readiness states and to balance training requirements with operational commitments. It will be made possible by the reorganisation of army formations, including creation of a new mechanised brigade, into a more balanced force structure of two deployable divisions, one armoured and one mechanised, and will as a result help to reduce overstretch and the burden of training on individual units in the cycle.

<P>
<a name="90310w01.htm_wqn7"><B> Mr. Hancock: </B>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90310w01.htm_spnew7"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 Vectra Technologies supply specialist safety, engineering and project management services. It is an approved Defence contractor, providing the Royal HM Naval Base Clyde with expert consultancy support in the production of safety cases for nuclear support services, in the development of nuclear safety management systems, and on management system audits.
<P>

<a name="90310w01.htm_para3">Vectra Technologies has current experience in working for the MOD on nuclear submarines at HM Naval Base Devonport, where they have a contract for the deep cleaning of reactor compartments and for the provision of Health Physics Monitors. The company also provided Health Physics Supervisors and Monitors at the HM Naval Base Clyde between November 1992 and June 1997.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90310w02.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. George Robertson: </B> 
 NATO remains ready to lead an international force in Kosovo to help implement an interim political agreement. Should such a force be required, it must be ready to go into Kosovo as quickly as possible after an agreement. This means that we must have forces ready in the region.
<P>

<a name="90310w02.htm_para0">The Government announced on 22 February 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column 3, the deployment of some 2,225 personnel of 4 Armoured Brigade Headquarters and the Lead Armoured Battle Group to Greece and Macedonia, and enablers for the headquarters of Allied Command Europe Rapid Reaction Corps (HQ ARRC). On 26 February, the Government announced the deployment of the majority of the remaining equipment and personnel of 4 Armoured Brigade Headquarters and the Lead Armoured Battle Group. Additional engineering and support assets are also being deployed to provide necessary engineering infrastructure support: their deployment was planned as part of the overall force, but has been brought forward to cover a longer than anticipated stay in Macedonia. NATO has now decided to deploy advance elements of the HQ ARRC to manage the build up of NATO forces in Macedonia. The UK is the framework nation for this headquarters.
<P>

<a name="90310w02.htm_para1">Together with national support elements and the British contribution to HQ ARRC, I expect the total number of British personnel in Greece and Macedonia by mid-March to be some 4,800. This figure is consistent with the overall British contribution of some 8,000 which I announced to the House on 11 February 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 565-66. It is a substantial number, and clearly signals our resolution to support the efforts of the international community.

 Responsibility for the delivery of analogue and digital terrestrial television (DTT) services rests with the BBC and Independent Television Commission. The ITC recently received an encouraging report of a study it commissioned into the prospects for increasing DTT coverage. The ITC will soon commence planning for the next phase of DTT transmitter in conjunction with the BBC. The prime objective of this work is further to extend DTT coverage. The Government have made it clear to the ITC and BBC that delivery of regional services is an important element to consider in development of the digital transmission network. The studies are, at this stage, designed to look at general principles and will not focus on the costs of employing digital transmissions to remove regional anomalies.

 The Government do not provide funding directly to the London Tourist Board. It does, however, directly fund the English Tourist Board which has for many years provided funding to the LTB and other regional tourist boards to complement the ETB's role in delivering national and regional programmes for tourism. Also, since 1996-97, a proportion of the Government's grant-in-aid to the BTA has been earmarked to help fund the LTB's Focus London campaign, which promotes London overseas as a major tourist destination and as the gateway to Britain. The funding that the LTB has received from the ETB and the BTA is as follows:

 <i>[holding answer 8 March 1999]:</i> Discussions took place at official level last year on incoming passenger forecasts. My Department's new Tourism Strategy, "Tomorrow's Tourism", makes explicit reference to the Government's work on preparing a UK airports policy looking some 30 years ahead which will reflect our policies on sustainable development and integrated transport.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90310w02.htm_spnew8"><B> Janet Anderson: </B> 
 "Tomorrow's Tourism" makes it clear that, if we are to widen access to tourism, we must first find out from those who do not take holidays what prevents them from doing so. Research into this is currently being carried out by the English Tourist Board. This will help to identify the market potential as well as any special needs which are not currently being met, and the level of training needed, to make sure that tourism businesses are able to cater for all customers.

 I refer the right hon. Member to the answer given by the Prime Minister to the hon. Member for Spelthorne (Mr. Wilshire) on 1 March 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column 531. There have been no instances of members of departmental select committees giving me or the Parliamentary Secretary drafts of select committee reports, or of parts of reports including their conclusions, before publication. Nor, to the best of my knowledge, have there been any occasions on which members of departmental select committees have given such material to civil servants or special advisers in my Department. This excludes embargoed copies of reports issued under House of Commons Standing Orders.
<P>

<a name="90310w03.htm_para0">However, as chair of the Modernisation Committee, I am responsible for drawing up its draft reports and these are also seen by my immediate advisers, that is, members of my private office and one or two officials who advise me on parliamentary matters and one of my special advisers. As a member of the House of Commons Commission, I also see some of the papers of the Domestic Committees; these are also seen by my immediate advisers.
<P>

<a name="90310w03.htm_para1">As chair of the Cabinet Committee on future legislation, I have also been consulted about the possibility of legislation to enact the recommendations of the Joint Committee on Parliamentary Privilege.

 My Department supports a range of programmes which promote education business links--principally, work experience for pupils mentoring programmes and teacher placements to industry. Support for these programmes in the year ahead, made available through Training and Enterprise Councils (TECs), will be &#163;13.5 million. My Department also provides &#163;145,000 support per year to the National Education Business Partnership Network.
<P>

<a name="90310w03.htm_para3">The support that we make available to Education Business Partnerships through TECs has been an important element in the TEC Review which has been under way. I am today announcing some changes to the operation of TECs, arising from the first phase of the TEC Review. These will strengthen partnership and accountability, improve the quality of work-based training and streamline contracting arrangements.

We shall also take into account the forthcoming Moser Report on basic skills, the University for Industry Corporate Plan, the further report of the Skills Task Force and the Social Exclusion Unit report on disaffected 16 to 18-year-olds.
<P>

<a name="90310w03.htm_para5">Drawing on the TEC Review, we will want to examine the local and national arrangements relating to the delivery of lifelong learning, work-force development and skills, excluding higher education.

As we set out in the "Learning Age" Green Paper, our goals are to increase the number of people engaged in learning; promote excellence and quality in its delivery; ensure coherent provision of further education and work-based training; provide support for all young people in making the transition from school to further learning or employment; involve employers in the promotion of lifelong learning; ensure that provision best meets the economy's needs for skills, creativity and innovation; make the most effective use of resources; and meet our National Learning Targets.

 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has set new requirements to improve initial teacher training (ITT). These represent a major step change in the expectations and requirements of new teachers and include:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) new high standards for the award of Qualified Teacher Status introduced for all trainees graduating from May 1998. These ensure that all new teachers have the necessary knowledge, understanding and skills to do their job effectively;</FONT></UL>

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(d) an induction year was introduced by the Teaching and Higher Education 1998 Act. This will give all new teachers, from September 1999, structured support and training to consolidate and extend the skills they gained in initial training. Teachers who fall short of the standards will not be able to be confirmed as members of the profession.</FONT></UL>
<P>

<a name="90310w04.htm_para0">The Teacher Training Agency (TTA) has been asked to support the introduction of the new requirements and has been funded to undertake a range of measures, which include:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) development of exemplification materials to assist in the implementation of the national curriculum for ICT in all subjects and phases, to ensure accurate assessment of trainees against the standards (including video and CD ROM formats) and the requirements in the standards concerned with teaching pupils from ethnic minority groups;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(b) assisting providers to improve the quality of their provision.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(c) mounting conferences for providers to brief them on the new requirements and to assist all new providers in developing course proposals;</FONT></UL>

<a name="90310w04.htm_para1">To support the implementation of the new curriculum for the use of ICT across the curricula the TTA to date has awarded ITT providers with additional funding totalling just over &#163;6 million. A further &#163;1 million was awarded for the implementation of the primary English and maths curricula. Other costs of developing the national curricula and exemplification materials fall within TTA's budget and are not disaggregated.

 We were a major donor in the 1998 crisis. There will be substantial humanitarian needs in Sudan this year and we are prepared to continue to help.

We shall monitor the situation closely in the coming months and, as needs become clearer, we shall respond further as required. We shall continue our dialogue with the UN on improving the effectiveness and efficiency of Operation Lifeline Sudan and will press for progress on the peace process which remains crucial to resolving Sudan's long term problems.

 There has been a continuation of violence in Kosovo, leading to continuing displacement of civilians. In recent weeks, an estimated 9,000 people have been driven from their homes. Fighting north of Pristina has also prevented the return of 15,000 people displaced from around 17 villages.

 Codes of conduct have considerable potential as a tool for protecting labour rights in developing countries. Last year, my department produced a widely circulated report entitled "A review of UK company codes of conduct". The report contained an analysis of the content of UK company's voluntary codes and showed that codes of conduct are being used by a

There is less consensus on the best means of monitoring the effectiveness of codes. We are working to find ways of implementing and monitoring codes in order to assist UK companies work with their suppliers to improve the conditions of workers in poorer countries.

 I met Commissioner Pinheiro and ACP and EU Ministers in Dakar on 8-9 February for the first substantive Ministerial discussion of successor arrangements to the Lome Convention. The meeting made good progress. There was a consensus on the main objectives of the next Convention and, although the ACP were not ready to accept the inclusion of good governance as a new essential element, they agreed to work on reaching a common definition of the concept. There was a large measure of agreement on development strategies, providing support for private sector development and the need to rationalise the existing instruments and improve aid management procedures. Progress was more limited on the future of support for short term fluctuations in earnings from basic products. The EU proposed updated, more flexible and more effective arrangements for helping countries where economic and wider reforms were jeopardised from such fluctuations, but the ACP continue to favour the retention of current arrangements. I participated in the discussion on trade and economic co-operation, the area of greatest divergence between the ACP and EU positions. I put the case for alternatives to the Commission's favoured regional free trade option. This was taken up by the ACP and reflected in the final report.

<a name="90310w06.htm_para0">Following a disaster, most lives are saved by immediate local effort. We are giving priority to building up the disaster response capacity of communities and institutions in disaster-prone poor countries. We also look first to agencies that are well established in the country and have the local knowledge and expertise to deliver assistance most quickly and effectively. It is important that we not only save lives and relieve suffering following a humanitarian crisis but also reduce risks and vulnerability to future crises. Therefore, we are assisting disaster-prone countries to include risk reduction, disaster management and mitigation in their development planning process and supporting community initiatives to reduce their vulnerability to risks. This includes analysing common hazards and their impact on poor people, and assessing the effect of recurrent crises on achieving the targets of sustainable international development.

 The Government are committed to the international development targets, which include halving the proportion of people living in absolute poverty by 2015. For the poorest, most indebted countries, who are similarly committed to poverty eradication, faster and deeper debt relief is required to enable them to invest sufficient resources in poverty reduction programmes to meet these targets. The Chancellor of the Exchequer and I have therefore challenged the international community to increase debt relief and increase aid flows to poor countries. Our objective over the coming months is to get agreement to cancel $50 billion of debt and to increase development assistance to $60 billion by the year 2000.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions when proposals for a directive concerning the regulations for growing and sale of genetically modified crops were first received by his Department from the European Commission; what observations were made by his Department prior to publication of the draft directive and on what evidence these observations were based; on what dates relevant explanatory memoranda were signed by ministers and placed in the Vote Office; and if he will publish the terms of such memoranda in the <i>Official Report</i>.

<a name="90310w09.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 22 February 1999]:</i> The Directive 90/220 on the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms was negotiated in the late 1980s and adopted on 23 April 1990. The Genetically Modified Organisms (Deliberate Release) Regulations 1992 were made under the Environmental Protection Act 1990, and came into force on 1 February 1993.
<P>

<a name="90310w09.htm_para0">The European Commission adopted a Report on the review of Directive 90/220 on 10 December 1996. Following this, the Commission published its proposal for 



<P>
<P><I>10 Mar 1999 : Column: 235</I><P>
the amendment of Directive 90/220 in February 1998. UK Government officials participated in discussions on the draft proposal, prior to its adoption by the Commission, during meetings of the 90/220 Competent Authorities.
<P>

<a name="90310w09.htm_para1">The Competent Authorities for Directive 90/220 submitted written comments on a Commission Working Document in Autumn 1997. These focused on, among other issues, the difficulties in implementing the current directive due to differences between Member States about interpretation and delays by the Commission. These comments were based on experience of operating the directive. The views of interested parties were actively sought throughout this process.
<P>

<a name="90310w09.htm_para2">An Orientation Debate was held in the June 1998 Council of Environment Ministers under the British Presidency of the European Union. Negotiations were subsequently held under the Austrian Presidency and the proposal was further considered by Ministers at the December 1998 Environment Council. The German Presidency has not yet indicated its timetable for discussion of the proposal.
<P>

<a name="90310w09.htm_para3">Explanatory Memorandum 6378/98 covering the Commission's proposal was submitted by the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions on 23 March 1998. EM 6378/98 was considered by the House of Commons European Scrutiny Committee on 29 April 1998. The committee recommended that the document was of political interest and requested further information. The Minister for the Environment responded to the points raised by the Committee in a letter dated 27 November 1997. At their meeting of 9 December 1998, the Committee recommended the proposal for debate in Standing Committee A. The debate has yet to take place, but will be held in good time before any decision is taken in the Council of Ministers.

<a name="90310w09.htm_para4">Since the regulations came into force on 1 February 1993, 153 consents have been issued for the release of genetically modified crops. Details of these consents, including the locations at which they have been released, are on the statutory public register held in the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions.

<a name="90310w09.htm_para5">All applications received by my Department for the release of genetically modified crops, either for research or for marketing, are copied for comment to the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. The statutory Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment which advises the Secretary of State on the safety of GMOs in the environment also advises MAFF Ministers.

<a name="90310w09.htm_para6">The Secretary of State has delegated the inspection and enforcement powers provided under Part VI of the Environment Protection Act 1990 to the Health and Safety Commission and Executive. HSE specialist inspectors visit a proportion of release sites to ensure that the releases are being conducted in accordance to the specifications set out in the consent. Full reports of the inspections are sent to DETR.

 A collision occurred between the United Kingdom registered fishing vessel Seahorse and the Irish registered fishing vessel Exodus in Bantry Bay, Ireland in March 1997. One crew member of the Exodus died. The Marine Accidents Investigation Branch undertook an Inspector's Investigation into the incident. The Inspector's report has not been published but a copy was forwarded to the Irish Maritime Authorities. The collision took place in Irish waters and the Irish Maritime Authorities are undertaking their own investigation into the incident. Their report will be published in due course. Following the incident the master of the Seahorse was successfully prosecuted by the Irish Authorities for a breach of the International Collision Regulations.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90310w09.htm_spnew4"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 My Department has received a number of representations from and on behalf of Catamaran Cruisers Ltd. and the Thames Passenger Services Federation about this matter. London River Services Ltd. (LRSL) has been set up to manage river services operating from the piers currently owned by the Port of London Authority and certain other new piers.
<P>

<a name="90310w09.htm_para8">The Government support LRSL's objectives, which are to:
<P>

<a name="90310w09.htm_para9"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Provide a comprehensive network of high quality river boat services (commuter and leisure) to meet London's river travel needs, having regard to efficiency, economy and safety of operation;

Maximise passenger benefits and usage within the funds available;
<P>
<BR>
Support multi-modal travel facilities;
<P>
<BR>
Develop and improve the infrastructure and information services which support the river network.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="90310w09.htm_para10">In pursuing these objectives within the context of the Government's Thames 2000 initiative, we believe that opportunities will be created for improving and expanding services on the River to the potential benefit of all operators. Neither the Government nor LRS has any wish to undermine existing operators, especially those which deliver a good quality of service and which have invested in new vessels and facilities.
<P>

<a name="90310w09.htm_para11">At the operational level, it is for LRS to determine how best to meet these objectives, having regard both to developing the market for river services and the potential impact on the sustainability of existing operators' services.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will ensure that London River Services does not sell the Thames piers in its ownership.  [75263]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90310w09.htm_spnew5"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 Whilst LT retains the right to dispose of assets that are not required for the purposes of its business, the Government believe that its subsidiary, London River Services Ltd., would not be able to fulfil the objectives it was set up to achieve--and which we fully support--without retaining ownership of the key central London piers. Other assets may be disposed of only with the Secretary of State's consent.
<P>

<a name="90310w09.htm_para12">In due course it is intended that ownership of the piers should pass to Transport for London. One of Transport for London's main transport duties will be to implement the Mayor's integrated transport strategy. In drawing up that strategy the Mayor will be under a duty to have regard to the desirability of encouraging the use of the River Thames, in particular for the provision of passenger transport services and for the transport of freight.

[76017]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90310w10.htm_spnew7"><B> Ms Armstrong: </B> 
 In October, my Department issued a consultation paper on creating a single housing allocation for capital investment to local authorities, which followed up proposals contained in the Deputy Prime Minister's statement on housing and regeneration policy in July 1998. A single capital allocation for housing is part of the Government's agenda for modernising local government finance. It aims to give local authorities more discretion in deciding their capital programme for housing. The proposal will have some impact on distribution to authorities with high levels of capital receipts relative to need. Such authorities will be expected to make a greater contribution to capital investment in housing in their area from these resources. Authorities with greater need will receive more resources.
<P>

<a name="90310w10.htm_para3">Most respondents to the consultation paper welcomed the main principle of our proposals. Some expressed concerns about the effect on the distribution of resources between local authorities, the possible impact on private sector renewal activity, and the timing of the change. I have given careful consideration to all these issues, but I have concluded that we should proceed as planned with the introduction of a single housing capital allocation in 2000-01. The guidance to be issued to local authorities for this year's Housing Investment Programme will cover the detailed implementation of the single pot. It will also

Imports of Big-leaf mahogany therefore require an export permit or certificate issued by the country of origin before they can enter the EU. In addition, the importer has to provide a notification form. By this close monitoring, the EU aims to ensure that international trade remains at sustainable levels.

 Following the Comprehensive Spending Review, my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister set out details of the New Deal for Regeneration in his Housing and Regeneration Policy statement on 22 July 1998, which will receive over &#163;3 billion over the next three years. This included a reshaped Single Regeneration Budget (SRB) with about 80 per cent. of new SRB resources targeted on the most deprived areas, based on the 1998 Index of Local Deprivation. SRB resources may contribute to schemes also supported by European funding, including Structural Funds. Also there is a new programme, the New Deal for Communities, which combats social exclusion through focused and intensive neighbourhood renewal, in the most deprived neighbourhoods.

<P>
<a name="90310w13.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 Of the tribunals for which the Lord Chancellor has ministerial responsibility, only three include a lay membership. They are lay members of the Immigration Appeal Tribunal; service and medical members of the Pensions Appeal Tribunal; and surveyor members of the Lands Tribunal. Under the terms of the Judicial Pensions and Retirement Act 1993, lay members appointed to each of these tribunals on or after 31 March 1995 shall vacate office when they attain the age of 70. However, the Judicial Pensions and Retirement Act contains provisions which allows the Lord Chancellor, in exceptional circumstances, to authorise continuance in office up to the age of 75 and transitional provisions which preserve the pre-existing compulsory retirement age of the end of year of service in which they reach 72 for those already serving on 31 March 1995.

1. Figures are given to the nearest 10,000 pensioner benefit units, although they are not necessarily accurate to that degree. Figures of less than 5,000 pensioners are denoted by '*'.<P>

2. Figures may not sum to row or column totals due to rounding.<P>

3. Figures should be treated with caution since taxpaying status is not directly measured by the Family Resources Survey, but has been imputed using a model based on policies announced up to and including the 1998 budget statement.<P>

4. Pensioner benefit units are defined as single people and couples (married or cohabiting) where at least one partner is aged over 59. Couples are allocated to age bands according to the age of the older partner.<P>

5. Taxpaying pensioner benefit units are defined as those where at least one individual in the benefit unit is modelled as liable to income tax.<P>

1. "Local authority tenants" were defined as those households where the landlord was either a local authority/council, a New Town development or Scottish Homes and where the property did not go with the job of anyone in the household. "Other social tenants" was defined as those households where the landlord was either a Housing Association, a co-operative or a charitable trust and where the property did not go with the job of anyone in the household. "Private renters" were defined as those households where the landlord was an employer, friend or relative of a household member, or another private landlord or organisation. "Owner occupiers" were identified as those households that were either owned outright, being bought with the help of a mortgage or loan, or were part rented and part mortgaged.<P>

2. "Households with families and dependant children" were defined as those households where there was at least one couple or lone parent with at least one dependant child. Pensioner couples with any dependant children were also included in this definition.<P>

3. Absolute values are rounded to the nearest ten thousand. Percentages are rounded to the nearest integer.<P>

4. Estimates are subject to sampling error and to variability in non-response.<P>

 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has held no discussions about extending bilateral Social Security agreements to cover uprating of UK State Pensions paid to pensioners living overseas. Bilateral agreements can be the means of providing annual increases of Retirement Pension, but that is not their primary purpose. An agreement is not strictly necessary to allow payment of pension increases, as that could be achieved through changing UK domestic legislation.

 The Crown Prosecution Service reviews and prosecutes all cases in accordance with the principles set out in the Code for Crown Prosecutors, issued under section 10 of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985. The provisions of the Code are set out in the Director of Public Prosecution's Annual Report, copies of which are in the Library of the House. The Code, first published in 1986, was subsequently revised in 1992 and again in 1994. The 1994 edition of the Code simplifies the language of the Code; it clarifies the evidential criterion and the public interest factors in favour of a prosecution.
<P>

<a name="90310w15.htm_para0">The general principles set out in the Code for Crown Prosecutors are supported by internal CPS guidance. The internal guidance is not presently in the public domain. In any event, tracing its development over the period covered by the question would not be practical and would involve a disproportionate cost.

 <i>[holding answer 9 March 1999]:</i> No members of task forces or policy reviews established since 1 May 1997 were recruited by way of public advertisement. Most task forces and reviews are short- term bodies established to give thorough consideration to important and difficult issues. External members are invited to sit on some task forces and reviews because they are able to contribute specific experience and expertise. In such cases, public advertising would be inappropriate and disproportionate. Since 1 October 1998, appointments to those task forces which qualify for classification as advisory non-departmental public bodies have come within the remit of the Commissioner for Public Appointments.

 Approval of genetically modified foodstuffs for importation into the EU is governed by EU legislation, specifically the Novel Foods Regulation (258/97/EC).

measures are based on scientific principles and are not maintained without sufficient scientific evidence. This agreement formed part of the WTO Agreement which concluded the Uruguay round of multilateral trade negotiations on 15 December 1993. The WTO Agreement was negotiated by the European Commission in consultation with EC member states under the provisions of the EC Treaties. The Agreement was signed on behalf of the United Kingdom by Mr. Tim Sainsbury in Marrakesh on 15 April 1994. Under the Ponsonby rule, the Agreement was laid before Parliament in May 1994 and debated on 14 June 1994, <i>Official Report,</i> columns 521-601. The United Kingdom's instrument of Ratification to the WTO Agreement was deposited with the GATT Legal Adviser on 30 December 1994. For the EC, the WTO Agreement was accepted by means of a Council decision and assent given by the European Parliament. The Agreement entered into force on 1 January 1995. The main WTO Agreement was published as Treaty Series No. 57 of 1996 (Cm 3277), and the Agreement on Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures as No. 54 of 1996 (Cm 3275).

 I am not aware of any manufacturers providing medical advice on action to be taken in the event of toys being ingested. All toys supplied in the UK--no matter how they are packaged--must meet the safety requirements of the Toys (Safety) Regulations 1995 which implement harmonised European requirements. Research undertaken by DTI has established that the main causes of choking involving children under three years of age are sweets, coins and food objects--none of which is required to be accompanied by medical advice.

After allowing for the influence of pseudo-reconvictions (effectively a four percentage point adjustment in favour of community penalties) the difference between reconviction rates for those commencing orders or discharged from prison in 1994 was, using unrounded percentages, 0.1 percentage points in favour of custody. This suggests there is currently no discernible difference between reconviction rates for custody and community penalties. The difference for the 1995 samples indicates a similar picture with a difference in favour of custody of one percentage point after the adjustment for predicted rates and pseudo-reconvictions had been made.

 I welcome the Audit Commission report; it provides a valuable analysis of progress to date and we are studying carefully the recommendations which it contains. We have worked closely with the Audit Commission and other key partners in developing the local crime and disorder reduction partnerships. We intend to continue that co-operation so as to ensure that the initiative is effective.

This disclosure must not, of course, compromise the inquest or any criminal proceeding or infringe the legal rights of witnesses. Each case will be reviewed in accordance with the code.

 The report has been received by the director of dispersal prisons, who commissioned it.

<P>
<a name="90310w20.htm_spnew7"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 The Prisons Ombudsman meets Home Office Ministers on a regular basis to discuss a range of issues. An internal Home Office review, which reported in November 1998, considered whether the Prisons Ombudsman's terms of reference should be extended to include the investigation of complaints relating to deaths in prison custody. The report recommended that a decision on this issue should be deferred until the Prison Service had established its policy on the disclosure of its internal investigation reports.
<P>

<a name="90310w20.htm_para3">A protocol allowing pre-inquest disclosure of investigation reports to properly interested parties is to be introduced on 1 April. We intend to reconsider whether the Prisons Ombudsman's remit should include deaths in custody once the impact of this protocol has been properly assessed.

[75889]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90310w20.htm_spnew8"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 The Prison Service has accepted the criticisms made by the Parliamentary Commissioner (Reports C993/97 and A27/99). In his reports, the Commissioner acknowledges the improvements in procedures which were made in the light of the three tragic deaths following restraint which occurred in 1995. Good progress has been made both locally and nationally by the Prison Service in improving control and restraint procedures, and improvements have been made at Belmarsh. I wish to acknowledge the contribution which the Parliamentary Commissioner's investigation and report has made to these.
<P>

 My right hon. Friend the Member for Gateshead, East and Washington, West (Ms Quin), the then Minister with responsibility for prisons and probation, met with the hon. Members for Erith and Thamesmead and for Bristol, East (Ms Corston) on 21 July 1998 to discuss their concerns about the deaths of Kenneth Severin, Alton Manning and Dennis Stevens. Since that meeting, the Prison Service has continued to work on a range of measures to improve control and restraint training, investigations into deaths in prison custody and the handling of relatives following a death.
<P>

<a name="90310w20.htm_para5">A full review of policy on control and restraint procedures was carried out last year. A revised training syllabus for basic training is nearing completion which reinforces instructions that officers will release prisoners from restraint holds as quickly as possible. Improved monitoring and auditing of the use of force will be adopted by the introduction of a new Prison Service Order on the use of force, which is shortly to be issued.
<P>

<a name="90310w20.htm_para6">In the autumn of last year, a Prison Service instruction was issued reinforcing standardised procedures to be adopted in investigations into deaths in custody. At the same time, a Prison Service Order was issued outlining guidance and good practice in the sensitive handling of bereaved relatives during the traumatic aftermath of a death in custody. This work will continue with moves towards greater openness in pre-inquest disclosure of information to families from 1 April this year.
<P>

<a name="90310w20.htm_para7">Following the recent decision by the Crown Prosecution Service that no charges should be laid in connection with the death of Mr. Alton Manning at Blakenhurst in 1995, the Prison Service has commissioned an investigation as to the reinstatement or revocation of the certification of the prison custody officers involved.
<P>

<a name="90310w20.htm_para8">The death of Mr. Dennis Stevens at Dartmoor in 1995 is under investigation by the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration following a complaint by Inquest on behalf of the family.

 <i>[holding answer 8 March 1999]:</i> The Independent Commission for Police Complaints currently has 17 <sup>1</sup>  members of staff and a full time Chairman and deputy Chairman and five part time members. The RUC's Complaints and Discipline Department has 115 <sup>2</sup>  staff. The Government's initial estimate, produced for the purpose of advertising the post of Police Ombudsman, is a staff of about 60.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. Figures are rounded to nearest ten.<P>

2. Figures exclude learners and agency staff.<P>

3. Data for years prior to 1982 relate to December, while those for subsequent years are staff in post on September 30.<P>

4. The number of full-time hours was reduced from 40 to 37.5 during 1980 and the 37.5 hour week became mandatory on 31 March 1981. This means that figures for whole time equivalents before 1980 are not directly comparable with those for subsequent years.<P>

5. Due to a change in classification in 1995 for collecting data, from pay scale to occupation code, 1995, 1996 and 1997 figures are non-comparable with earlier years.<P>

6. From 1995, figures for qualified midwives include midwives teaching midwifery and managers in the maternity services area of work. Managers may be a nurse, midwife or health visitor who has overall responsibility for budgets, manpower or assets, or who is held accountable for a significant area of work, and who has little or no direct clinical involvement.<P>

 No. We gave careful thought to the legislative option, but concluded that voluntary commitments by the industry were more likely to be implemented effectively and with public support. The White Paper "Smoking Kills" includes a new charter on smoking in public places, agreed by the hospitality industry. The results will be monitored and we will consider the need for any further action in the light of progress.

 The Departmental medical and dental work force census shows about a 100 hospital medical staff in forensic psychiatry training grades in England at 30 September 1997. The Specialty Workforce Advisory Group advises Ministers on the numbers needed in higher specialist training in forensic psychiatry so as to provide fully-trained doctors to fill consultant posts in the future. In estimating likely future requirements for higher specialist trainees, it seeks views from the National Health Service on local pressures and service developments and consults the medical profession.

some cases the cause of death may be unclear or wrongly attributed. Currently, local Area Child Protection Committees are required to review cases which involve an incident leading to the death of a child where child abuse is confirmed or suspected, or a child protection issue arises which is likely to be of major public concern arises. Local authorities are required to inform the Department or the Welsh Office (as appropriate) immediately they become aware of any such case. We are improving the consistency and reliability of information provided through this route by revising the child protection guidance "Working Together Under The Children Act 1989--A guide to arrangements for inter-agency co-operation for the protection of children from abuse" and associated measures.

<a name="90310w27.htm_wqn2"><B> Mr. Drew: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what research he intends to conduct into cattle TB during 1999-2000.  [76408]




<P>
<P><I>10 Mar 1999 : Column: 301</I><P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90310w27.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The Krebs review concluded that there is no single solution to the problem of TB in cattle. It made a number of recommendations designed to provide a firm scientific basis for future policy. Many of the recommendations were proposals for further research, and it was these that the Government acted on first. We completely reviewed our TB research programme, and on 20 April last year published a document setting out new research requirements for the year beginning on 1 April 1999. Researchers wishing to participate were invited to submit bids by 3 July. 36 bids were received and were appraised by a panel of internal and external experts from Britain and overseas. A subsequent notice invited bids to analyse TB risk factors. Successful bidders were informed last autumn, and we have since been engaged in negotiations. We hope to sign research contracts shortly.
<P>

<a name="90310w27.htm_para1">The new research programme will comprise 19 separate projects and will cost around &#163;3.4 million in 1999/2000, although most of the projects will be carried forward into future years. Many of the projects are integrated into the badger culling trial and epidemiological survey, which take forward other recommendations in the Krebs report and will yield extensive information for analysis.
<P>

<a name="90310w27.htm_para2">There are three main strands to the new programme.
<P>

<a name="90310w27.htm_para3">First, there is work to develop improved control strategies. Although we shall also spend &#163;55,000 on examining the possibility of using bacteriophages to control <i>Mycobacterium bovis</i> in the environment, the most important work here is on vaccine development. This will be undertaken at the Institute of Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency, with a number of sub-contractors including experts in New Zealand, and will cost &#163;1.4 million. If successful this will also lead to the development of a better test to diagnose TB in live badgers.
<P>

<a name="90310w27.htm_para4">Although improved TB vaccines have eluded researchers for many years, recent advances in molecular biology offer new hopes for success. The genome sequencing project which we are co-funding with the Wellcome Trust is a particular example. This work will be taking place at the frontiers of scientific knowledge. It is important that the various projects contributing to the vaccine programme are taken forward together, and that full account is taken of parallel work in other countries and in human medicine. We have therefore appointed Dr. Jo Colston, the Head of Mycobacterial Research at the National Institute for Medical Research, Mill Hill, as external consultant for this programme.
<P>

<a name="90310w27.htm_para5">Secondly, there is work to improve our understanding of herd breakdowns. We are reanalysing the information in our existing databases on TB risk factors. We shall develop new transmission models and examine a wide range of possible transmission and risk factors, including a variety of possible wildlife reservoirs of infection other than badgers. We shall be looking at better ways of detecting Mycobacterium bovis in clinical and environmental samples. We shall be developing molecular fingerprinting techniques to categorise Mycobacterium bovis strains more precisely. This work, which will cost &#163;1.5 million in total, will be undertaken in a variety of research institutions in Great Britain, and will also draw in expertise from Northern Ireland, the Netherlands and New Zealand.




<P>
<P><I>10 Mar 1999 : Column: 302</I><P>

<P>

<a name="90310w27.htm_para6">Thirdly, we need to examine the role of badgers in TB more closely. We shall be spending &#163;475,000 on work estimating badger numbers, and understanding the role of badgers in disease transmission.
<P>

<a name="90310w27.htm_para7">Details of the projects, contractors and costs are being placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="90310w27.htm_para8">Although this programme is extensive and will provide answers to many of the questions identified by the Krebs and Bourne Groups and by people who have written to us, it is not exhaustive. We shall be taking forward a project started in 1998 to use geographical information systems to provide better spatial analyses of TB risk factors, and are currently identifying gaps for new projects which we might be able to finance from next year. We are also consulting external appraisers about a project to be commissioned from the Central Science Laboratory to assess the ecological impact of badger culling.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90310w27.htm_wqn3"><B> Mr. Drew: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what plans he has to sequence the genome of the bacterium which causes TB in cattle; and if he will make a statement.  [76407]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90310w27.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 I am pleased to announce that MAFF and the Wellcome Trust have recently agreed joint funding for a three-way collaboration between the Veterinary Laboratories Agency, the Sanger Centre and the Institut Pasteur in Paris to sequence the complete genome of <i>Mycobacterium bovis</i>. MAFF's contribution will be around &#163;800,000, payable largely in the current financial year.
<P>

<a name="90310w27.htm_para9">This is an exciting and important new development in our fight against the rising tide of TB in cattle. Determining the genetic code for the bacterium which causes cattle TB is undoubtedly the best means of catalysing vaccine research and development. The prospect that by March 2000 we will have a completely defined genome sequence of <i>Mycobacterium bovis</i>, the organism which causes TB in cattle, is very encouraging and represents a major advance.
<P>

<a name="90310w27.htm_para10">The time is undoubtedly right for this research to be taken forward. The genome sequence of the human TB strain has already provided valuable leads for vaccine research. Unravelling the secrets of the bovine TB genome is of the highest relevance to the development of an effective cattle vaccine and a diagnostic test which will distinguish between vaccinated and infected animals.
