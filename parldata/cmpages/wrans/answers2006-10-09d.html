It is not possible to break down ineffective calls into those that did
or did not receive an engaged tone for old system calls in 2002-03.
<i> Notes:</i>  1. Data is presented for calls made regarding
cases on the new system (CS2) and the old system (CSCS)
combined.  2. "Attempted customer calls" excludes calls
attempted outside working hours.  3. "Calls for which outcome
not recorded" are those that were received but for which, due to data
problems, the eventual outcome was not recorded. The volume of such
calls has decreased significantly in the last three years as management
information systems have improved.  4. "Calls for which
outcome recorded" are those which were received and for which there is
management information to track the eventual outcome.  5. IVR
denotes the automated touch tone part of the process where customers
enter their details via the telephone key pad. Once callers have
cleared this part of the process, they enter a queue to be answered by
a member of CSA staff. Note that there is no IVR process on the old
system.  6. Numbers are rounded to the nearest thousand.
Components may not sum to totals due to
rounding.<br></td></tr></table><br><p><a name="06101024000181"><b><a name="06101024001232">Mr.

the market value of occupational pension scheme assets reduced by a

<notus-date day="9" month="10" year="2006" textMonth="Oct"></notus-date><b>9 Oct 2006 : Column 111W</b><br><p><a name="06101116000052"><b><a name="06101116001236">Beverley
Hughes:</b> Several research projects that examine the sexual
attitudes and behaviours of BME groups have been commissioned as part
of the Teenage Pregnancy Strategy, details of which are provided at
annex 1. The strategy has also drawn upon routinely collected data to
inform our understanding of ethnicity and teenage pregnancy.</p><p><a name="06101116000053">The evidence suggests that
young people from different ethnic groups are more or less likely to
experience teenage pregnancy than others. But establishing the precise
impact of ethnicity is difficult because: ethnicity is not recorded at
birth registration; BME groups are over-represented in deprived areas
where higher rates would be expected; and sexual behaviour, knowledge
and attitudes may vary considerably within BME
groups.</p><p><a name="06101116000054">Data on
mothers giving birth under-19, identified from the 2001 Census, show
rates of teenage motherhood are significantly higher among young women
of &#145;Mixed White and Black Caribbean&#146;, &#145;Other
Black&#146; and &#145;Black Caribbean&#146; ethnicity.
&#145;White British&#146; young women are also over-represented
among teenage mothers, while all Asian ethnic groups are
under-represented. Girls and young women of Black and Black British
ethnicity are also over-represented among abortions under-18. In 2004,
Black ethnic groups (which represent around 3 per cent. of all females
aged 15-17) accounted for 9 per cent. of all abortions
under-18.</p><p><a name="06101116000055">The Teenage
Pregnancy Strategy has a target to halve the rate of under-18
conceptions by 2010 (compared to the rate in 1998). Between 1998 and
2004 (the latest year for which data are available) the under-18
conception rate fell by 11.1 per cent., to its lowest level for 20
years and the under 16 rate fell by 15.2 per cent. The strategy does
not have targets to reduce conceptions among different ethnic groups,
although local areas are asked to take account of factors that increase
the risk of early pregnancy, including social deprivation, poor
educational attainment, living in care and ethnicity, in the delivery
of local
strategies.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="61009w0019.htm_wqn9"><a name="06101116000006">Connexions</h3><p><a name="06101116000056"><b><a name="06101116001237">Mr.

case of the two rejected applications, the School Playing Fields
Advisory Panel determined, on appeal, that the applications did not
meet the published criteria. Applications have been withdrawn either as
a result of the panel's preliminary view that the application failed to
meet the criteria or as a result of similar advice from officials. In
some instances, the applicant itself has withdrawn its application
because it realised that it failed to meet the criteria. In every case,
however, the reason for withdrawal was that the application failed to
meet the criteria for giving consent. A withdrawn case has the same
effect as one that is rejected in that the proposed disposal, or change
of use, does not
happen.</p><p><a name="06101116001079"><b><a name="06101116001315">Mr.

their schools to determine their own particular training and

of Congo most affected by insecurity. Current estimates from the UN
Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) suggest that
there are over 200,000 internally displaced people (IDPs). The worst
affected area is around the villages of Gety and Aveba, where over
40,000 people have sought shelter in camps. Attacks on these IDPs and
on international non-governmental organisation (NGO) staff by rebel
groups make it extremely difficult to provide support for these people,
many of whom had been hiding in the surrounding forests for some time.
Shortages in food supplies and logistical constraints have compounded a
very serious humanitarian
situation.</p><p><a name="06101118000232">However the
situation has now stabilised and food and other support is reaching
people in the camps. Food rations supplied by the World Food Programme
(WFP) were being distributed in Gety during the visit of one of
DFID&#146;s humanitarian experts in the second half of September.
Additional resources have been allocated to WFP in DRC this year to
cover food, transport and logistics costs through the Central Emergency
Relief Fund (CERF) and the DRC Humanitarian Pooled Fund. Both these
funds were established with strong encouragement from DFID and the UK
is a major contributor to
both.</p><p><a name="06101118000233">The people of

policies to support economic stability, promote the effective use of
higher levels of aid and to build the capacity of public

stability is important if poverty is to be reduced. It is a foundation
for growth, for avoiding inflation that harms the poor and for ensuring
countries can sustain long term investments in public services. All
countries face constraints in deciding on appropriate levels of
domestic deficits and borrowing. The IMF's dialogue and advice helps
countries establish budget policies that achieve and maintain
stability. This includes agreeing with countries on the budget limits
that are central to their fiscal policies. These limits avoid
unsustainable deficits that will force countries to cut back on their
future spending. These policies support long-term spending plans that
are central to strengthening public
services.</p><p><a name="06101118000529">The IMF and
the World Bank are both committed to helping developing countries
manage larger aid flows to support public service investments that
reduce poverty. The IMF helps countries with advice on policies to
manage the macroeconomic consequences of larger aid flows. It promotes
long term predictable aid that can finance higher public spending
without excessive borrowing and adjusts the fiscal targets in its
programmes to support higher aid backed spending. The World Bank plays
a leading role in supporting countries' own poverty reduction
strategies. It is a major global provider of aid to finance these
strategies. The Bank also plays a central role in helping countries

food safety net programmes for delivering regular grants of cash and

money allocated to the region following the series of major natural
disasters in 2004-06 is spent effectively. This has arisen from
DFID&#146;s commitment to allocate 10 per cent. of its funding in
response to each natural disaster for DRR. As a result, DFID is
providing &#163;6.5 million for DRR work in the Asia tsunami-affected

in Pakistan and &#163;500,000 following the 2006 earthquake in

related to areas highlighted in the question has been managed through
the joint DFID, FCO and MOD conflict prevention pools; the Africa
Conflict Prevention Pool (ACPP) and the Global Conflict Prevention Pool
(GCPP). Both pools receive technical support from the Post Conflict
Reconstruction Unit (PCRU). The PCRU is also a tri-departmental unit
involving DFID, the FCO and MOD. The PCRU enables UK Government
Departments and the military to work together to support countries
emerging from conflict. It provides skilled civilian staff to help
kick-start post-conflict recovery. It does not provide funds.</p><p><a name="06101118000613">The pools support projects to
improve the effectiveness of UK and international support for conflict
prevention, through addressing long-term structural causes of conflict,
managing regional and national tension and violence, and supporting
post-conflict reconstruction where the UK can make a significant
contribution, in particular Africa, Asia, the Balkans and the middle
east.</p><p><a name="06101118000614">Given these
arrangements, providing a detailed break down of DFID contributions in
the areas (a) to (e) would be difficult and would incur
disproportionate costs. Further, they would effectively be limited to
administrative costs incurred by DFID in fulfilling its management and
oversight obligations. The overall pools budgets for the financial year
2006-07 are provided as follows for information.</p><table border="1"><tr valign="top"><td class="tabletext"><i> Pool</i></td><td class="tabletext"><i> Overall

this aid is on three areas (i) livelihoods, (ii) rural assistance and
(iii) state- building; the latter comprising roughly 10 per cent. of
annual expenditure. State-building expenditure supports efforts to
increase Government capacity in order for the Afghan Government to meet
its commitments outlined in the Interim Afghan National Development
Strategy and Afghan Compact, both of which were signed at the London
Conference in January 2006. DFID Afghanistan does not fund directly
areas (b), (c), (d) or (e) outlined in the question. However through
DFIDs' partnership arrangements with UN agencies, international
financing institutions and civil society organisation funding does
indirectly address areas (b), (d) and (e). Disaggregated figures are

Rule of Law and Security programme in 2006-07. Much of this programme
is focused on Somaliland and Puntland, as both are more stable regions
with relatively better established institutions. Within the framework
of the transitional federal charter for Somalia, DFID is directing its
efforts at the establishment of inclusive safety, security and access
to justice institutions.</p><p><a name="06101118000645">On (b), DFID has committed
&#163;800,000 to UNHCR to support the integration and settlement of
internally displaced people (IDPs) and refugees. However in the long

of the circumstances that have driven people from their homes in the

of these funds will be used to support most of the activities listed in

the rivers Severn and Wye. It also assumes an annual 5 mm increase in
predicted water levels in the Severn estuary as part of its planning
for the possibility of future sea level

Pearson:</b> The primary responsibility for maintenance of all
watercourses rests with the relevant riparian owner (a landowner with a
frontage along a
watercourse).</p><p><a name="06101160001696">In
England, the Environment Agency (EA) is the principal flood risk
management operating authority with permissive powers for the
maintenance of watercourses designated as &#145;main river&#146;.
The EA has assumed responsibility for some 1,800 additional watercourse
lengths transferred from other operating authorities over the last
three years.</p><p><a name="06101160001697">Defra is
providing 413 million in grant in aid this year to fund the EA's flood
risk management activities, which includes capital improvement
projects, maintenance and operation of existing infrastructure, and
associated activities such as flood warning and public awareness
campaigns. The EA will also spend &#163;53.7 million received from
local levy, Internal Drainage Board charges, General Drainage Charges
and other income. This figure includes &#163;8.7 million planned use
of balances. The total funding for 2006-07 is &#163;466.7 million.
This is targeted according to flood risk, rather than whether a
watercourse is in an urban or rural
area.</p><p><a name="06101160001698">The EA uses the
National Flood and Coastal Defence Database (NFCDD) to monitor the
condition of assets, and reviews progress on a quarterly basis. A
nationally consistent method of classifying asset condition has been
shared with other operating authorities. These other operating
authorities are required to use NFCDD to record details of the assets
that they
manage.</p><p><a name="06101160001699">Expenditure on
the maintenance of watercourses is not held centrally and we could not
seek to gather this information without incurring disproportionate
cost. It is also the case that maintenance and capital works are not
generally classified by rural or urban location and often the
distinction will not be
clear.</p><p><a name="06101160001700">Economic
considerations are integral to the implementation of the Water
Framework directive, for which the EA is the competent authority in
England and Wales. This explicitly requires economic considerations and
social issues to be considered and taken into account when setting
water management objectives. The Collaborative Research Programme is
developing methodologies for ensuring a balance between the
environmental, social and economic concerns during river basin planning
decisions which are part of the
Framework.</p><p><a name="06101160001701">&#145;Making
Space for Water&#146;, our new cross-Government strategy for flood
and coastal erosion risk management, presents an approach that embeds
the three pillars of sustainable development, and extends our risk
management tools by expanding our flood warning and flood awareness
activities. The strategy encourages measures to improve resistance and
resilience to flooding, including scoping work on the development and
delivery of a pilot on direct aid to individuals. The document is

because of its sampling frame, it has difficulty capturing data on
people with very low pay. It is therefore likely to under-represent

not affected by absence. From1997-2005 estimates are based on the
Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings.  <sup>(2 )</sup>In 2004
additional supplementary surveys were introduced to improve the
coverage of the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings. Figures are
presented both excluding and including the additional surveys for
comparison purposes.  <sup>(3)</sup> Constant price terms have
been uprated using the Retail Prices Index (RPI), re-based at April
2005. <i> Guide to qualify</i><i> </i>The Coefficient of Variation (CV)
indicates the quality of a figure, the smaller the CV value the higher
the quality. The true value is likely to lie within +/- twice the CV
e.g. for an average of 200 with a CV of 5 percent., we would expect the
population average to be within the range 180 to 220. The above
estimates all have a CV of less than 5 percent. An x has been given for
estimates with a CV of greater than 20 percent. 
<i> Note:</i><i> </i>The median replaces the mean as the headline
statistic. The weighted mean is the sum of the weighted values divided
by the sum of the weights. The median is the value below which 50
percent. of employees fall. It is preferred over the mean for earnings
data as it is influenced less by extreme values and because of the
skewed distribution of earnings data. <i> Source:</i> Annual Survey of

possible changes in the reporting of crime to the PSNI.

Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) in line with Home Office
Counting rules and are broadly comparable with those supplied by police
forces in England and
Wales.</p><p><a name="06101247000627">Information on
crime levels and public attitudes to crime is gathered through the
Northern Ireland Crime Survey (NICS), run by NISRA central survey unit
on behalf of the Northern Ireland Office. The survey is also the main
vehicle by which the Department is able to (1) identify those most at
risk from different types of crime, (2) examine people&#146;s
attitudes to crime and (3) measure confidence in the police and the
wider criminal justice system. By examining crime reporting levels in
Northern Ireland the survey also offers comparisons to reporting levels
in England and
Wales.</p><p><a name="06101247000628">Results from
the Northern Ireland Crime Survey (2003-04&#151;the last full year
for which results are available) showed that 45 per cent. of comparable
crimes were reported to the police. This is broadly similar to England
and Wales where the British Crime Survey (2003-04) stated that 42 per
cent. of such crimes were reported to the police for the same period.
Due to its sample size, the NICS cannot be used to produce sufficiently
robust crime reporting data to facilitate analysis at district command
unit level.</p><p><a name="06101247000629">The
Northern Ireland Crime Survey also examines reasons for not reporting
crime in Northern Ireland. In the most recent survey, only 1 per cent.
of respondents who did not report crime gave the reason
&#145;dislike/fear the police&#146;, while the most common reasons
were &#145;too trivial/no loss&#146; (33 per cent.), &#145;police
could not have done anything&#146; (32 per cent.) and &#145;police
would not have been bothered/been interested&#146; (24 per
cent.).</p><br>

continues to attract large numbers of high calibre applicants from
throughout the community. With the large number of applications to join
the Police Service, the number of suitable candidates is far in excess
of the finite number of trainee posts available. This means that
candidates of both religious traditions and genders will sadly
experience the disappointment of an unsuccessful
application.</p><p><a name="06101247001875">The
latest campaign saw the highest number of applications yet, with 7,691
applicants competing for 220 places. 37 per cent. of these applications
were from the Catholic community, which is the highest rate to date,
and the number of female and ethnic minority applications has
increased.</p><p><a name="06101247001876">In terms of
religion, the Government believe that the temporary recruitment
provisions are necessary and reasonable to correct an historic
imbalance in the composition of the PSNI. These exceptional measures
are reviewed every three years, with the next, and hopefully final,
such review due later this year. This will be subject to detailed
review of the policy, extensive consultation, and debate in both
Houses.</p><p><a name="06101247001877">Catholic
composition in the PSNI regulars has increased from 8.3 per cent. to
20.05 per cent. Our goal is to increase Catholic representation to 30
per cent. by 2010-11, the date envisaged by Patten. I am pleased to say
that we are on track to meet this, which would not be possible if the
50:50 provisions were not in
place.</p><p><a name="06101247001878">Although our
efforts have focused on the imbalance between the number of Catholics
and Protestants in the composition of the Police Service, we also
recognise the importance of gender and ethnic minority representation.
It is notable that female composition has risen from 13 per cent. to
20.54 per cent. and the ethnic minority background composition compares
favourably with the overall level of the working age ethnic minority
population in Northern
Ireland.</p><p><a name="06101247001879"><b><a name="06101247004339">Mrs.

completed in 1998 identified a need to improve the public
accountability of the trust ports; to extend their commercial powers;

that certain trust ports within the United Kingdom should be classified
as public corporations, it became a requirement from April 2005 that
trust ports in Northern Ireland should operate within the public
expenditure system. Taking trust ports out of the public expenditure
system would require removing the controls relating to public
accountability that the Assembly had considered should be in place
before extended commercial powers were

number of principles established under statute, case law and guidance,
often described as the "Compensation Code." The open market value of
the property acquired, disregarding the impact of the scheme, will form
the basis of any award. The claimant may also be entitled to
compensation for disturbance costs (removal expenses, fees etc.) and a
Home Loss payment. The Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004

Discussions have not yet concluded with Birmingham Sandwell, Manchester
Salford and Hull and East Riding on their programmes for
2006-07.<br>2. The outputs
in the table are only those that are funded directly by HMRP. The
pathfinders have played a part in generating significant additional
outputs through the contributions of partners, principally local
authorities, RSLs and the private sector, in related and complementary
interventions in housing market renewal
areas.<br>3. The variation
in outputs between pathfinders is partly explained by the different
sizes of the programmes and how long they have been running. There is
also a wide variety in approaches taken depending on the particular
problems face in each

the Taliban and traffickers based on personal relationships, tribal

resisting the Afghan government and coalition forces. The Taliban is
also attempting to exploit the continued existence of the drugs trade
to undermine the central government's authority. In the south, there
was evidence earlier this year that the Taliban was encouraging farmers
to grow opium poppy and resist Afghan government eradication efforts.
The Taliban also received payments from traffickers. However in the
north, regional warlords and drug traffickers are more likely to resist
the Taliban when this would be in their interests. We continue to

(ILO) concluded that the Belarusian authorities had seriously violated
the basic civil liberties of trade union members and leaders. The
European Commission subsequently launched its own investigation in 2005
which agreed with the ILO. It is clear Belarus has not met the
standards necessary and is facing withdrawal of preferences, after a
long and considered process. The Belarusians have had over two years to
answer ILO and EU concerns. The decision is based on the clear criteria
for GSP and does not form part of the EU sanctions introduced following
the fraudulent elections earlier this year. The political implications
were not therefore part of the decision making process. Nevertheless,
it should send a signal that the EU is serious about the need for

between armed groups in south Lebanon and helped to protect the

occasional exchanges of fire over the

and the wider North Caucasus. Recent years have seen a gradual
improvement in the security situation in Chechnya, resulting in the UN
downgrading its security classification for Chechnya from Phase 5 to
Phase 4 in August. Russian and local security forces have had some
success in improving security recently. The death of Shamil Basayev has
been followed by an amnesty under which over 200 fighters are reported
to have turned themselves in, creating the opportunity for a process of
reconciliation that could underpin long-term
security.</p><p><a name="06101265000619">Following

human rights situation in the republic is still deeply troubling and we
regularly raise these issues with the Russian government. There are
ongoing reports of torture, extrajudicial killing and abductions in
Chechnya, which Chechen President Alu Alkhanov has acknowledged are a
terrible crime. We believe that security measures which do not respect
international human rights law are counter-productive, and that a

improved considerably through 2006, but remains fragile. The major
