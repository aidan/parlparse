 The Department continues to support the work of the police, local authorities and transport operators to tackle crime on public transport. We are developing, evaluating and disseminating good practice on reducing crime and the fear of crime wherever it occurs in the transport system. We have also introduced the Secure Stations Scheme and launched the Safer Travel on Buses and Coaches Panel. As Sponsor Department for the British Transport police we have encouraged and assisted the force, through implementation of legislation and increased funding, to fulfil its responsibilities for policing the railways.

<p><a name="st_51"><a name="60117w05.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 Civil Contingency Reaction Forces (CCRFs) are based on the 14 TA Infantry battalions spread across the country. Each CCRF comprises a pool of around 500 personnel drawn from the Volunteer Reserve Forces, who have volunteered for the CCRF commitment in addition to their normal role. CCRF membership is dynamic and details of individual availability, including where volunteers have been deployed as part of their normal Reserve role, are not held centrally. It is, however, the case that when a CCRF member is mobilised to meet other commitments we aim to replace that individual immediately by another volunteer.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117w05.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_27">There are no specific recruitment schemes in place, nor are such schemes necessary given that the pool of potential volunteers consists of existing members of the Volunteer Reserves. The future size of the CCRFs is being considered as part of a wider review of the TA.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117w05.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_28">CCRFs would not be deployed in a situation which required the use of force so no question of rules of engagement would arise. Volunteers are not held at permanent readiness, although we aim to be able to deploy a CCRF within 24 hours. There are no specific criteria which would lead to a decision to mobilise a CCRF; they form part of the pool of resources upon which we could draw in the event of a request for military assistance.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117w05.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_29">While the supporting infrastructure is based on the army&#039;s regional structure, it is not the case that a CCRF would only be mobilised to undertake operations within its &quot;home&quot; region. Consequently, all CCRFs are available to undertake operations anywhere in the UK over an extended period, including in London.

<p>
<a name="60117w05.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_30">No CCRF members were mobilised in response to the terrorist attacks in London on 7 and 21 July 2005.

Macro-economic stability, active labour market policies such as the new deal, policies to make work pay such as the national minimum wage and the working tax credit, and financial support for families, have all contributed to reducing child poverty since 1998&#150;99. On an after housing cost basis, this approach has lifted 600,000 children out of relative poverty (60 per cent. of less of contemporary median income), and 1.8 million children out of absolute poverty (60 per cent. or less of median income in 1996&#150;97, uprated by prices), between 1998&#150;99 and 2003&#150;04. Since 2000&#150;01, 300,000 children have been lifted out of relative poverty and 800,000 children have been lifted out of absolute poverty.

<p>
<a name="60117w07.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_43">Financial support for families has been based on the principle of progressive universalism, with support for all families and additional support for those who need it most. Child benefit provides universal support, and the Government have increased the rate of child benefit for the first child by more than 25 per cent. in real terms since 1997. The child tax credit (CTC) was introduced in April 2003, and targets additional financial support based on the needs and circumstances of the whole household. As a result of the Government&#039;s reforms to the tax and benefit system since 1997, by October 2007, in real terms, families with children will be, on average, &#163;1,550 a year better off, while those in the poorest fifth of the income distribution will be, on average, &#163;3,350 per year better off.

<a name="stpa_44">The Government have set out its spending plans to 2007&#150;08, including a commitment to increase the child element of CTC in line with earnings. While it is possible to model the immediate effect of further changes, there are uncertainties in projecting the numbers of children in relative low income poverty. A further increase of &#163;5 per week in the rate of child benefit would initially lift around 350,000 children out of poverty, at a cost of around &#163;3.4 billion. A further increase of &#163;500 per week in the child element of CTC would initially lift around 750,000 children out of poverty, at a cost of around &#163;3.5 billion. Increasing the rate of child benefit for all children to the rate for the first child would lift around 250,000 children out of poverty, at a cost of around &#163;1.7 billion.

<p>
<a name="60117w07.html_para7">
<a name="stpa_45">The Family Resources Survey does not enable the Government to make an estimate of the cost or effect of reducing the rate of child benefit when a child reaches the age of 12. The Government have not made an estimate of the cost of eradicating child poverty by 2007&#150;08, which would depend on the definition used, and would be subject to large uncertainties around future income growth, changes in the income distribution, and individual changes in behaviour in response to policy changes.

Notes:<br>

1. The public expenditure figures are taken from Public Expenditure Statistical Analyses 2005.<br>

2. Private spending is calculated in a similar way as for ONS health accounts. From 2004&#150;05, it is assumed to carry forward as a constant share of GDP.<br>

3. The EU averages are simple averages of the figures for each country; they are not weighted by country population. For seven countries where 2003 figures were not available, 2002 figures were used instead.<br>

4. The 19 members of the OECD within the EU-25 are the EU-15 plus the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and the Slovak Republic.<br>

 DFID, along with all Government Departments, is committed to see reform of developed country agriculture policies, including trade policies, which distort international markets, and which if reformed, could deliver real development gains to the world&#039;s poorest countries. In the assistance we provide to developing countries, we do not start from the premise that their agriculture trade policies specifically must be reformed. The assistance that DFID provides to developing countries under our trade related capacity building programme is designed to support their own priorities and development needs, as identified by the countries themselves, and falls into three broad categories; helping developing countries to determine their own trade policies; helping them to negotiate their priorities in both bilateral and multilateral fora; and helping them to capture the potential benefits from trade. Since 1998, we have committed &#163;181 million to trade related capacity building, and are set to increase this Aid for Trade to &#163;100 million per annum by 2010.

A Diagnostic Trade Integration Study (DTIS) is carried out for each LDC participating in the IF which identifies constraints to the trading performance of LDCs, policies, infrastructure, institutional and private sector capacity. It also provides technical advice on how to address these constraints. Agriculture trade policies will be considered in participating LDCs with agricultural export sectors.

 A preliminary analysis of the barrier&#039;s route, published by the UN&#039;s Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) in March 2005, identified that some 142,640 acres (10 per cent.) of West Bank land will lie between the completed barrier and the Green Line. This is some of the most fertile land in the West Bank and is currently home to 49,400 Palestinians. Where the Barrier has been constructed, Palestinians face economic hardship from being restricted from or not being able to reach their land to harvest crops, graze animals or earn a living. Residents have also been cut off from schools, universities and specialized medical care by the constructed Barrier.

The Bill also provides for a reformed and simplified regulatory framework for early years and childcare to reduce bureaucracy and raise quality.

<a name="stpa_109">Local authorities receive support on early education through the Foundation Stage strand of the Primary National Strategy (PNS). That support includes disseminating effective practice; supporting the transition from Foundation Stage to Key Stage 1; supporting integrated provision; ICT development in the early years; working with parents as partners; and helping to embed the Foundation Stage Profile.

Of this Lancashire local authority will receive &#163;3,531,061 in 2006&#150;07 and &#163;4,515,291 in 2007&#150;08. The funding is to &#039;kick start&#039; extended services and can be used flexibly, for example, to support the development of childcare including the training of childcare workers.

 Graduates with an honours degree undertaking a second undergraduate degree in medicine, or other subjects, will not be entitled to a government tuition fee loan when introduced in 2006/07. The Department of Health does pay the fees of undergraduate medical students, including those with a previous graduate qualification, in years 5 and 6. Medical students on four year fast track courses do not pay tuition fee contributions, except in their first year, because the Department of Health pays the fees in years 2 to 4.

<a name="60117w17.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_123">There are several possible reasons for the rise in bankruptcy figures. Media coverage of the issue of student loan borrowers declaring themselves bankrupt during the passage of the Enterprise Act 2002 may have contributed to the rise in bankruptcies in 2003 and 2004. In addition, one of the effects of the Enterprise Act itself was to reduce the period of discharge from bankruptcy from three years to one. As a result provisions were included in the Higher Education Act 2004 to prevent student loans being written off on discharge from bankruptcy.

<p>

<a name="stpa_124">Bankrupt student loan borrowers, though, continue to benefit from the same non-commercial terms as other borrowers, including income thresholds and repayment in line with income.

Notes:<br>

1. Figures are for Great Britain. They are in 2005&#150;06 prices and rounded to the nearest &#163;100 million.<br>

2. Pension credit projections assume the continuation of the current uprating of the guarantee element of pension credit by earnings, although the Government are not committed to this beyond 2008.<br>

3. Projections of expenditure for pension credit in the future are based on a long-term version of the Department&#039;s policy simulation model, which uses Family Resources Survey data for 2003&#150;04 projected forward into the future to estimate the extent of eligibility and average award for each pensioner household on the survey.<br>

3. Expenditure figures for 2005&#150;06 are consistent with the latest available forecasts from the pre-Budget report 2005.<br>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what estimate he has made of the costs of paternity benefits arising from measures in the Government&#039;s Work and Families Bill for each year from 2005&#150;06 to 2010&#150;11; and if he will make a statement. [41310]</p>




<p><a name="st_37"><a name="60117w21.html_spnew10"><b> Mr. Sutcliffe: </b> 
 The new paternity leave measures in the Work and Families Bill will be subject to further consultation and the date when they will come into effect has yet to be decided. The regulatory impact assessment for the Bill, which was published in October 2005, gives an initial cost estimate of &#163;29.6&#151;&#163;59.4 million in the first year of implementation. This will fall to &#163;24.6&#151;&#163;50.9 million in subsequent years.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117w21.html_para7">
<a name="stpa_31">&#163;19.1&#150;28.0 million of the costs in the first year will fall to the Exchequer, and &#163;15.1&#150;24.0 million in subsequent years. The remainder will fall to employers. The range of figures reflects the fact that the Government are still consulting on the detail of the scheme for additional paternity leave and pay there is some uncertainty about how many fathers will choose to take advantage of the new entitlements.

<p><a name="qn_82"><a name="60117w26.html_wqn5"><b> Mr. Leigh: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what criteria were used to make the decision <i>(a)</i> to grant an exception from the religious discrimination provisions in clause 47 of the Equality Bill to landlords who let part of a house in which they live and <i>(b)</i> not to grant an exception from clause 46 to owners of bed and breakfast accommodation who rent out part of a house in which they live.  [41922]</p>




<p><a name="st_82"><a name="60117w26.html_spnew5"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 There is a fundamental difference between someone who rents out a room in their own home and someone who provides a bed and breakfast service to the general public.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117w26.html_para2">
When a person rents a room in a house the arrangement is usually of a long-term nature and involves the paying of rent on a weekly or monthly basis. The person renting the room becomes a tenant and the house becomes their home, As a tenant they are entitled to certain legal rights of occupancy and it will be classed as their residence for the purposes of, for example, the census and electoral register. Such arrangements may involve a close relationship between the landlord and tenant. For example, they may include sharing washing and cooking facilities as well as other communal areas in the house. We believe it is right that when someone offers to take someone into their home on this basis that they should be allowed to discriminate on who they 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>17 Jan 2006 : Column 1271W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
accept as tenants. That is why we have provided an exemption for the letting out of rooms in small dwellings at clause 48 of the Equality Bill.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117w26.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_70">The situation with bed and breakfast accommodation is different. This involves a service that is provided to the general public on a commercial basis. People often stay in bed and breakfast accommodation for only a brief period of time and the service is often paid for on a daily basis. The person staying in such accommodation does not become a tenant and has no legal rights of occupancy. We do not believe that there is any justification for an owner of a bed and breakfast to discriminate on the grounds of religion or belief in the way they provide their services. Clause 46 of the Equality Bill would not make it unlawful to provide a service which reflected the religious beliefs of the owner, for example, to offer a Christian bed and breakfast service where grace was said at mealtimes or where rooms included objects associated with the Christian faith.

There are, however, occasions when this is not possible. In the years since figures have been available, there were 20 occasions in 2003, and five in 2004.

Notes:<br>

Patient counts:<br>

Patient counts are based on the hospital episode statistics unique patient identifier (HESID). This identifier is derived based on patient&#039;s date of birth, postcode, sex, local patient identifier and NHS number, using an agreed algorithm. Where data are incomplete, HESID might erroneously link episodes or fail to recognise episodes for the same patient. Care is therefore needed, especially where duplicate records persist in the data. The patient count cannot be summed across a table where patients may have episodes in more than one cell.<br>

Data Quality:<br>

Hospital episode statistics (HES) are compiled from data sent by over 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England. The Health and Social Care Information Centre liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br>

Ungrossed data:<br>

Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).<br>

<p><a name="st_151"><a name="60117w34.html_spnew3"><b> Ms Rosie Winterton: </b> 
 From April 2006, general dental services contracts and personal dental services agreements are a matter for local agreement between primary care trusts and dentists, subject to the provisions set out in the General Dental Services and Personal Dental Services Transitional Provisions Order 2005 (SI2005/3435). The value of a unit of dental activity may vary between dentists depending on a range of factors. These include the relationship between national health service earnings and dental activity during the reference period October 2004 to September 2005, which in turn will reflect the average treatment needs of a dentist&#039;s patients.

Due to small numbers, the calculation of the median wait is prone to fluctuation at primary care trust (PCT) and strategic health authority level. Care should be taken when interpreting these figures.<br>

The Cumbria and Lancashire strategic health authority (SHA) advise that from this money, the equivalent of 16.1 whole-time additional dentists are now working within the Lancashire area. PCTs across Lancashire have been working with dental practices to support them in moving over to the new personal dental service (PDS) contract. As at the beginning of December 2005, 37 per cent. of practices had converted to PDS. The SHA advises that all PDS contracts have growth included in them for extra national health service registrations and practices have been increasing their registrations on a steady basis.

 The Department funded an evaluation of the national health service stop smoking services in England. The evaluation included an analysis of how well the services were doing in enabling access to the services of smokers from hard-to-reach groups. Results from the evaluation show that the NHS stop smoking services in England are successfully reaching smokers living in the most disadvantaged areas. The evaluation was published in a special supplement of the journal, &quot;Addiction&quot; in April 2005. A copy is available in the Library.

<p>
<a name="60117w37.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_138">The Department has also asked the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) to look at two areas of smoking cessation: the first is for brief interventions and referral, the second is for optimal provision of services for smokers. The scopes for these two pieces of work are available on NICE&#039;S website. In both cases the scopes place particular emphasis on looking at groups where smoking rates are high including manual working groups, pregnant women, low income/lone parents and homeless people.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117w37.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_139">The Department ran a major marketing campaign during 2005 to raise awareness of local NHS stop smoking services. This campaign included television, press, radio and ambient advertising. As with all tobacco education campaigns, the campaign had a strong focus on the routine and manual audience. In February 2006, a new major campaign, promoting local NHS stop smoking services will be launched. This will again focus on the routine and manual group audience.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117w37.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_140">To build on the continued good progress of the NHS stop smoking services in reaching and exceeding previous targets for helping smokers to quit, the Department set from April 2003 a more demanding national target of helping 800,000 smokers to quit by March 2006. To help meet this increased target, the services have expanded substantially, supported by extra investment of &#163;138 million over the three years. The table shows the substantial and continued increase in capacity in NHS stop smoking services.

<p>
<a name="60117w41.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_172">The ombudsman found that there was inadequate preparation before and during the early part of the John&#039;s placement with his foster parents. She was also critical of the council&#039;s failure to have guidance for foster carers about whether and when it might be appropriate to ask fostered young people to be out of the house when the foster carer was not present.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60117w41.html_para7">
<a name="stpa_176">This problem was one inherited by the council from its predecessor, Humberside county council. The council was aware of this problem at the time, and indeed considered the matter at committee level in October 1996.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60117w41.html_para8">
<a name="stpa_177">The ombudsman acknowledged the financial difficulties which had confronted the council and made prioritising work and expenditure difficult, but she had to remind the council that Parliament had placed upon the council a statutory duty to assert and protect the rights of the public to use and enjoy public footpaths. The failure here to respond to this statutory duty was, in the ombudsman&#039;s view, maladministration. The ombudsman felt this was aggravated by the failures of both the council and its predecessor to comply with recommendations contained in the previous report issued about this matter.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117w41.html_para9">
<a name="stpa_178">Although the ombudsman commended the council for the action it is taking now, she was critical of the time taken to reach this point. The ombudsman felt that the council&#039;s failure to respond to the previous report, and the failure over many years to take any effective action, reflected very poorly on the council.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117w41.html_para10">
<a name="stpa_179">The council has now instigated action which should resolve this matter and re-establish the footpath. However the ombudsman felt that the complainants had been put to great trouble in being forced to pursue their complaints as they did and, commending their patience, felt that the council should pay each of them &#163;500 to compensate them for their time and trouble.

 I refer the hon. Member to the answer given to the hon. Member on 14 December 2005, <i>Official Report,</i> columns 1970&#150;1W. As that explained, there is currently no standard approach to Supporting People assessments, but our Supporting People strategy development work commits us to working towards one and to integrating that with those for care and other relevant services. As such, arrangements, and the links between support plans and care plans, will currently vary between local authorities and between providers.

<p><a name="st_230"><a name="60117w42.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Woolas: </b> 
 There is no standardised approach to assessments for Supporting People services, and arrangements will vary between authorities and between providers. It is, however, usual for an assessment to be made of an individual&#039;s personal circumstances in order to obtain housing-related support. This could take account of things like physical and mental health, social, family, domestic and financial circumstances. The basic aim will be to determine eligibility, so a decision can be made on who is entitled to a service funded through Supporting People and in accordance with grant conditions applying to the programme; and why, and what, if any, charges for the service should be made.

 As is clear from the Government&#039;s Discussion Paper, &#039;Standards of Conduct in English Local Government: The Future&#039;, published on 15 December 2005, we have no plans to abolish the board. We consider that the new style strategic board as proposed in the paper, if Parliament legislates to establish it, should be re-located out of London. In advance of this, I have given approval for the board to re-locate a small number of posts to Manchester in 2006, provided this can be achieved without the need for any extra grant funding from the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister.
