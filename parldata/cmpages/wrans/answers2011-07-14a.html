 This is a matter on which industry leads. Key players, as represented by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders' Electric Vehicle Group, the Plugged-In Places and the Institution of Engineering and Technology's Electric Vehicle Group, favour moving to a dedicated plug-in vehicle recharging connector (the IEC62196-2 Type 2) to allow faster recharging rates (up to 32A) than are possible with a three-pin plug. Given this clear direction of travel from industry, the Plugged-In Places will start to install public infrastructure with Type 2 connectors. We will continue to monitor the emergence of standards with industry and internationally.</p>

 As set out in the Department for Transport’s plug-in vehicle infrastructure strategy “Making the Connection”, published on 30 June 2011, we want the majority of recharging of plug-in vehicles to take place at home, at night, in a period of off-peak demand for electricity. This will be supported by recharging at workplaces and public infrastructure targeted at those places where they are most likely to be used.</p>

               <a name="11071477000247"> This approach is supported by the findings of the Technology Strategy Board's Ultra Low Carbon Vehicle Demonstrator programme, one of the largest trials of plug-in vehicles in the world, the Energy Technology Institute's Plug-In Vehicle Economics and Infrastructure programme, Element Energy's work for the Committee on Climate Change and WWFs recent report “Electric Avenues”. These show that recharging at home, at night, is how drivers prefer to recharge. This type of recharging also maximises the environmental benefits of plug-in vehicles by using low carbon night-time generation and is economically preferable, as it allows consumers to take advantage of cheaper off-peak tariffs.</p>

As well as this Strategy, the Government are also supporting the growth of the plug-in vehicle market through the Plug-In Car Grant providing a 25% discount (up to a maximum of £5,000) on eligible vehicles.

1. No figures are available for May 1997, as waiting times data was only collected quarterly in 1997. Therefore, figures for June 1997 have been provided.
2. Figures on in-patient and out-patient waiting times were only published monthly from June 1998. Therefore, figures for June 1998 have been provided.
3. Data on in-patient waiting lists not collected after March 2010. Therefore, figures for March 2010 have been provided.
4. The figures show the median waiting times for patients still waiting for admission at the end of the period stated.
5. Median waiting times are calculated from aggregate data, rather than patient level data, and therefore are only estimates of the position on average waits.

1. Data on out-patient times waited are only available quarterly, so figures for quarter ending June have been provided.
2. The figures show the median time waited for patients having a first consultant led out-patient appointment in the period stated.
3. Out-patient waiting times are measured from general practitioner referral to first out-patient appointment.
4. Median waiting times are calculated from aggregate data, rather than patient level data, and therefore are only estimates of the position on average waits.
5. Figures last published September 2007.

 The National Audit Office (NAO) Report (2008) stated that the estimated total cost of the national programme for information technology would be £12.7 billion. The latest NAO report (2011) stated that the Department plans to reduce the overall cost of the programme to £11.4 billion and that, as of 31 March 2011, the Department and the national health service (in England) have spent £6.4 billion on the programme. These costs are based on a 2004-05 price base. Certain elements of the programme have not yet been delivered.</p>

 The estimated expenditure for the NHS Bursary Scheme in 2011-12 is £525 million. The costs are dependent on the number of students and the package of support available to each student. An estimate of the costs for 2012-13 will be made once further information is available about the number of student places that will be filled in 2012-13.</p>

 North Yorkshire and York primary care trust (PCT) was established on 1 October 2006 as a result of a merger between Craven, Harrogate and Rural District PCT; Hambleton and Richmondshire PCT; Scarborough, Whitby and Ryedale PCT; and Selby and York PCT. As recurrent revenue allocations had already been made to the predecessor PCTs for 2006-07 and 2007-08, the first allocation made directly to North Yorkshire and York PCT was for 2008-09.</p>

Allocations would be made to clinical commissioning groups. Further detail on allocations and processes will be announced in due course.</p>

 The unlawful obtaining or disclosure of personal data is an offence under s.55 of the Data Protection Act. The Ministry of Justice has been exploring ways of making the illegal obtaining and disclosure of personal data less lucrative, for example, through the use of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, under which unlawfully gained assets can be recovered. This was recently used successfully in connection with the Information Commissioner's prosecution of two offenders who had sold customer information relating to mobile phone contracts. I have also asked the Sentencing Council to consider the production of a sentencing guideline on data protection offences, and we are keeping the question of greater penalties for such offences under review.</p>

Under these EC regulations, nationals of other member states who are employed or self-employed in the United Kingdom and are paying compulsory national insurance contributions are entitled to claim child benefit and the child tax credit in respect of children resident in other member states. United Kingdom nationals who work and are compulsorily insured in another member state have reciprocal entitlement to family benefits in that other state by virtue of the same EC regulations.</p>

It has also held a series of free public cycling events across the estate to promote safe cycling. Over the past three years, the agency has improved and increased the amount of cycling routes, and now provides 27 miles of off road cycle routes, and 32 miles of park roads.</p>

 Current national planning policy for housing makes clear that local planning authorities should carry out a strategic housing market assessment to provide information on the level of needs and demand for housing in their area.

Based on the requirements identified, planning authorities should develop policies and implementation strategies to ensure that sufficient, suitable land is made available to achieve their housing objectives.

The Coefficient of Variation (CV) indicates the quality of an estimate, the smaller the CV value the higher the quality. The true value is likely to lie within +/- twice the CV—for example, for an estimate of 200 with a CV of 5% we would expect the population total to be within the range 180-220.

 The Prime Minister pledged to make this the greenest Government ever and recently announced that carbon emissions from Government HQs and offices have been cut by nearly 14% in just one year. Following this, he committed the Government to go further by reducing emissions by 25% by 2015. We are also supporting greater energy efficiency across the economy by introducing the Green Deal, leading technological development with support for the world's first commercial scale CCS demonstration, and rolling-out smart meters and a smart grid will build on this progress. Moreover, on 12 July 2011 the Government published ‘Planning our electric future: a White Paper for secure, affordable and low-carbon electricity’. The White Paper sets out key reforms to the electricity market to attract investment, reduce the impact on consumer bills, and create a secure mix of low-carbon electricity sources including renewables, new nuclear and carbon capture and storage.</p>

 Government are working to support the deployment of offshore wind and attract turbine manufacturers to the UK. It is for manufacturers, not Government, to decide where the best locations are from a business perspective. The Government's focus is on ensuring that investors have confidence in the development of the UK market more widely. As part of this work, the Renewables Roadmap published this week shows that a central scenario of up to 18 GW of UK offshore wind deployment is possible by 2020. The Electricity Market Reform White Paper published on 12 July also set out the long-term framework needed to give investors confidence.</p>

 Apprenticeships provide substantial economic benefit both to employers and to their workers. It is therefore crucial that smaller employers, who form the backbone of our economy, have the opportunity to reap the benefits that apprenticeships offer. We are working to ensure that the process all employers go through to recruit an apprentice is as straightforward as possible. This includes creating a new on-line toolkit, taking employers through the 'end to end' journey from initial interest to actual recruitment, and developing new delivery standards enabling employers to fully understand the level of service they can expect from the National Apprenticeship Service and the apprenticeship provider.</p>

We will come forward in the autumn with proposals to facilitate greater SME engagement with apprenticeships.</p>

 The White Paper “Higher Education: Students at the Heart of the system” (Cm 8122) sets out proposals for a single, transparent regulatory framework for all providers. There will be a new role for the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) as lead regulator.</p>

               <a name="11071481000121"> For-profit higher education institutions that want their students to access student support funding would have to comply with requirements on quality, dispute resolution, information, access (if charging over the basic tuition charge), financial sustainability, any reformed student number controls and tuition charge caps. As now, HEFCE would sit within a framework of "arm's length" principles precluding it from any role in admissions. This framework, on which we will consult, provides the necessary safeguards for students in respect of quality and information; protects the autonomy of institutions; and ensures government is able to maintain control of its financial exposure.</p>

               <i>[holding answer 11 July 2011]:</i> There are very few licences issued that specifically relate to permitting a vessel to fish with hand lines. Instead, licences are structured primarily to control what species a fisherman can target. For example, a category A licence allows a fisherman to target any species subject to UK quotas. Within this, they can use a range of gears, depending on any EU or national technical conservation measures in place—for example, there are restrictions on the use of beam trawl gears based on historic activity.</p>

               <a name="11071481000286"> There were 1,386 category A licences issued in 2010 to vessels spread around the UK, all of which could have potentially used hand line gears. Of these, for example, only 345 vessels actually fished for mackerel with hand lines in 2010 in the South West, i.e. ICES areas 7e to 7h. This does not necessarily mean that the other vessels were inactive as they may have fished with other gears.</p>

 DEFRA and the devolved Administrations work closely with the European Commission to ensure that we comply with EU legislation and that they understand the bovine TB situation in the UK. The Commission has supported our approach, approving the UK Bovine TB Eradication Plan for 2011, which includes controls to prevent the spread of bovine TB within the UK and to other countries. On that basis the current risk of EU sanctions is low. However, cattle can only be exported if they are individually certificated, come from officially tuberculosis free herds and if over 42 days of age have passed a pre-export tuberculin skin test within the previous 30 days. This is in accordance with Community law.</p>

 Ongoing surveillance of wild foxes has demonstrated that the fox population in the UK remains free of echinococcus multilocularis. Similarly, no domestic cases of human infection by the tapeworm E. multilocularis have been found. The UK's geographic separation from continental Europe essentially eliminates the risk of the introduction of E. multilocularis through the cross-border movement of wild animals to a negligible level.</p>

Exposure of a pet to infection depends on the country visited and whether the pet has ingested any infected rodents. Alveolar echinococcosis is restricted to the northern hemisphere and has become more of a problem in some urban fox populations. The risk is currently mitigated by a requirement to treat all cats and dogs with Praziquantel (certified by a vet in the pet passport or third country official veterinary certificate) before entering the UK.</p>

Spatial protection mechanisms are not, in isolation, the most effective way of protecting highly mobile species. Protecting some habitats important to mobile species can aid their conservation, as part of wider protection measures that can be applied across their range. We will continue to develop bespoke management measures for vulnerable mobile species, such as acoustic deterrents to reduce dolphin bycatch and fisheries protection for endangered sharks. For birds the SPAs, combined with other sector-wide initiatives (for example under the EU Seabird Plan of Action), will be the primary methods for protection.

 The Department is currently funding a research project that is looking at the impact on greenhouse gas emissions from changes to manure management practices as a result of the Nitrates Action Programme. The project will evaluate the effects of the implementation of several possible Action Programme measures, including designating the whole of England as a single Nitrate Vulnerable Zone (NVZ). Evidence from this and other research projects will assist Ministers in making their final decisions on the designation of Nitrate Vulnerable Zones in England under the EU Nitrates Directive (91/676/EEC) due in 2012.

 It has sometimes been suggested that a restoration of the bounty scheme operated by the Government in the 1950s could help to eradicate grey squirrels or at least make a serious impact on numbers. The scheme made no significant impact on natural fluctuations in numbers, however, and was abandoned as ineffective. Populations of grey squirrels actually rose during most of the scheme's lifetime. Therefore, we have no plans to reintroduce a bounty scheme for grey squirrels.</p>

 At least 16 of the Department for International Development's (DFID) bilateral programmes are currently planning programmes which will deliver improvements in the food security and nutritional status of poor people in the countries concerned. DFID also provides significant support for food security through our investments in agricultural research and our contributions to the work of relevant multilateral institutions such as the World Food Programme. Over the next four years, DFID's support will stop 10 million more children going hungry and ensure anther 4 million people have enough food throughout the year.</p>

 The Framework for Results recognises the risks associated with adolescent pregnancy and highlights the importance of ensuring that adolescents have control over their fertility. Adolescent pregnancy is not only dangerous for the health of the mother and the child but also has other consequences, such as the mother dropping out of school and damaging her future opportunities to participate in the labour market. It can also have an adverse affect on their status as well as on the children and their wider communities.</p>

 The estimate that 25% of the Department for International Development’s (DFID) health funding supports human resources for health (HRH) was drawn from data analysis undertaken for DFID's 2009 Health Portfolio Review. A desk-based analysis of Overseas Development Assistance in the 2008-09 financial year was used to quantify the volume and percentage of DFID spending on “aid to health” that was committed to HRH spending across all countries. In addition, an in-depth review of HRH programming in four countries and a survey of HRH programming across 12 countries were used to test the assumptions made in the desk-based analysis.</p>

 The UK Government remain extremely concerned about the situation in Yemen. Following the attack on President Saleh's mosque on 3 June the President is currently receiving medical treatment in Saudi Arabia. Since President Saleh left Yemen on 4 June, the capital has experienced a welcome lull in the fierce inter-factional fighting seen in previous months. But the situation elsewhere in Yemen remains tense. The Yemeni cities of Taiz and Aden have seen continuing fierce fighting. The Yemeni Government admit that they have lost security control over five governorates. Yemeni security forces are fighting to contain attempts by Islamic militants and others to control the towns of Zinjibar and Ja'ar in Abyan governorate. Continuing conflict is exacerbating the serious humanitarian crisis that Yemen already faces.</p>

 There are no plans to invite the Kalon Tripa to the UK. Since 1980 the UK has not accorded recognition to governments; we only accord recognition to states. So no question of our recognising the Tibetan Government in exile can arise.</p>

 While we recognise Tibet as part of the People's Republic of China, we believe long-term stability in Tibet can only be achieved through respect for human rights and genuine autonomy for Tibet within the framework of the Chinese constitution. We have urged the Chinese Government to engage in meaningful dialogue with the Dalai Lama's representatives as the best way to make this happen. I raised this with the  <br/>

 Our overall objective is securing a more peaceful and stable Yemen, which presents a reduced risk to UK interests at home and in the region. Our work focuses on achieving a peaceful settlement to the current political stalemate; halting the country's decline into state failure; and working with the Yemeni authorities and others to disrupt Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula's activities and operations. This is proving extremely difficult in the current volatile security climate in Yemen. Given our serious concerns about the security situation, we have drawn down our embassy to a small core team. That said, we continue to work with the Vice President and other key players in the Government and opposition to secure the political change that Yemen so badly needs. We continue to urge Vice President Hadi to engage with all sides to begin a peaceful political transition on the basis of the Gulf Co-operation Council agreement. We encourage all sides to participate in an inclusive dialogue as a way forward and to refrain from further violent clashes.</p>
