 I refer the hon. Member to the answer I gave the hon. Member for Bridgend (Mrs. Moon) on 21 November 2007, <i> Official Report</i>, column 861W. Birds registered under section 7 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 are primarily captive bred birds. The UK's biodiversity targets are aimed at improving the conservation status of wild species. Only six species of wild birds subject to registration are also subject to biodiversity action plans, and these are only kept in very low numbers. Therefore any discontinuation of the bird registration scheme is unlikely to affect the UK's biodiversity targets.</p>

The development as a whole (including all homes) should reach zero carbon and should use the standards set out in the Code for Sustainable Homes as a guide.</p>

 As a first step, I undertook to engage with the university sector by setting out my views in a lecture given to the Fabians Society on 27 November. A copy of this lecture can be found on the website of the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills. I am undertaking a number of visits to different universities to talk to students and staff about this issue as well as contact with sector bodies to encourage them to engage with and lead this debate. Academic freedom is one of the most powerful means at our disposal to challenge the views of violent extremists and to promote cohesive communities.</p>

There is no reason why applications for visas which are made in good time and with the necessary supporting documentation would be delayed. UKVisas&#146; latest published statistics for the F/Y 2005/2006 indicate that a total of 284,447 student applications were received, of which 194,827 visas were issued and 88,897 applications refused. These figures do not distinguish between level of study and thus cover higher education, further education and language study.</p>

In 1999 SGM was replaced by SGM Plus which looks at 10 areas of DNA plus the sex area. SGM has a one in 50 million chance of being incorrect, and SGM Plus has a better than one in 1,000 million chance of being incorrect, when applied to the general population, though they are less discriminating between individuals who are related, or if matched against partial profiles from crime scenes i.e. where the DNA found at the crime scene is too degraded to look at all the relevant areas of DNA. It was decided when SGM Plus was introduced that it was too costly to reanalyse all the samples taken between 1995 and 1999 to upgrade them from SGM to SGM Plus.

 I have been asked to reply.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_136"><a name="71203w0009.htm_para0"><a name="07120329001065">Dropping litter is an offence under section 87 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990, punishable by a fixed penalty fine, which can be set locally by a council within a range of &#163;50 to &#163;80, or prosecution (with a fine of up to &#163;2,500 on conviction). Police community support officers, persons accredited under community accreditation schemes, parish councils and local authority authorised officers have enforcement powers, although responsibility rests primarily with the local authority.</p>

The offence carries a maximum penalty of five years imprisonment, an unlimited fine, or both. Due to the serious nature of fly-tipping, there is no FPN available.

<i> [holding answer 29 November 2007]:</i> In line with generally accepted current practice, pure tone audiometry is the main method used to inform determination of claims for hearing loss by former military personnel under the War Pension and Armed Forces Compensation Schemes. Pure tone audiometry is undertaken to quality assured standards by suitably trained technicians. Where the test is considered unreliable, unrepeatable or in some other way unrepresentative of true hearing level, other tests may be used such as evoked response audiometry.</p>

The audiological literature is kept under review including research on technical aspects of, and new approaches to, hearing loss assessment and possible application to MOD's no fault compensation schemes. The scheme rules governing the assessment of noise induced sensorineural hearing loss are currently in article 42 of and part VI of schedule 1 to the Naval, Military and Air Forces Etc.

 Staff are not disciplined as the result of their poor sick record. Under the Department&#146;s restoring efficiency procedures, measures are applied to restore and maintain acceptable levels of attendance and deal with staff whose excessive sickness absence and attendance record has become a cause for concern. Employment can be terminated where patterns of irregular attendance from staff becomes unacceptable or where long term sickness absence persists and there is no prospect of a regular return to work. Staff also have their employment terminated when they are medically assessed as being so unwell in the longer term that ill-health retirement is approved.

 There has been no change in the policy of rating telephone networks. Where fibre optic networks are known to the Valuation Office Agency they are assessed for rating. At present there are four fibre optic telecommunications networks in assessment that are known to be in the rateable occupation of local authorities and 18 fibre optic networks in assessment that are known to be in rateable occupation of other public sector organisations. All fibre optic networks, whether occupied by public or private sector ratepayers, are valued in the usual way on the basis of their annual rent if they were available to let on the open market at a fixed valuation date.</p>

Eco-towns should be planned in a way that supports low carbon living, and minimises carbon emissions from transport.

From October 2003, information is available on whether a job lasted at least 13 weeks, or less than 13 weeks, but not on whether it lasted at least 26 weeks.  5. Separate data on job sustainability through NDDP has not been collected centrally since April 2006. As information is requested for each year, complete year data is provided to December 2005.  6. New Deal for Disabled People started in July 2001.  7. Data is rounded to the nearest 10.  <i> Source:</i>  Information Directorate, Department for Work and Pensions.<br>

 In respect of gas and electricity, each supplier has a range of tariffs which are generally related to payment method. While these will be available to all customers, there will be circumstances where a customer cannot access a particular tariff, for instance, an internet-based tariff or, where a customer is repaying debt through a prepayment meter. Most suppliers now offer social tariffs to their fuel poor customers, while others offer a range of measures designed to assist these customers. Among other things, these activities help low-income households reduce their energy costs. I am in continued discussion with suppliers to encourage them to maintain and build on these activities.</p>

A number of intermediaries now also exist to inform customers about different tariffs and provide an easy means of switching. In respect of the cheaper tariffs that are available through direct debit, the key is access to a bank account. The Government are tackling this through its work on financial inclusion and specifically work with the banking sector to improve access to bank accounts.</p>

 The Department plays a key role in delivering the Government's public sector agreement of leading the global effort to avoid dangerous climate change, particularly in relation to promoting carbon trading, encouraging the adoption of renewable and low carbon technologies, and addressing the removal of barriers to behavioural change in order to improve energy efficiency. As such, Ministers and officials have regular discussions both in and outside Government on these issues. For example, I took part in the zero carbon homes taskforce meeting on 26 October which is looking at addressing the barriers to implementation of the 2016 zero carbon homes target. Officials have been in discussion with industry on the competition for a commercial-scale carbon capture and storage demonstration project launched on 19 November. Ministers and officials have been discussing with a number of stakeholders ways of encouraging more renewable electricity generation.

 Security is one of the major challenges in delivering humanitarian assistance to Somalia. Relief agencies are unable to work effectively to assist the most needy people, especially in Mogadishu and the surrounding area, and the threat of piracy makes the delivery of humanitarian assistance more difficult. Transporters demand higher rates because of the risks, and delays are caused when willing transporters cannot be found or cargoes are seized. Three ships have been attacked in 2007. All were returning empty from Somalia to Kenya, and so there was no loss of humanitarian cargo.</p>

There are many incidents of militia groups setting up checkpoints along roads inside Somalia and demanding payments for passage. This happens to such an extent that the World Food Programme (WFP) still prefers to send the bulk of its humanitarian cargo by ship. At present, approximately 80 per cent. of deliveries of WFP food aid to Somalia are by sea.</p>

 No officials from the Department will have access to records held on ContactPoint. Once ContactPoint is deployed, local authority data controllers will have responsibility for the accuracy of records of children and young people ordinarily resident in their areas. Government Departments, local authorities and agencies&#151;for example the NHS, the Child Exploitation and Online Protection centre (CEOP), and the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service (CAFCASS)&#151;whose staff are responsible for safeguarding children and ensuring their well-being, and who need to use ContactPoint as part of their job, will be able to access and amend child records for children with whom they are working.

 We welcome the report &#145;Making ContactPoint Work&#146;, published last week by the Children&#146;s Rights Director for England, Roger Morgan. In fact, my Department specifically requested Roger Morgan to ask children what they thought of the proposals set out in draft Government guidance about ContactPoint. We acknowledge fully and understand that children and young people quite reasonably want reassurances about security and access.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_403"><a name="71203w0042.htm_para5"><a name="07120447000289">The views of children and young people are central to the development of ContactPoint. In fact, &#145;Making ContactPoint Work&#146;, representing the views of 62 children, is a small part of the overall consultation DCSF has undertaken with children and young people. More than 1,000 children have already been consulted about ContactPoint and overall findings have shown that, once young people understand what ContactPoint is, they usually agree it is a positive thing. The views and issues they raise have played, and continue to play, an important role in the development of ContactPoint. Further consultation with young people and parents and carers is planned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_404"><a name="71203w0042.htm_para6"><a name="07120447000290">Access to ContactPoint will be limited strictly to those who need it to do their job (currently estimated at around 330,000 practitioners). All users will be subject to stringent security controls and, before being granted access, must have completed mandatory face-to-face training, have obtained security clearance (including enhanced Criminal Records Bureau clearance) and have a user name, a password, a PIN and a security token to control their access to ContactPoint. Mandatory face-to-face training will include the safe and secure use of ContactPoint and the importance of compliance with the Data Protection Act 1998 and Human Rights Act 1998.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_405"><a name="71203w0042.htm_para7"><a name="07120447000291">To gain access to a child&#146;s record, all users will have to state clear reasons why they are accessing ContactPoint. All use of the system will be monitored and audited and every access to a child&#146;s record will be detailed in the ContactPoint audit trail. This will be regularly monitored by local authorities, using online User Activity Reports, to ensure that any misuse is detected and that appropriate action is taken.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_406"><a name="71203w0042.htm_para8"><a name="07120447000292">ContactPoint will include all children in England because it is not possible to predict accurately, in advance, which children will need additional services. Any child or young person could require the support of additional services at any time in their childhood. We want to support early intervention for children to help prevent situations becoming critical.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_407"><a name="71203w0042.htm_para9"><a name="07120447000293">Officials at the DCSF were briefed, on 20 November, by Treasury colleagues about the loss of the data at the HMRC. DCSF Ministers have been kept closely informed about how the issue is being dealt with at HMRC and the other agencies involved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_408"><a name="71203w0042.htm_para10"><a name="07120447000294">As soon as we were aware of the issue, we made contact with the Serious Organised Crime Agency, the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre and HM Treasury to identify any potential children&#146;s welfare issues. As child safety and welfare issues are an absolute priority for us, we are maintaining close contact with the agencies involved to ensure that we all remain vigilant to any child welfare issues that may arise.</p>

Friend the Secretary of State for Children Schools and Families, asked the Department&#146;s Permanent Secretary to conduct an immediate assessment of how personal data is stored and protected in the Department. The Permanent Secretary reported back within 24 hours to confirm the Department is confident that we have very robust procedures in place. In light of the security breach at the HMRC, we are continuing to check our procedures to ensure standards are as high as they can be. On Wednesday 21 November, the Prime Minister confirmed this approach when he asked all Departments to check their procedures for the storage and use of data. Given the obvious importance of ensuring that ContactPoint has extremely robust security measures in place, the Secretary of State, also on Tuesday 20 November, asked for an independent assessment of its security procedures, which will be conducted by Deloitte.</p>

DWP&#146; Employability Skills Programme learners in receipt of jobseeker&#146;s allowance and undertaking a programme of a minimum of 20 hours per week are eligible for help with child care costs. The discretionary Learner Support Fund allocated to providers by the Learning and Skills Council can be used to support child care costs for learners aged 20 and above. Some local European Social Funding allocations can also be used to support child care costs. This varies from project to project depending on the scope and purpose of the project. In addition to this, learning undertaken by parents through Family Literacy, Language and Numeracy can also offer child care provision in some places. This support is not mandatory but informal arrangements are made by a number of providers.</p>

 The Department has taken a number of steps to tackle child sexual exploitation, including publication in April 2006 of the updated &#145;Working Together to Safeguard Children&#146;, the main inter-agency guide to working together to safeguard and promote the welfare of children. &#145;Working Together&#146; stresses the need to treat children involved in prostitution and other forms of sexual exploitation primarily as the victims of abuse and advises that agencies should work together to develop local protocols. It also includes guidance for practitioners on sharing information with children&#146;s social care and the police about underage sexual activity, in response to recommendation 13 of the Bichard Inquiry Report, and sets out a number of considerations that practitioners should take into account in assessing when and how to share information about underage sexual activity. These include indicators of possible sexual exploitation. We have also established Local Safeguarding Children Boards, which have a role in co-ordinating work to safeguard children from sexual exploitation in each local area; and have published draft guidance to help agencies safeguard children who may have been trafficked. We are currently updating &#145;Safeguarding Children involved in prostitution&#146;, which was originally published in 2000 as supplementary guidance to the 1999 edition of &#145;Working Together&#146;.

 The Qualifications and Curriculum Authority is piloting new functional mathematics assessments at Entry Level to Level 2 for use both by young people and adults. These are being developed by awarding bodies to the functional skills standards, which have also been reflected in the new national Curriculum programmes of study at Key Stage 3 and Key Stage 4. I shall place copies of the latest version of the functional mathematics standards in the House Library. The standards include financial literacy skills, which are vital to equipping people with the skills they need to operate in life and at work. The functional skills standards at Entry Level 1 include note and coin recognition. Entry Level 1 is of comparable standard to National Curriculum Level 1&#151;the study done during Key Stage 1&#151;and is being designed to be suitable for those needing to develop very basic mathematics skills.</p>

 Since 2006 the Music Standards Fund has comprised two elements.

received a new allocation through the Music Standards Fund grant, of &#163;3million in 2006-07 and &#163;23 million in 2007-08, to be devolved to schools serving Key Stage 2 pupils. This allocation allows primary and special schools themselves to begin buying in instrumental and vocal tuition at Key Stage 2, either from the Local Authority Music Service or from other local providers. We understand that in many local authorities schools have decided to buy in support from their local music service. In each of the years from 2008-09 to 2010-11 the whole &#163;82 million available will go to local authorities to support the new music education ambitions set out on 21 November. However, they will be expected to secure the agreement of the School Forums as to its precise use.</p>

There are 192 providers of initial teacher training in England. In 2005-06, 54 were inspected; in 2006-07, 73 were inspected; in 2007-08 Ofsted is scheduled to inspect the remaining 70 providers. Ofsted is therefore on target (192 scheduled inspections, three re-inspections, one early inspection on behalf of the TDA and one inspection spread over two years) to complete the inspection of initial teacher training within the agreed time limit for the current initial teacher training Framework.</p>

(Registered children's home must have two inspections during every 12 month period). Since April 1,673 inspections have been completed. We are confident that, although the timescale is demanding, Ofsted remains on target to complete each inspection cycle.</p>

 The School Food Trust (SFT) will shortly be publishing &#145;A guide to introducing the Government's food-based and nutrient-based standards for school lunches&#146;. It will be available on the SFT website in early December, and hard copies will be distributed to stakeholders including schools, local authorities and catering providers. The guide will explain the standards and give advice on implementing and monitoring them.</p>

All achieved the standards including the iron target with slight modifications to lunchtime provision. Details of these pilots will be published in the guide. Similar pilots in 12 secondary schools are currently being run; the results will be published next year.</p>

 At the beginning of the financial year, local authorities are required to provide to the Governors of a school a budget based upon the number of pupils on roll at the School Census in the previous January. In order to provide stability to schools, that budget may not be amended after the start of the financial year and schools are therefore required to organise within that budget for the whole year, taking into consideration admission numbers. No adjustments may be made, regardless of whether a pupil leaves or joins and there may be turnover in both directions. Local authorities may, however, choose to include within their formula a factor for schools with significantly rising rolls. This is likely to be based upon an estimate of numbers where it is anticipated there will be a significant influx of pupils arriving after the School Census is taken the previous January, or a factor which provides additional funds in the following financial year.</p>

The grant is approx &#163;179 million in 2007-08, rising to &#163;206 million in 2011. Longstanding guidance and funding is in place to support schools in teaching English as an additional language. Furthermore, the New Arrivals Excellence Programme (NAEP), launched in July 2007 gives support, advice, guidance and training to schools in offering the best provision for learning EAL. Selected local authorities with schools that have little experience of integrating children who are new arrivals will have access to outreach support from a dedicated Regional Adviser. This will ensure they can access the curriculum as quickly as possible.</p>

1. The revenue funding per pupil figures only run to 2005-06 because we cannot provide a consistent time series beyond that year as the introduction of the Dedicated Schools Grant (DSG) in 2006-07 fundamentally changed how local authorities are funded. The 2003-04 to 2005-06 figures are based on education formula spending (EFS) which formed the education part of the Local Government Finance Settlement, plus various grants. This was an assessment of what local authorities needed to fund education rather than what they spent. In 2006-07 funding for schools changed with the introduction of the DSG which is based largely on an authority's previous spending.<br>
2. In addition, DSG has a different coverage to EFS: EFS comprised a schools block and an LEA block (to cover LEA central functions) whereas DSG only covers the school block. LEA block items are still funded through DCLG&#146;s Local Government Finance Settlement but education items cannot be separately identified. This means we have a break in our time series as the two sets of data are not comparable, an alternative time series is currently under development.<br>
3. Price Base: Real terms at 2006-07 prices, based on GDP deflators as at 26 September 2007.<br>
4. Some of the grant allocations have not been finalised. If these do change, the effect on the funding figures is expected to be minimal.<br>

 It is not possible to estimate the number of schools receiving only the guaranteed level of funding provided for by the Minimum Funding Guarantee for 2008-09. To do this would require known pupil numbers for the financial year (which are not counted until January 2008), and the individual formulae of each authority along with any changes to those factors proposed for 2008-09.</p>

 Members of an interim executive board (IEB) are chosen and appointed in individual school cases by the appropriate authority, which may be either the local authority (LA) or the Secretary of State. When the Secretary of State considers an LA&#146;s application for an IEB to replace a governing body, he will give particular attention to whether the membership of the Board represents the right mix of skills and experience to meet the school&#146;s needs. In the majority of cases, the LA&#146;s proposals contain one or more officers from that authority, and where this is not proposed the Secretary of State sometimes invites the LA to consider such membership. In other cases, the Secretary of State has invited extra membership from experienced professionals outside the LA, to secure an independent view on the Board.</p>

 The EYFS defines milestones in the form of Early Learning Goals which provide the basis for assessing children&#146;s development at the end of the EYFS&#151;normally at the end of reception class. Children&#146;s progress during, and at the end of the EYFS (age five) when the Early Years Foundation Stage Profile will be completed, are based on observational assessment of them in everyday activities, by practitioners using their professional judgement. One of the 13 scales used to assess young children&#146;s development at age five relates to physical development. Targets both at national level and local authority level relate to overall achievement across the Foundation Stage Profile, rather than specific targets relating to the physical development.</p>

<i> [holding answer 29 November 2007]:</i><i> </i>The Government are committed to reducing substance misuse among young people, including that relating to alcohol. In June of this year, the Government published the updated Alcohol Strategy for England, &#147;Safe. Sensible.

As part of this strategy, this Department has committed to:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_483"><a name="71203w0056.htm_para5"><a name="07120447005830">Alcohol education continues to be a vital element of our approach. The Department&#146;s guidance, &#147;Drugs: Guidance for Schools (DfES 2004)&#148; is clear that pupils&#146; education about alcohol and its effects should start in primary school, before drinking patterns become established and should be revisited as pupils&#146; understanding and experience increases.</p>

 The Department does not collect this information. Most trusts will have some accommodation stock for which they will charge, and it is unlikely that they will provide it at no cost to the doctor unless there is a contractual, statutory or service need. In such cases, arrangements to provide free accommodation will inevitably be subject to scrutiny to assess any tax liability on the benefit.</p>

 We are advised by the Food Standards Agency (FSA) that genetically modified (GM) crops may be used in animal feed in the European Union provided they have been authorised and that a safety assessment forms a key part of the authorisation process. GM food is subject to a similar, rigorous, safety assessment before being permitted to enter the food chain.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_512"><a name="71203w0059.htm_para2"><a name="07120476000415">The labelling requirements for GM food are set out in the directly applicable Regulations (EC) Nos. 1829/2003 (GM Food and Feed) and 1830/2003 (Traceability and Labelling of GM Organisms), the intention of which is to facilitate consumer choice. There is no requirement for food produced from animals fed on GM feed to be labelled as such, nor is there any provision for &#145;non-GM&#146; and &#145;GM free&#146; labelling. We are advised by the FSA that such labelling may, however, be used on a voluntary basis, as appropriate to the product concerned. The FSA has expressed the view that the use of the terms &#145;non-GM&#146; and &#145;GM free&#146; should mean that food labelled in this way is completely free from the use of GM technology.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_513"><a name="71203w0059.htm_para3"><a name="07120476000416">Local authorities are responsible for enforcement of the legislation at retail level and checks for the presence of GM material in foods on the basis of sampling form part of their enforcement activities. Local authorities also carry out checks on documentation to ensure that the traceability requirements are being met. These enforcement activities play an important role in consumer protection.</p>

Due to reasons of confidentiality, figures between 1 and 5 have been suppressed and replaced with &#147;*&#148; (an asterisk). &#147;&#151;&#147; represents zero.<br>
<i> All Diagnoses count of episodes</i><br>
These figures represent a count of all FCE&#146;s where the diagnosis was mentioned in any of the 14(7 prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in a Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) record.<br>
Diagnosis code used: K70.3 Alcoholic Cirrhosis of Liver.<br>
<i> Assessing growth through time</i><br>
HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. During the years that these records have been collected the NHS there have been ongoing improvements in quality and coverage. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series.<br>
Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example a number of procedures may. now be undertaken in outpatient settings and may no longer be accounted in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.<br>
<i> Data Quality</i><br>
HES are compiled from data sent by over 300 NHS trusts and PCTs in England. The Information Centre for Health and Social Care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. Whilst this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br>
<i> FCE</i><br>
A FCE is defined as a period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. Please note that the figures do not represent the number of patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the year.<br>
<i> Ungrossed Data</i><br>
Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).<br>

<i> [holding answer 29 November 2007]:</i> Tarceva is licensed for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer whose cancer has continued to grow despite having chemotherapy. The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence is currently appraising Tarceva for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. Final guidance is expected to be published April 2008.

Some, such as a minor relocation of existing premises, are decided administratively by the primary care trust (PCT) without prior notification while others are subject to quite extensive notification.

 The Government sympathize with those affected by the closure of First Solution.

An agreement has been reached on the sale of the company&#146;s assets which, in the opinion of the official receiver, will provide the best possible outcome for its creditors. In the context of the agreement reached on the Payment Services Directive (PSD) in April 2007, the Government have committed to bring money transfer companies into regulation from November 2009. The Treasury will launch a consultation on the implementation of the PSD before the end of the year.</p>

The National Statistics method for estimating the number of migrant workers employed in the UK is routinely based on the number of people at a given time who were born abroad, are of working age (16-64 for men, 16-59 for women). This question has been answered on this basis. It means, for example, that some people who are UK nationals will be included in the total of "foreign born" and that people who are working but are above state pension age are not included.</p>

<i> [holding answer 27 November 2007]:</i> Annual UK goods import volumes from the EU27 have grown by 13 per cent. on average over the last two years. Comparable import volumes of services figures are not available. A country specific breakdown is not available for import volumes to the UK. Using current price imports, the two biggest EU27 countries exporting to the UK in 2005 were Germany and France exporting &#8364;71.5 billion and &#8364;44.2 billion respectively, the country that exported the least to the UK is Estonia (&#8364;0.4 billion). The returns received by the EU27 on investments in the UK in 2006 were &#163;89.8 billion. This was 1.4 per cent. of total EU27 (excluding the UK) GDP. This was up from &#163;70.2 billion, 1.1 per cent. of EU27 GDP, in 2005. The estimate of jobs linked to trade with the EU is not available on a country-by-country basis.</p>

 In response to the continuing security and humanitarian crisis in Chad, in September the UK co-sponsored UN Security Council Resolution 1778, which authorises the deployment of an EU force (EUFOR) and a UN multidimensional mission (MINURCAT) to Chad. The force aims to contribute to the stabilisation of the regions in eastern Chad and north eastern Central African Republic which border Sudan. Improved security will facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid and help create the conditions necessary for voluntary, secure and sustainable return of refugees and internally displaced persons. EUFOR and MINURCAT support the larger African Union/UN mission to Darfur, which is mandated to protect civilians and is in the process of being deployed.</p>

The EU is also sponsoring a process of dialogue between President Deby and the political opposition forces in Chad, which should contribute to creating a more stable political environment in which to promote peace. The UK takes every opportunity to call on the governments of Chad and Sudan to fulfil their obligations under the Tripoli agreement, which calls for a ceasefire between Chad and Sudan, and an end to support for armed movements, which destabilise  the region.</p>

Discussions among EU partners are currently under way on what human rights issues should feature on the agenda for the next human rights dialogue, although a date for the dialogue has not yet been agreed.

 It is a condition of their employment that members of the diplomatic service must be prepared to serve anywhere in the world at any time during their career, sometimes at very short notice. Those with children also have a legal obligation as parents to ensure that their children receive a full-time education from the age of five years. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) helps staff meet these potentially conflicting obligations by providing financial support for their children's education in the UK (or overseas, where free state schooling in English is not available locally).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_588"><a name="71203w0069.htm_para0"><a name="071204103000119">With staff and families having to move at regular intervals, sometimes at times which may disrupt schooling for their children, and education facilities at posts overseas varying, continuity of education can prove problematic particularly during the important exam years. The FCO addresses this problem by providing a continuity of education allowance to enable children to board at schools in the UK, while their parents remain subject to the world-wide mobility obligation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_589"><a name="71203w0069.htm_para1"><a name="071204103000120">The amounts we have spent each year on financial support for the costs of private education in the UK and travel for visits by children to their parents during school holidays are set out in the following table. We have also listed the number of staff in receipt of the allowance (where known) and the number of children who have benefited.</p>

 The UK believes that strong popular support is key to the success of enlargement and fully supports initiatives ensuring that citizens better understand the process of enlargement. The UK notes that the most recent Eurobarometer Report (April to May 2007), found that 57 per cent. of Turks polled replied that EU membership would be a good thing. The UK has not conducted an independent assessment of levels of support for EU accession among Turkish Cypriots. However, our contacts with a range of Turkish Cypriot interlocutors and recent polls indicate that support for EU accession is waning. This underlines the need for the speedy implementation of the UN's 8 July 2006 Agreement leading to a just, comprehensive and durable settlement of benefit to all Cypriots, as well as the implementation of the EU Commission's projects which will improve the quality of life of ordinary Turkish Cypriots and bring them closer to the EU.</p>

 The leadership of the Lord&#146;s Resistance Army (LRA) remains publicly supportive of the Juba peace talks. The Government welcome the current consultations being carried out in northern Uganda between the victims of the conflict and the LRA negotiating team. We are hopeful that a deal can be concluded early in 2008, but recognise that several difficult issues still need to be resolved.</p>

 The UK plays a prominent role in building and maintaining the coalition of anti-whaling countries within the International Whaling Commission (IWC). In advance of the 2007 annual meeting in Anchorage, the UK and its like-minded allies recruited a further six countries into the IWC, with the net result that the pro-whaling majority in that organisation was overturned. In a further response to UK lobbying efforts, several other countries have indicated willingness to support our opposition to Japanese whaling and to join the IWC in time for next year&#146;s annual meeting.</p>

 The UK believes that any scientific whaling should be confined to non-lethal research, and should be undertaken only if relevant proposals have been approved by the Scientific Committee of the International Whaling Commission (IWC).</p>

However, &#145;Scientific purposes&#146; are not defined by the Convention. Furthermore, we doubt that the authors of the Convention anticipated that parties would undertake research on the scale now practised by Japan.</p>

They state that a range of information is needed for the management and conservation of whales, such as population, age structure, growth rates, reproductive rates, feeding&#151;and that this can only be obtained through lethal research.</p>
