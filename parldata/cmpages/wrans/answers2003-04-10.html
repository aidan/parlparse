To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills if he will make a statement on the performance of specialist schools.  [107641]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30410w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 In 2002, specialist schools' 5+ A*-C GCSE/GNVQ performance was on average 6 percentage points higher than the equivalent performance in maintained, mainstream non-specialist schools (54.9 per cent. vs 48.9 per cent.).
<P>

<a name="30410w01.html_para10">Research carried out by Professor David Jesson (University of York) shows that the performance of each cohort of specialist schools and City Technology Colleges (from 1994 to 2001) has improved more than schools that were non-specialist at the time, with the exception of the 1996 and 1997 cohorts (see following table). This research excluded grammar schools, which, however, form a very similar percentage of both specialist schools and non-specialist schools.

 'Combat Identification' is the term we use to describe the capacity to distinguish between friend, foe and neutrals in modern joint and coalition military operations. Effective Combat Identification is delivered through the combination of three elements: Situational Awareness (knowledge of what is happening in the battlespace), Target Identification (the ability to positively identify a target within the battlespace), and Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (including such measures as the use of recognition devices on vehicles and the clear definition of areas of operation). Because it is so key to overall operational effectiveness, Combat Identification is a characteristic spread across a wide

 On 28 March 2003, RFA Sir Galahad delivered some 300 tonnes of humanitarian aid at Umm Qasr, Iraq. The load included 100 tonnes of bottled water and 187 tonnes of food. This has been, and will continue to be distributed, as required, across an expanding area of operations. It is not accurate, therefore, to characterise the amount as 'days of supplies'. However, a large number of people in southern Iraq will benefit from the delivery.
<P>

<a name="30410w03.html_para9">Also, as part of humanitarian aid emergency packs, the load carried two and a half tonnes of blankets and half a tonne of plastic sheeting (normally intended to shelter the supplies, if required). None of this was specifically to provide shelter nor has this been found to be a particular requirement.

<a name="30410w04.html_para6">There has been no research into the relative efficiency of condensing boilers and micro CHP heating systems. Research into the efficiency of conventional and condensing boilers led to the development of the SEDBUK (Seasonal Efficiency of a Domestic Boiler in the UK) procedure. The SEDBUK procedure can be used to demonstrate that boiler efficiency meets the requirements of Part LI of the Building Regulations. At present the SEDBUK database of boilers (which can be viewed at www.sedbuk.com) does not include micro CHP systems because a means of taking the electrical energy benefit into account in the efficiency rating has yet to be developed.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister if he will publish the calculation used by his Department to reach the conclusion that the forthcoming change in national insurance contributions would increase local authorities' pay costs on average by 0.7 per cent. [106176]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30410w04.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The changes to employers' national insurance contributions announced in the Budget will raise revenue by &#163;4.0 billion in 2003&#150;04. This puts pay costs up on average by about 0.7 per cent. across the economy, calculated by expressing the increase as a percentage of the total pay bill in the economy and allowing for the element on which NICs are not paid. At the time of the Spending Review, we looked at the actual total local authority pay bill for 2000&#150;01, including pay, national insurance, pension contributions and other costs. This was then uprated by an assumption for pay increases to estimate the first year direct costs. The precise cost will be dependent on a number of factors including the actual pay award and the number of part-time staff employed by local government.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what assessment he has made of the additional cost to local authorities in a full year of the recently announced extension of TUPE provisions in PFI and PPP contract arrangements.  [106993]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30410w04.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Leslie: </B> 
 Clauses 102 and 103 of the Local Government Bill confer new powers on the Secretary of State, the National Assembly for Wales and Scottish Ministers to require best value authorities, in contracting with other persons for the provision of services or in circumstances where a contracted-out service is brought back in-house, to deal with staff transfer matters (employment and pensions) in accordance with any directions made. This will enable the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister to meet its commitment, following the Best Value Review to make statutory within local government the policy set out in the Cabinet Office "Statement of Practice on Staff Transfers in the Public Sector" and the Annex to it, "A Fair Deal for Staff Pensions".
<P>

<a name="30410w04.html_para7">The Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) published when the Bill was introduced contained estimates of cost based on data from a Local Government Management Board (LGMB) survey carried out in 1998. This survey found that up to 12 per cent. of local authority staff transferred without TUPE applying and up to 35 per cent. transferred without a broadly comparable pension. This figure represents contracts entered into in any one year but is calculated over the full term of the contract.
<P>

<a name="30410w04.html_para8">The RIA estimated that for England and Wales the additional cost of protecting employees' terms and conditions could equate to almost &#163;5.5 million. The additional cost of protecting employees' pension provision was estimated to be almost &#163;21 million (the survey indicated that fewer contracts contained pension provision in the past). Therefore the total additional cost of protecting transferees' terms and conditions and pension provision could amount to almost &#163;27 million.




<P>
<P><I>10 Apr 2003 : Column 357W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="30410w04.html_para9">These estimates, however, illustrate a maximum possible cost scenario and because of policy and legislative changes since the survey was carried out, we do not consider that the shortfall is likely to be more than a few per cent. The RIA therefore made an assumption that if only 2 per cent. of employees currently transfer without TUPE and 6 per cent. currently transfer without a broadly comparable pension, then the additional cost of protecting these employees would amount to approximately &#163;4.5 million.
<P>

<a name="30410w04.html_para10">A revised RIA will be published shortly reflecting amendments made to the Bill during Standing Committee to extend the provisions to Scotland.

 No assessment has been undertaken to measure percentage of household batteries recycled in 2002. However, the current recycling rate is estimated to be less than 2 per cent. for the UK.
<P>

<a name="30410w07.html_para4">An EC Batteries Directive is currently being negotiated that will set targets for the collection and recycling of automotive, industrial and consumer (or household) batteries. In anticipation of these targets, the Government have set up a major pilot project to study the collection and recycling of consumer batteries in Bristol. The results of the pilot will be made available to all local authorities. Other pilot collection schemes involving industry, local authorities and/or waste management companies include those in Lancashire, Cheshire, Dorset, Barnet and Ealing.

The Department for International Development (DFID) is helping to improve economic conditions in Moldova primarily through the Poverty Reduction Strategy Process (PRSP) and directly through support to the Medium Term Expenditure Framework in partnership with the Ministry of Finance. Under the Partnership and Co-operation Agreement with the EU, Moldovan exports receive Most Favoured Nation (MFN) treatment. Also as a developing country, Moldova benefits from the EC's Generalised System of Preferences (GSP). Further market oriented reforms must take place in Moldova for economic conditions to improve.

The Government were disappointed that the WTO's 31 March deadline to establish modalities for a new agreement on agriculture was not met. Agricultural trade reform remains critical for developing countries and is central to the Doha Development Agenda as a whole. WTO members must now redouble their efforts to reach consensus on agriculture by the 5th meeting of the WTO Ministerial Conference in Cancun this September. We are working with all our EU partners, including the European Commission and France, to ensure that the EU plays its full part in bringing this about.

 The National Asylum Support Service (NASS) has not taken legal action against any of its contractors. NASS is aware that one of its contractors has been involved in a dispute with a former sub-contractor. NASS was not directly involved in this dispute. Their concern was for the safety of asylum seekers placed in accommodation affected by the dispute.

<P>
<UL>Beverley Hughes: The Home Office is responsible for meeting the direct needs of destitute asylum seekers and their dependants (accommodation and subsistence). Services such as education and health are provided in the same way as they are for anyone else moving into an area. Local Education Authorities (LEAs) have a statutory duty to ensure that education is available for all children of compulsory school age in their area, irrespective of a child's immigration status or rights of residence in a particular location. The Department for Education and 



<P>
</UL><P><I>10 Apr 2003 : Column 382W</I><P>
<UL>Skills has produced guidance on supporting the education of asylum seeking and refugee children which covers good practice at both LEA and school level. The Department of Health is responsible for issuing guidance to primary care trusts/local authority social services respectively. Regional consortia have been established in each region of the UK and these include representatives from local councils, the education authorities and the National Health Service. Generally speaking asylum seekers are not allowed to work whilst their application for asylum is under consideration and no guidance is issued to Job Centres.
<P>
The Legal Services Commission has entered into contracts with competent legal representatives to provide legal representation to asylum seekers. The voluntary sector is grant funded by the National Asylum Support Service to provide one stop services in dispersal areas to assist asylum seekers.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30410w10.html_spnew11"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 The accommodation provided by the National Asylum Support Service (NASS) is chosen on the basis of suitability to house asylum seekers and their dependants within the cluster areas throughout the United Kingdom. The cluster areas are ideally based in towns and cities where suitable accommodation is available and where there is potential to provide a link with existing multi-cultural communities and to develop the support of local voluntary and community groups.
<P>

<a name="30410w10.html_para15">The accommodation within the cluster areas is also located within a three mile radius of the main post office. If the accommodation is located outside of this three mile radius, it is the responsibility of the accommodation provider to cover the cost of travel to the main post office in order for asylum seekers to collect their support payments. There is no requirement for accommodation to be provided within a certain distance of the railway station in each cluster area.

 Yes. As part of the drive towards more co-ordinated preventive services, IRT systems aim to improve information sharing between agencies working with children and young people at risk before the situation reaches crisis point.

2. The Commission for Racial Equality (CRE) had credit control problems with service providers in 2001&#150;02 which resulted in a significant number of invoices being kept back, creating a backlog of payments. The Commission have been making a special effort to improve their payment performance in 2002&#150;03 and this is reflected in a considerable improvement in the figures, with 77 per cent. paid within terms compared with 56 per cent. in the previous year (figures provided by CRE).<P>

<P>
<a name="30410w11.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Bob Ainsworth: </B> 
 The Government have long been committed to greater openness in the EU Institutions. This was a key theme of the UK Presidencies in 1992 and 1998. Making it easier to gain access to non-sensitive documents is crucial to this. The Government welcomed Regulation 1049&#150;2001 regarding public access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents. As a result, more documents are released to the public, whilst genuinely sensitive documents are given the protection they need.
<P>

<a name="30410w11.html_para2">Much of the Council's work takes place in preparatory bodies, including working groups. Negotiations at all levels are generally held in private. However the Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) Council occasionally holds open debates on general policy subjects. Discussions at the JHA Council are also reported by written answers to PQs in both Houses or by letter to the Parliamentary Scrutiny Committees during Recesses.
<P>

<a name="30410w11.html_para3">Accountability and transparency of Council business to Parliament are ensured by the scrutiny process, to which the Government are also firmly committed. The scrutiny process offers the opportunity for Parliamentary oversight of proposals which are under negotiation in all but a few cases, such as agreement with third countries, which remain confidential during their negotiation. All deposited documents are placed in the Library and the Scrutiny Committees publish their reports, together with Ministerial correspondence relating to the proposals, on their websites (www.parliament.uk). Home Office Ministers regularly give oral evidence to the Scrutiny Committees of both Houses.
<P>

<a name="30410w11.html_para4">We strongly supported the measures agreed at the Seville European Council to make the Council more open when in legislating mode. We remain committed to increasing transparency. The Future of European Convention is also looking at ways to make the EU more open, including through proposals for the Council to meet in public when it is discussing a legislative proposal.

 Providing the application for further leave is made before expiry of the current leave, an outright refusal is an immigration decision within the terms of section 82(2)<i>(d)</i> of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, and accordingly, attracts a suspensive right of appeal under section 82(1).
<P>

<a name="30410w11.html_para5">A person who fails to leave the United Kingdom voluntarily after this process, or who applied out of time for further humanitarian protection leave and was refused, is an overstayer. A decision to remove an overstayer is an immigration decision under section 82(2)<i>(g)</i>, and again, attracts a right of appeal under section 82(1). This appeal is suspensive if an asylum or human rights claim has been made in the United Kingdom.
<P>

<a name="30410w11.html_para6">In either case, all the grounds listed in section 84(1) of the Act may be cited in the appeal, in particular, that removal would breach the appellant's rights under the Refugee Convention or the Human Rights Act.

 The Nationality, Asylum and Immigration Act 2002 created a new offence of trafficking for the purpose of controlling someone through prostitution, the relevant sections of which came into force on 10 February 2003.

 Intelligence gathered by the Immigration Service shows that significant numbers of people who had been accepted as refugees elsewhere were coming to the UK and making asylum applications in false identities. We considered that suspending the UK's operation of the 1959 Council of Europe Agreement, which allowed refugees settled in certain countries to visit the UK without a visa, was a necessary step to tackle this abuse.

 On 28 March the UN Security Council unanimously approved resolution 1472 giving the Secretary General authority to adapt the Oil for Food Programme (OFF) to changed circumstances so that it could continue to operate. While the UN, Red Cross and NGOs can provide assistance to cover a short gap in the OFF, with 16 million Iraqis totally dependant on the Programme and most families partially dependent, it is essential that the OFF fully resumes as soon as possible. The World Food Programme (WFP) concluded contracts last week to buy a further 400,000 metric tonnes of food aid for Iraq, which they intend to use to replenish the OFF distribution system. But they will only reach people if we can keep the distribution system in place. This means helping Iraqis keep 55,000 separate outlets across the country operating. The WFP is taking a lead in monitoring and supporting the distribution network.

 The Government have long been committed to greater openness in the EU Institutions. This was a key theme of the UK Presidencies in 1992 and 1998. Making it easier to gain access to non-sensitive documents is crucial to this. The Government welcomed Regulation 1049/2001 regarding public access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents. As a result, more documents are released to the public, while genuinely sensitive documents are given the protection they need.

 OGC buying solutions framework agreements are awarded following a competitive tender process in full accordance with EC rules. The main criterion for award is the acceptance of the most economically advantageous offer (i.e. value for money). The sub criteria include adherence to product specification, price, service delivery capability and whole life costs. Qualitative and whole life costs criteria will include relevant environmental factors such as energy savings, recyclability and disposal costs. As requested, a copy of the most recent relevant advertisement in the <i>Official Journal</i> of the European Communities has been provided.

<i>Notes</i>:<P>

<P>

<sup>(14)</sup> Transco's mains replacement programme originally ran on a calendar year basis. In 2001, this was changed to a financial year i.e. a 15month period. However, because the improvement notice required the work to be completed by 31 December 2002, Transco continued to provide data on progress with Medium Pressure Ductile Iron Mains (MPDI) replacement on a calendar year basis i.e. January to December.<P>

<P>

<sup>(15)</sup> The forecast for the 02/03 other mains replacement policy was revised downwards because the focus of Transco's work was on the compulsory work being carried out to meet the requirements of the Medium Pressure Ductile Iron Mains Replacement Policy.<P>

<P>

<P>

<a name="30410w16.html_para9">HSE's current assessment is that Transco will meet the revised forecast target for 2002&#150;03. The data for the full year will be available shortly.

 <i>[holding answer 9 April 2003]:</i> The administration of Job Centre Plus is a matter for the Acting Chief Executive of Job Centre Plus, Clare Dodgson. She will write to my hon. Friend.

<a name="30410w18.html_para1"><i>Letter from Clare Dodgson to Mr. Dismore</i>, <i>dated 10 April 2003</i>:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>As Jobcentre Plus is an Executive Agency, the Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your questions about future plans for Hendon Jobcentre Plus offices and the level of consultation which has taken place in relation to this. These are issues which fell within my responsibilities as Acting Chief Executive of the Agency.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Jobcentre Plus Vision incorporates a commitment to continuously improve the quality, accessibility and delivery of services to all working age customers. Already, the Jobcentre Plus 



<P>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Pathfinder offices have begun to demonstrate a very different model of service, which has been widely welcomed by our customers.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>As part of the national roll-out programme for Jobcentre Plus, it was necessary to consider the services provided to our customers within each District. It became clear that we needed to review the existing estate and in some cases rationalise the accommodation in Jobcentre Plus and Social Security Offices. The aim of the review is to enable Jobcentre Plus to deliver a better, more focused and cost effective customer service.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Within the North London District, the current service provision at the Hendon and Edgware Social Security Offices (SSOs) was reviewed. Various options were considered as part of this process and the favoured option was in providing National Insurance Number interviews at Hendon, and benefit enquiries/payments at Edgware. It was proposed that by centralising the customer services between the two sites, an overall improvement of service would be achieved. There are good transport links by bus between Hendon and Edgware and customers will be able to access services at both locations regardless of where they live.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The staff affected by the changes to the Hendon and Edgware SSOs have been consulted. The Trade Union and staff directly involved with the proposed changes, were issued with a copy of the proposal on 4 April. Their comments on the proposal are due to be returned by 18 April.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>After considering the feedback, MPs and external organisations will then be formally notified of the proposed changes and comments will be invited. The proposed deadline for comments on the proposal is expected to be 2 May 2003.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Decisions on the longer term plans for provision of Jobcentre Plus services in Hendon and Edgware will not be taken until nearer the proposed roll-out date, which is anticipated to be in 2005&#150;06. This is when we expect to have the fully integrated model, currently operating in the Pathfinder Districts, to be introduced in the North London District.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Burnt Oak Jobcentre was part of Brent, Harrow and Hillingdon District and is situated in the HA8 postcode area. Based on the rollout plan for this district for 2002&#150;03, a decision was taken to close this stand-alone Jobcentre, which provided only a limited job broking service. Benefit customers have not been affected. Brent, Harrow and Hillingdon have been putting together these proposals over the course of the past nine months, during which time the local trade union has been kept closely in touch with developments. Although we did not consult customers themselves, we did write to customer representative groups including Community Mental Health teams, the London Homeless services team, local Citizens' Advice Bureaux and local businesses at the same time as we wrote to you and to other local Members of Parliament about the service delivery plan for the Brent, Harrow and Hillingdon Jobcentre Plus district.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I regret that you feel that the letter informing you of the plans for Burnt Oak Jobcentre was unclear. I have reviewed the guidance covering these circumstances and put in place arrangements to help ensure we are clearer about proposals and plans in the future. I have instructed my District Managers to state when writing to Members of Parliament and stakeholders the actual names of any offices they are considering closing as part of their Jobcentre Plus Service Delivery Plans.</FONT></UL>
