The Strategic Rail Authority (SRA) encourages all train operating companies to tailor their provisions for the carriage of cycles on trains to the demand on particular routes while recognising that cycle provision cannot be considered in isolation but must have regard to the needs of all other rail users. The SRA has recently carried out a consultation of cycle policy and will be publishing a detailed cycle policy in due course. Copies of their Cycle Policy Consultation Document are available in the Libraries of the House.

 Of the 25 franchised train operators, three carry bicycles on all services without requiring prior reservation, six carry bicycles on all their services but do require prior reservation, one does not require prior reservation but restricts bicycles to off-peak times only and the remaining 15 require both prior reservation and restrict bicycles to off-peak times only. All franchised train operators have a maximum number of cycles which can be carried on any particular train.

<p><a name="40913w01.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 The Strategic Rail Authority (SRA) collects annual Passengers in Excess of Capacity (PiXC) census data every autumn for all London Commuter Train Operating Companies. Last year&#039;s figures for c2c indicate an overall PiXC figure of 1 per cent. (morning plus evening combined) against the threshold of 4.5 per cent.. This was the lowest of the 10 London Commuter TOCs, for which the total was 2.7 per cent.

<p><a name="40913w01.html_spnew7"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 None. The redeployment of rolling stock was agreed by the Strategic Rail Authority to cover a potential shortfall in rolling stock which was identified elsewhere on the network as a result of the West Coast Route Modernisation programme. The 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>13 Sept 2004 : Column 1391W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
redeployment is not permanent and it is envisaged that the rolling stock will return to c2c once new trains have entered service on the West Coast Main Line.

<a name="40913w01.html_sbhd4"><h3 align=center>Car Noise</h3>





<p><a name="40913w01.html_wqn8"><b> Chris Grayling: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what his policy is on maximum noise levels from straight-through car exhausts on customised cars.  [187389]</p>








<p><a name="40913w01.html_spnew8"><b> Mr. Jamieson: </b> 
 Only new cars are subject to maximum noise limits. However, Regulation 54 of the Road Vehicles (Construction and Use) Regulations 1986 does set minimum requirements for the maintenance of exhaust systems and silencers for cars, and other vehicles, in use. This requires that they be fitted with a silencer, that the silencer is maintained in good and efficient working order and has not been altered so as to increase noise. The Regulations also make it an offence to use a car in such a manner as to cause excessive noise that could have been avoided by the exercise of reasonable care on the part of the driver. It is likely that a straight-through exhaust, whether used on a customised car or any other vehicle, would be in breach of this requirement. Enforcement, however, is a matter for the police.

<p><a name="40913w01.html_spnew9"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 Cross London Rail Links Ltd (CLRL), a joint venture company currently owned by Transport for London and the Strategic Rail Authority, was set up to develop and promote the Crossrail project.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40913w01.html_para2">
Total expenditure to date on consultation by CLRL is &#163;3,466,500. &#163;2,170,500 was spent on the first round of consultation (September 2003 to January 2004) that I asked CLRL to undertake to explain to the public in more detail their proposed scheme, and to canvass views on their route proposals. The remaining &#163;1,296,000 is the cost to date of the second round of consultation, on CLRL&#039;s preferred route, which began in August 2004, following my right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State&#039;s Statement to the House on 20 July announcing the decision to introduce a hybrid Bill for Crossrail at the earliest opportunity. The costs include salary costs of CLRL staff.

<p><a name="40913w01.html_spnew10"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 In May 2001, Cross London Rail Links (CLRL) was provided with ring-fenced funding of &#163;154 million for the purposes of developing Crossrail. CLRL has spent &#163;62.5 million to the end of financial year 2003&#150;04, with a further &#163;42.5 million budgeted for the current year. This would leave &#163;49 million of the original &#163;154 million available for developing the scheme after March 2005.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what powers <i>(a)</i> he has and <i>(b)</i> are vested in local authorities to prevent motorised vehicles from blocking cycleways including those on the highway; and what plans he has to ensure that cycleways are not blocked by motorised vehicles.  [188379]</p>








<p><a name="40913w02.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 Parking enforcement is a matter for the police or, where local authorities have acquired decriminalised parking enforcement powers, those authorities.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40913w02.html_para0">
It is an offence under section 21 of the Road Traffic Act 1988 to park a motor vehicle wholly or partly on a track provided for use by pedal cyclists. Parking in a cycle lane marked on a carriageway for the use of cyclists may be prohibited by means of a traffic regulation order made under the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984. The restriction would be indicated by yellow lines and may operate 24 hours a day or for a more limited period. It is an offence under sections 5 or 8 of the 1984 Act to contravene such an order.

<p><a name="40913w02.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Jamieson: </b> 
 Gloucester Safer City Project addressed safety issues on the roads in Gloucester and implemented measures to improve safety for cyclists along approximately 15 km of the carriageway. Off road cycleways were not part of the project. However, cycle lanes were provide in Elmbridge Road, Finlay Road, Cheltenham Road, Stroud Road and Bristol Road. In addition, on the Stroud Road the cycle lane was taken on to the footway for part of its route and in Metz Way the off-road cycle route was improved.

<p><a name="40913w02.html_spnew6"><b> Mr. Jamieson: </b> 
 I have had no such discussions. Regulations are already in place to ensure that passengers of any age or size can be carried safely, when they are complied with. These include a requirement for passengers to wear a securely fastened safety helmet and to sit astride a properly fixed seat, with their feet reaching suitable supports or rests. Only motorcyclists who have passed a motorcycle test may carry passengers.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport how many of the <i>(a)</i> deaths and <i>(b)</i> serious injuries on roads were attributable to speed in the last year for which figures are available.  [186763]</p>








<p><a name="40913w03.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Darling: </b> 
 Routine statistics do not record the primary cause of a road accident. However, under a pilot scheme, 15 police forces in Great Britain have provided information on contributory factors to accidents since 1999. In 2003 this information was available for about a third of all reported injury accidents in Great Britain. Among these, 30 per cent. of fatalities and 20 per cent. of serious casualties were in accidents where &#039;excessive speed&#039; was a factor.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40913w03.html_para0">
If the results from the pilot scheme were representative of the whole country, it would mean that over 1,000 deaths and about 6,600 serious injuries in Great Britain in 2003 were sustained in accidents where &#039;excessive speed&#039; was a contributory factor.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40913w03.html_para1">
The contributory factor data are based on the opinions of police officers. In the case of accidents reported by a member of the public at a police station, these factors have to be determined from their description of the accident.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40913w03.html_para2">
The true extent of the influence of speed as a contributory factor in road traffic accidents may be greater than suggested by the single factor &#039;excessive speed&#039;, as some other factors&#151;such as &#039;following too close&#039;&#151;may also be associated with inappropriate speed. My Department is undertaking further analysis of the pilot contributory factor data and will publish an article later in the year.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40913w03.html_para3">
Starting in January 2005 this pilot scheme will be replaced by a new set of questions on contributory factors, which will henceforward form an integral part of the road accident reporting system and will be collected by all police forces for accidents reported at scene by a police officer.

<p><a name="40913w03.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Jamieson: </b> 
 The Road Safety Strategy, published in March 2000 gave a commitment to revise and update our guidance to local authorities on the setting of local speed limits, currently in the form of Circular Roads 1/93. We will shortly issue a consultation draft of a revised Circular for comment, and we expect to finalise and publish the Circular early in 2005. In January this year we published a Traffic Advisory Leaflet on village speed limits, recommending that the speed limit should usually be 30 miles per hour.

Notes:<br>

1. The change in the overall rate of basic State Pension for any given year is estimated by comparing the actual maximum rate of basic State Pension for that year with the rate if earnings uprating had been in place. The average recorded basic State Pension in Great Yarmouth for each individual year is then increased proportionately to reflect the difference.<br>

2. It is assumed that basic State Pension was uprated by earnings from 1998 onwards. It is assumed that additional State Pension would still be uprated in line with prices. The average additional State Pension in Great Yarmouth each year is then added to the adjusted average basic amount to provide the total average State Pension.<br>

3. Figures for actual State Pension amounts are taken from 5 per cent. sample of September&#039;s DWP administrative data for the year shown and are therefore subject to a high degree of sampling variation.<br>

4. Figures for individual parliamentary constituencies are not available prior to 1999.<br>

3. Costs are for additional spending on Basic and State Second Pension and do not include any increased income tax revenue or savings in income related benefits. Costs are estimated by the Government Actuary&#039;s Department and are consistent with Budget 2004 assumptions and use 2002 based population projections. Accrual rates were calculated by the Department.<br>

4. Except where stated, current policy on calculation and uprating of benefits is assumed to continue and long-term assumptions are in line with those for budget 2004. The guarantee credit is therefore increased in line with average earnings.<br>

5. Increasing basic State Pension by more than prices as in parts B and C of this question will result in additional spending on basic State Pension.<br>

6. Costs also exclude any changes that might occur to contracting out rebates.<br>

<p><a name="40913w04.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Browne: </b> 
 The Government are strongly committed to combating child trafficking. We recognise that it is a complex problem and are determined to address every aspect of it, whether in countries of origin, en route to the UK, or on arrival. We have put in place a number of measures to do so, and constantly keep them under review.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40913w04.html_para8">
We are working with source countries to tackle the problem at its root. The UK is one of the strongest supporters of the International Labour Organisation&#039;s (ILO) Convention on the Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labour. We have given &#163;70,000 to Anti-Slavery International for raising awareness of the abuses suffered by the victims of trafficking and remedial action in West Africa. We have also given &#163;3 million for the International Labour Organisation&#039;s International Programme on the Elimination of Child Labour (IPEC) programme in the Greater Mekong region. This involves a number of inter-linked interventions to raise awareness and prevent trafficking, and to withdraw women and children from labour exploitation and reintegrate them back into their own or new communities.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40913w04.html_para9">
We are also taking action to ensure an effective enforcement response. Since 2000, all operational activity targeted against organised immigration crime, including people trafficking, has been co-ordinated through the multi-agency task force Reflex. Led by the National Crime Squad (NCS), Reflex brings together all the key agencies (including the Immigration Service, the National Criminal Intelligence Service and key police forces), as well as the appropriate Government Departments. Reflex aims to build up the intelligence picture, co-ordinate operations and provide a focal point for the operational response to human trafficking and smuggling.

The Sexual Offences Act 2003, which came into force in May this year, sets out wide-ranging offences covering trafficking for sexual exploitation with a maximum sentence of 14 years imprisonment. A new offence covering trafficking for non-sexual purposes, such as forced labour, is included in the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc.) Act 2004.

The Government are committed to providing appropriate support to victims of trafficking. Child victims of trafficking are likely to be in need of welfare services. Under the Children Act 1989 local authorities have a duty to safeguard and promote the welfare of children who are in need, by providing a range and level of services appropriate to those needs or arranging for their provision by other agencies. Assistance and support should therefore be provided by local statutory services in response to identified needs, whether directly or though specialist agencies.

The Home Office and the Department for Education and Skills are jointly considering the results from the Reflex funded multi-agency operation, Paladin Child. This involved the Metropolitan Police, the Immigration Service, social workers from Hillingdon Social Services and secondees from NSPCC. The operation risk assessed children arriving at Heathrow airport without their parents or legal guardians and social services followed up those considered to be at risk. The operation did not uncover any evidence of child trafficking. However, the report did make a number of recommendations related to child protection.

 By definition, illegal immigrants fall outside of official statistics and are therefore difficult to measure.

The Government have commissioned research into the methods used in other countries to estimate the size of the illegal population in order to define methods appropriate for the UK.

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">The increasing involvement of organised crime in illegal immigration led to the creation in 2000 of Reflex, the multi-agency forum which brings together key law enforcement players including the Immigration Service, as well as relevant government Departments and the Security Services, under the chair of the National Crime Squad.</p>

[187059]</p>








<p><a name="40913w05.html_spnew6"><b> Mr. Browne: </b> 
 Over the past 15 months the UK Immigration Service (UKIS) has participated in a variety of joint multi-agency street crime operations in London, initiated by both the Metropolitan and British Transport Police (BTP). Focusing on crime hotspots, the Immigration Service has been invited to attend where an immigration offence is expected. The deployment of immigration officers in public places is a legitimate activity within the spectrum of our mandate of enforcing immigration laws.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40913w05.html_para6">
While immigration officers do not have the same powers as the police to stop and search individuals in public places, they may legitimately question people to determine their immigration status where there is reasonable suspicion that a person is an immigration offender.

 The budget for the Environment Agency&#039;s North East Region, which comprises the North East Region of England and most of the Yorkshire and Humber Region, was &#163;83.8 million in 2001&#150;02, &#163;95.9 million in 2002&#150;03 and &#163;95.2 million in 2003&#150;04.

 The new Council Regulation to address cetacean bycatch requires the use of &#039;pingers&#039; on vessels of 12 metres and over in ICES divisions VIId, e, f, g, h and j when using bottom-set gillnets or entangling nets. In ICES Area IV and division IIIa, the pinger requirement applies to vessels of 12 metres and over using bottom-set gillnets or entangling nets where the combination of net lengths used does not exceed 400 metres or where the mesh size used is greater than or equal to 220mm. The data is not available to identify the number of vessels falling in or out of the latter

In November 2003, McDonald&#039;s and the Local Government Association (LGA) formed a pioneer partnership to assist local authorities in improving the quality of local environments and public spaces.

<p><a name="40913w07.html_spnew7"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 Defra published a consultation document entitled the Fly-Tipping Strategy in February 2004. It proposed a range of measures that aimed to ensure that enforcement against fly-tipping is as effective as possible. The strategy proposed to move towards dealing with fly-tipping in a more pro-active preventative manner rather than focusing just on expensive clearance.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40913w07.html_para7">
The measures proposed in the strategy would give local authorities and the Environment Agency more effective powers for dealing with fly-tipping, which should lead to a better response to the blight of illegally dumped waste. Benefits will also extend to local residents by moving towards cleaner, safer, and greener public spaces and reducing the damaging effects of fly-tipping on the environment.

The consultation paper seeks views on a general coming into force date for the regulations of July 2005, with the possibility of sites producing hazardous waste being notified from 1 April 2005.

<p><a name="40913w08.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 All local authorities in England have been set challenging Statutory Performance Standards for 2003&#150;04 and 2005&#150;06 for the recycling and composting of household waste. Individual local authority targets combine to meet national targets as set out in Waste Strategy 2000 to recycle or compost 17 per cent. of household waste by 2003&#150;04, and 25 per cent. by 2005&#150;06.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40913w08.html_para2">
In 2002&#150;03, the household recycling and composting rate for England was 14.5 per cent., a 2 per cent. increase over 2001&#150;02. This percentage rise represents a significant improvement compared with previous annual increases, which had tended to be around 1 per cent. (as measured by the Municipal Waste Management Survey).

<p>
<a name="40913w08.html_para3">
The most recent evidence, offered by local authorities&#039; unaudited Best Value Performance Indicator data for 2003&#150;04, suggests that the 2003&#150;04 national target of 17 per cent. will be met. The national target for 2005&#150;06 remains a significant challenge but an achievable goal if the current rate of progress is maintained.

<p><a name="40913w08.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Morley </b> 
<i>[holding answer 8 September 2004]:</i> All local authorities in England have been set challenging Statutory Performance Standards for 2003&#150;04 and 2005&#150;06 for the recycling and composting of household waste. The Government do not specify which materials local authorities are required to collect. The Statutory Performance Standards are weight based so initially local authorities are likely to recycle heavier materials. However, as recycling targets become increasingly demanding, local authorities are expected to target lighter materials such as plastics.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40913w08.html_para4">
To make the recycling of plastic more economically attractive the Government-funded Waste Resources and Action Programme (WRAP) has developed a programme to expand markets for plastic recyclate. As a result of WRAP activity since 2001 in excess of 35,000 additional tonnes of plastic recycling capacity per year is either operational, under construction or otherwise committed.

<p><a name="40913w09.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 There are no direct economic disincentives for waste-to-energy incinerators to burn source separated waste. Incentives to recycle source separated waste exist and these act as indirect disincentives to burn source separated waste. Examples of these incentives include local authority statutory performance standards for recycling and composting and the recycling targets set out in the European directive on packaging and packaging waste.

<p>
<a name="40913w09.html_para1">
Government announced in Budget 2002 that the case for an economic instrument for incineration would be considered.

 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development (1) what resources he plans to commit to AIDS vaccine research in the next 10 years;  [187466]

</p>



<p>(2) what recent discussions he has had with the pharmaceutical industry regarding funding and facilities for the production of AIDS vaccine once developed.  [187467]</p>








<p><a name="40913w09.html_spnew3"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 In line with the recently published DFID Research Funding Strategy, we are committed to the global effort to find a vaccine for AIDS. DFID has committed &#163;14 million in support of the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI) up to the end of this year and I recently met Dr. Seth Berkeley, who is president and chief executive the of IAVI, to discuss its work. The UK is also committed to work with our G8 colleagues. DFID supports the aims of the Global HIV and AIDS Vaccine Enterprise and are developing areas for UK engagement with the enterprise including potential financial support during the UKS G8 Presidency. Over the coming months DFID will be considering the resource framework for the three years commencing April 2005, including further support for IAVI and support for the Global Vaccine Enterprise.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40913w09.html_para3">
In addition to this direct support, the UK has tax relief for investments in research into vaccines and other medicines for HIV and AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis. The Vaccines Research Relief is effective on expenditure from April 2003. It is too early to report on the success of the Vaccines Research Relief since company tax returns are retrospective in nature. The first claims are not expected until later this year. However, a programme of evaluation will be implemented once data begins to be received. It is important to bear in mind the long-term nature of research decisions and outcomes and the fact that the impact of the relief is likely to appear over the medium to long term.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40913w09.html_para4">
DFID officials have been meeting regularly with pharmaceutical companies and business associations as part of our work on increasing access to medicines in developing countries. These meetings have dealt with issues such as the affordability of existing medicines and other health technologies, and the need for increased research and development into new technologies&#151;including vaccines&#151;for diseases disproportionately affecting developing countries.

 The review of the 1995 Beijing Platform for Action will be an integral part of the UK Government&#039;s work on gender equality in 2005. The 49th Session of the Commission for the Status for Women (CSW) at the United Nations in March 2005 will review and appraise the implementation of Beijing over the last 10 years. A cross-Whitehall UK Government delegation will actively participate at CSW, working to ensure that the gains achieved at Beijing in 1995 are upheld. DFID has already begun contributing to this process, completing a United Nations questionnaire on progress made in the UK since 1995, which will feed into the UN Secretary-General&#039;s report.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40913w09.html_para5">
DFID is also working closely with the European Union Gender Group and other donors through the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Development Assistance Committee&#039;s (DAC) Gender Network, to develop a contribution to the review. We are attending regional preparatory meetings and working with civil society organisations. These include the UK Gender and Development Network, to whom DFID has provided support on a study examining the links between the Platform for Action and the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).
</p>


<p>
<a name="40913w09.html_para6">
Gender equality is relevant to the achievement of all the MDGs, not only that specifically aimed at gender equality and the empowerment of women. The review will be an opportunity to underline the continuing relevance of the Beijing Platform for Action to the achievement of gender equality.

DFID is in the process of reviewing how we might step up our work in this area. A scoping study, commissioned by DFID&#039;s Conflict and Humanitarian Affairs Department and undertaken by the Overseas Development Group, will soon report. The study will examine the relationship between development and disasters so as to help the development community and DFID better understand how we might tackle disasters risk most effectively. It will also consider how to better integrate disaster risk reduction into development. We intend to develop a forward strategy for DFID on disaster reduction in the light of the findings of this study. The findings will be disseminated to interested parties.

<p><a name="40913w10.html_wqn1"><b> Norman Baker: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what assessment he has made of the impact on girls&#039; school enrolment of increased access to sanitation; and how this is taken into account in the design of the programmes funded by his Department in pursuit of the Millennium Development Goal to eliminate gender disparity in education.  [188058]</p>








<p><a name="40913w10.html_spnew1"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 DFID&#039;s assessment of this relationship is two-fold. First, access to basic facilities such as school toilets, safe drinking water, clean surroundings and information on hygiene all improve the quality of the school environment and result in better learning outcomes for girls. Provision of basic facilities ensures universal basic education and results in increased enrolment of girls in schools. Basic sanitation for girls in particular, can lead to lower dropout rate for girls, especially at puberty. For example, in Bangladesh, a school sanitation and hygiene education programme reported to increase girls&#039; attendance rates by 11 per cent.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40913w10.html_para0">
Second, parents are more likely to send girls to school when they have ready access to safe, drinking water and girls are no longer required to collect water from distant water pumps.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40913w10.html_para1">
An example of how this assessment has been used in DFID&#039;s work is in Sudan. As part of its support for the peace process in Sudan, DFID has provided approximately &#163;2 million to assist the United Nations Children&#039;s Fund&#039;s (UNICEF) education programmes in the conflict affected areas of the country, providing books and materials to over 2,000 primary schools and supporting the construction of water and sanitation facilities.

 The Israeli operation &quot;Forward Shield&quot; in Beit Hanoun has led to extensive damage and destruction to property, including agricultural land and infrastructure, in one of Gaza&#039;s most important agricultural regions. The levelling of a further 17 per cent. of total arable land in the last two months adds to the debilitating impact on the livelihoods and food security of Palestinians in the area. Over 50 per cent. of total agricultural land in the area has now been up-rooted since September 2000. As a result of residential buildings being destroyed, 145 people have been made homeless and another 580 people have had their homes damaged. Damage to public property has led to breaks in the water, power, sewerage and road networks. In addition, 17 privately owned water-wells were destroyed with consequences for access to drinking water and agricultural use. DFID funding for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency provides support for affected people in the area.

<p><a name="40913w10.html_spnew5"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 Sudan is a country in the midst of a chronic complex emergency. UN social indicators continue to be among the lowest in the world. Large areas of the country outside the more affluent area of Khartoum continue to need life-saving and life-sustaining assistance. Continuing conflict in many areas has resulted in persistently high levels of poverty as agricultural production is disrupted and land taken out of cultivation due to instability.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40913w10.html_para3">
With the expectation of a Comprehensive Peace Agreement in the coming months, humanitarian needs are likely to increase as the needs of returning internally displaced persons (IDPs) and refugees from the conflict between the north and south of Sudan add to those affected by natural disaster.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40913w10.html_para4">
In Southern Sudan, 23 years of conflict has created critical food insecurity, an almost total lack of primary health care outside of what is provided by NGOs, and crisis levels of mortality and morbidity across the area. The conflict is estimated to have displaced 4 million people out of a total population of 5 million, some of whom are now refugees and some are IDPs. (A breakdown of this is provided in the table). The critical issue for the humanitarian community in the south is ensuring a stable and sustainable environment to help displaced people to return home. While the Comprehensive Peace Agreement holds out the prospect of peace in Southern Sudan, fighting continues, with an outbreak of militia activity in the Shilluk Kingdom, which has displaced 50,000 people since March 2004.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40913w10.html_para5">
Other areas of concern in Sudan include the Red Sea State in Northern Sudan, where the population of 700,00 has suffered persistent drought and repeated crop failures since 1988. The rainfall and predicted agricultural production for 2004 is better than the last few years, but due to the prolonged nature of the crisis, a large proportion of the general population is likely to remain short of food and to require food and nutritional assistance for some time to come.

The humanitarian situation in Darfur remains dire and urgent action is needed on all sides. Over 1.2 million people have been internally displaced in Darfur, and a further 200,000 have fled to Chad. The needs are enormous. Security in the camps has improved, but reports of attacks continue outside the camps, and IDPs, refugees and host communities in Darfur and Eastern Chad remain vulnerable as inter-tribal fighting continues and the levels of banditry and general insecurity remain. IDPs and refugees still lack adequate water and sanitation and many do not have adequate shelter against the rain and extreme conditions. Outbreaks of disease are a serious concern (a hepatitis E outbreak has already been diagnosed in West Darfur). Aid agencies are scaling up delivery of assistance, but capacity constraints remain. The UN estimates that 1,000 international staff are needed to cope with the crisis; 500 are currently working in Darfur. Humanitarian access has however improved and over 45 NGOs are registered, although not all are operational. The rainy season from May to September has also resulted in logistical difficulties, with the World Food Programme (WFP) resorting to airdrops of food in some inaccessible areas. A further constraint is that resources are still limited. The UN has revised its appeal for the crisis in Darfur and now estimates that it needs a total of $530 million for Chad and Darfur, of which $255 million is unmet. The UK is the second largest bilateral donor to the humanitarian response, having allocated &#163;62.5 million since September 2003. DFID is urging other donors to do more.

<i>[holding answer 9 September 2004]:</i> Custody facilities at courthouses are audited by the Prisoner Escort and Custody Services (PECS) at regular intervals against current standards of health and safety, decency and security. On 2 June 2004, a PECS audit concluded that the Aberystwyth Magistrates&#039; Court cell complex meets basic health and safety standards.

<p>
<a name="40913w11.html_para5">
However, access to the cell area fails to meet the established security standards because there is no van dock and there is no direct access to the custody area from the courtrooms. In order to reduce risk the number and type of hearings with defendants in custody at the courts has been reduced. This allows the custody officers a greater degree of control over each custodial defendant brought before the Court.

<p><a name="40913w17.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Straw: </b> 
 The urgent need for intelligence was a result of the international community&#039;s lack of reliable information as to Iraqi activities in the absence of UN inspectors between December 1998 and November 2002 caused by Iraq&#039;s continuing failure to meet its obligations under UN Security Council Resolutions.

 The take-up of broadband in the UK is now rapid with a wide range of suppliers in the marketplace and there are now about 50,000 new broadband subscribers every week. BT is now in a position to ensure that over 99 per cent. of all households could acquire a broadband connection if they so wished.

However, broadband TV remains in its infancy, and it will be many years before it could be regarded as universally available. Because of broadband TV&#039;s current small scale and technological limitations Government has not as yet made a specific assessment of where the market for broadband TV will be in the next 10 years, but of course Ofcom and other experts are routinely monitoring changes in technology and in consumer behaviour.

While the broadcasters have not reached a full consensus on the optimum timetable, some&#151;including the BBC&#151;have suggested that 2012 may be the most appropriate date for the completion of switchover.

 Unless changes are made to the Care Standards Act 2000, a protection of vulnerable adults check would be required each time a junior doctor or healthcare trainee moved to a new training post.

In light of these reports the Government have set up a small group to consider more closely the level of cocaine use in Northern Ireland with a view to informing future policy and strategy development in terms of prevention and treatment.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what rationale underlies the differing periods of time which must elapse from the commencement of an illness before a claim can be made for <i>(a)</i> attendance allowance and <i>(b)</i> disability living allowance; and if he will review the rationale.  [187824]</p>








<p><a name="40913w25.html_spnew7"><b> Mr. Spellar: </b> 
 The qualifying periods for attendance allowance and disability living allowance help ensure that they are not paid to people with short term, transient disabilities. The differences in the qualifying periods for the two benefits reflect the differing characteristics of the people they are designed to help. Disability living allowance focuses help with the extra costs of disability on people who have the very considerable disadvantage of being severely disabled early, or relatively early, in life. Hence, it has a shorter qualifying period than attendance allowance which provides help with the disability-related extra costs of people who do not experience the onset of severe disability until later in life when they are aged 65 or over. There are no plans to change these arrangements.

<p><a name="40913w25.html_spnew9"><b> Mr. Spellar: </b> 
 Attendance allowance is paid at two rates. The higher rate is for people who need help with personal care and/or supervision or watching over to avoid substantial danger to themselves or others by day and at night. The lower rate is for people who have those needs either during the day or at night. As at May 2004, attendance allowance was providing help towards the disability-related extra costs of over 65,000 people aged 65 or over in Northern Ireland. We believe that the allowance is properly directed towards the needs of older disabled people and there are no plans to introduce a third rate.

The team, along with other agencies&#151;13 in total in the Londonderry incident&#151;worked together to provide assistance and advice to those affected.

<p>
<a name="40913w26.html_para3">
In the Londonderry incident, Water Service, Roads Service and Rivers Agency deployed some 75 staff, working late into the evening and next morning, to minimise damage to property and aid recovery. I would like to pay tribute to the efforts of those staff and the staff of other agencies. The Central Claims Unit had its loss adjusters on the ground on 18 August. Notwithstanding these efforts, a number of householders and businesses suffered significant flood-related damage. Derry city council organised a &quot;help shop&quot;, to provide advice and information, on 20 August, and all the relevant statutory agencies participated in this event. My ministerial colleague, lan Pearson, visited Londonderry on 18 August to survey the damage and to ensure that remedial measures were in train.

<a name="40913w26.html_para4">
The circumstances of the flooding incidents are being fully investigated to identify any opportunities to reduce the risk of further events and improve the standard of the inter-agency response. As with all such incidents, it is essential that any lessons are learned and applied.

Water Service is implementing a programme of flood relief schemes at 50 locations at risk of flooding. &#163;6 million has been invested on such schemes in the last four years and a further &#163;5 million will be invested over the next three years. Moreover work on the &#163;100 million Belfast sewer project is already underway and a further &#163;59 million will be invested in upgrading the sewerage network across the region in the three year period to 2006. Major upgrades of the sewerage system planned will also help to reduce flooding risks. In addition, Rivers Agency has an ongoing works programme to protect property from flooding from watercourses and the sea, amounting to approximately &#163;7 million per annum.

However, it must be recognised that, although modern drainage standards will provide better protection, it is impossible to guarantee that flooding will not occur, when unusually severe weather conditions are experienced.
