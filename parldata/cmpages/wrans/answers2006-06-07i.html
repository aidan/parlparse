Figures are for UK Regular Forces, both Trained and Untrained, located in the UK. They therefore exclude Gurkhas, Full Time Reserve Service personnel, the Home Service battalions of the Royal Irish Regiment and mobilised reservists. Naval Service personnel on sea service are included against the local authority containing the home port of their ship. Naval Service personnel serving in flights at sea are included against the local authority containing the base airfield of their flight. The detailed figures have been compiled from unit statistics related to unit postcodes. For some units postcode information is either unavailable or inappropriate. Location statistics are not available for FTRS, the Home Service battalions of the Royal Irish Regiment and Mobilised Reservists. These figures are taken from TSP 10: UK Regular Forces Distribution across the UK which shows the distribution of Service Personnel by Government Office Region/country, county and local authority area. The publication was suspended in October 2002 when a number of concerns were identified in both the source data and the programs used to produce the publication. It was reinstated in July 2004. Due to a different methodology figures before 2002 should not be compared to those after 2004.<br></br>

 Child care costs are affected by a number of factors, such as the availability of child care provision, local wage levels, or land or rental prices where child care is offered. The child care element of the working tax credit has had a significant impact on the affordability of child care for low to moderate-income families, reducing the proportion of child care costs that they pay. Through the child care element of the working tax credit, working parents receive financial assistance with up to 80 per cent. of the costs of registered and approved child care, up to a maximum of £300 per week (£175 for one child). In April 2006 374,000 families were benefiting from the child care element, and they were receiving an average of £50 per week towards their child care costs.</p>

 Local authorities are not obliged to provide milk, but where they do so they must provide it free of charge to pupils entitled to receive a free school lunch. Local authorities decide whether or not to provide whole milk. They are also free to make use of the EU School Milk Subsidy Scheme, which reduces the cost of whole milk and semi-skimmed milk purchased. The new nutritional standards in schools, announced on 19 May 2006, stipulate that only semi-skimmed and skimmed milk should be made available in schools.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_391"><a name="60607w0008.htm_para3"><a name="06060874002297">The advice of the School Meals Review Panel and the School Food Trust was that only very young children require full-fat milk as part of their diet; and that once children are at school, semi-skimmed and skimmed versions of milk are entirely adequate. This approach reflects current nutrition advice, which is based on advice from the Committee on Medical Aspects of Food Policy (now replaced by the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition) who considered this issue in relation to cardiovascular disease. Current advice highlights the important role that milk and dairy products play in children’s diets, particularly their contribution to children’s calcium intake; and states that school-aged children should have the opportunity to choose lower fat versions of milk as these contain at least the same amount of calcium as whole milk, but less fat.</p>

Consequently, we have not discussed review of the guidance with any other Departments. This guidance was produced jointly by the Department of Health, Home Office, Department for Education and Skills and the Welsh Assembly. It is intended to provide a national framework within which agencies and professionals at local level—individually and jointly—draw up and agree upon their own more detailed ways of working together in cases of fabricated or induced illness. It is addressed to those who work in the health and education services, the police, social services departments, the probation service, and others whose work brings them into contact with children and families.</p>

 There is scope in the Personal Social and Health Education framework for schools to explore issues such as parental separation and divorce. Since 2003, we have been providing training for teachers of PSHE through the PSHE certificate for teachers, from which over 5,000 teachers have so far benefited. In addition, the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority has produced a package of guidance for teachers of PSHE. This package includes units of work which can be used to address issues of divorce and separation.</p>

 Cases involving sex offenders who are also pupils or students should be considered individually, in line with guidance in “Working Together to Safeguard Children”. There should be a co-ordinated approach, involving youth justice, children’s social care, education (including educational psychology) and health (including child and adolescent mental health). An assessment should be carried out in each case to assess the risks to other children and to decide what plan of action should be put in place to address the young person’s behaviour and to ensure the safety of others. This might include arrangements for monitoring the child to ensure that he does not have unsupervised access to children under 16 while at school or college or provision of specialist services, including education, not in mainstream settings, which help address the young person’s behaviour.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills pursuant to the answer of 23 May 2006, <i>Official Report,</i> column 1716W, when the new Vetting and Barring Scheme will take effect; and what interim safeguards he will require in respect of children in children’s establishments and schools and receiving children’s services. [74206]</p>

<p><a name="st_201"><a name="06060874002568"><a name="60607w0010.htm_spnew5"><a name="06060874005045"><b>Mr. Dhanda:</b>
 Subject to Parliament’s approval of the necessary legislation, our intention is to introduce the new Vetting and Barring Scheme in 2008. Implementation will be staged—as was recommended in Sir Michael Bichard’s report into the Soham murders—to ensure that the new requirements are established effectively. Until then the current barring schemes will continue to operate alongside the system of Criminal Records Bureau checks. Since the Secretary of State’s review into list 99 in January, we have taken a number of steps to strengthen this scheme including the establishment of an independent expert panel to advise and assist the Secretary of State in carrying out his list 99 functions, and new regulations making Criminal Records Bureau checks mandatory for all newly appointed school employees. We will also be introducing new regulations shortly to ensure that any individuals working with children who are convicted or cautioned for sex offences against children will be automatically entered on list 99.</p>

 We have made no assessment or recommendation about scanners being used in or by schools. The Violent Crime Reduction Bill, if it receives Royal Assent, will enable schools to search, without consent, pupils they suspect are carrying a knife or other weapon. Staff authorised to conduct a search could use a detector but that is for individual schools to decide. Police called in to make a general search at a school could also use a detector.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland pursuant to his answer of 11 May 2006, <i>Official Report</i>, column 541W, on sex offenders, for what offences each of the people whose addresses are not known to the police were convicted; whether any of these people have been assessed as a danger to public safety; and whether they were subject to supervision and control orders at the time they moved from their last known residential address. [74314]</p>

 Sex offender compliance with the notification requirements of the Sexual Offences Act 2003 is high at around 97 per cent. in Northern Ireland. Notifications are recorded by the police on a live database and the number of unregistered offenders in breach of the requirements may therefore fluctuate on a daily basis. A search of the database to provide the information in reply to the hon. Gentleman's question showed that the number of offenders subject to the notification requirements and for whom the police did not have a current residential address has now reduced to 11. The offences for which these offenders had been convicted were as follows: three for rape; one attempted rape; two unlawful carnal knowledge; two indecent assault on a female; two making/possessing indecent images of children; one buggery. One person with a conviction for making/possessing indecent images of children was subject to probation supervision at the time they failed to comply with the notification requirements. Of the 11 offenders, four had been subject to a multi-agency risk assessment with no one being assessed as Category 3 High Risk i.e. someone whose sexual offending has been assessed as currently likely to lead them to seriously harm other people. PSNI pursue a policy of actively seeking to trace offenders who fail to comply with the notification requirements. This includes placing the offender's details on ViSOR and PNC to alert other UK police forces, checking with agencies such as social security to establish if the offender is claiming benefits etc, and providing full details to colleagues in An Garda Siochana who then complete similar checks for the offender in the Republic of Ireland.</p>

 Since the introduction of the Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) schools programme in 1953 the epidemiology of tuberculosis has changed from a disease of the general population to one predominantly affecting high-risk groups. The new recommendations are based on the advice of the joint committee on vaccination and immunisation and are aimed at delivering an improved targeted risk based programme. The widespread introduction of targeted BCG vaccination means that the majority of children at high risk of tuberculosis will now be vaccinated in early life.</p>

 The Government's drug interventions programme (DIP) which began in 2003 is providing a route out of crime and into treatment for drug misusing offenders who commit crime to feed their habit. DIP uses contact with the criminal justice system as an opportunity to engage drug misusing offenders in treatment and support.</p>

Those testing positive are required to attend an assessment with a drugs worker. Testing on arrest is a way of identifying drug misusers at an early stage in the criminal justice process. Other key elements of the programme are operating across England and in Wales.</p>

 The Government’s strategy in tackling drugs is founded on the fact that all drugs subject to it are harmful and no one should take them.

 Following a review of the criteria for the categorisation of foreign national prisoners and their allocation to open conditions in May, the Prison Service concluded that no changes were required of the policy. However, governors have been instructed to take into account recent public statements made by Ministers, including the Prime Minister, regarding the likelihood of deportation when considering foreign national prisoners for category D status and allocation to open conditions. The overriding purpose of the security classification must be to ensure that prisoners are retained in custody with a level of security that is consistent with the need to protect the public.</p>
