 The Department for Transport's report on improving the Air Passenger Experience (November 2007) provided some indications of security waiting times at Heathrow and Gatwick based on BAA data. Average daily queues were less than 10 minutes for 95 per cent. or more of the time at Heathrow in August 2007.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport how she plans to measure the emissions from UK aviation when the sector is included in the EU Emissions Trading Scheme. [218791]</p>

 The UK reports annually to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFGCC) estimates of emissions from UK sales of aviation fuels&#151;known as "bunker fuels"&#151;for domestic and international aviation. In doing so, the UK follows guidelines published by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Estimates of emissions from fuel used for international aviation do not form part of the UK's national emissions inventory, as there has been no international agreement on how to allocate them to individual countries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1"><a name="80901w0001.htm_para1"><a name="0809023000132">The Government will continue to press internationally for an approach that would allocate responsibility for international aviation emissions, and therefore require action to be taken globally to address them. Such allocation may be, for example, to countries or to the international aviation sector as a whole.</p>

The Government do not believe that inclusion of aviation in the EU ETS will provide a suitable emissions allocation methodology. Responsibility for meeting the cap will be placed directly on airlines; responsibility for regulating airlines will be placed on member states, in a process designed to achieve administrative simplicity. As a result, the UK regulator   <br>

<p><a name="stpa_3"><a name="80901w0001.htm_para3"><a name="0809023000134">The EU ETS will cap emissions from flights arriving in, or departing from, the EU. Any growth in emissions above that cap will require airlines to pay for equivalent emissions reductions from elsewhere within the scheme, thereby maintaining total emissions below the cap. The UK's reports to the UNFCCC on emissions from bunker fuels would not reflect achievement of the EU ETS cap. The differences between the UNFCCC and EU regimes reflect the different purposes for which they were established.</p>

 Currently, airlines compete for customers on a number of factors including price, route and passenger service.

These areas were passage through airports, with particular reference to Terminal 5 at Heathrow, and the resilience of airports to recover from problems such as extreme weather conditions.

<i> [holding answer 22 July 2008]:</i> The regional strategy preparation process, which involves input from local authorities, sets housing numbers for districts. These take into account the need and demand for housing within housing market areas and the strategic availability of land within individual districts. Therefore these numbers should be planned for by individual districts but we encourage joint working between districts in doing this.</p>

Our aspiration is to see all homes built to Lifetime Homes Standards by 2013 and we will ensure that all publicly funded housing is built to Lifetime Homes Standards by 2011. It is currently a mandatory element of the Code for Sustainable Homes at code level 6 and will become mandatory at code levels 4 and 5 from 2010 and code level 3 from 2013. We will continue to work with stakeholders to encourage take up of the standards across all sectors and progress will be reviewed in 2010.</p>

 None. Local authorities' access to communications data and use of directed surveillance and covert human intelligence sources is governed by secondary legislation made under the 2000 Act. This restricts local council access and use of these techniques to the purpose of preventing or detecting crime or disorder in the carrying out of their functions.

 The armed forces provide assistance to the civil authorities at their request and primarily when the civil authorities lack the necessary capabilities. The Civil Contingencies Act 2004 has mandated that civil authorities should have contingency plans in place to deal with a range of civil crises. As a result civil authorities have developed their capabilities to deal with a wide range of challenges.</p>

Fire and rescue authorities are required to have in place a contingency plan which does not rely upon support from the armed forces. Accordingly the armed forces do not have any contingency plans in place, but Defence Ministers would consider any requests from the Department for Communities and Local Government, the lead Government Department responsible for the Fire and Rescue Service on a case by case basis.</p>

<a name="80901w0010.htm_brev0"><a name="0809023002615"><ul><p class="tabletext">My colleague, the Under Secretary of State for Defence, undertook to write to you in answer to your Parliamentary Questions on 2 June 2008, (Official Report, column 669-670W) about Pay As You Dine (PAYD) for Service personnel. I am responding as the Duty Minister.</p>
</ul><a name="80901w0010.htm_brev1"><a name="0809023002616"><ul><p class="tabletext">Prior to the introduction of PAYD, all Service personnel living in Single Living Accommodation paid a fixed food charge to cover three meals per day, irrespective of the number of meals that they actually ate. Inspection showed that on average 50 percent of meals or less were being taken. The Armed Forces Pay Review Body during their annual round of discussions with Service personnel identified strong support, particularly from amongst the junior ranks, for a replacement system which would enable personnel to pay only for food that they ate. In 2005, the MOD gave approval for each of the Services to implement PAYD and this they are now doing in a manner appropriate to meet their individual Service needs. PAYD is part of a concept of integrated catering, retail and leisure services that aims to improve the quality of life for Service personnel. It gives our Service personnel greater freedom by giving them the choice over when, where and how they eat and promotes fairness by ensuring that Service personnel pay only for the meals that they consume.</p>

<a name="80901w0010.htm_brev2"><a name="0809023002617"><ul><p class="tabletext">The PAYD scheme incorporates a core menu which conforms to the Tri Service Menu Policy. Indeed, the three core meals under PAYD are designed to be broadly to the same standard (ie to provide the required calories and nutritional balance if all three meals are taken) as those specified under the old regime with the cost of the core menu being exactly the same as the current Daily Food Charge. The MOD undertakes to provide a variety of healthy palatable food and beverages to all military personnel to enable them to adopt healthy eating habits, a balanced diet and to ensure optimal fitness and performance. Contract Caterers who deliver PAYD are required to provide food at the point of service that meets these requirements. In addition we continue to encourage all personnel to eat in a healthy and balanced manner. However, whether Service personnel are at a PAYD site or not, the ability to ensure that young serving personnel eat a healthy and balanced diet is somewhat limited. The menus at each meal offer healthy options but we do not have the ability to force people to choose that option. With the introduction of PAYD and choice there comes with it a certain degree of personal responsibility in terms of what they eat. There is also a mechanism in place to ensure that nobody is denied a meal if they run out of funds and special dietary and religious eating needs continue to be accommodated.</p>
</ul><a name="80901w0010.htm_brev3"><a name="0809023002618"><ul><p class="tabletext">Your first question referred to the impact on young soldiers. Due to the special circumstances of the nutritional needs of young trainees (of all the Services), Phase one trainees and some Phase two trainees do not participate in PAYD, but continue to pay the Daily Food Charge and are entitled to the core menu to ensure they receive a balanced and nutritional diet which includes appropriate supplements to cater for high activity levels (although it is still the individual's choice as to what they put on their plate at meal times). Trainees receive specifically targeted booklets, lifestyle lectures and guidance during training to ensure that they appreciate the importance of adequate and appropriate eating habits in relation to their professional and personal activities. In addition new recruits are also taught how to budget for PAYD.</p>
</ul><a name="80901w0010.htm_brev4"><a name="0809023002619"><ul><p class="tabletext">In terms of assessing whether or not the PAYD scheme has promoted healthy eating&#151;all contract Caterers are required to provide healthy options at each core meal. Contracts provide for cereals, yoghurt and fruit as part of the breakfast menu and for lunch and dinner salads and fresh vegetables are available. Where concerns are raised, these are addressed directly with the Contractor and alternative healthier options to various meals are introduced. PAYD was introduced to give people choice; it does this by offering a wide variety of meals at varying prices. Healthy options (as part of the core meal) are available if chosen by the individual.</p>
</ul><a name="80901w0010.htm_brev5"><a name="0809023002620"><ul><p class="tabletext">In addition, Defence Food Services has issued all Commanding Officers with a pan-Service booklet "A Guide to Healthy Eating" to complement and reinforce the policy. The Expert Panel of Armed Forces Feeding (EPAFF), in consultation with QinetiQ, has also produced and issued a Recruits Guide to Nutrition, a Servicewoman's Guide to Health and Performance, and an Armed Forces Personal Guide to Nutrition. All of these publications recognise the potential change to individual food choice as a result of the introduction of PAYD and are designed to provide individuals with the necessary guidance and advice to enable them to choose the right foods so that they can more easily cope with the physical demands of military training, operations and competitive sports. The single Services continue to reinforce the healthy eating message through various single Service publications.</p>
</ul><a name="80901w0010.htm_brev6"><a name="0809023002621"><ul><p class="tabletext">The single Services monitor the PAYD scheme through a regular programme of meetings between the Services and Contractor both locally and at HQ level. For the Royal Navy, the contracts require that the contractors undertake regular Customer Surveys and provide returns for assessment by the Royal Navy commercial branch and the Catering Services subject matter experts. The Army has a survey under way which began in late April 2008, the responses to which are still being received. Over 4,000 questionnaires were distributed with the results becoming available over the next few months. The RAF which has only three PAYD sites has monitored feedback on its trial sites via customer feedback forms. However since the start of 2008, focus groups have been held and are currently being completed to indicate consumer views. In addition, a sample of RAF personnel has been completing food diaries over a period of a month to gauge eating patterns. A formal independent assessment by a Market Research company is  <br>

</ul><a name="80901w0014.htm_brev8"><a name="0809023002670"><ul><p class="tabletext">HMS ONTARIO, a 22 gun sloop, foundered in a storm on Lake Ontario on October 31 1780 during the American Revolutionary War&#151;it is uncertain how many lives were lost (estimates range from 88 to over a 120) as the ship may have been carrying some American prisoners of war in addition to British soldiers and her British and Canadian crew. There were no survivors. The dive group, who located the wreck using side-scanning sonar and an unmanned submersible, say that it is virtually intact, it is thought that the cold, fresh water of the lake has acted as a preservative with the lack of light and oxygen slowing decomposition of the ship&#146;s timbers. In addition to being effectively the last resting place of those who perished in the sinking, the remains of the ONTARIO undoubtedly represent an important item of underwater cultural heritage. The dive group apparently have no plans to attempt to raise the wreck or remove artefacts from it and have not publicised its position.</p>
</ul><a name="80901w0014.htm_brev9"><a name="0809023002671"><ul><p class="tabletext">The ONTARIO was launched from Carleton Island shipyard on Lake Ontario in May 1780. A King&#146;s Ship, she was part of the Provincial Marine, a coastal protection service on the Great Lakes operated and staffed by the Royal Navy. This service with the Provincial Marine complicates the question of ownership as it is possible that rights to the wreck may have transferred to Canada when she became an independent nation and the assets of the Provincial Marine were made over to it. This issue is being investigated but as you can appreciate, it is likely to take some time to resolve.</p>
</ul><a name="80901w0014.htm_brev10"><a name="0809023002672"><ul><p class="tabletext">That said, the issue of who actually owns the wreck may, in this case, be moot. The remains of HMS ONTARIO appear to lie in United States territorial waters and the United States have already indicated that they are willing to use US legislation to protect the wreck from unauthorised interference&#151;a stance that the United Kingdom is entirely comfortable with. The United Kingdom is unlikely to object to appropriate archaeological investigation of the find&#151;however, any such investigation would be a matter for the Canadian and United States authorities in the first instance given that these two countries control access to the site. We shall of course continue to monitor developments and liaise with our Canadian and United States counterparts, but it seems clear that all State parties involved are united in their wish to see the wreck of HMS ONTARIO properly protected.</p>

 The decision to close the Horsea Island facility to regular commercial use is the result of an increased training requirement for both Army and Royal Navy personnel, and a security review of the site which concluded that an armed security presence was required. Organised commercial diving activity is therefore no longer compatible with the operational and security arrangements required at this site.</p>

 UK forces trained and mentored the 10<sup>(th)</sup> Division of the Iraqi army from the establishment of its Headquarters in Basra in May 2005 until its move to Dhi Qar province in September 2007.

These factors include the previous military experience of the Division&#146;s recruits, the timing of the Division&#146;s formation, the security challenges it faces and the availability of equipment. The Coalition does not therefore seek to calculate an average period for the full training and mentoring of Iraqi army Divisions.</p>

 The RAF has had a contract with HORIZON to market spare training capacity at RAF Halton since 2001. I am withholding the list of HORIZON'S customers as its release would, or would be likely to, prejudice commercial interests. Details of customers for spare capacity at RAF Halton prior to 2001 are not held centrally and could only be provided at disproportionate cost.</p>

<i>  [holding answer 17 July 2008]:</i> We are currently consulting on changes to the European Union emissions trading scheme (EU ETS) in light of the European Commission's proposed climate and energy package. Credits from reforestation and afforestation projects require a robust monitoring system, an understanding of the potential impact on the EU ETS allowance price, and assurance that non-permanent credits would not damage the environmental integrity of the scheme, before they can be included in the EU ETS.</p>

However, we recognise the importance of addressing this issue and we are working through the international climate negotiations for an agreement on reducing emissions from deforestation for post-2012. I welcome the provision contained in the European Commission's proposal for new crediting mechanisms under an international agreement which would give the flexibility to include credits from avoided deforestation and other land use activities in future phases of the EU ETS.</p>

The report was completed in January 2006 and was published as part of the new science information system which went live on the DEFRA website in February 2007.

This work reported in February 2007 and is available electronically on the contractor's website. It provides a review of the potential for health impacts to occur from alternate week waste collection schemes, principally in comparison with weekly collection schemes, using the scheme operated by Wycombe district council as a case study. The study was carried out to investigate any issues relating to odours, insects, rodents and the risks of disease. The research literature consulted provided no evidence that alternate week residual and biodegradable waste collection will cause any significant health impacts for residents, or that any health impacts are likely to be significantly greater than those associated with weekly collections. This is consistent with wider studies of the health effects of waste management, which indicate that all methods of waste management can have at most a minor effect on health<sup>(2)</sup>. The Wycombe study goes on to recommend some common-sense steps that can be taken to alleviate amenity issues (e.g. keeping containers clean, not shredding or chopping kitchen waste before disposal, keeping containers outdoors, avoiding shelter opportunities for rodents, waste wrapped or in containers etc.).</p>

 Since 1997 the Government have implemented major change to simplify the further education landscape and streamline national agencies. This includes reducing numbers of staff managing the further education and skills system from 10,000 in the TEC era to 4,700 as the Learning and Skills Council was established and further to 3,600 currently. We responded quickly to recommendations in Realising the Potential: A review of the future role of further education colleges by merging two major inspectorates, Ofsted and the Adult Learning Inspectorate, thereby simplifying inspection processes. More recently, the merger of the Quality Improvement Agency and the Centre for Excellence in Leadership, to form the Learning and Skills Improvement Service, will streamline processes further and drive quality improvement in the FE service through more direct influence from sector-leaders and practitioners. An updated list of organisations with a monitoring, inspection or improvement role in further education colleges is set out in the following list on the same basis as originally in the review report. This shows a reduction in the number of organisations with a monitoring, inspection or improvement role.</p>

<i> [holding answer 21 July 2008]</i><i> : </i>Our ELQ policy is a balanced one. We are reinvesting resources to benefit those who have not already obtained a higher education qualification. Yet over two thirds of the current level of HEFCE grant for ELQ students will continue to be invested in supporting them in 2010-11. All we have asked HEFCE to do is to redistribute about &#163;100 million a year by 2010-11 in order to fund over 20,000 extra new entrants to higher education.

 Student retention rates at higher education institutions in this country compare very well internationally.

 The Government's policy is that it is right that students should bear a fair share of the costs of higher education. The variable fees regime that we introduced in 2006 will provide an additional &#163;1.6 billion for higher education by 2010-11. At the same time we have ensured that there is strong support to meet students' personal financial needs. This has enabled us to make further progress in widening access to higher education, with the proportion of accepted applicants from England who are from the bottom four socio-economic groups has increased from 31.7 per cent. in 2006 to 32.1 per cent. in 2007.</p>

 The Home Office does not authorise death as an experimental endpoint in project licences granted under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. Where an earlier endpoint has been set to ensure that animals are killed before death would occur, euthanasia would be applied as soon as the animal exhibits predetermined signs, such as abnormal behaviour, appearance, body weight changes, body temperature changes, abnormal clinical findings or observations or laboratory investigations. Monitoring arrangements would also be required to ensure that such signs were identified promptly. Where appropriate, these may include 24-hour care.</p>

 There are no regulations that govern the use of ultra-sonic deterrent devices. However, the prolonged exposure to the noise emitted by a device may be a statutory nuisance. If an environmental health officer took the view that it affected the occupants of a property, action could be taken against the owner of the noise emitter. Inappropriate use of the device may also be classed as a harassment offence under the Public Order Act 1986 or the Protection from Harassment Act 1997.</p>

 Travel by Ministers makes clear that special flights may be authorised when a scheduled service is not available, or when it is essential to travel by air, but the requirements of official or parliamentary business or security considerations or urgency preclude the journey being made by a scheduled service. In respect of overseas travel by Ministers, since 1999 the Government have published an annual list of all visits overseas undertaken by Cabinet Ministers costing &#163;500 or more during each financial year. The list published in 1999 covers the period 2 May 1997 to 31 March 1999. Where RAF/Private Charter aircraft are used this is shown in the list. The Government have also published on an annual basis the cost of all Ministers&#146; visits overseas. Copies of the lists are available in the Libraries of the House.</p>

The convention is intended to ensure that a driver resident in one country and disqualified in another country for a motoring offence committed there, should not escape the consequences of that disqualification when he or she returns home. The convention will take effect when all 15 signatory states have ratified it. So far as we are aware, only Spain of the original signatories has done so.

One of the first tasks the projects undertake is to improve behaviour to stabilise a families&#146; tenancy.

We know from contact with the projects, however, that eviction happens very rarely. A small minority of families (5 per cent. were identified in the recent evaluation) disengage from the projects and it is possible in a small number of these cases the LA would proceed with an eviction. But these are families who were facing eviction before they became involved with the Family Intervention Project.</p>

 Data on young persons aged under 18 were obtained from the National DNA Database (NDNAD) and the Police National Computer (PNC) on 9-10 April 2008. The NDNAD data indicate that, on 10 April 2008, there were 349,934 subject sample profiles relating to persons aged 10 to 17 on it. There are more profiles than individuals due to DNA samples being taken from some individuals on more than one occasion, that is, there is some duplicate sampling. It is estimated that the current rate of profile replication is about 13.3 per cent.

 The information requested is given in the table. The figures show the number of subject sample profiles retained on the National DNA Database (NDNAD) at 31 March 2008, which were taken by police forces in England and Wales. The number of subject profiles is not the same as the number of individuals. It is currently estimated that 13.3 per cent. of profiles held on the NDNAD are replicates, that is, that a profile for a person has been loaded on more than one occasion. The replication rate of 13.3 per cent. should, however, be applied only over the entire NDNAD, as the replication rate for individual police forces varies considerably. The table gives the number of subject profiles for each police force only, but gives a total estimated number of individuals for all English and Welsh police forces.</p>

 The Cost Report has set out those elements of the cost estimates that relate specifically to passports, those cost estimates specific to identity cards, and those cost estimates that are common to both. The cost of registering individuals for passports and ID cards is included in common costs because the same technology infrastructure and business processes will be used. In many cases, the same application will result in the issue of both a passport and an ID card.</p>

 The Government are committed to working with and listening to the representations from the public, community groups and law enforcement partners to tackle knife crime. The Government have taken measures to restrict and control the sale of knives. In the Violent Crime Reduction Act 2006 the Government made it illegal to sell knives to anyone under 18, and in April 2006, following a public consultation on offensive weapons, samurai swords were added to the 18 items on the Offensive Weapons Order which it is illegal to sell, hire, manufacture or import.</p>

These schemes for young people will make them understand the full consequences of their actions and will include weapons awareness sessions which provide detailed information on the risks and consequences of carrying knives; it may also include discussions with healthcare professionals and victims' organisations and offenders so that young people understand the full impact of carrying a knife and where it may lead.</p>

We recognise that people do not necessarily want lap dancing establishments in their neighbourhoods and we want to ensure local authorities have the powers to reflect the views of local people when considering applications and monitoring existing licenses. We will consider, for example, whether lap dancing clubs should fall under the category of Sex Encounter Establishments under the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1982 and legislate if there is a need to do so.</p>

 We use a number of measures to assess the changes in educational attainment in academies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_440"><a name="80901w0048.htm_para2"><a name="08090235000226">In 2007, for the 36 academies with underperforming predecessor schools (i.e. not including former City Technology Colleges) the proportion of students gaining five or more GCSE at A*-Cs increased from 22 per cent. in 2001 to 43.7 per cent. in 2007 compared to a national increase of 12.2 points. Including English and Maths the increase is 11.2 percentage points from 14.0 per cent. to 25.2 per cent. compared to a national increase of 7.8 points.</p>

The National Audit Office report of 2007 found that GCSE performance is improving faster in academies than in other types of school. Taking account of students' personal circumstances and their prior attainment, academies&#146; GCSE performance is substantially better, on average, than other schools. The 2007 PwC report also said that academies&#146; progress in terms of student  <br>

achievement has generally exceeded corresponding Improvements at a national level and amongst similar schools.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_442"><a name="80901w0048.htm_para4"><a name="08090235000228">Finally, Ofsted have now inspected 24 academies. One academy&#151;Mossbourne&#151;has been graded as outstanding in every single respect. In terms of their overall effectiveness, four have been graded as outstanding, seven good, with the remaining 13 graded as satisfactory. Key to the future success of the academies is their leadership and management. On this indicator, six academies have been graded outstanding, 17 good and one satisfactory. That means that 96 per cent. which have good or outstanding leadership, compared to 62 per cent. for secondary schools in general.</p>

 We have not made a formal assessment of the effects on local primary schools, local communities and local economies. However, there is anecdotal evidence that academies do have a positive effect in these areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_443"><a name="80901w0048.htm_para5"><a name="08090235000231">Many academies work closely with their feeder primary schools to help raise standards. For example, one sponsor is currently working on a joint programme between two academies and partner primaries, with involvement from the local authority and national strategies. This will involve joint training for primary and academy teachers, targeted interventions for pupils not performing at the expected level in writing, and teachers from year six of the primary schools and year seven of the academies meeting to discuss pupils&#146; progress and jointly agree targets for individual pupils. We are also supporting 15 academy projects that are all-through schools. In this way the academies will be able to make an impact at an earlier stage of their students&#146; education.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_445"><a name="80901w0048.htm_para7"><a name="08090235000233">We also have good anecdotal evidence that academies engage with their communities. For example, the Capital City Academy in Brent allows local supplementary schools to use their facilities, their professional library staff have worked closely with their local library service to set up reading events, and they have become central hubs for local sports and arts partnerships. They were recently named the specialist school which had made the greatest positive impact on its local schools. An award supported by their local family of schools.</p>

Examples of such events are hospitality from Ministers, at publicity events such as launches or the rare occasions when senior staff judge that official business can best be transacted by hosting a meeting over lunch or dinner. This policy is in accordance with the principles of Treasury guidance in &#147;Managing Public Money&#148; and &#147;Regularity, Propriety and Value for Money&#148;.</p>

If it is considered the occasion did not justify expenditure on alcohol the individual will be expected to meet the cost themselves.</p>

 The following tables provide details of the numbers of schools that have been designated as sports, technology, engineering and music colleges in each of the last three years. Design is not one of the 10 specialisms for which schools can apply under the specialist schools programme. I have, however, provided details of the number of technology and engineering colleges as design and technology is one of the subjects which schools designated as technology or engineering colleges may focus on. I would also refer the hon. Member to my answer of 21 July 2008 which set out the number of arts colleges designated in each of the last three years. Arts colleges specialising in visual or media arts will have an element of design within their specialist curriculum.</p>

The new model is designed to be simple, fair and transparent, and has helped to secure an above average settlement of 3.8 per cent. from Her Majesty's Treasury. It is based on one salary rate for each grade and Ofsted considers it to be both competitive and affordable. I have been advised by Her Majesty's chief inspector, Christine Gilbert, that Ofsted has engaged in extensive discussions with the unions about the settlement. There is no further money available for pay and Ofsted is unable to respond to the trade union demands regardless of the actions they are taking or may take in the future.</p>

This includes funding to help build kitchens in areas with no kitchen facilities and to better support the development of training centres for the school food workforce. We are also providing an extra &#163;6 million over the next three years to promote healthy food to young people and raise take up.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_520"><a name="80901w0054.htm_para2"><a name="08090235000750">Increasing school lunch take-up is also a priority for the School Food Trust. The Trust is supporting schools through its Million Meals Campaign and encouraging healthier eating through its Get Real media campaign aimed at young people. That work is having an impact as shown by the provisional findings from their third annual survey of take up of school meals, reporting on the 2007-08 financial year. In primary schools take up in 2007-08 was 43.6 per cent. an increase of 2.3 percentage points on the value reported for 2006-07 of 41.3 per cent. These figures illustrate that the number of primary school children eating school meals rose by roughly 88000 from 2006-07 to 2007-08.</p>

 In 2008 we maintained the fundamental aspects of the 2007 high performing specialist school (HPSS) criteria but raised minimum thresholds for GCSE 5+ A*-C including English and mathematics. The reasons for these changes were: to reflect the introduction of the national challenge and the Government's target that all secondary schools should have at least 30 per cent. of their pupils achieving five or more A*-C GCSEs including English and mathematics; to ensure that only the top third of re-designated schools qualify for the HPSS programme; and to make the best use of available resources.</p>

These schools still have the opportunity to maintain the status if their 2008 results are above the necessary threshold. Specialist schools receive an additional &#163;60,000 to &#163;90,000 per year depending on the HPSS roles acquired. Schools that do not meet the criteria will retain funding for these additional roles until August 2009 to plan for any loss in funding. The impact on the Department's budget is neutral as we continue to identify new HPSS and remain on schedule to identify a total of 30 per cent. of all specialist schools to take on an additional HPSS role by 2011.</p>

However, DfEE research on teacher absence published in 2000 &#147;(Health Retirement and absenteeism Amongst teachers, Research Report 235)&#148; found stress was the fourth most common reason for absence.</p>

<i> [holding answer 22 July 2008]:</i> It is our policy that all young people have the opportunity to benefit from work experience and we estimate that around 95 per cent. do so, amounting to over half a million placements each year during key stage 4, the final two years of compulsory education. We have published a new standard for work experience which includes specific references to roles and responsibilities for the health and safety of young people. Records of accidents during school hours, including those occurring during work experience, are held by schools who have the primary duty of care. Employers are also responsible for everyone on their premises. The Department for Children, Schools and Families does not collect or hold such data centrally but anecdotal evidence suggests that, with such a massive volume of placements, the track record on safety is first rate and a credit to everyone involved.</p>

A finished admission episode is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one health care provider. Admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year. Admissions to hospital via A&amp;E include admission methods 21 and 28 (21 = Emergency: via A&amp;E services, including the casualty department of the provider/28 = Emergency: other means, including patients who arrive via the A&amp;E department of another healthcare provider). <i> Data Quality</i> Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) are compiled from data sent by over 300 NHS trusts, and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England. Data are also received from a number of independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain. <i> Specialty</i> Care is needed when analysing HES data by specialty, or by groups of specialties (such as Acute). Trusts have different ways of managing specialties and attributing codes so it is better to analyse by specific diagnoses, operations or other recorded information. <i> Assessing growth through time</i> HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. During the years that these records have been collected by the NHS, there have been ongoing improvements in quality and coverage. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example a number of procedures may now be undertaken in out-patient settings and may no longer be accounted in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time. <i> Ungrossed Data</i> The data are ungrossed. This means no estimates (grossing factors) have been added to the data set to make up for any shortfalls or gaps in the data.  <i> Source:</i>  HES, The NHS Information Centre for health and social care.<br>

<p><a name="stpa_544"><a name="80901w0057.htm_para4"><a name="08090235001342">A new national health service indicator has been put into place to measure the change in the rate of hospital admissions for alcohol related harm from April 2008&#151;the first ever national commitment to monitor how the NHS is tackling alcohol health harms.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_545"><a name="80901w0057.htm_para5"><a name="08090235001343">This indicator is expected to encourage PCTs to invest in earlier identification of people who drink too much, linked to advice and support from GPs or other health care staff&#151;shown to be the best way of reducing the kind of 'everyday' drinking which over time leads to liver disease and other problems, including dependency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_546"><a name="80901w0057.htm_para6"><a name="08090235001344">From 2007-08 PCTs have received an extra &#163;15 million of additional funding to improve alcohol interventions. The National Audit Office will carry out a value for money audit of NHS spend on alcohol interventions and specialist treatment, with a report expected this autumn.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_547"><a name="80901w0057.htm_para7"><a name="08090235001345">In total 76 local authorities have chosen to set a target using National Indicator 31, rate of hospital admissions per 100,000 for alcohol related harm, of the National Indicator Set, as part of their local area agreement. The National Indicator Set allows progress against national priorities, agreed by Government, to be measured and strengthens the incentives for improved and closer partnership working.</p>

 The 2007-08 national GP Patient Survey results were published on 16 July 2008, by the Information Centre for health and social care. The survey was conducted from January to March 2008 and shows improvements in patients experience of access during core general practitioner (GP) opening hours, but with more patients wanting to see a GP at convenient times, including, later in the evening or at weekends.

 Practice-based commissioning has two elements, which when supported by appropriate governance arrangements, have the potential to improve-the range and quality of local services. Firstly, the multi-professional, collaborative work in commissioning better care for local populations. Secondly, the role of general practitioner practices in providing an enhanced range of services for their patients. For example by establishing a phlebotomy service in the practice so patients do not have to attend outpatients, or by employing an extra nurse to provide proactive care in the community in order to reduce the number of emergency referrals. The Department will provide further information on this later this summer as part of a package of measures to highlight the precise role and contribution of practice-based commissioning.</p>

 The current general medical services (GMS) weighted capitation payment per registered patient is &#163;54.72 but the protection of historic income by the Minimum Practice Income Guarantee means that most GMS practices receive more than this and there is wide variation in the payments that practices receive. If these protected payments were distributed fairly and equitably between GMS practices the average GMS weighted payment per patient nationally would be &#163;66. In North Yorkshire and York Primary Care Trust the average GMS weighted capitation payments received by practices is &#163;69.

 The Department expects each primary care trust (PCT) to secure a general practitioner (GP) led health centre during 2008-09. As the recent national GP Patient Survey demonstrates, patients across all parts of the country wish to have greater and more convenient access to GP services. It is for primary care trusts to develop models of primary care and community services that focus more strongly on promoting health, preventing illness and managing long-term conditions. PCTs may therefore chose to commission a wider range of responsive services that reflect local health need and maximise integration with other services such as diagnostics, dentistry, pharmacy and social care.</p>

 This is a local contractual matter for each primary care trust (PCT). However, we have advised PCTs to set a local equitable price per patient per year of care (i.e. a fair and equitable weighted capitation payment per patient); or to obtain a cost per registered patient through the procurement process. Where PCTs choose to set a local price, the payment mechanism should be calculated on a weighted capitation basis i.e. based on the expected age/sex/deprivation and demographics of the population to be covered. Where PCTs decide to ask bidders to bid on a price per registered patient, per year basis, a comparison should be made with the price per patient for existing practices with similar patient demographic characteristics.</p>

The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain. <i> Finished admission episodes</i> A finished admission episode is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one health care provider. Please note that admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year. <i> Finished consultant episode (FCE)</i> An FCE is defined as a period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one health care provider. Please note that the figures do not represent the number of patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the year. <i> Main procedure/intervention</i> The main procedure/intervention is the first recorded procedure or intervention in the HES data set and is usually the most resource intensive procedure or intervention performed during the episode. <i> Heart operations</i> K01-K78 <i> Secondary procedure</i> As well as the main operative procedure, there are up to 11 (three prior to 2002-03) secondary operation fields in Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) that show secondary or additional procedures performed on the patient during the episode of care. <i> Time waited (days)</i> Time waited statistics from Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) are not the same as the published waiting list statistics. HES provides counts and time waited for all patients admitted to hospital within a given period whereas the published waiting list statistics count those waiting for treatment on a specific date and how long they have been on the waiting list. Also, HES calculates the time waited as the difference between the admission and decision to admit dates. Unlike published waiting list statistics, this is not adjusted for self-deferrals or periods of medical/social suspension. The IC have provided the mean (average) and median (middle in ranking) days waited where there was a main procedure of 'heart operation' in 2005-06 and 2006-07. The median figures are a better proxy to the average time waited as mean figures can cloud the real picture as some anomalies (long-waiters) may be artificially increasing the average. Ungrossed data Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).<i>   Source:</i>  Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), The NHS Information Centre for Health and Social Care.<br>

So far, the MHRA has received 38 THR applications, of which 33 are for products containing a single active ingredient and five are for combination products.

2. Data Quality: HES are compiled from data sent by over 300 national health service trusts and primary care trusts in England. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. Whilst this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.  3. Assessing growth through time: HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. During the years that these records have been collected by the NHS, there have been on-going improvements in quality and coverage. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example a number of procedures may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and may no longer be counted in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.  4.

The basis of the strategy is that the transfer of one embryo at a time, where this is clinically appropriate, will reduce the health risks of multiple births for mother and babies. The strategy is being implemented in partnership with professional bodies, patient groups and clinics. We have established an expert group on commissioning national health service infertility provision, which will take account of the HFEA&#146;s programme of work in this area.</p>

<i> [holding answer 16 July 2008]:</i> Information is collected on the number of finished admission episodes to hospital. A finished admission episode is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one health care provider.

* The technical term for what has been supplied is finished admission episodes.<br>
<i> Assignment of Episodes to Years</i><br>
Years are assigned by the end of the first period of care in a patient&#146;s hospital stay.<br>
<i> Finished admission episodes</i><br>
A finished admission episode is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one health care provider. Admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>
Cause code&#151;stab wounds** and gunshot wounds***<br>
The cause code is a supplementary code that indicates the nature of any external cause of injury, poisoning or other adverse effects.<br>
Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) has used the following ICD-10 external cause codes when referring to gunshot wounds and knife-related injuries.<br>
** Stab wounds:<br>
X99.&#151;Assault by sharp object<br>
*** Gunshot wounds:<br>
W32.&#151;Handgun discharge<br>
W33.&#151;Rifle, shotgun and larger firearm discharge<br>
W34.&#151;Discharge from other and unspecified firearms<br>
X72.&#151;Intentional self-harm by handgun discharge<br>

X74.&#151;Intentional self-harm by other and unspecified firearm discharge<br>
X93.&#151;Assault by handgun discharge<br>
X94.&#151;Assault by rifle, shotgun and larger firearm discharge<br>
X95.&#151;Assault by other and unspecified firearm discharge<br>

Y35.0 Legal intervention involving firearm discharge<br>
Y36.4 War operations involving firearm discharge and other forms of conventional warfare<br>
<i> Data Quality</i><br>
HES are compiled from data sent by over 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br>
<i> Assessing growth through time</i><br>
HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. During the years that these records have been collected, the NHS there have seen ongoing improvements in quality and coverage. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example, a number of procedures may now be undertaken in out-patient settings and may no longer be accounted in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.<br>
<i> Ungrossed Data</i><br>
Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).<br>
<i> Low Numbers</i><br>
Due to reasons of confidentiality, figures between 1 and 5 have been suppressed and replaced with &#147;*&#148; (an asterisk).<br>
<i> PCT and SHA Data Quality</i><br>
PCT and SHA data was added to historic data-years in the HES database using 2002-03 boundaries, as a one-off exercise in 2004. The quality of the data on PCT of Treatment and SHA of Treatment is poor in 1996-97, 1997-98 and 1998-99, with over a third of all finished episodes having missing values in these years. Data quality of PCT of general practitioner (GP) practice and SHA of GP practice in 1997-98 and 1998-99 is also poor, with a high proportion missing values where practices changed or ceased to exist. There is less change in completeness of the residence-based fields over time, where the majority of unknown values are due to missing postcodes on birth episodes. Users of time series analysis including these years need to be aware of these issues in their interpretation of the data.<br>

 All clinicians are required by their professional bodies, and for clinical governance and medico-legal reasons to keep clear, accurate, legible and contemporaneous patient records, and to keep these secure and confidential. This is most often likely to be in electronic form. This is irrespective of the national programme for IT and systems implemented by local service providers. Patients are able to opt out of having their clinical information uploaded to the &#147;spine&#148;, the national database of key information about patients' health and care within the national health service care records service, by choosing not to have a summary care record.</p>

 While it is never possible to eliminate all risk, stringent security controls and safeguards have been put in place to prevent unrestricted or uncontrolled access to personal information accessible through HealthSpace. Authentication of patients seeking a HealthSpace account has been designed to operate within the specified e-Government Interoperability Framework (e-gif) requirements and industry best practices. In due course, when the technology to do so becomes available, registration requirements will be uprated to the next highest level.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_723"><a name="80901w0082.htm_para8"><a name="08090235007045">In addition, the HealthSpace system has been subjected to exhaustive penetration testing to demonstrate its resilience to unauthorised attempts by third parties to access data held within it.

The safeguarding of access controls, including PINS and passwords, is an example of personal responsibility, along with not choosing to access records at a time or location where others may see them. Users will be supported in this by means of standard technical measures used widely in secure electronic transactions, for example by the setting of a 'timeout', so that after a given period of inactivity the user is automatically logged off the system.</p>

 Legitimate relationships are a form of access control that prevent those who are not working in a team that is involved in providing national health service care to an individual from accessing that individual's clinical information. NHS organisations will determine which of their staff work within which teams for this purpose.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_725"><a name="80901w0082.htm_para10"><a name="08090235007051">A new legitimate relationship is normally created when a patient is referred to a team for care. This referral may be from a different part of the NHS or may be a self-referral by a patient, for example when attending a minor injuries unit, or when registering with a general practitioner's practice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_726"><a name="80901w0082.htm_para11"><a name="08090235007052">Some clinicians, particularly those working in emergency care environments, are also able to establish a legitimate relationship with a patient when this is needed to support emergency care. These &#147;self-declared&#148; legitimate relationships generate an alert to staff responsible for ensuring that the facility is not misused.</p>

 The NHS Care Record Service links patient information from different parts of the national health service electronically so that authorised NHS staff and patients have the information they need to make care decisions. It comprises a number of national services, and compliant local applications, for example trust patient administration systems, and general practitioner systems. These local applications hold their own data and interact through messages with national services such as choose and book, the summary care record, and the personal demographics service. All local applications that interact with the national services require a valid smartcard.</p>

This position was formally agreed with Ministers in February 2007. At no point have we changed how we are measuring the target. It is being measured in the same way as other national targets.</p>

 Financial liability for performance under the contract with Fujitsu, terminated on 28 May 2008, will ultimately be determined by agreement between the parties, or failing that by arbitration, or by a court. The contract, which was reset in September 2005, provides for caps of liability. Fujitsu&#146;s liability to the Department is capped at &#163;100 million per contract year, and an aggregate total of &#163;500 million. The Department&#146;s liability is capped at &#163;50 million per contract year. In both cases, the liabilities have potential to apply from the last contract reset.</p>

 As the National Audit Office has recently reported, although deployment by local service providers has started, the completion of deployment of systems to all hospitals is likely to take some four years longer than originally planned. This delay is regrettable and is related to the scale and complexity of the task. This is because the new systems have taken longer to be developed and because they are being installed into acute hospitals that already have between 20 and 40 existing systems, built to different standards over many years. The new systems need to be made to operate seamlessly and safely with these non-standard existing systems and interfaces, with associated data cleansing and data quality requirements.</p>

<i> Notes:</i><br>
1. Berkshire consists of Berkshire East Teaching PCT and Berkshire West PCT in 2007 and the following PCTs in 2002: Slough PCT, Bracknell Forest PCT, Windsor, Ascot and Maidenhead PCT, Newbury and Community PCT, Reading PCT and Wokingham PCT. Prior to this, in 1997, there was Berkshire HA and no lower level breakdown available.<br>
2. GP Data is available by SHA and PCT only, there are no GPs recorded in Acute Trusts or Ambulance Trusts on the GP Census Collection. This, as well as part-mergers of trust boundaries in recent years, can make comparability difficult between GP Data, non-medical staff data and medical and dental workforce data over a time-series at local trust level.<br>

 All new foundation trusts and existing foundation trusts whose contracts expired by 31 March adopted the standard national health service contract for acute services. The standard contract requires all signatories set out relevant services in Choose and Book through a Directory of Service. Foundation trusts whose contracts extended beyond this date were able to choose to adopt the standard contract or to retain their existing contracts until the required period of notice to change had expired. These foundation trusts are not legally obliged to set out their services on Choose and Book and to accept patients under free choice though, under payment by results, this would mean a possible loss of potential income.

1. These incidents exclude duplicated incidents and incidents where the submitting organisation/individual did not consent to provide their details. Incidents where the data provided did not meet our minimum requirements were excluded from these results. Incidents from Welsh organisations, community pharmacies and NHS Direct were also not included.<br>
2. As reporting to the NRLS is done on a voluntary basis, the figures provided should not be used as an indicator of national trends.<br>
3. NRLS Reports Disclaimer Statement: NPSA Staff<br>
The incidents summarised in this report have been drawn from the NPSA National Reporting and Learning System (NRLS). The NRLS supports the goal of the NPSA to make patient care safer. The NRLS is a confidential reporting system. The incidents are reported through a variety of routes, by individual NHS staff, including through local trust risk management systems and web based e-forms (including an open access e-form). The individual reports are not investigated or verified by the NPSA. Since these incidents are self-reported they are not necessarily representative of the NHS across England and Wales and therefore need interpreting with care.<br>
4. Permission must be obtained from the NPSA before the information contained within the report it is published or passed on to a third party outside the NPSA.<br>
For help with interpretation please contact the statistics team on statisticsteam@npsa.nhs.uk.<br>
