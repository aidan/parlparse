<P>
<a name="10502w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Mitchell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, pursuant to his answer of 10 April 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 532W, on the rapid reaction force, if a representative of the Danish Government was <i>(a)</i> present at and <i>(b)</i> participated in the discussion of the Presidency report on European security and defence policy; and how much time the Council spent discussing the report.  [158815]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10502w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Vaz: </B> 
 Representatives of the Danish Government were present at and participated in discussion of the Nice Presidency report on European defence. Competent bodies of the Council discussed this report at length in the weeks leading up to the Nice European Council.

<a name="10502w01.html_wqn1"><B> Dr. Starkey: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs if he will place in the Library the agenda for the meeting of the EU Association Committee in May to review the operation of the EU-Israel Association agreement.  [158804]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10502w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Vaz: </B> 
 A copy of the provisional agenda, agreed by the EU and Israel, was deposited in the Library on 26 April.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10502w01.html_wqn2"><B> Dr. Starkey: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what action the EU Association Committee will consider at its meeting in May to stop the import into the EU under preferences of goods labelled "made in Israel" which originate in Israeli settlements in the occupied territories.  [158807]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10502w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Vaz: </B> 
 The EU/Israel Association committee will discuss goods from settlements under the agenda item entitled "Rules of Origin". We expect the EU to raise the post-verification requests for certificates of origin and to remind the Israelis that they have until June 2001 to respond.
<P>

<a name="10502w01.html_para0">In consultation with the European Commission, the UK and other members states are carrying out a post- verification exercise in relation to a number of goods exported to the EU and described as Israeli. These are goods which benefit from preferential access to the EU under the origin protocol in the EU/Israel Association agreement.
<P>

<a name="10502w01.html_para1">The UK continues to support the Commission's efforts to establish whether any infringement of the EU/Israel Association agreement has taken place.

<a name="10502w01.html_wqn3"><B> Dr. Starkey: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs who will represent the British Government at the meeting in May of the EU Association committee reviewing the EU-Israel Association agreement.  [158805]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10502w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Vaz: </B> 
 The EU-Israel Association agreement states that "the Association Committee shall meet at official level". The UK will be represented by an official from the UK permanent representation to the EU.

<P>
<a name="10502w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Llew Smith: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what recent reports he has received concerning industrial activities undertaken at the Al Daura plant, near Baghdad.  [159729]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10502w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 The Iraqi acting Minister for Foreign Affairs wrote to the UN Secretary-General on 28 March requesting that funds from the UK oil-for-food programme be used for the reactivation of the Al Daura facility for the production of foot and mouth vaccine.
<P>

<a name="10502w01.html_para2">In the continuing absence of UN monitors, the United Kingdom has opposed this request for reactivation of a plant known to have been used for biological weapons production in the past.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10502w01.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Nicholas Winterton: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what recent representations he has made to <i>(a)</i> the European Commission and <i>(b)</i> the Government of Spain regarding the handling of internationally dialled telephone calls routed through Spain destined for Gibraltar.  [156134]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10502w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Vaz: </B> 
 This matter was raised with the Spanish Government on 20 March, and with the Commission on 30 March.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10502w01.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Nicholas Winterton: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what representations he has received regarding using the Gibraltar international direct dialling code prefix 350.  [156131]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10502w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Vaz: </B> 
 The Government of Gibraltar have brought to our attention various issues related to the use of Gibraltar's international direct dialling code.
<P>

<a name="10502w01.html_para3">As my hon. Friend the Minister for Small Business and E-Commerce made clear in her answer of 6 April 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 305W, we remain deeply concerned about the unsatisfactory situation. We will continue to pursue the issue as a matter of urgency.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10502w01.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Nicholas Winterton: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs if he will make a statement on the United Kingdom Government's relations with Spain regarding the freedom of movement of trade and services in relation to Gibraltar.  [156132]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10502w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Vaz: </B> 
 When Gibraltar became part of the European Community upon the United Kingdom's accession in 1973, Gibraltar did not join the Customs Union. This is recognised by all member states. Subsequent EU legislation concerning the free movement of goods has not therefore been applied in relation to Gibraltar. EU legislation concerning the free movement of services has however been applied.

<a name="10502w01.html_sbhd4"><H4><center>Clemency Pleas</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="10502w01.html_wqn8"><B> Mrs. Humble: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs if it is Her Majesty's Government's policy to support a plea for clemency from a British national imprisoned overseas.  [160352]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10502w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 Our objective is to support pleas for clemency in deserving cases, while respecting the sovereign right of foreign Governments to sentence prisoners according to their own laws. Following an internal review, we have decided to widen our existing criteria for supporting clemency pleas. We will now consider supporting clemency pleas from British nationals imprisoned overseas in the following cases:
<P>

<a name="10502w01.html_para4"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>in compelling compassionate circumstances, such as where a prisoner is chronically ill or dying (particularly when prison conditions overseas are poor) or when a close family member is chronically ill or dying; where continued incarceration is likely to endanger life or is likely to reduce life expectancy significantly;
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="10502w01.html_para5"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>in cases of minors imprisoned overseas;
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="10502w01.html_para6"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>as a last resort, in cases where we have prima facie evidence of a denial or miscarriage of justice, where we have made representations, but where those representations have failed to secure a remedy. In these cases, our reasons for supporting a plea would not normally be mentioned explicitly in the plea itself.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="10502w01.html_para7">We will also take the prisoner's family circumstances into account when considering whether to support a plea for clemency. We will examine all pleas on a case-by- case basis.
<P>

<a name="10502w01.html_para8">Our previous policy was to support clemency pleas in compelling compassionate circumstances, such as where a prisoner was terminally ill, or where the death of a spouse would leave young children with no one to care for them. The new policy demonstrates our commitment to protecting the human rights of British nationals.

<a name="10502w01.html_sbhd5"><H4><center>Humanitarian Crises</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="10502w01.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. David Taylor: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what progress has been made in Her Majesty's Government's consultations with international partners on UK proposals for international action in response to humanitarian crises.  [160353]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10502w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 We firmly believe that we have a shared responsibility to respond when confronted with massive violations of international humanitarian law and crimes against humanity. The UK has played a leading role in this continuously evolving debate. We have spent the past year trying to build the broadest possible consensus around a set of ideas on the conditions and circumstances that make international action appropriate. We believe such a consensus could strengthen the Security Council's ability to respond effectively and promptly to humanitarian crises. Our ideas have been framed as policy guidelines to help the international community decide when it is right to act.
<P>

<a name="10502w01.html_para9">The key elements of our ideas are:
<P>

<a name="10502w01.html_para10"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>that any intervention is by definition a failure of prevention. Force should always be the last resort;
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="10502w01.html_para11"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>that the immediate responsibility for halting violence rests with the state in which it occurs;




<P>
</UL></FONT><P><I>2 May 2001 : Column: 630W</I><P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>
<P>
<BR>
but when faced with an immediate humanitarian catastrophe and a Government who have demonstrated themselves unwilling or unable to halt or prevent it, the international community should take action;
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="10502w01.html_para12"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>any use of force in this context must be collective, proportionate, likely to achieve its objective, and carried out in accordance with international law.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="10502w01.html_para13">Our consultations will continue, but progress has proved difficult. Many countries have reservations about the concepts involved, fearing that their endorsement would undermine the principle of state sovereignty.
<P>

<a name="10502w01.html_para14">Copies of our set of ideas have been placed in the Libraries of the House of Commons and House of Lords.

<a name="10502w01.html_sbhd6"><H4><center>MV Etireno</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="10502w01.html_wqn10"><B> Mr. Welsh: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what measures were taken by his Department during the recent hunt for the MV Etireno; and what steps his Department <i>(a)</i> has taken and <i>(b)</i> intends to take, to combat the trade in child slavery.  [159859]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10502w01.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 The UK was the first to respond to the Benin authorities' request for help to search for the Etireno. HMS Glasgow was in the area and we offered her services. This offer was declined when it became clear that the Etireno had returned to Benin.
<P>

<a name="10502w01.html_para15">The UK is firmly committed to eradicating slavery and bonded labour worldwide. We played a leading role in drafting and securing agreement to the International Labour Convention 182 on the worst forms of child labour. We are working with international and non- governmental organisations and industry to address the problem of child slavery, and are looking at what we can do to increase these efforts.
<P>

<a name="10502w01.html_para16">I am meeting industry representatives, and also Ministers from the Government of Cote d'Ivoire, on 4 May.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10502w02.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Brake: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will list the deliveries of <i>(a)</i> incinerator ash, <i>(b)</i> mixed waste containing organics and <i>(c)</i> compost to (i) Burnside Farm at Heddon-on-the-Wall and (ii) other farms by (1) Newcastle Council's Waste Department, (2) City Works and (3) Associated Waste Services from (A) domestic, (B) commercial and (C) institutional premises; and what tests have been carried out on animal feed for dioxin, furan and PCB content.  [155313]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10502w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 26 April 2001]:</i> Section 34 of the Environment Protection Act 1990 imposes a duty of care on waste producers and others who have control of waste. The parties to the transfer of waste are required to keep records but information on waste 



<P>
<P><I>2 May 2001 : Column: 631W</I><P>
transfers is not held centrally. Duty of care records can, of course, be sought locally through the Environment Agency's serving a notice on the parties concerned.
<P>

<a name="10502w02.html_para0">The Environment Agency advises that it has not carried out tests on animal feed and holds no information on any such tests carried out by others. In my reply of 30 March 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 818W, I have separately provided the hon. Member with a list of the sites which have received ash from the Byker Reclamation Plant--including farms.

 The Department for the Environment, Transport and the Regions has received two written representations on this issue within the past six months. In addition the Radioactive Waste Management Advisory Committee presented a Report, published in November 2000, on the Radioactive Waste Implications of Reprocessing. In their report, the Committee noted that the reduction of HAL stocks to buffer levels was extremely important and that HSE had set a target date of 2015 for this. The Committee recommended that progress

 Late last year a Joint SRA/DfEE Working Group was established to look at the current and future skills needs of the rail industry. The Joint Working Group recently published an 18-Point Action Plan which provides a strategic approach to recruitment, training, assessment and competence of key staff. The Plan is being taken forward and monitored by the high level Rail Industry Group, chaired by Sir Alastair Morton, which had also identified the need for action and had set up its own cross-industry group to tackle the issues. Initial outcomes of the various initiatives are expected to be seen in the autumn.

 No. The detailed provisions of franchise agreements are for the Strategic Rail Authority to decide. I understand that the Authority does not consider that SQUIRE, which involves direct checking of inputs by PTE inspectors, is the most suitable or efficient way to control standards. It prefers to measure service quality through the National Passenger Survey, Customer Satisfaction Surveys and Mystery Traveller Surveys which reflect passengers' opinions. Bidders for replacement franchises are being asked to demonstrate how they will develop and deliver a step-change in customer service.

 The final approach tracks followed by aircraft approaching Heathrow to land have to be aligned with the runways in order to comply with long established internationally agreed standards. They have not changed and cannot be changed unilaterally.
<P>

<a name="10502w04.html_para0">The paths that aircraft follow before aligning with the runway are not fixed, in order to allow for safe tactical integration of up to four streams of traffic, but the area of airspace used for this purpose has been established in its present form for about 30 years. An "early morning landings trial" commenced in September 1995, which required aircraft during westerly operations at night (before 6.00am) to join the 3o glideslope of the instrument landing system (ILS) at or above 3,000 ft (instead of 2,500 ft) and to join the final approach track at not less than 10 nautical miles (18&#189; km) from touchdown. The trial was evaluated and a summary of the findings was published in the November 1998 consultation paper on night restrictions at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted airports (copies of which were placed in the Libraries of the House). It was found that the trial procedure produced a reduction in noise exposure in the area between 16&#189; km and 31&#189; km from touchdown. Some noise increases were caused in parts of Clapham, Deptford, Lewisham and Blackheath because more aircraft joined the ILS final approach track further from touchdown. A redistribution of traffic over built-up areas can result in gains and losses but may be justified, as in this case, where the gains substantially outweigh the losses. The study also found a small increase in the achievement of the noise reducing continuous descent approach (CDA) procedure even though the CDA instructions were not changed for the trial.

 My Department publishes annual daytime noise contours for Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted airports. These contours cover the 16 hour day from 0700 to 2300 BST, averaged for the relatively busy period 16 June to 15 September. The contours for 2000 are about to be published by the CAA on the Department's behalf; and the explanatory booklets, including small-scale versions of the contours, will be placed on the DETR website shortly. All take-offs are monitored for compliance with the departure noise limits. The new daytime and night-time limits announced by my hon. Friend on 18 December 2000, <i>Official Report,</i> columns 11-12W, have come into effect. Readings from these and other noise monitors (covering both arrivals and departures) are used, along with radar data on the dispersion of aircraft tracks, to validate the model used to generate the contours. Other measurements are taken, and contours produced from time to time, for various studies on behalf of the Department and of the airports.
<P>

<a name="10502w04.html_para1">We do not routinely publish contours for aircraft noise at night at these airports, as research has suggested that, because of the uneven and distinct patterns of operation, these would not be sufficiently well correlated with sleep disturbance and annoyance. However, operations at night are subject to the restrictions, including movement limits and noise quotas made, after consultation, by Notice under s.78 of the Civil Aviation Act 1982; and are monitored and reported by the airports accordingly.
<P>

 Officials carried out a preliminary review of the staffing of the Office of the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards in spring 2000, because of concerns which had arisen over the office's work load. The outcome of this work was reported to the House of Commons Commission on 3 July 2000, and temporary additional secretarial support was provided, pending a more thorough review of work load to be carried out by the staff inspector from the internal review service (IRS).
<P>

<a name="10502w04.html_para4">The findings of the IRS review were reported to the Commission late in 2000. The Commission referred the matter to the Finance and Services Committee whose

The temporary additional secretarial support would remain in place for the time being.

<a name="10502w04.html_para6">There has been no significant direct read across between the Arleigh Burke class, which includes the USS Winston Churchill, and our more recent type 45 programme. Although similar in size to the Arleigh Burke class, the type 45 anti-air warfare destroyer, equipped with the principal anti-air missile system, offers, we believe, significant acquisition and through-life cost benefits over earlier generations of destroyers.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will publish the health data for the fluoride compounds used in artificial fluoridation procedures.  [158441]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10502w07.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 Fluoride compounds used for artificial fluoridation break down to release fluoride and other ions when mixed with water. These ions occur naturally in water supplies. The recently published review by York University found no evidence of any harmful effects on systemic health from drinking fluoridated water and acknowledged benefits in reducing tooth decay. However, as the review was critical of the quality of the research available, we have asked the Medical Research Council how the evidence base might be strengthened.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will make a statement on dental fluorosis with specific regard to links to systemic toxicity.  [158440]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10502w07.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 Dental fluorosis is considered to be an effect seen in teeth and due to the presence of fluoride in the body while teeth are being formed. Its presence does not necessarily imply any harm to health or that fluoride is having any effect, good or bad, on any other part of the body.

 <i>[holding answer 26 April 2001]:</i> The Eastern Regional Office of the National Health Service Executive is working closely with the East and North Hertfordshire NHS trust and Hertfordshire health authority to address deep seated and longstanding financial and service challenges going back at least a decade. For 2001-02 the health authority received additional funding of &#163;26.5 million (8.25 per cent.) to enable it to meet waiting time targets, to effect service improvements to deliver the NHS Plan, and to meet cost and service pressures.
<P>

<a name="10502w07.html_para0">At the end of March 2001, as a result of reallocation of funding within the Department, the regional office was able to allocate a further &#163;6.5 million to East and North Hertfordshire. In addition two reviews on financial

 Chapter 10 of the NHS Plan proposed that community health councils be abolished and new structures set in place to increase patient and public empowerment across all sectors of the health service. Following the launch of the NHS Plan in July 2001 a public undertaking was given to involve national and local stakeholder groups in developing the detail of the new structures. A series of seminars was held in November and December 2001 and focused on the various elements of the new arrangements and involved key representative groups. Since then the proposal for abolition of CHCs and the development of the new structures have been subject to debate through the introduction of the Health and Social Care Bill. Key stakeholder groups have continued to be involved in the development of the new arrangements.

The number of health authorities will be cut by around two thirds, and it is expected that around half of the posts currently in regional offices will go. Net savings will be at least &#163;100 million. Precise staffing arrangements will be for local decision. Where possible, job reductions will be achieved by natural turnover.

<P>
<a name="10502w08.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The social services inspectorate social care regions and inspection groups, and the SSI/Audit Commission joint review team all contribute to the assessment of the performance of each local council with social services responsibilities. Their work is informed by the performance information collected by the local council, through the performance assessment framework. Some inspections cover broad areas of services, such as children's services. Others focus on more specific tasks, such as monitoring the performance of authorities which are subject to special measures.
<P>

<a name="10502w08.html_para1">The SSI social care regions monitor the progress made by all councils in implementing the "Government's Objectives for Children's Social Services", progress on major initiatives such as Quality Protects, and action plans to address the recommendations of inspections and joint reviews.
<P>

<a name="10502w08.html_para2">Many agencies beyond social services departments have child protection responsibilities. These responsibilities are set out in detail in "Working Together to Safeguard Children". For the first time ever, beginning later this year, there will be a programme of children's safeguards inspections. These inspections will focus on the working of area child protection committees in their implementation of "Working Together to Safeguard Children", and the inter-agency arrangements to assess and address the risks posed by dangerous adults. They will be undertaken by a team of inspectors drawn from each of the inspectorates for the range of agencies with regular contact with children, and will be led by the SSI. It will therefore include inspectors from Ofsted, the Commission for Health Improvement, Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary, HMI Prisons, and will be supported by the Magistrates Courts Service Inspectorate and the Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate.

 Regional tourist boards (RTBs) in England will receive &#163;5.5 million during the current financial year. The funding, allocated to the RTBs by the English Tourism Council (ETC), is provided for work that complements the ETC's role in delivering national and regional programmes--in line with "Tomorrow's Tourism", the Government's tourism strategy--rather than for direct marketing.
<P>

<a name="10502w08.html_para3">However, the ETC have received an additional allocation of &#163;3.8 million to fund a national and regional information and promotion campaign as part of the foot and mouth recovery plan.

[158210]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10502w09.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Chris Smith: </B> 
 The financial assistance provided by Sport England to assist young people with the potential to reach the national squads is currently provided through the lottery funded world class programmes: performance, potential and start.
<P>

<a name="10502w09.html_para0">The funding is provided to both the national governing body for the main costs associated with the programmes and also to individual athletes included in the plans.
<P>

<a name="10502w09.html_para1">In the current financial year, boxing has been awarded funding for world class performance, potential and start. The potential squad includes 14 young people around the ages of 18/19 who are receiving individual financial assistance. Two are from the south-east, one of whom is from London. Cricket similarly has been awarded financial support for its world class programmes. However, while no young people currently receive individual assistance they will benefit from the &#163;2 million programme award. Football does not have a world class programme due to the lack of financial need, which therefore means that no young people currently receive financial assistance through the world class programmes.

Through correspondence and a meeting with officials, we have made the Kirch group fully aware of the extent of this legislation: that the whole of the World cup finals tournament (all 64 matches) is a listed event, and that any broadcaster purchasing live rights from Kirch would have to comply with the provisions of the 1996 Broadcasting Act.

Information relating to the indicators can be found in the second Government "Opportunity for all" report on tackling poverty and social exclusion, "One year on: making a difference" (Cm 4865). The report also describes and monitors the impact of policies we have already introduced, and sets out our plans for the future.

Kilbride office. In our new London headquarters building, which we are due to move into later this year, we are replacing the old hydrochlorofluorocarbon-based (HCFC) systems with a HFC alternative, "134A", which has zero ozone depletion potential. This follows a detailed evaluation of the most appropriate system given the requirements and constraints of the existing building.

 My Department already actively considers the use of appropriate alternative refrigerants, and leakage control systems, for our main headquarters buildings. For instance, we will be relocating to a new London headquarters building at the end of this year, and as part of the refurbishment works a wide range of refrigerants were considered for both their ozone depletion potential (ODP) and global warming potential (GWP). We have decided to replace the current hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC) refrigerant--R22--with a modern HFC alternative, "134A", which has zero ODP. This will meet the requirements under the Montreal protocol to phase out the use of R22. We will also carry out a review of the suitable refrigerant alternatives for a second much smaller London building, for which we have just taken responsibility.

However, of the total number reported, 115 were from the London metropolitan district, 20 from the midlands, 14 from the south-west, 12 from the north-west, 11 from the south-east, 10 from the south and seven from Wales. Figures are not available for Scotland and Northern Ireland.

<a name="10502w13.html_spnew12"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 The National Asylum Support Service consults regional consortiums which are local authority- led about the identification of cluster areas. Any evidence put forward about the suitability of the area for the accommodation of asylum seekers received as part of this consultation process will be taken into account. Once an area has been identified as a cluster area there is no formal appeal process against its use for accommodating asylum seekers, but any evidence put forward as to why a particular area should no longer be a cluster would be given due consideration. No area has had their designation as a cluster area removed.

<P>
<a name="10502w13.html_spnew16"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 The National Asylum Support Service (NASS) conducts research to identify cluster areas. Information is received from the local authority led regional consortiums, voluntary groups and other organisations with an interest in asylum. There is a consultation process in place to seek advice from local health and education authorities. Any information received will be taken into account, and this can include information about unemployment rates, health services and education provision. The Commission for Racial Equality is consulted on specific issues.
<P>

<a name="10502w13.html_para21">Ideally, NASS aims to establish cluster areas where there is suitable and available accommodation and where it would be possible to link with existing communities and to develop the support of voluntary and community groups. In some cases not all of the above criteria will be in place before asylum seekers are dispersed and it is recognised that some support structures are unlikely to develop until asylum seekers are actually located in an area.

<P>
<a name="10502w13.html_spnew17"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 The identification of cluster areas follows research conducted centrally by the National Asylum Support Service and on information fed through by the local authority led regional consortiums, voluntary groups and other organisations with an interest. When considering if an area is suitable for accommodating asylum seekers a number of factors are taken into account. These include the make up of the local population, the number of asylum seekers already present in the area and the effect on the local area of placing additional asylum seekers there. The weight given to actual numbers will vary between areas. Information on the total population and percentage from ethnic minorities in individual cluster areas is not recorded centrally.

 The National Asylum Support Service (NASS) consulted all regional consortiums to identify suitable cluster areas for the accommodation of asylum seekers before Part VI of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 came into force. As part of this consultation process NASS sought the views of the Yorkshire and Humberside regional consortium, of which Grimsby is part. The consortiums provided a list of towns and cities that were considered suitable to accommodate asylum seekers and the list from the Yorkshire and Humberside regional consortium included Grimsby. Grimsby has been designated as a cluster area since 3 April 2000, when the new support arrangements came into force.
<P>

<a name="10502w13.html_para23">Designation as a cluster area means that an area is deemed suitable to send asylum seekers under the dispersal arrangements operated by the National Asylum Support Service. Further, schools with asylum seeking children dispersed to the area by NASS on their registers were able in the last financial year 2000-01 to apply for additional grant of up to &#163;500 per pupil. This grant could be used to assist the child to settle quickly into school. In addition the grant to the local authority is based on the standard spending assessment which takes account of rises in the local population.

 Information relating to asylum applicants who did not submit their statement of evidence form (SEF) within the 10 working day deadline, or submitted it within the time specified but inadequately completed or in a language other than English, is not currently routinely collected and so could be obtained only through examination of individual case records and is therefore available only at disproportionate cost.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department when he will announce the outcome of consultations on the proposals for reform of the licensing laws set out in the White Paper, "Time for Reform".  [160121]

<P>
<a name="10502w14.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 We are grateful for all the responses to our proposals. We have concluded that they confirm the case for comprehensive modernisation of the alcohol and entertainment licensing laws in England and Wales. They show that the White Paper proposals represent a sound basis for legislation and strike the right overall balance between the needs of business, the enlargement of consumer choice, and the interests of local residents.
<P>

<a name="10502w14.html_para9">Two issues raised by the White Paper attracted most comment: which body should be responsible for the new integrated licensing arrangements and whether licensing hours should be extended.
<P>

<a name="10502w14.html_para10">As to the former, the responses to the White Paper showed a great divergence of opinion. We have considered with care the views of those who argued that the new licensing authorities should be based on magistrates courts. However, there remains a clear need to bring greater democratic accountability to licensing, and we remain persuaded that local authorities are the right bodies for this purpose. It will of course be important for all licensing decisions to be taken, as the White Paper stressed, in accordance with fair and consistent procedures.
<P>

<a name="10502w14.html_para11">The balance of opinion among those who commented specifically on licensing hours in responding to the White Paper clearly supported our proposals for more flexible arrangements. They will make an important contribution to dealing with the problems of alcohol-related crime and disorder, alongside the provisions in the Criminal Justice and Police Bill.
<P>

<a name="10502w14.html_para12">The responses to the White Paper include a number of reservations or suggestions which are helpful, and which we shall want to pursue as we work up the detail of legislative proposals to bring before Parliament in due course. There is, however, one major point on which we have been persuaded by the consultations that a substantive change to the White Paper proposals is required.
<P>

<a name="10502w14.html_para13">The appeal arrangements described in the White Paper gave rise to considerable anxiety for many interested parties. We now intend to provide in legislation that appeals against licensing decisions should go to local magistrates courts on both law and merits, rather than to the Crown court.
<P>

<a name="10502w14.html_para14">We will continue to consult closely with all the interested parties as work on preparing the necessary legislation proceeds.

The functions of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food under part VI of the EPA have been transferred to the National Assembly for Wales. The Assembly has now recognised that it does not have a sufficient basis for the exercise of its powers under section 110 of the EPA 1990 to restrict the planting of GM crops on the sites currently proposed. It now proposes to place existing separation distances between sites of GM and non-GM means of production on a statutory basis.

 The departmental headquarters operates a general telephone helpline facility for members of the public. The Court Service headquarters operates two helplines; a general customer service line and one that deals specifically with disability issues. The Crown court at Blackfriars operates a jury summoning helpline, Central London county court and Birmingham county court operate general helplines, as does the Immigration Appellate Authority in Loughborough. Most of the associated offices operate general inquiry lines that are manned during normal working hours; the judge Advocate General's office (four lines), the Public Guardianship Office (four lines), the Official Solicitor's Office (two lines), the Legal Services Ombudsman (one line) and the Council on Tribunals (one line). The Public Record Office has a contact centre to respond to inquiries from the public that uses an automated system with the option to speak to a member of staff. The 24 district land registries along with the Land Registry headquarters and land charges department operate a mixture of automated and manned helplines to assist the public.

 <i>[holding answer 5 April 2001]:</i> We are aware that the current ban on artificial insemination (AI) by technicians in infected areas will pose problems for some farmers, although we are not in a position to quantify the extent. On 29 April there were around 8,000 dairy holdings (as classified in the June 2000 agricultural census) in the infected areas in England. Not all of these will use AI; some will own a bull. Of those that do use AI, some will use the DIY method (where licensed movement of semen is permitted, subject to certain conditions) and others AI companies. We have already taken some action to alleviate the problems faced by farmers and we are actively considering other ways in which we can provide assistance in this area.

<a name="10502w18.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 This Department has concluded a range of measures since May 1997 to improve farm animal welfare, both at EU level and domestically. We have successfully negotiated a protocol to the treaty of Rome that recognises animals as sentient beings; agreed minimum EU welfare standards for all farm animals; and secured detailed EU rules for the welfare of laying hens. At home, we have introduced an updated code of recommendations on the welfare of sheep; continued our advisory campaigns for farmers on welfare issues; and committed substantial sums to farm animal welfare research and development. Full details of these, and many other, measures may be obtained from the Department's website http://www.maff.gov.uk/.

 Co-operation between agencies is essential to the success of the Government's anti-drugs strategy, particularly at local level. The Lancashire Drug Action Team is working closely with 12 Community Safety Partnerships on a range of initiatives designed to tackle drug misuse in the area. Examples in Burnley include

targeting action to increase child specific services, reducing waiting times for specialist treatment, auditing service provision to ensure new resources are targeted where they are most needed, and encouraging opportunities for residents to voice their views on substance misuse.

<a name="10502w18.html_para6">We have also made available nationwide an additional &#163;220 million to Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships working with Drug Action Teams to build stronger community links and help police and local communities tackle neighbourhood drug problems and the crime associated with them.

 The Government have set demanding targets in all four areas of their 10 year anti-drugs strategy--halving drug use among young people, halving re-offending by drug-misusing offenders, doubling the numbers of people entering treatment and halving the availability of Class A drugs--and have put in place comprehensive research and information projects to measure progress.
<P>

<a name="10502w18.html_para7">In one of the areas--halving drug misuse among young people--a baseline figure has been established using the 1998 British Crime Survey. This showed that the proportion of 16 to 24-year-olds reporting use of Class A drugs in the last years was 8.3 per cent. and in the last month was 3.4 per cent.
<P>

<a name="10502w18.html_para8">Baselines for the other areas will be established within the next 12 months.

 The Cabinet Office is responsible for a range of functions which cover England as a whole, or in relation to non-devolved matters, Great Britain or the United Kingdom. It is therefore not possible to say what their specific impact is on a particular constituency. Additionally any policy changes arising form reports by Cabinet Office units, such as the Social Exclusion Unit and the United Kingdom Anti-Drugs Co-ordination Unit, are implemented by the appropriate Government Department, rather than by the Unit itself.
