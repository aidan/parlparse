 During the passage of the Animal Welfare Bill through Parliament a Circus Working Group was established consisting of representatives of welfare organisations and the circus industry, together with an academic panel from the scientific community. The group was charged with examining the issues relating to the transportation and housing needs of wild animals (i.e. animals not normally domesticated in the British Isles) used for performance in travelling circuses. The conclusions were that there was not enough evidence to show that the welfare of wild animals in circuses is any better or worse than those in other captive environments and that available scientific evidence was insufficient to justify regulations being introduced to ban wild animals being used in circus performance.</p>

Indeed, in the early stages of this disease it is not always possible to observe lesions during abattoir post-mortem examination and, due to the fastidious nature of this organism, it is very difficult to isolate it from tissue samples without visible lesions. Meaningful proportions that subsequently did not confirm disease at culture for TB test reactors cannot be provided, as substantial numbers of skin and gIFN positive animals are not subject to laboratory culture-e.g. once infection has already been identified in other cattle from the same herd.</p>

 Following the military coup in December 2006, Fiji was suspended from the Councils of the Commonwealth. The situation deteriorated further in April 2009, with the abrogation of the constitution, suspension of the courts, censorship of the press and re-establishment of Public Emergency Regulations. In July, Military Commander and interim PM, Voreqe Bainimarama, announced a 'Roadmap for Change', which ruled out holding democratic elections until 2014. As a member of the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group, the UK took a full role in discussions which led to Fiji's full suspension from the Commonwealth on 1 September 2009. The regime can be erratic: the Australian and New Zealand Heads of Mission were suddenly expelled on 3 November 2009. This was the third New Zealand Head of Mission expulsion since the coup.</p>

 The Department for Transport is providing considerable support for projects to increase cycling, through Cycling England. Cycling England was established by the Department to get more people cycling, more safely, more often.

 The Government were a strong supporter of the New Car CO2 regulation adopted in April 2009. The regulation aims to reduce CO2 emissions by setting manufacturers average CO2 targets based on the new cars they produce that are registered in the EU. In particular, the Government played a successful leading role, in calling for an ambitious long-term target in the regulation. This target of 95g/km means that, on average, new cars will emit 40 per cent. less CO2 in 2020 compared to 2007. In the UK alone, this is expected to save 7.6MtC02 per year by 2020.</p>

 The information requested in parliamentary question 296881 asked for the benefit-cost ratios (BCRs) of all schemes in the targeted programme of improvements at programme entry and at present. The BCR data requested are not held centrally.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_231"><a name="91207w0010.htm_para3"><a name="09120749000316">The targeted programme of improvements (TPI) comprised 114 major road schemes of which 71 are now open for traffic. The schemes entered the programme at various times, 37 of them in July 1998. For the older, completed schemes, files have been put away into storage and would have to be retrieved at a cost of £20 per file. Extracting the relevant BCR information from the files and putting that information into context in terms of what assumptions were made when the BCR was calculated is not a straightforward task.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government what assessment he has made of the benefits to residents of sheltered accommodation of the provision of services by wardens who work a 34-hour week; and what assessment he has made of the likely effects on such residents of changes in the working patterns of such wardens.

 There has been no central assessment of the benefits to residents of having warden services within sheltered accommodation. When reviewing services local authorities should take account of residents views on the services being provided and the benefits received. We expect every service user to have a full risk and needs assessment undertaken and an appropriate support plan put in place. It is a local decision as to how to best meet the needs identified.</p>

1. There was a major change in police recorded crime recording in 2002 that means that figures from 2002-03 are not comparable with figures prior to this year. The introduction of the National Crime Recording Standard in 2002 brought In a more victim-focused reporting system, where victim accounts had to be accepted unless there was credible evidence to the contrary.<br>
2. Offence classifications 5A, 5B and 5C were introduced from 1 April 2008 and replace classification 5. Classification 5A was influenced by a clarification in recording rules that had the effect of significantly increasing levels of recording in some forces. Figures for 2008-09 for classification 5A should be viewed as provisional as a current inspection by HM Inspectorate of Constabulary may give rise to further revisions from forces. Classification 5A also includes some other offences of endangering life as well as GBH with intent, though GBH with intent is the major part of this category.<br>
3. Offence classifications 8F, 8G, 8H, 8J and 8K were introduced from 1 April 2008 and had previously been recorded as part of classifications 8A or 8D.<br>

<p><a name="stpa_297"><a name="91207w0016.htm_para3"><a name="09120758000632">The review is looking at evidence gathered from the early stages of tier 4, which was launched in March this year, to look at the case for or against any policy changes. The review will consider all of the available data and evidence, including the potential financial impact of the proposals on the different parts of the education sector such as the English language sector.</p>

 The flexibility of the points-based system allows us to support UK workers and at the same time meet the recruitment needs of businesses and support the economy. Since April this year, the RLMT has been strengthened to include a requirement to advertise skilled jobs in Jobcentre Plus, so that resident workers have a single source-their local job centre-to access all skilled vacancies. This strengthening of the resident labour market test was introduced to better support resident workers looking for skilled jobs. I announced on 24 November that, on the Migration Advisory Committee's recommendation the test would be further strengthened by increasing from two weeks to four weeks the minimum period that jobs must be advertised in order to satisfy the test. No formal assessment of the impact of the changes has yet been undertaken.</p>

 As the Ministry's disciplinary processes are devolved to a local level, there is no central recording of the total number of criminal convictions incurred by staff.

 Members of the public who receive civil legal aid for a money or property dispute, and who succeed in obtaining a financial benefit from their case, are required to repay their legal aid costs, so resources can be recycled to help others. If someone is unable to repay their legal aid costs immediately, these can be postponed as a statutory charge on their property. Where charges are postponed against property, persons are not obliged to make any repayments, or to repay the charge in full until their financial circumstances change, or the property changes hands. The Legal Services Commission will not force anyone to sell their home. However, in order to encourage clients to repay their postponed charge where they can, the charge accrues simple interest, the rate for which is set out in regulations.

 Training for newly recruited prison officers provides officers with an understanding of mental health disorders and how to respond effectively to all prisoners (including women) experiencing mental ill health. Further training is available to prison officers throughout their career depending on their role within their prison. Training makes specific reference to issues affecting women, where appropriate. All training provides prison officers with the knowledge to identify offenders with mental health issues and refer to appropriate health care professionals.</p>

The standards draw from existing best practice and cover all areas of regime provision including reception into custody, day to day living in the prison environment and planning for resettlement, as well as discrete groups of women. The main thrust of the standards is about being sensitive and responsive to gender specific needs and addressing them appropriately, in particular through the positive engagement of staff. It is largely a case of good staff training and support, and the introduction of the Women's Awareness Staff Programme training has therefore been key.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_409"><a name="91207w0026.htm_para0"><a name="09120767001084">The total number of unoccupied places according to the table is approximately 3,000. This represents the difference between the total operational capacity of the estate and the population (at the end of October). In some cases, prisoners will be held in accommodation that does not feature in a prison's operational capacity (for example, are temporarily located in a segregation unit or in the health care centre, units that do not usually feature in operational capacity) or will be on temporary licence. However, these prisoners would ordinarily be accommodated in the general accommodation  <br>

of the prison and therefore it is appropriate to include them in the calculation. Reductions in operational capacity because accommodation is not available for current use (for example, because of sustained damage, as in the case of HMP Ashwell, or substantial refurbishment programmes) have been discounted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_410"><a name="91207w0026.htm_para1"><a name="09120767001085">The level of unoccupied cells does not reflect the level of free, useable capacity in the estate. Places might be temporarily out of use, for example, where a cell has been damaged or is under going short term maintenance. Some places cannot be used because they are in double cells required for single occupancy following a safety risk assessment. More generally, the demographics of the population mean that it is impossible in practice to make use of every operationally viable place. This is reflected in the operating margin: an allowance of 2,000 places that is removed from total operational capacity figures to provide the estate's useable operational capacity. The above table suggests that there is useable headroom of around 1,000 places in the estate, which is the current difference between useable operational capacity and the population.</p>

 Instances of alcohol use in prisons are treated as a miscellaneous incident and recorded centrally on the Prison Service Incident Reporting System. These incident reports are currently in a format that cannot readily be interrogated electronically. To provide the information requested would involve the manual inspection of more than 100,000 incident records which could only be achieved at disproportionate cost. The National Offender Management Service has in place a strategy to reduce both the supply and the demand for alcohol with a comprehensive range of security measures and searching techniques to detect items of contraband, including alcohol, and prevent smuggling into establishments. It is a criminal offence to convey alcohol into prison and prisoners caught in possession of alcohol within prison will face disciplinary action. Alcohol consumption is a cause of criminality in society and many prisons have programmes in place to assist prisoners to lessen their dependence on alcohol.</p>

 Automatic release at the halfway point of sentence was introduced by the Criminal Justice Act 1991. Prisoners who are sentenced to three months therefore normally serve six weeks in prison and prisoners who are sentenced to six months normally serve three months in prison. Adult prisoners sentenced to less than 12 months are not subject to supervision by the probation service on release from custody. However, they are 'at risk' of return to custody by the courts, to serve the unexpired portion of the sentence, if they commit an imprisonable offence before the expiry date of the original sentence. Young offenders (those under the age of 22 released from a term of detention in a YOI) are subject to a minimum of three months supervision. Juvenile prisoners sentenced to a detention and training order are supervised as part of the conditions of these sentences.</p>

 The Government recognise the effects of fuel poverty on health and has a strong package of measures to tackle the three root causes; poor energy efficiency, high fuel prices and low household income. It has not carried out a detailed assessment of the impacts of fuel poverty on health,</p>

Improving the energy efficiency of a home is key to assisting those at risk from the cold and the Government have a number of established and new initiatives such as Warm Front, the Carbon Emissions Reduction Target and the Community Energy Savings Programme to help. We improve the income of vulnerable households through winter fuel and cold weather payments alongside the wider tax and benefit system and look at ways to cut the cost of energy that is supplied to them through a robust system of regulation aiming to protect all consumers. The recently introduced Energy Bill will set a framework for schemes that will require energy suppliers to provide a specified level of social price support (direct assistance with energy bills) to more of the most vulnerable customers.</p>

 The Department is working towards publishing a White Paper on care and support in early 2010. We have been working with the Personal Social Services Research Unit (PSSRU) to provide the modelling and analysis to underpin our policy development. We were provided with an interim report from PSSRU in November but that was based on a view of the system when the Green Paper was published.
