 The welfare of livestock, including cows, is protected by the Welfare of Farmed Animals (England) Regulations 2007 and the Animal Welfare Act 2006. There are codes of recommendations published on the DEFRA website which farmers are required by law to have access to, and be familiar with, which encourage high standards of husbandry. Enforcement action can be taken against farmers who do not comply with this legislation.</p>

All dairy cattle, in whatever system they are kept, are protected by comprehensive animal welfare legislation in England. It is important to recognise that poor welfare can occur in both intensive and extensive systems, and the most significant influence on the welfare of livestock is the stock-keeper, not the system in which it is reared.</p>

First agreements commence on 1 July 2010.

 The downturn in the global economy has had a severe impact in both Anguilla and the Turks and Caicos Islands (TCI). Public finances have also suffered as both territories have relied heavily on tourism and construction for a large part of their revenue base. Between 2008 and 2009 Government revenues fell by 28% in Anguilla and by around 33% in the TCI. This sharp downturn in Government revenues has put pressure on public finances and-as in other jurisdictions-there has been a need to reduce public expenditure. The Governments of the TCI and Anguilla are aware of the need to take action to put their public finances on a sustainable footing. We are working closely with both to address these challenges, including funding revenue studies in both Territories, and an expenditure study in Anguilla.</p>

 The UK is concerned about the security situation in Yemen. The terrorist threat in Yemen is high and we judge that attacks are highly likely, as we make clear in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office travel advice.</p>

We are particularly concerned about decreasing stability across the country and about the resultant increase in local conflict. Al Qaeda look to exploit instability where they can-the root causes of which are often wider social, economic and political problems. Rising insecurity, conflict and extremism in Yemen will pose a threat to UK long-term interests of stability in the region and beyond, including energy security and global trade flows. Increased radicalisation directly threatens economic and security interests in the Gulf and could pose an indirect threat abroad.</p>

 None. The countersigning of passports is not part of the work that general practitioners (GPs) or other national health service staff are required to do as part of their NHS responsibilities. Should a GP (or other NHS staff) countersign an application it is a private matter between the doctor and the applicant. Where a charge is made for this service this is purely a private matter, not covered by any national terms and conditions.</p>

 Full searches (previously known as strip-searches) may be carried out in order to detect items of contraband secreted on the person. NOMS' National Security Framework permits establishments to full search young people (15 to 17-year-olds) and young adults (18 to 21-year-olds) held in young offender institutions (YOIs), both on a routine and intelligence-led basis. Records of foil searches conducted in YOIs are not held centrally. To provide the information requested would involve requesting and collating information from all YOIs which could be done only at disproportionate cost.</p>

<i> [holding answer 7 June 2010]:</i>Policy on the Green Belt is currently set out in Planning Policy Guidance Note 2, Green Belts (PPG2), published in 1995. PPG2 establishes a presumption against inappropriate development on Green Belt. If a proposal for such development is received, the local planning authority has to consider whether any harm to the Green Belt would be outweighed by other considerations, and whether very special circumstances exist to justify planning permission.</p>

 As independent organisations, it is up to the board of each housing association to determine the level of remuneration to award its executives.

 The contribution which local authorities are being asked to make this year to enable the Government to take immediate action to tackle the United Kingdom's unprecedented deficit should not impact on the delivery of essential front line services.

We have retained formula grant funding at the level approved by Parliament for 2010-11 (£29 billion), and have also gone further by lifting restrictions on how local government spends its money, by de-ringfencing more grants.
