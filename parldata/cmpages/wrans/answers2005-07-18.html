 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will make a statement on the UK&#039;s carbon dioxide reduction targets; and what her policy is on <i>(a)</i> disaggregating the targets between devolved regions of the UK and <i>(b)</i> devolving responsibility for meeting those targets to the devolved regions.  [11310]</p>




<p><a name="st_1"><a name="50718w01.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 Estimates that were published in March 2005 show that the UK is on course to meet its Kyoto protocol commitment to reduce emissions of a basket of six greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, by 12.5 per cent. Below base level years by 2008&#150;12. The data released in March also indicates that, even without the further action currently being considered under the review of the UK Climate Change Programme, the UK will be about 20 per cent. below base year levels in 2010. This is a significant achievement.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50718w01.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_0">The UK have set itself an ambitious domestic goal to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 20 per cent. below 1990 levels by 2010. Our most recent projections show that, on the basis of existing policies, emissions of carbon dioxide will fall by about 13 per cent. below the 1990 level by 2010. We therefore recognise that more needs to be done. Our review of the UK Climate Change Programme is examining how existing policies are performing and is considering additional measures that we could implement to put the UK back on track to achieving the domestic goal. The outcome of this review will be announced before the end of the year.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50718w01.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_1">Many of the means by which emissions can be reduced have been devolved to the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish administrations, but the UK Government maintain overall responsibility for the Kyoto target and for ensuring that a programme is put in place for delivering it. The devolution legislation do contain powers that could be used to bind the administrations to the UK&#039;s international target but the 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>18 Jul 2005 : Column 1282W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
Government do not propose to use these powers because it is confident that significant reductions can be, and are being, delivered through working in partnership.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50718w01.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_2">The Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish administrations are also committed to the UK&#039;s domestic carbon dioxide goal. The nature of the 20 per cent. goal is different, in that it is not a legally binding target, and the UK Government and the administrations aim to achieve it through a balanced, partnership approach rather than through a set of quantified, contributions from the different parts of the UK.

<p><a name="st_2"><a name="50718w01.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 The Government have no plans to provide specific help to farmers or milk retailers to ensure adequate supplies of imported non-GM feed for animals.

Notes:<br>

1. Estimates from coal mines are based on current generation and projections for mine closures. Number of mines generating is less than number of mines open.<br>

2. Estimates of energy generation from landfill and sewage gas are derived by linear interpolation, consistent with the most recent projections published by the Department of Trade and Industry for 2005 and 2010.<br>

3. The number of digesters currently used for anaerobic digestion on farms in the UK is thought to be very small.<br>

 The requested figures are set out in the table. The majority of advertising investment by my Department is in support of the THINK! road safety campaign. Among non-departmental bodies for which the Department is responsible, major advertising investment has been by the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency, most recently to explain changes to the car tax rules. These changes have resulted in 700,000 fewer unlicensed vehicles on our roads and have recovered &#163;77 million of tax revenue.

 Text messaging is one of the means by which XHIBIT (exchanging Hearing Information By Internet Technology) can communicate with witnesses. XHIBIT is being rolled out to all Crown courts across England and Wales by the end of March 2006. The new system was introduced at Lincoln Combined Court on 11 April 2005.

<p><a name="st_41"><a name="50718w06.html_spnew3"><b> Bridget Prentice: </b> 
 The Immigration Appeals Tribunal (IAT) developed a system of country guidance cases to facilitate consistent decision making. This enabled the IAT to issue guidance cases on the circumstances and risks to certain groups in particular countries following a detailed assessment of the available country information. The IAT (and now Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (AIT)) nominates leader cases which contain issues consistently seen by Tribunal judiciary. These lead to other cases being identified as containing very similar issues to that of the leader case&#151;known as follower cases&#151;which are heard and determined once the leader case has been promulgated. The number of leader cases currently awaiting determination has caused some delays in listing the follower cases for hearing. There has been some further delay due to the commencement of the AIT on 4 April 2005, created by a merger of the Immigration Appellate Authority (IAA) and the IAT. The leader cases, which number approximately 100, are expected to be listed to be heard substantively in September and October of this year, and once these have been determined the follower cases, approximately 300 in number, will then be listed for hearing as soon as is practicable.

On 4 April 2005 the commencement of section 26 of The Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc.) Act 2004 introduced a unified appeals system under the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (AIT).

<p><a name="qn_44"><a name="50718w07.html_wqn0"><b> Mr. Djanogly: </b> 
 To ask the Minister of State, Department for Constitutional Affairs (1) what the average running costs per day are of <i>(a)</i> the Community Justice Centre in Liverpool and <i>(b)</i> an average magistrates court;  [12704]
</p>



<p><a name="qnpa_16">(2) what steps she is taking to evaluate the cost-benefit of the Community Justice Centre in Liverpool.  [12705]</p>




<p><a name="st_44"><a name="50718w07.html_spnew0"><b> Ms Harman: </b> 
 The information is as follows:
</p>


<p>
<a name="50718w07.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_40">The Community Justice Centre will not be fully operational until September. The court is currently hearing cases in a courtroom of Liverpool magistrates court and the daily running costs are approximately the 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>18 Jul 2005 : Column 1304W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
same as for the other courtrooms. The average cost of a magistrate&#039;s courthouse per day is &#163;4,382 and a courtroom is &#163;111 (figures for 2003&#150;04). The cost of providing the multi agency problem solving team is &#163;666 per day. The cost of this team is not currently borne by a mainstream magistrates court, as the function is performed to some extent elsewhere and is accounted for by the CJS agencies (eg Probation, YOTs).
</p>


<p>
<a name="50718w07.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_41">The evaluation will compare the resources that are being used in the existing CJS agencies dealing with one courtroom with the cost of those based within the centre. The effectiveness of the existing CJS agencies framework against the joint approach of the centre will be measured in their outcomes. An example of this 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>18 Jul 2005 : Column 1305W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
would be a reduction in antisocial behaviour or the number of young people getting involved in crime. The evaluation will also measure qualitative benefits such as the level of victim and witness satisfaction.

 We have been informed by Pickfords Records Management that there are currently 444 requests outstanding for copies of the Marked Register.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50718w07.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_42">Because in a number of cases the documents have not been presented to Pickfords in accordance with instructions, Pickfords have had to conduct searches and checks and contact Returning Officers to find them, which has had an impact on their process times and resources.

<p><a name="st_47"><a name="50718w07.html_spnew3"><b> Ms Harman: </b> 
 Access to the marked electoral registers is the responsibility of the Clerk of the Crown. The marked register which is made available for inspection or copying is the paper copy of the register kept at the polling station, and marked by polling station staff. No electronic copies are compiled, and we have no current plans to provide for it. Paper copies may be purchased, as has been the case in previous elections.

 The research into remote electronic voting is primarily conducted through pilots under S. 10 of the Representation of the People Act 2000. There have been 27 e-voting pilots in 2002 and 2003 and these were all evaluated by The Electoral Commission which reported on each of the pilots and also published a strategic evaluation.

<a name="stpa_45">In addition to piloting, research has been jointly commissioned by the Government and key stakeholders investigating the issues surrounding the implementation of electronic voting in the UK. This research was published in May 2002.

 Detailed information of hours spent by officials on specific areas of work is not kept.

</p>


<p>

 There are 10 Commonwealth war graves in Equatorial Guinea, all in Malabo cemetery, which is situated on the island of Bioko off the coast of Cameroon.

 The armed forces already employs and trains engineering specialists in order to enhance operational effectiveness. These specialists are primarily employed to provide engineering and construction support on deployed operations where the operational conditions would preclude the use of commercial operators. It is possible that these engineers may be employed on construction projects for the armed forces, for instance in the UK, but only when it is sensible and cost-effective to do so and the training experience accrued will directly benefit their role on operations. Otherwise, the skills and expertise of the commercial sector is employed, allowing the armed forces to concentrate on military tasks.

Figures are based on location of armed forces careers office to which applicant applied not residence of applicant. Armed forces careers office regions do not align with Government office regions and differ between services; consequently, it is not possible to make meaningful comparisons across services or to population figures.<br>

All figures have been rounded to the nearest 10. Due to the rounding methods used, figures may not always equal the sum of the parts. When rounding to the nearest 10, numbers ending in five have been rounded to the nearest multiple of 20 to prevent systematic bias.<br>

 We have been working with the Home Office to identify areas where the identity cards scheme could provide business benefits. Our assessment has indicated that the proposal for the introduction of identity cards would benefit the Ministry of Defence by aiding the identification of individuals who have a relationship with the Department, but are not direct employees. Examples include potential new recruits, past employees, members of the reserve forces, job applicants, visitors and contractors. On 28 June 2005, my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary placed in the Library of the House a paper containing the latest estimates of benefits of the identity cards scheme which shows that the benefits outweigh the costs once the scheme is fully operational. The cost of equipping premises will depend on the nature of the use of the identity cards scheme and the type of identity check(s) necessary to deliver the business benefits. The Ministry of Defence is in dialogue with the Home Office and we will judge the impact on our IT systems as details of the scheme emerge. As the design of the scheme matures, during and after the procurement exercise, so will our understanding of where the scheme will be of most benefit which will allow us to further refine our estimates of costs and benefits.

<i>[holding answer 14 July 2005]:</i> On the 11 February 2003, RAF Tornado GR4s dropped a total of five munitions during the course of the attack. The attack was conducted in self-defence in accordance with the appropriate rules of engagement for Operation Resinate (south), the operation to enforce the southern no-fly zone. The surface-to-surface missile system concerned had recently relocated to a position close to the Kuwaiti border, from which it posed a direct threat to the operating base for UK aircraft and other forces allocated to Operation Resinate (south).

<p>
<a name="50718w11.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_69">The answer I gave stated that officers received a tax-free allowance to enable them to maintain their uniform and dress. It has now come to my attention that officers in fact receive an annual tax-credit, known as &quot;income tax relief for maintenance of uniform&quot;, rather than an allowance as such. This means that a certain proportion of their salary is not subject to income tax. For dismounted male officers below the rank of colonel, and therefore all personnel belonging to those regiments identified in your original question, this annual rate amounts to &#163;589.29 of earnings against which income tax is not paid.

 The part of the Patents Act 2004 relating to post-grant amendment is one of several provisions which will bring UK patents legislation into line with the revised European Patent Convention (&quot;EPC&quot;). All such provisions will be brought into force at the same time as the revised EPC itself comes into force, which is desirable in order to maintain consistency between the UK and European patents systems. It is uncertain exactly when this will be, because the revised EPC takes effect 2 years after the 15th state has ratified or acceded, or (if earlier) three months after the final state has ratified or acceded. At present I understand that 14 states have done so, and therefore that the revised EPC, and the corresponding provisions in the 2004 Act, are very unlikely to take effect until mid-2007 at the earliest.

<p><a name="st_185"><a name="50718w20.html_spnew9"><b> Alan Johnson: </b> 
 The two roof programme is a ground breaking change programme to rationalise our central London estate and transform the way we use our workspace. This core element of the DTI&#039;s Efficiency Programme offers a new and radical approach to workspace utilisation and will allow the Department to reduce its accommodation by approximately 30 per cent. Starting in 1 Victoria Street, the accommodation is being remodelled as part of a wider change programme to support team based desking in a flexible, open plan working environment on the basis of providing on average eight desks for every 10 people to be accommodated. This has enabled us to increase the capacity of our main HQ building from 1,680 under the original, traditional approach to approximately 2,400 now and to release other buildings on the estate for reuse or disposal. This highly successful change programme will now be applied to the rest of our London accommodation.

 Specific data on infant mortality (first year of life) are unreliable given the lack of effective vital statistics systems.

 The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) is the largest UN provider of reproductive health assistance to developing countries and countries in transition.

It is important that this work should continue and that all people be given access to modern services, and the chance to choose their family size.

These findings were produced by independent research carried out by the University of Southampton and the China Population Information and Research Centre and paid for by DFID China.

However, like all of us who have been elected to public office, councillors do have to promote and maintain high standards of conduct, ethics and propriety. Any advice that councillors receive on this issue would come from their own internal advisers and standards committees. The advice will generally be identical to that which applies to all committees carrying out local authority functions. Ultimately, the decision as to whether any councillor should disqualify himself or herself from participation in any individual case would be a matter for him or her.

 There are two ways in which asbestos is legally managed. One is by disposal to a landfill site with a dedicated cell which receives only asbestos waste. The other is by contained storage in waste transfer stations where asbestos is kept until it can be transported to Great Britain for disposal in landfill in an economically viable manner.

 We recently published PricewaterhouseCoopers&#039; Second Annual Report from the Evaluation of the Academies Programme, which demonstrated that academies are overwhelmingly popular with parents and pupils, and that they have made a significant difference to the teaching and learning culture from their predecessors. Cost effectiveness is one of the indicators we expect that PwC will analyse as the five year study progresses, but it is important to note that academies are funded at the same level as other schools. Their recurrent funding is calculated on the same basis as other local schools and their capital costs are calculated using the same benchmarks as for other new schools.

 Sponsors provide 10 per cent., up to a cap of &#163;2 million, towards the capital costs for each academy, with the Government providing the balance and funding all recurrent costs. For the 17 academies currently open, and the 10 opening this September, the current expected total of private sponsors&#039; contributions amounts to an additional investment in state education of &#163;44 million. That figure rises to &#163;69 million when including sponsors&#039; contributions for the eight other academy projects opening in 2006 and 2007 which already have funding agreements in place.

 Over the last 12 months, Ministers and officials have met regularly with representatives from higher education institutions with high proportions of part-time undergraduate students to discuss a range of issues, including the changes to the student funding system which will be introduced in 2006&#150;07. Ministers have listened to concerns raised by institutions and are considering the most effective means of using available funding to support part-time undergraduate provision. This includes an ongoing consideration of the merits of fee deferral in light of a deepening understanding of the diverse part-time student body.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50718w35.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_24">To understand better the part-time undergraduate student body, the Department for Education and Skills commissioned Alan Woodley from the Open University&#039;s Institute of Educational Technology to survey part-time students. The report &quot;Earning, learning and paying: the results from a national survey of the costs and financing of part-time students in higher education&quot; was published in November 2004. Additionally, part-time undergraduates are included within the scope of the 2004/05 &quot;Student Income and Expenditure Survey&quot; (SIES). The SIES is due for publication early in 2006.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50718w35.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_25">The Woodley survey confirmed the heterogeneity of the part-time undergraduate student body and that the barriers which individuals may face to participation are, by no means, uniform. Notably, 65 per cent. of part-time undergraduates are in full-time employment with a further 18 per cent. in part-time employment. Moreover, 36 per cent. of part-time undergraduate students have all their fees paid by an employer. Consequently, any consideration of the merits of fee deferral for part-timers must address the financial resources available to individual students and the likelihood of replacing existing employer support.

<a name="50718w35.html_para7">
The Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) has considered representations from institutions for special funding in response to concerns about the impact of variable fees on large scale providers of part-time undergraduate higher education. The Council announced its findings on 1 March. These included a commitment to develop a widening participation measure, from the 2006/07 academic year, designed to ensure that the most disadvantaged students will continue to be able to study on a part-time basis. Details of the measure will be confirmed by the HEFCE board in the autumn. No representations have been received from the Office for Fair Access with regard to part-time undergraduate provision.

 Arranging provision for children with special educational needs (SEN) is a matter for schools and local education authorities (LEAS), within the framework set out in the Education Act 1996 and taking account of statutory guidance, such as the SEN Code of Practice. That framework and guidance sets out a graduated approach to meeting children&#039;s SEN, including, where necessary, a process for the assessment of children&#039;s SEN and the drawing up of SEN statements. Admission to special schools, including those for children with moderate learning difficulties, is through the school being &#039;named&#039; on the statement, other than in exceptional circumstances, such as where a child is admitted for the purposes of an assessment.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50718w37.html_para10">
When a statement is being drawn up or the description of a child&#039;s educational needs on a statement and the provision to meet those needs is being amended, parents can ask for the school of their choice, mainstream or special, to be named. The LEA must consider the parents&#039; preference carefully and whether the school is suitable for the child&#039;s needs and whether placing the child there is compatible with the education of other children at the school and the efficient use of resources. If the LEA does not name the parents&#039; preferred school, the parents can appeal to the SEN and Disability Tribunal, whose decisions are binding on LEAs.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50718w37.html_para11">
<a name="stpa_35">The provision made for children with moderate and severe learning difficulties, and the funding for it in the case of those with statements, should be decided upon individually. However, it is open to LEAs to have general SEN funding arrangements, as long as they are prepared to vary those arrangements in individual cases. In May 2004 the Department published guidance on &quot;The management of SEN expenditure&quot; which recommended that changes to funding arrangements should be consulted on widely. However, precise arrangements in each local authority area are matters for the relevant LEA.

 Secondary legislation providing for registered social landlords (RSLs) to provide sites for Gypsies and Travellers will come into force in time for the next bidding round for 2006&#150;07. This facility has already been publicised in a variety of ways, including in Parliament and in the Government&#039;s response to the ODPM Select Committee Inquiry. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister will be explaining the new arrangements in more detail to RSLs, in general terms via guidance from the Housing Corporation and through specific bidding guidance on the next bidding round. This guidance will include an explanation of arrangements for monitoring the progress of schemes. Clearly it is too early to assess the effectiveness of this policy, but we will be keeping the progress of this initiative under close review as part of a wider package of measures we are taking to promote increased site provision generally.

 Local authorities and the police have strong powers under the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 to evict unauthorised encampments of Gypsies and Travellers from land. The Department has also introduced new police powers in the Anti-Social Behaviour Act 2003 which will enable the police to remove Gypsies and Travellers from unauthorised encampments with greater speed.

Notes:<br>

1. Expenditure has been taken from audited health authority summarisation forms and primary care trust summarisation schedules, which are prepared on a resource basis and therefore differ from cash allocations in the year. The figures have not been adjusted for inflation.<br>

2. Figures for 1997&#150;98 to 2001&#150;02 have been prepared using gross expenditure figures. Figures for 2002&#150;03 and 2003&#150;04 have been adjusted to eliminate expenditure, which would be double counted where an authority acts as a lead in commissioning healthcare or other services. In 2001&#150;02, there was a high degree of inter authority transactions, which have increased the apparent expenditure per head.<br>

3. In many HAs there are factors, which distort the expenditure. These include:<br>

the HA acting in a lead capacity to commission healthcare or fund training on behalf of other health bodies; and<br>

asset revaluations in national health service trusts being funded through HAs or PCTs.<br>

4. The majority of general dental services expenditure is separately accounted for by the Dental Practice Board. An element of pharmaceutical services expenditure is accounted for by the Prescription Pricing Authority. Total expenditure on these items by the Dental Practice Board and the Prescription Pricing Authority cannot be allocated to individual health bodies, therefore the total expenditure in the answer by health authority does not capture all NHS expenditure within the area.<br>

<a name="stpa_154">In terms of violent crime, much of the rise in violence against the person which is shown in the tables can be accounted for by changes to the way the police define and record certain offences. Police recorded crime data are subject to changes in police recording practices, including those relating to national Counting Rules and recording standards. The Counting Rules changes in 1998 had a very significant impact on violent crime, across England and Wales the numbers of such crimes recorded by the police increased by 83 per cent. in the first year of using the new rules. The National Crime Recording Standard, introduced in April 2002, again resulted in increased recording of violent crimes, particularly for less serious violent offences. In addition, increased police activity can have an impact on how many offences are recorded, because, in such circumstances, police officers may encounter and record incidents that may not previously have been reported or recorded.

UKPS data sampling have identified the first time adult channel as accounting for 74 percent. of all fraudulent applications, although this group accounts for less than 10 percent. of all applications processed annually by the Agency. ABI closes the loophole that currently exists in the postal application system by bringing together the physical applicant, and current biographical information, to ensure they are one and the same. A fraudster will now be faced with having to act out their false identity, and risk a real possibility of detection. There have been a number of instances in the past where the requirement to attend for interview would have enabled UKPS to identify a fraudulent application and prevent the issue of a passport in a false identity.

<sup>(82)</sup> Because the Welsh Assembly does not operate a grant damping mechanism, the Home Secretary has for several years provided additional funding to ensure Welsh police authorities receive at least a minimum increase in grant in line with English authorities. These additional grants amounted to &#163;5. 1 million.<br>

 Government funding for police authorities is chiefly allocated using a funding formula that distributes resources on the basis of relative need and resources. A damping mechanism subsequently applied to protect all authorities against financial instability ensures all authorities receive an increase in grant at least equal to the &quot;floor&quot; level on a like-for-like basis year-on-year.

 1,294 remand prisoners are recorded as having self-harmed in 2003 and 1,367 in 2004. Remand prisoners are over-represented in self-harm statistics. The heightened risk is associated with the fact that the majority of remand prisoners are in the early phases of imprisonment. Remand prisoners, as compared to sentenced prisoners, have also been shown to have higher rates of a number of risk factors that we know increase the likelihood of self-harm, such as mental disorder, substance dependence, previous self-harm and previous abuse (Singleton et al, 1998).

<a name="stpa_222">The written ministerial statement on 23 June announced that, following a review of the scheme and in the light of additional labour available from the new EU countries, the current sectors based scheme for the hospitality sector would be ended. The findings of that review have been placed on work permits (UK)&#039;s website. If additional needs are identified in future, small tightly managed quota-based schemes will be established for specific shortage areas for fixed periods.
