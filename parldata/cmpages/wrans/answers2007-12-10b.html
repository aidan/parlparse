 One of the key objectives of the modernisation of the West Coast Main Line is to provide capacity for growth in passenger and freight over the next 30 years with substantially faster and more competitive journey times. Therefore, from the December 2008 timetable change, much greater use will be made of the fast lines with up to 11 trains every hour. This means that only two of these can call at Watford Junction.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_128"><a name="71210w0003.htm_para1"><a name="07121025000418">The more fast line trains that call at Watford Junction, the lower the frequency that can operate to and from Euston. This would then reduce the benefits to passengers overall of the scheme, because the West Coast Main Line service as a whole would not be able to accommodate the projected demand. As a result of the new timetable, two of the 11 hourly services will call at Watford Junction. Watford Junction passengers are also able to interchange with a range of services at Milton Keynes.</p>

 The UK is vulnerable to the introduction of exotic animal disease as global trade in animals and animal products increases. Despite sophisticated systems of import control, we cannot hope to reduce the risk of introduction of disease to zero. Climate change and the threat of bio-terrorism also present new means by which animal disease could be introduced to this country. We must therefore ensure we can prepare for, and react quickly to, all disease outbreaks.</p>

This was highlighted by the pressure put on existing facilities during the 2001 foot and mouth disease outbreak in the UK.

 The gamebird shooting industry involves the shooting of the native grey partridge and red grouse in addition to non-native gamebirds such as red-legged partridge and pheasant. These populations are managed for shooting and there is no evidence to suggest that shooting has resulted in population declines. In order to enhance gamebird populations, a range of native birds and mammals are killed legally as part of pest control campaigns. These species are generalist predators, including foxes, stoats, weasels, carrion crows and magpies. There is no evidence to suggest that this has an adverse affect on populations of these species, although little information is available on which to assess the impacts of killing stoats and weasels. The illegal persecution of native birds of prey, especially for the threatened hen harrier in England, has been associated with game rearing interests and remains a serious problem.</p>

As a part of this work, we plan to commission research to assess the environmental impacts of peatland management.</p>

 An assessment carried out by the inspection team, on 20 November, concluded that live virus had not been released to the environment.

<i>  [holding answer 4 December 2007]:</i> The Joint Rapid Reaction Force (JRRF) is made up of 3 Commando Brigade Royal Marines, 16 Air Assault Brigade and the High Readiness Mechanised or Armoured Brigade. None of these units is currently deployed in a JRRF capacity. The elements of the JRRF that are currently held at high readiness, therefore, are the Lead Commando Group (LCG) and the Lead Airborne Task Force (ABTF). The LCG is made up of elements of 3 Commando Brigade, while the ABTF is currently provided by the 2nd Battalion, The Parachute Regiment (2 PARA). The remaining element of the high readiness reserve is provided by the Spearhead Land Element. The ABTF is due to be replaced by a Small Scale Focused Intervention Battlegroup, based on a Light Infantry Role Battlegroup, between February 2008 and January 2009; its readiness may vary over time depending on the unit rostered.</p>

 Figures for those participating in apprenticeships funded by the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) can be derived from the individualised learner record (ILR). The programme-led apprenticeship (PLA) is an initiative to enable more learners to enter an employed status apprenticeship programme. When they achieve their agreed goals, learners cease to be on a PLA and then become mainstream apprentices. It is possible to calculate participation for programme-led apprenticeships from the ILR data, but not their progression onto mainstream apprenticeships and therefore the associated framework achievement.</p>

teaching is organised on a departmental basis. However, we have consistently made clear that if a physics or chemistry department closes at one institution, the Higher Education Funding Council for England should seek to maintain capacity elsewhere and we announced last year that the Council should report to us on how provision can be maintained in this way. Some science subjects are starting to become more popular and the measures we are taking to increase demand and the extra &#163;75 million announced last year should help to sustain capacity as demand increases. Physics and chemistry are also taught as major subjects at some 50 and 70 UK institutions respectively. The latest figures published by the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS) show that the number of students who have been accepted for entry to full-time undergraduate courses in chemistry in autumn 2007 is up by nearly 13 per cent. compared to 2005, while the figures for physics have increased by 10 per cent. over the same period.</p>

 There were an estimated 4,188,033 persons with a DNA profile retained on the national DNA database (NDNAD) on 31 October 2007. Of these, approximately 4,165,300 had provided a DNA sample following arrest and 22,700 had provided a sample voluntarily. These figures are for the whole NDNAD and cover persons sampled by police forces in England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland and by other UK forces such as the Channel Islands.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_286"><a name="71210w0018.htm_para5"><a name="07121048001381">Approximately 3,916,500 persons with a DNA profile retained on the NDNAD had provided a sample following arrest by police forces in England and Wales; and 21,600 persons provided a sample voluntarily for forces in England and Wales. The number of persons on the database is approximately 13.7 per cent. fewer than the number of subject sample profiles. It is currently estimated that 13.7 per cent. of DNA profiles held on the NDNAD are replicates, i.e. that a profile for a person has been loaded on more than one occasion (one reason for this is that the person gave different names, or different versions of their name, on separate arrests). The presence of these replicate profiles on the NDNAD does not impact on the effectiveness and integrity of the database. Nonetheless, a long-term exercise is under way to identify issues associated with the removal of all such redundant replicate profiles.</p>

 64.8 per cent. of police officer time in Essex was spent on front-line policing in 2006-07. The existing definition of time spent on patrol excludes other front line activity. Time spent on patrol refers only to time when an officer is patrolling but engaged in no other duty. Any activity (such as advice to a member of the public or responding to antisocial behaviour) carried out while on patrol is recorded separately. This figure therefore provides a more rounded picture of front line activity by police officers.</p>

 The time spent by police officers on paperwork and other administrative duties remains an inevitable, but often necessary part of the process of protecting the public. We are, however, taking measures to reduce the time spent on these activities in order to increase the time police officers are able to spend on front line duties. These measures include: improving custody management working practices and processes; streamlining and providing greater local flexibility over performance management requirements; and providing a new &#163;50 million capital fund to support wider access to time and paperwork saving innovative electronic fingerprinting and mobile data technologies.</p>

 It will be for individual local authorities, in developing proposals for business rate supplements, to consider the potential impact on local business and on business improvement districts (BIDs).

 Eighteen local authorities are members of the network of empowerment champions. Their purpose is to promote effective empowerment practices so that they are more widely adopted. The function of the network is to achieve this by identifying effective practices, publicising them, and increasing their adoption through a peer learning programme.

Information reported each quarter by local authorities about their activities under homelessness legislation includes the number of households accepted by local authorities as eligible for assistance, unintentionally homeless and in priority need, and therefore owed a main homelessness duty. The duty owed to an accepted household is to secure suitable accommodation. If a settled home is not immediately available, the authority may secure temporary accommodation until a settled home becomes available. This data is published in our quarterly statistical release on Statutory Homelessness, available on our website and placed in the Library each quarter.

 Detailed housing targets are not directly set by government, but are set out in regional and local plans which are developed through regional and local planning processes. The Government set the overall strategy for housing supply in England. The 2003 Sustainable Communities Plan set out a target to increase housing supply from 900,000 to 1.1 million in the RPG9 area (the wider South East) over the course of the plan, and the Government's 2005 response to the Barker review of Housing Supply announced an ambition to increase housing supply in England from 150,000 to 200,000 per annum by 2016.</p>

 I am committed to maintaining the excellent language skills of Diplomatic Service staff and to modernising the ways in which those skills are acquired. Following a review of the provision of language training, Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) Services concluded in 2006 that its language teaching services cost between 15 and 40 per cent. more than comparable providers and that it should no longer provide language teaching services to the FCO.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_412"><a name="71210w0036.htm_para6"><a name="07121116000093">At the same time, the FCO conducted a policy review of language training which recommended a number of reforms, including more group and in-country teaching. These changes would further increase the cost of in-house teaching. The FCO therefore concluded that it would be a better use of public money to outsource the language teaching requirement. A key element in the new arrangements was a strict quality control and monitoring component to ensure that the quality of teaching was maintained.  <br>

 The emergency response has been rapid, especially that of the Government of Bangladesh, which has taken a strong co-ordination lead. Relief efforts have reached nearly all affected areas, but there is room for better co-ordination in reaching the ultra poor and most needy. The water availability crisis has passed, due to the high attention given to this by the government, supported by others, including the military and some donors. However, a large number of people remain in makeshift camps that are still in urgent need of water, sanitation and hygiene support. The UK is looking to support meeting these short to medium-term needs by allocating &#163;2.5 million, from our &#163;7 million pledge for cyclone relief, to CARE, OXFAM GB, and Save the Children UK.

 The humanitarian situation in Darfur remains critical. Malnutrition rates have risen sharply since the heavy rains in the autumn, particularly in the camps. Ongoing violence has led to a further 260,000 people being displaced this year alone, adding to the more than two million people already living in camps across the region. The camps are overstretched and becoming increasingly volatile. The increase in needs has been compounded by an escalation of attacks by armed groups against humanitarian agencies. This is having a serious impact on the ability of humanitarian agencies to deliver vital aid to those in need.</p>

The UK is playing a leading role in improving the effectiveness of the humanitarian response such as the &#163;40 million 2007 contribution to the Common Humanitarian Fund. The UK is also a strong supporter of international efforts to build on local-level peace-building and the AU/UN-led Darfur peace talks which commenced on 27 October in Libya.

<p><a name="stpa_448"><a name="71210w0039.htm_para0"><a name="07121144000250">The House of Lords reached a unanimous decision that pleural plaques do not constitute actionable or compensatable damage. The decision is based on fundamental principles of the law of negligence&#151;firstly, that compensation can only be payable where there is actual damage, and secondly that compensation is not payable simply for the risk or the worry that something might happen in the future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_449"><a name="71210w0039.htm_para1"><a name="07121144000251">Overturning these fundamental principles in the case of pleural plaques would create uncertainty in the law and could raise the possibility of claims being made much more widely for the risk of an illness occurring or for worry that something might happen.. This would considerably increase the level of litigation and the possibility of weak or spurious claims, and could have damaging effects on business and the economy.</p>

1. Estimates are presented in net terms meaning that estimated savings from reduced income related benefit payments (pension credit, housing benefit and council tax benefit) have been deducted. The proportions of additional expenditure saved through reduced income related benefit payments in 2008-09 have been estimated using the Department&#146;s Policy Simulation Model. This proportion is assumed to remain constant in future years.<br>
2. Column 2 is based on paying UK pensioners the current full value of the basic state pension of &#163;87.30 per week uprated by the relevant Average Earnings Index of 3.5 per cent. and rounded to the nearest five pence, which gives a figure of &#163;90.35 in 2008-09.<br>
3. Column 3 is based on the value of the current level of the pension credit standard minimum guarantee of &#163;119.05 per week for a single person, uprated by the relevant Average Earnings Index of 3.5 per cent. and rounded to the nearest five pence, which gives a figure of &#163;123.20 in 2008-09.<br>
4. Column 4: Sixty per cent. of median population income for a single person with no children after deducting housing costs was &#163;108 per week in 2005-06 (Households Below Average Income: An analysis of the income distribution 1994/95&#151;2005/06 (Revised), DWP). This figure has been uprated by average earnings to &#163;121.60 per week in 2008-09.<br>
5. In the financial years up to and including 2013-14 Treasury economic assumptions have been used to model earnings uprating. After this point a long term earnings growth assumption of 4.93 per cent. has been applied.<br>
6. No changes have been made to the current or projected level of the savings credit threshold.<br>
7. &#145;All pensioners&#146; is defined as all individuals over state pension age living in the United Kingdom. The estimates do not include pensioners claiming a UK pension, but living overseas. Including this group would increase the estimated costs.<br>
8. The estimates are consistent with mid-2004 GAD population projections. We are currently in the process of revising our expenditure projections in line with the mid-2006 ONS population projections.<br>
9. Estimates are in 2007-08 prices and have been rounded to the nearest &#163; billion.<br>

The first national risk assessment, which includes energy issues, will be carried out within three years of enactment of the Bill, with subsequent assessments being published at least every five years. In addition, the Bill will also require the Government to publish and regularly update an adaptation programme. This will set out the Government&#146;s objectives in relation to adaptation to climate change and their proposals and policies for meeting those objectives. As part of preparations for developing this programme, the Government will be publishing an adaptation policy framework in spring 2008 .</p>

<i> [holding answer 6 December 2007]:</i><i> </i>Statement of Insolvency Practice 9 provides regulatory guidance which insolvency practitioners must follow when seeking approval for their fees. Matters to be considered by the approving body (usually the creditors) include the effectiveness with which the insolvency practitioner has carried out his duties and the value and nature of the assets with which he has had to deal.

The percentage scale provided in Schedule 6 is taken from the scale that at one time was applicable to official receivers. However, provisions in the Enterprise Act 2002 introduced a new financial regime for official receivers, whereby creditors pay for the costs of the official receiver&#146;s administration of cases. Such costs are now provided for in a Fees Order and do not relate to the remuneration limits set out in Schedule 6.</p>

 The Department is currently considering responses to the consultation on nuclear power. If the Government were to confirm their preliminary view that it would be in the public interest to allow private sector energy companies the option of investing in new nuclear power stations, we have proposed to undertake a strategic siting assessment (SSA), in combination with a strategic environmental assessment, to develop robust, objective and transparent criteria for assessing the suitability of sites for new nuclear power stations.</p>

 The Government set out their preliminary view on the future of nuclear power in the consultation document, published on 23 May. In the consultation document the Government recognise that although nuclear power stations pose some unavoidable terrorism risks, the Office for Civil Nuclear Security (OCNS), the security regulator, is satisfied that the existing security regime is robust and effective and that allowing new nuclear power stations to be built would be unlikely to materially increase the risks to the UK, because any proposals for new nuclear power stations would only be permitted to proceed if they met the stringent regulatory requirements in full, based on the most up to date threat assessments. For any new nuclear power stations, the OCNS would be involved in the generic design assessment stage with a view to security being built into the design, rather than retrofitted.</p>

 Agencies addressing children's needs are encouraged to work closely with parents and carers. For example, schools and local authorities are statutorily required to have regard to the special educational needs (SEN) code of practice; among other things, the code stresses the importance of all professionals (in schools, local authorities and other agencies) actively seeking to work with parents, valuing the contribution they make. The code also reminds local authorities that section 332A of the Education Act 1996 requires them to arrange for the parent of any child in their area with special educational needs to be provided with advice and information about matters relating to those needs.</p>

Given that this disorder often entails difficult or challenging behaviour, supporting the child to address his or her behaviour is in itself helpful to his or her parents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_561"><a name="71210w0048.htm_para6"><a name="07121183000399">If there are concerns that a child may have additional needs which require a range of services, or it is unclear what his or her needs are, agencies are increasingly using the common assessment framework (CAP) to identify appropriate ways forward.

 Schools do not have to apply to the Department for Children, School and Families to become a trust or foundation school. A change of school category to foundation and the acquisition of a trust are &#147;prescribed alterations&#148;. To make such a prescribed alteration the governing body must publish proposals in accordance with provisions in the Education and Inspections Act 2006, regulations made under that Act and having regard to guidance issued by the Secretary of State under that Act. The proposals are then decided by the governing body (or the Schools Adjudicator where proposals to acquire a trust have been referred by the local authority).

6. The table above only covers those who hold a first degree in the subject of their ITT training course, it does not cover those who have a first degree in mathematics or science but are entering an ITT course which is not mathematics or science.<br>
7. There are additional postgraduate trainees on mathematics and science ITT courses where the first degree is unknown, so there are potentially more mathematics and science graduates entering teaching posts.<br>
8. Figures include trainees who enter maintained schools, non-maintained schools and schools where the sector is unknown.<br>
9. Trainees known not to be employed in teaching posts six months after gaining QTS include those who are seeking a teaching post and those who are not seeking a teaching post and those with an unknown destination.<br>
10. The above figures only cover those who are known to enter a teaching post six months after gaining QTS; therefore those who enter teaching after this will not be covered. This will also not include graduates who enter teaching who are not Newly Qualified Teachers.<br>

 The importance of phonics in the teaching of reading has always played a key part in our guidance to primary schools. Following the publication of Sir Jim Rose's &#147;Independent review of the teaching of early reading&#148;, we accepted all of the review&#146;s recommendations, and we have paid particular attention to the recommendation that phonics should be taught as the prime approach to learning to read. We have renewed the Primary National Strategy&#146;s framework for teaching literacy to reflect this. The renewed framework now says that systematic phonics is  <br>

the best route to teach children to read. With help from Jim Rose, we have developed a high quality systematic phonics teaching programme, Letters and Sounds, to support teachers in implementing these changes. To help schools that wish to choose a commercial scheme instead, we have published guidance on a set of criteria which define the key features of an effective phonics teaching programme and which build directly on the review&#146;s recommendations for high quality phonic work. Publishers of such schemes are able to provide a self-evaluation against these criteria on our phonics website.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_580"><a name="71210w0055.htm_para0"><a name="07121183002712">We have taken steps to ensure that local authorities have the capacity and expertise to support schools in developing effective phonics teaching. The Primary National Strategy&#146;s Communication, Language and Literacy Development programme has provided training in early reading for every local authority and funded additional consultants to lead this work in 50 targeted local authorities. This programme will build greater quality and capacity in the teaching of early literacy through developing work on speaking and listening and strengthening leadership and management of early literacy in schools.</p>

 The young person can avoid the enforcement process, as it is designed as a deterrent. They can do this by complying with their duty to participate; having a reasonable justification as to why they were not participating; or by showing that they are taking the right steps towards participation. In these cases the young person would not get a fixed penalty notice. If the young person does not pay the fixed penalty notice the local authority will have the power to prosecute them in the Youth court. If a fine is unpaid, it is enforceable using the Youth court&#146;s usual powers, such as taking the money from wages or imposing an unpaid work requirement.</p>

 The Department does not approve school projects.

in 2005 on the ratings expected and may also have suffered from a lack of experience of sustainable design. As designers get more experience of designing sustainable schools we expect to see a higher proportion of schools achieving the expected standard. There will always however be schools where site constraints mean that some of the BREEAM credits are unavailable making it very difficult and probably uneconomic to achieve a very high rating in these cases. It should be remembered that BREEAM credits are only given where designs exceed regulatory minimum standards as laid out in the building regulations and the like.</p>

 Herefordshire local authority will receive a basic increase per pupil in their allocation of dedicated schools grant (DSG) of 3.1 per cent. for 2008-09, and 2.9 per cent. for 2009-10 and 2010-11, together with funding for the following ministerial priorities: personalised learning and SEN; and bringing the authority up to the level of the funding formula in 2005-06. This results in increases of 4.7 per cent. 3.9 per cent. and 4.5 per cent. per pupil, and an above average increase of 13.6 per cent. for the three year period as a whole. Further details of the calculation of Herefordshire's DSG allocations can be found at:</p>

This was closely related to the schools formula spending share (FSS) calculation, which took account of the needs of rural authorities through an addition for pupils in primary schools: this recognised the additional costs faced by rural authorities in keeping open more small primary schools than other authorities.</p>

<i> [holding answer 26 November 2007]:</i><i> </i>Standards of teaching and learning in primary and secondary schools have risen substantially since 1997. This is as a result of a number of factors, including challenge and support through the Primary and Secondary National Strategies. They provide; continuing professional development to primary and secondary schools to support them in raising standards in teaching; support better use of pupil performance data and challenge schools and local authorities to set ambitious targets for their pupils. In 2007-08 funding of &#163;45 million was provided for the West Midlands in 2007-08 to support improvement programmes in teaching and learning with specific focus on core subjects through the National Strategies.</p>

 Under the policy to raise the participation age 16 and 17-year-olds will still be able to work, as long as they are in some form of education or training alongside this. There will be no effect on those currently in full-time employment, and there will never be a situation in which full time employees suddenly have to change to part time working&#151;the first 16-year-olds to be affected are aged 10 now. Young people will know before entering employment at 16 that they have to be in learning part time. And they will not all necessarily work part time. Some will work full time and be provided will accredited training by their employer, and we will encourage employers to do this. Some may rearrange their working hours to attend part time training, rather than working fewer hours. The impact assessment for the Education and Bill was published alongside the Bill on 29 November and copies have been placed in the Library of the House. The impact assessment sets out that the estimated foregone productivity cost to the economy of some young people being released for education or training for one day a week who might otherwise have worked full-time is estimated to be around &#163;4.3 million per cohort.</p>

 To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer pursuant to the answer of 26 November 2007, <i> Official Report,</i> column 47W, on capital gains tax, if he will estimate the revenue implications of taxing capital gains at the same marginal rates as income tax, with indexation from April 2008.

<i> [holding answer 5 December 2007]:</i> The revenue yield from taxing all capital gains at the income tax rates announced for 2008-09 with indexation allowance but without applying taper relief would be of the order of &#163;3 billion a year by comparison with the current (2007-08) regime. This is a broad estimate that assumes continuation of the tax-free annual exempt amount and takes into account the likely taxpayer response to the change.</p>

 To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what estimate he has made of the capital gains tax (CGT) revenues received by the Exchequer from sales of residential properties in each of the last five years; and what estimate he has made of the net effect on this CGT revenue stream of the proposed reforms to CGT announced in the October 2007 pre-Budget report.

A key inspection is a thorough, detailed inspection, under which CSCI will assess all of the key national minimum standards. For example, a &#147;poor&#148; quality service will receive a minimum of two key inspections a year, an &#147;adequate&#148; service will receive a minimum of one key inspection a year, a &#147;good&#148; service will receive a minimum of one key inspection every two years, and an &#147;excellent&#148; service will receive a key inspection a minimum of once every three years.</p>

 Information is not available about which primary care trusts (PCTs) have the highest concentration of veterans. The extension of priority treatment to all veterans will not affect serving military personnel, as their arrangements for accelerated access to the national health service are not changing. As with the current arrangements for priority treatment for war pensioners, decisions about priority treatment for all veterans will be made by the relevant clinicians, and will be subject to clinical need. There should be no significant additional cost: the policy is about prioritisation of future referrals.</p>

<sup>(1)</sup> More accurate validation processes in 2006 have resulted in the identification and removal of 9,858 duplicate non-medical staff records out of the total workforce figure of 1.3 million in 2006. Earlier years&#146; figures could not be accurately validated in this way and so will be slightly inflated. The level of inflation in earlier years&#146; figures is estimated to be less than 1 per cent., of total across all non-medical staff groups for headcount figures (and negligible for full-time equivalents). This should be taken into consideration when analysing trends over time.<br>

 Independent sector treatment centres (ISTCs) have been able to provide additional surgical capacity in the south-west while offering patients a wider choice of hospitals for their treatment. The treatment centres have helped local national health service hospitals in achieving their own maximum waiting time targets. Prior to the opening of the treatment centres, the local NHS used private sector capacity in an unstructured way to manage demand from general practitioners, but the introduction of treatment centres has reduced the requirement for this.</p>

 In 2006-07 the informal system of cash brokerage and planned support that had previously operated across the national health service, was replaced for primary care trusts (PCTs) by a formal system of cash limit additions. The requirements for cash limit additions were identified in conjunction with strategic health authorities, and were provided to finance historic working capital issues that had previously been financed informally through the cash brokerage system.

This is significantly higher than the long-term average of around 3 per cent., so we should not consider the next three years as a period of low growth. On top of the growth in funding, the NHS will deliver annual average value for money improvements of 3 per cent., and the cash released will be available to improve patient care. The Department will publish the value for money agreement in December, which will support local delivery of the savings. In addition, the NHS is now in a sound financial position and better able to cope with reduction in the growth in funding.</p>

 The National Health Service (Pharmaceutical Services) Regulations 2005 contain provisions that relate to both community pharmacy and dispensing doctors. These provisions include the procedures that are to be followed by primary care trusts in deciding whether a new provider can enter the market and the impact of any decision on existing local services. The operation of these provisions is kept under review and discussed with the various representative bodies as necessary.</p>

 In the near future. The model will conform with the commitments given in the care record guarantee, which requires access to patient-identifiable information to be controlled by use of individual user smartcards, a valid pass code, role-based access controls and a user profile linked to the organisation in which the user is working. Officials are now working with stakeholders to agree the operational detail which will underpin these requirements and this work is expected to complete shortly.</p>

<i> Notes:</i><br>
The table shows the organisations as they existed, at the time of each collection.<br>
A last minute cancellation is one that occurs on the day the patient was due to arrive, after they have arrived in hospital or on the day of their operation.<br>
Some common non-clinical reasons for cancellations by the hospital include: ward beds unavailable; surgeon unavailable; emergency case needing theatre; theatre list over-ran; equipment failure; admin error; anaesthetist unavailable; theatre staff unavailable; and critical care bed unavailable.<br>
An operation which is rescheduled to a time within 24 hours of the original scheduled operation should be recorded as a postponement and not as a cancellation. The QMCO collection does not record the number of postponements.<br>
