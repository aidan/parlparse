 Of the 17 distinct stops on the visitor route, only St. Stephen&#039;s Hall is entirely inaccessible to wheelchair users. Wheelchair users can view the Lords Chamber from alongside the throne and from the Bar of the House, but cannot transit the Chamber due to the narrow space between the benches and the Table of the House.

 To ask the hon. Member for North Devon, representing the House of Commons Commission what assessment the Commission has made of the impact on visitor numbers to the Public Gallery in the Chamber since the erection of the security screen.  [39063]</p>




<p><a name="st_1"><a name="60109w01.html_spnew1"><b> Nick Harvey: </b> 
 There is no reason to suggest that the erection of the Chamber screen has had any impact on numbers of visitors to the Public Gallery. In the year April 2003 to March 2004 before the temporary security screen was in place there were 107,136 visitors from the public queue and 10,355 from Members&#039; allocated tickets (total 117,491). From April 2004 to March 2005 with the screen in place the corresponding figures were

111,846 from the public queue and 10,329 from Members&#039; allocations (total 122,175). I refer the hon. Member to my answer to the hon.

 To ask the Solicitor-General in which areas primary responsibility for decisions to charge for offences has been passed from the police to the Crown Prosecution Service; and what the clear-up rates for crime in <i>(a)</i> the year before and <i>(b)</i> the year after implementation of the policy were in each case.

<p><a name="st_2"><a name="60109w01.html_spmin0"><b>The Solicitor-General:</b> 
 To date, 30 areas are operating under statutory charging. The remaining 12 areas have been operating shadow charging schemes since 2003, whereby charging is operating on a non-mandatory basis, which mirrors as closely as possible statutory charging arrangements between 9 am and 5 pm Monday to Friday. These remaining areas are scheduled to move onto statutory charging by April 2006.

<p>
<a name="60109w01.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_0">The expected benefits of the charging scheme are a reduction in the rate of discontinuance, an increase in the guilty plea rate, and a reduction in the rate of attrition.

</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10">I have provided tables below to show the number of complaints received by the Agency by clients, and by other bodies, for which information is available. It should be noted that it is difficult to use this information to make meaningful comparisons over time due to changes in the way that information has been recorded. In particular, whilst the volume of Stage 1 complaints undoubtedly rose between 2002/3 and 2003/4, this is likely to have been due in part to more rigorous recording of complaints received at the time, and the introduction by the Agency of a three tier complaints process during 2003/04.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11">The three tier complaints process comprises of; Stage 1 complaints from clients which are dealt with by the Complaints Resolution Team located within each of the Agency&#039;s six business units. Stage 2 complaints which are an escalation to the relevant Area Director when the client is not satisfied with the outcome of stage 1, and stage 3 which is an escalation to the Chief Executive if the client remains dissatisfied.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12">Complaints are also received into the Agency from MPs, or via MPs from a member of the public.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13">The outcome of whether a complaint to the Agency is upheld is not recorded. However, as described above, clients are signposted to the next level of the process should they remain dissatisfied. The table below shows the volume of cases escalated to stages two and three, for which information is available. Once these internal avenues have been exhausted, the client may wish to contact the Independent Case Examiner (ICE), their MP or, via their MP, to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration.</p>

<sup>(10)</sup> While the agency did receive stage 1 telephone complaints prior to 2002&#150;03, their volumes were not recorded, thus preventing meaningful comparison with later years.<br>

<sup>(11)</sup> Although 671 stage 1 telephone complaints were recorded between December 2002 and March 2003, their volumes were not recorded throughout the whole year, thus preventing meaningful comparison with later years.<br>

<sup>(12)</sup> While the agency did receive complaints directly to the chief executive, treat official complaints, and MP complaints to business units prior to 2000&#150;01, their volumes were not recorded, thus preventing meaningful comparison with later years.<br>

<sup>(13)</sup> During 2003&#150;04 complaints sent directly to the chief executive were not recorded separately from those complaints, which were escalated to him as part of the 3 stage process. Therefore, although 7,183 complaints in total were received during 2003&#150;04, it is not possible to separate out those complaints received by the chief executive directly (as opposed to those escalated via the complaints process), thus preventing meaningful comparison with data for earlier years.<br>

<sup>(14)</sup> In April and May of 2004, the chief executive received a total of 1,435 complaints but is not possible to separate out those complaints received by the chief executive directly, as opposed to those escalated to stage 3 of the complaints process). From June 2004-March 2005, after which time such complaints were recorded separately, the chief executive received 4,352 direct complaints and 2,549 complaints escalated upwards from stage 2. Again, these recording issues prevent meaningful comparison of this category with earlier years.<br>

<sup>(15)</sup> Treat official letters are those received by a Minister from a member of the public, and referred for initial consideration to an official of the agency.<br>

Notes:<br>

1. Percentages rounded to the nearest whole number.<br>

2. The percentages are calculated by combing information from the CSA administrative system with that from the benefits system to get current benefit status. Information from the latter system does not exist prior to 1997.<br>

3. We cannot provide information for 2003&#150;04. This is due to limitations with the new system (CS2), which mean we do not currently hold information for new scheme cases and old scheme 



cases on CS2 for that period. This is an issue we are working to address and are hopeful that we will be able to provide this information in the near future.<br>

4. The methodology used to produce these statistics is consistent with that used in the measurement of the Department&#039;s Public Service Agreement target in this area. Namely, all those cases with a child maintenance calculation or assessment where the parent with care is on income support or income based job seekers allowance (including those with a nil liability) who are in receipt of maintenance.<br>

We have introduced a number of simplification measures to reduce complexity in the housing benefit rules.

Notes:<br>

1. Expenditure figures are for Great Britain.<br>

2. Expenditure has been rounded to the nearest million pounds.<br>

3. Gross domestic product percentages have been rounded to one decimal place. A percentage less than 0.1 per cent. is indicated by the symbol *.<br>

4. Expenditure for the basic state pension, minimum income guarantee and other benefits for pensioners include a small amount of expenditure on child dependency increases which are paid with some of these entitlements.<br>

5. Disability benefits for pensioners include disability living allowance, attendance allowance and severe disablement allowance.<br>

6. For figures up to 2004&#150;05, other benefits for pensioners include additional state pension/SERPS, non-contributory retirement pension, contribution based Christmas bonus, pensions compensation board, over65&#039;s payment, over70&#039;s payment, the over 75 TV licence, widow&#039;s benefit, bereavement benefits and incapacity benefit.<br>

Incapacity benefit is only included until 2000&#150;01 as incapacity benefit was no longer paid to people over pension age after that year, following the 1995 Reforms.<br>

7. For figures from 2010&#150;11, other benefits for pensioners include additional state pension/SERPS, non-contributory retirement pension, contribution based Christmas bonus, non-contributory Christmas bonus and the over 75 TV licence.<br>

8. As per the above notes (6 and 7), the breakdown of expenditure is not on a consistent basis.<br>

Source:<br>

Expenditure and percentage of gross domestic product figures have been taken from data which underlies the 2005 pre-Budget report.<br>

<sup>(16)</sup> Individual estimates have been uprated in line with 2004&#150;05 expenditure and may differ from published values.<br>

<sup>(17)</sup> Figures expressed as percentages (percentage) give the overpayments as a percentage of the benefit paid out in the year.<br>

<sup>(18)</sup> The housing benefit estimates in this table include approximations for the purposes of producing an overall fraud and error figure. The estimates in the table will therefore be different from those published previously as National Statistics.<br>

<sup>(19)</sup> The 2004&#150;05 DLA National Benefit Review identified cases where the change in customer&#039;s needs have been so gradual that it would be unreasonable to expect them to know at which point their entitlement to DLA might have changed. These cases do not result in a recoverable overpayment as we cannot quantify or define when the customer&#039;s change occurred. Because legislation requires the Secretary of State to prove that entitlement to DLA is incorrect, rather than requiring the customer to inform us that their needs have changed, cases in this subcategory are legally correct. The difference between what claimants in these cases are receiving in DLA and related premiums in other benefits and what they would receive if their benefit was reassessed is estimated to be around &#163;0.7 billion (+/- &#163;0.2 billion). This figure is not included in the total above, but a similar figure was included in the global fraud and error figure of &#163;3 billion reported in the resource account for 2003&#150;04.<br>

<sup>(20)</sup> Official error rates have been updated with estimates from the 2003&#150;04 measurement exercise.<br>

<sup>(21)</sup> Overpayments due to knock-on effects between loss of DLA component entitlement and premiums on income-related benefits.<br>

<sup>(22)</sup> The estimated rate of fraud and error on unreviewed benefits, for which we have no reliable review information, has been set at 2.7 per cent. and divided equally among fraud, customer error and official error.<br>

Notes:<br>

1. Fraud and error on CTB has not been measured before and is assumed here to be equal to fraud and error rates on HB.<br>

2. Although quoted to the nearest &#163;0.1 billion, there are considerable uncertainties around the total estimates (95 per cent. confidence intervals of between &#177;&#163;0.2 billion and &#177;&#163;0.3 billion).<br>

3. Individual figures may not add across to total fraud and error figures due to rounding.<br>

Note:<br>

The figures for April 2003-March 2004 and October 2003-September 2004 in the above table have been adjusted for data quality problems found. Previous figures have not been adjusted in this way as there is not enough information available to do so. The tables therefore are not all suitable for making reliable comparisons over time but give a reference of our best estimate of these overpayment figures in each year. Confidence intervals are not provided in these tables although are typically around &#177;20&#150;30 per cent. of the central estimates.<br>

Notes:<br>

1. These figures will not include all overpayments in HB through official error. They were published in the latest National Statistics report for HB fraud and error, and only cover the 85 per cent. of HB expenditure that is within the scope of the HBR sample. In these reports, there was an extra category of error labelled &quot;non-residence&quot; error, an unknown amount of which will be due to mistakes made by officials&#151;these overpayments are not included in the figures in this table.<br>

2. The Second National Housing Benefit Accuracy Review, in 1997&#150;98 gave an estimate of &#163;60 million for official error, but was based on a different methodology, so the results are not considered comparable with more recent estimates.<br>

1. These estimates are subject to wide margins of error. Our best estimate of STB overpayments for 2004&#150;05 includes a further amount of around &#163;20 million due to incorrectness types not captured under methodology in earlier years.<br>

Notes:<br>

1. The sample for long-term benefits is a small one and excludes some types of cases. It provides reassurance that official error on these benefits is a very low proportion of expenditure, but the estimate is only a broad indicator.<br>

2. As a result of the wide margins of error, the changes over time are not statistically significant.<br>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what measures he is taking to remove the barriers to work for people with caring responsibilities.  [27007]</p>




<p><a name="st_133"><a name="60109w14.html_spnew3"><b> Mrs. McGuire: </b> 
 In the National Strategy for Carers, &#039;Caring About Carers&#039;, published in February 1999, the Government set out its commitment to encourage and enable carers of working age to remain in work and to help those carers who are unable, or do not want, to combine paid work with caring to return to work when their caring responsibilities cease or diminish. Many people providing informal care already do paid work as well.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60109w14.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_155">From April 2004, Work Focussed Interviews (WFIs) have been introduced for partners of benefit customers in Jobcentre Plus areas. Although partners who are full-time carers with entitlement to carer&#039;s allowance are exempt from WFIs, they are however entitled to help and support, including through new deal for partners, on a voluntary basis.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60109w14.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_156">Carers who are in receipt of carer&#039;s allowance can work and earn up to &#163;82 per week. This amount is calculated net of expenses such as income tax, some national insurance contributions, and half of any contribution towards an occupational or personal pension. Help can also be given with the cost of care of the disabled person when the carer is at work, provided that the substitute carer is not a close relative of either the carer or the disabled person. The amount allowable is 50 per cent. of the net earnings after deduction of the other allowable expenses. Therefore, it is possible for a carer to earn well in excess of &#163;82 and still remain eligible for carer&#039;s allowance.

Decision notices issued when entitlement is established and annual award notices issued when benefit rates change include written reminders of the need for customers to notify changes of address. In addition to this when it is known that an address is out of date various steps are taken depending upon the benefit in payment, for example in jobseekers allowance the customer is seen on a regular basis where correct address details are confirmed. Disability & Carers Service would contact such people as carers, health care professionals involved in the case etc to confirm address details. In other areas checks would be made with local authorities where housing benefit and council tax benefit are in payment.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60109w17.html_para9">
<a name="stpa_188">If an address could not be traced banks would be contacted to suspend payments and data matching takes place with organisations such as Royal Mail redirect. Details of changes in addresses notified to one part of my Department are shared with other Agencies within the Department through cross-benefit computer systems. These systems also receive address data from Her Majesty&#039;s Revenue and Customs where many customers who are in receipt of child benefit, child tax credits and new tax credits are also customers of my Department.

2. Information for percentages of people from this group still claiming jobseeker&#039;s allowance (JSA) is given to June 2005 as this is the latest benefit information available and gives a more accurate reflection of people still claiming JSA.<br>

3. Information is only for those who were claiming JSA when they started new deal 50 plus. It is possible to join new deal 50 plus and not be claiming JSA.<br>

4. Percentage moving into work consists of people recorded as gaining a job through new deal 50 plus and may include people claiming a benefit other than income support or incapacity benefit.<br>

5. Percentage moving into work and onto income support and /or incapacity benefit consists of people who are recorded as gaining a job through new deal 50 plus who are also recorded as having a new claim for income support or incapacity benefit after starting the programme. The income support/incapacity benefit claim may have occurred before, during, or after their job.<br>

6. People recorded as not going into work or claiming income support or incapacity benefit could still be participating on new deal 50 plus.<br>

7. The percentage claiming JSA at the end of June 2005 may include people who also went into work or claimed income support or incapacity benefit between joining the programme and June 2005.<br>

8. Jobs figures are rounded to the nearest 10.<br>

9. Individual percentages may not sum exactly to 100 per cent. due to rounding.<br>

3. Pension Credit (PC) replaced Minimum Income Guarantee (MIG) on 6 October 2003. Existing MIG recipients were automatically converted onto Pension Credit on that date (assuming they still met the eligibility criteria).<br>

4. Data from the Generalised Matching Service (GMS) 100 percent scan taken on 16 September 2005. The figures have been rated up to give month-end estimates.<br>

5. These figures are early estimates. Operational processing times mean that a number of claim commencements and terminations are not reflected in the figures. The final figures incorporated within the Work and Pensions Longitudinal Study (WPLS) will take account of such cases.<br>

6. Couples may contain a number of partners who are less than the age of 60.<br>

 It is a matter of record that the policy of both this and previous Governments has been to exclude most, but not all, full-time students from entitlement to housing benefit; since 1990 financial support for those students opting to study full-time has been seen as the responsibility of the education system, rather than the benefit system.

It would be very difficult for someone in full-time education to fully meet the conditions for receipt of jobseeker&#039;s allowance.

<a name="stpa_245">Young people who are eligible to claim jobseekers allowance receive, like everyone else, help and support to find work. As unemployment lengthens and getting into work becomes more difficult the help provided becomes more intensive. As part of this, young people become eligible for the new deal after six months unemployment. The new deal provides intensive support through a personal adviser and includes, for those people who do not find work quickly, a number of options, including full-time education and training, to help improve their prospects of finding work.
