 DEFRA officials have considered numerous reports on whether cephalopods experience pain and suffering, but the current scientific evidence is not clear-cut.

 The Department is continuing to hold constructive discussions about the project in Gloucestershire which, to the Department&#039;s knowledge, is keeping the beavers in captivity and is therefore not a re-introduction project.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what environmental impact assessment has been carried out into the process that converts vegetable oils into biodiesel of diesel quality.  [43911]</p>




<p><a name="st_4"><a name="60130w01.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 The most common process for converting vegetable oil into biodiesel is trans-esterification. This process is well known from years of use in the oleochemical sector. However, the Low Carbon Vehicle Partnership will be looking at the specific environmental impacts of biodiesel processing as part of their work on developing draft environmental standards for biofuels. The impacts in terms of pollution to air, land and water are controlled by the Environment Agency. A pollution prevention control permit is required where biodiesel is being produced for own-use by six or more people or for commercial operations producing more than 5,000 litres a year. The processing of biodiesel from waste cooking oil and tallow is also subject to waste management controls. Various studies have assessed the greenhouse gas impact across the whole production process from raw material to finished biodiesel. UK-produced biodiesel typically gives greenhouse gas savings of around 55 per cent. compared to fossil diesel.

<p><a name="st_5"><a name="60130w01.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 The current skin test for bovine tuberculosis is an effective test. It is the accepted standard laid down in both national and international legislation for determining the existence of the disease in a cattle herd. Under EU law, the gamma-interferon diagnostic blood test may be used to supplement the skin test. It is considered marginally more sensitive than the skin test, but less specific. This means that it results in a higher probability of false positives. EU legislation allows for the gamma-interferon test to be used to pick up cases missed by the skin test, but not to overrule it.

 The UK Film Council provides financial assistance to film projects to help deliver a consistent flow of high quality and culturally significant films. All film projects are selected according to an assessment of their cultural and creative merits. Funding will generally be given only to projects that are wholly or substantially capable of certification as a &#039;British&#039; film. However, the UK Film Council is able to exercise discretion and may still elect to finance a film if there are other strong cultural reasons for doing so.

<a name="stpa_129">The Royal Armouries currently runs a programme called &#039;Memories&#039;, which records through DVD the reminiscences of veterans from the Second World War about the Department for weapons they either used or encountered during conflict. A DVD is currently on display in the main entrance to the Royal Armouries in Leeds, and 10 more Second World War veterans will be interviewed by the end of February. The project is in its early days and it is estimated that it will cost &#163;7,000 in 2005&#150;06, with plans for further development.

 The LSC is currently undergoing a radical restructuring exercise which will enable it to work even more effectively with local partners and stakeholders in identifying and responding to London&#039;s learning and skill needs. The existing local office structure will be replaced by a number of specialist local Partnership and Economic Development teams made up of experienced education and training professionals. They will work closely with local partners and stakeholders to ensure that properly funded education and training is available that meets the needs of learners and employers in the London area. These changes are in keeping with the Government&#039;s wider public sector reform agenda, which seeks to move responsibility for local delivery closer to the frontline.

<p><a name="st_36"><a name="60130w24.html_spnew3"><b> Jacqui Smith: </b> 
 The level of funding per pupil received through the dedicated schools grant (DSG) reflects the characteristics of children in each authority: authorities receive more funding if they have higher numbers of children living in deprived circumstances. That is because pupils from more deprived backgrounds are likely to have additional educational needs, and to require additional help if they are to have an equal chance to succeed. North Somerset&#039;s average level of funding per pupil mainly reflects the authority&#039;s lower than average level of deprivation. The Government will review the operation of a number of aspects of the new school funding arrangements, including the DSG distribution, but in doing so it will continue to aim to give all pupils an equal opportunity in life.

 A research review commissioned by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister in 2003 found some indication that there is a relationship between overcrowding and children&#039;s educational attainment, and between overcrowding and children&#039;s social and emotional development. However, the research evidence on the effects of overcrowding on attainment is limited. It is also hard to separate any direct effect of overcrowding from the effect of other associated factors, such as poverty and degree of parental involvement in education. Current evidence suggests that any direct effect of overcrowding on attainment is likely to be small.

<i>[holding answer 24 January 2006]:</i> Total education spending by Newcastle-Upon-Tyne local authority in 2004&#150;05 was &#163;185 million, including spending on provision outside schools. The Department is currently working on figures for spending on school provision for 2004&#150;05 that are comparable with the Dedicated Schools Grant, on both a cash and per pupil basis, and will place them in the Library as soon as they are available.

The total DSG allocation will not be finalised until May 2006 when the January 2006 pupil figures are finalised. In addition, while authorities must apply the whole of their allocation of DSG to their Schools Budget, they are free to add to it from their own resources. Final figures for total budgeted expenditure per pupil for 2006&#150;07 may therefore be higher than the authority&#039;s allocation of DSG per pupil for that year.

 The Department for Education and Skills pays dedicated schools grant (DSG) to local authorities, to provide for those items that are included in each local authority&#039;s schools budget, which consists of the delegated budgets allocated to individual schools, and a budget for other provision for pupils which local authorities fund centrally. Each local authority then decides, in consultation with its Schools Forum, on the 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>30 Jan 2006 : Column 96W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
distribution of funding between its schools. The national formula for distribution of DSG does not take account of the level of deficit at an authority&#039;s schools and, normally, local authority formulae for distributing funding do not do so either. However, it is open to an authority to distribute additional funding to a school which is in financial difficulties. Where a school is in deficit, it should agree a plan with its local authority to eliminate the deficit over a three-year period.

This was a larger than usual increase. We might therefore expect a slight fall in application numbers for the 2006 entry and then a return to a long-term upward trend, as experienced in 1997 and 1998 when the last major change to student support arrangements was introduced.

However, we judge that there is most unlikely to be agreement in the UN Security Council to refer Zimbabwe to the ICC at present and that failure to secure agreement would constitute a reverse.

 EU sanctions against leading figures in the Zimbabwe Government continue to place real and significant pressure on the regime. They have the support of the Zimbabwean political opposition and non-governmental organisations, and they send a firm message that the EU is concerned at human rights abuses, but as we have made clear on many previous occasions, the measures we have in place are targeted specifically against the regime. We do not believe it is right to pursue sanctions which would hurt innocent Zimbabweans already suffering from the misrule by the Mugabe regime.

Patient counts are based on the unique patient identifier HESID.

However, the Department also provides a wide variety of other arrangements which allow staff to work flexibly, and thereby help to promote diversity and the achievement of a better work-life balance, while still ensuring its business is conducted effectively. These include initiatives such as a flexitime scheme, part-time working, job sharing, part-year appointments, which are particularly suitable for people wishing to work only during school term time, compressed hours, fitting the working week into less that five full days, and special leave arrangements to cope with a variety of circumstances.

 As part of the Department&#039;s commitment to reducing administrative burdens on the national health service, statistical information relating to medicines management in hospitals is not collected routinely. However, in 2003 NHS trusts were invited to self-assess their medicines management performance against developmental good practice standards contained in the Department&#039;s medicines management framework. Responses were considered by strategic

health authorities (SHAs) and, where appropriate, action plans to address areas of weakness would be developed and implemented by the individual trusts. The information collected by SHAs suggested that by the end of 2004 some 67 per cent. of respondents expected to have systems in place to utilise patients&#039; own drugs and enable self-administration, where appropriate.

However, the Office for National Statistics&#039; (ONS&#039;s) report &quot;Psychiatric Morbidity among Adults Living in Private Households, 2000&quot; shows the associations between the presence of mental disorders and key socio-demographic and economic characteristics for those with different types of mental disorder.

 The Queen Elizabeth Hospital National Health Service Trust has a reference cost index score of 103 for the year 2003&#150;04.

<p><a name="st_287"><a name="60130w52.html_spnew1"><b> Jane Kennedy: </b> 
 This is a local matter. The South East London Strategic Health Authority (SHA) has advised that following the HM Treasury&#039;s discount rate for the provisions for 3.5 per cent. and 2.2 per cent., the Queen Elizabeth Hospital Trust has applied this directive to the deferred asset created to transfer ownership of the private finance initiative hospital back to the national health service over the term of the contract. The SHA further advises that this interpretation of the guidance has recently been clarified by the Department. However, the trust is finding it difficult to contain the impact of the financial pressure resulting from this clarification which was published on 3 January with an effective date of 1 April 2005.

 This is a local matter. The South East London Strategic Health Authority has advised that the Queen Elizabeth Hospital scheme has not been refinanced. It was financed with an index-linked bond. The nature of bond deals make them very hard to refinance without incurring considerable additional costs. It is therefore unlikely that a refinancing will take place as the costs will normally outweigh the benefits.

 As with all medicinal products, vaccine safety is continually monitored by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) with advice from independent experts. The United Kingdom&#039;s Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) and its expert working group on vaccine safety have thoroughly reviewed the safety of thiomersal-containing vaccines, including alleged links with neurodevelopmental disorders, and kept this under close review.

<p>
<a name="60130w52.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_213">In 2001, the CSM, now the Commission for Human Medicines, conducted a major review of the available evidence and has since then considered new data on a number of occasions as it has emerged. Following concerns in the United States of America (USA) about the possible toxicity of thiomersal-containing vaccines, the Department funded a study using the UK&#039;s general practice research database to investigate whether there is a relationship between the amount of thiomersal that an infant receives through vaccination at a young age and subsequent neurological disorders. Data from a study involving over a 100,000 UK children were considered by CSM in 2003. Further studies from Denmark involving almost half a million children and a study from the USA have also specifically investigated 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>30 Jan 2006 : Column 190W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
the suggested link between mercury-containing vaccines and autism. None of these studies have found any evidence of a causal association with subsequent neurodevelopment disorders, including autism.

<p>
<a name="60130w52.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_214">The advice of CSM stands that there is no evidence of harm from the very small quantities of thiomersal contained in some vaccines, with the exception of possible allergic reactions, typically skin rashes or local swelling at the site of injection. This view concurs with that of the World Health Organisation, the USA&#039;s Institute of Medicine and the European Medicines Agency.
