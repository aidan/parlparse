 The bulk of the discussions have, quite properly, been with Post Office Ltd. and we have been talking to them about this since last summer. The first meeting on this was in fact instigated by the former chief executive of Post Office Ltd. (David Mills). The meetings have covered a number of issues, including the DWP pilots which have been running over the last few weeks. We also advised the National Federation and Postwatch before the pilots started.

<p>

<a name="stpa_1">In July 2005 the consultation document on the Pension Protection Levy estimated that as at September 2004 the aggregate deficit, on a Pension Protection Fund basis, was &#163;134 billion.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (1) pursuant to his oral statement of 24 January 2006, <i>Official Report,</i> columns 1305&#150;12W, on the Welfare Reform Green Paper, what the baseline year is for measuring the target to reduce the number of people on incapacity benefit by one million over 10 years;  [51950]



</p>



<p><a name="qnpa_0">(2) what estimate he has made of the proportion of existing incapacity benefit claimants who will flow off benefit and into work following the introduction of the proposals outlined in the Green Paper A New Deal for Welfare: Empowering People to Work;  [51953]

<p><a name="st_5"><a name="60313w01.html_spnew5"><b> Margaret Hodge: </b> 
 The Green Paper set out our proposed measures to significantly reduce the number of people claiming and receiving incapacity benefits. These 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>13 Mar 2006 : Column 1843W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
measures included improvements to workplace health, reform of the gateway, increased support for claimants and removing the perverse incentives in the system.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60313w01.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_4">While it is difficult to model the precise impact of these measures at this early stage, the Green Paper set out our aspiration to reduce the number of claimants of incapacity benefits by one million over the course of a decade through the combined efforts of the Government, employers, local authorities and health professionals.

<p><a name="st_6"><a name="60313w01.html_spnew6"><b> Margaret Hodge: </b> 
 The current personal capability assessment focuses entirely on an individual&#039;s limits to functional capabilities, as a way of determining eligibility for benefit. It gives no regard to a person&#039;s capabilities.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60313w01.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_5">In our Green Paper on Welfare Reform, we set out our plans for transforming the assessment into a much more constructive and proactive process, focusing not just on what an individual can&#039;t do but on what they can do as well. We will identify the barriers preventing an individual from returning to work and the types of support and intervention needed to overcome those barriers. We will also identify those people whose illness or disability limits them so severely that it would be unreasonable to expect to engage in work-related activity at that point in time. They will be entitled to a higher rate of benefit.

The provisions in the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 1976 which banned media identification of sex offence defendants was repealed by the Criminal Justice Act 1988.

The last year of monitoring was 2000&#150;01 and QCA&#039;s records show that five secondary schools in the Peterborough local education authority area used the regulations for a total of 179 pupils. The total number of secondary schools in England that used the Key Stage 4 regulations in that academic year was 1,292, affecting 55,787 pupils.

 We do not currently have any plans to revise the EMA criteria to include young people who are required to be in compulsory education. The purpose of the education maintenance allowance (EMA), is to provide an incentive to engage young people aged 16 to 18 in learning.

Higher education leads to a range of benefits, not only higher earnings but reduced crime, better health, and wider social capital benefits. The new student support arrangements offer a better deal for students from poorer backgrounds. We have reintroduced grants for those from low income households; we have ended up front fees; and we have

introduced the Office for Fair Access so that universities have agreements on outreach and funding help that they will offer poorer students. &#163;300 million is being offered in bursaries and other financial support. Alongside this, the Government and its partners support the Aimhigher programme, which enables partnerships of schools, colleges and universities to design and deliver a range of aspiration and attainment raising activities to enable young people from backgrounds currently under-represented in higher education to be able and willing to go on to HE. We are also determined to improve educational attainment so that more people are in a position to benefit from HE. Our proposals in the Schools White Paper, which is now the basis for The Education and Inspections Bill 2006, will help ensure that every young person has the opportunity to reach their potential, including, where appropriate, university education.

 The Maritime and Coastguard Agency has a comprehensive programme of monitoring discharges from ships in the UK Pollution Zone.

 The identification of Marine Environmental High Risk Areas (MEHRAs) is just one of a number of measures used to protect the UK coast from possible environmental impacts of shipping. These include improvements in the provision of Emergency Towing Vessels, and the mandatory reporting system for tankers carrying heavy grades of oil into the newly designated Western European Particularly Sensitive Sea Area (PSSA). The Government also take account of wider developments in UK policy on the sustainable use of the marine environment, such as the growth in offshore renewable energy, the Government&#039;s commitment to introducing a Marine Bill, developments in thinking on marine spatial planning and advances in e-navigation technology. The introduction of any additional protective measures for MEHRAs has to be considered as part of these wider, inter-linked developments.

 Helicopter travel enables members of the Royal Family to undertake a number of engagements at different locations on the same day.

In 2004&#150;05, members of the Royal Family undertook 2,400 official engagements in the UK. Accordingly there are no current plans to limit the use of helicopter travel.

 As my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for International Development told the House on 1 March, the international community is united in its support for the Quartet statement of 30 January. Hamas needs to give up violence, recognise Israel and sign up to previous obligations on the peace process. Aid to the future government will be reviewed against those principles. While the current caretaker Government is in place, the international community is examining closely what steps could help to stabilise the financial situation, as recommended by the Quartet.

<a name="stpa_150">Prism brings major changes, it is not merely a new IT system. It establishes new processes and reinforces adherence to existing processes. This is a significant challenge, particularly for staff using Prism each day, including management officers, accountants and buyers. Their workload certainly increases during the first months of using the system. For many, this has been exacerbated by Prism&#039;s poor performance, particularly its speed. A concerted effort to improve this is beginning to pay dividends for a significant number of Posts. But many using satellite links continue to face slow performance. Despite this, our experience is that, once Posts get to grips with Prism, workloads start to return to normal. Posts with most Prism experience are beginning to see tangible benefits from the changes.

These include mandatory hostile environment training; briefing packs prior to arrival containing security advice and details of evacuation procedures; professional security briefing on arrival in Afghanistan; protected accommodation; armoured vehicles with armed protection; provision of close protection for medium and high risk movements; and a location notification system 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>13 Mar 2006 : Column 1924W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
which tracks all staff movement 24 hours per day. In the event of an emergency, DFID also has access to International Security Assistance Force and Coalition forces military assistance. An on-going risk assessment is in place to ensure that these procedures continue to be both appropriate and adequate.

 Based on advice from a number of sources, including the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) Security Management Directorate Overseas Security Adviser, the DFID Permanent Secretary will decide whether security permits deployment of DFID staff in Helmand province. We recognise the responsibility to share information with development partners to enable them to minimise security related risks, but the final decision on their deployment to Helmand must lie with development partners themselves.

 UK deployments to Helmand are part of a comprehensive NATO-led package.

Decisions about future deployment will be dependent on assessments of the operating environment, particularly regarding security. We also expect regular visits to Helmand from DFID staff working in our office in Kabul.

 DFID has provided assistance to those affected by the Chernobyl nuclear power plant accident through our share of the nuclear safety component of the European Community&#039;s (EC) Technical Assistance to the Commonwealth of Independent States (TACIS) programme.

The 2005 programme includes &#8364;17.9 million for Ukraine. Its main aim is to attain the highest level of nuclear safety, including the management of the Chernobyl site. In addition the programme includes &#8364;1.5 million for restarting previous agriculture activities and creating new jobs for those in the areas affected by the accident.

Details of this assistance can be found in The Global Partnership&#151;Progress during 2005 on the UK&#039;s programmes to address nuclear, chemical and biological legacies in the Former Soviet Union (URN 05/373)&quot;.

 Promoting commercial competitiveness of small-scale farmers is critical to boosting growth and poverty reduction in Africa. Action is needed in three key areas: improving policies and public spending in support of small-scale farming; developing the business environment and infrastructure, particularly in rural areas, so that markets function more effectively for small farmers; and improving the productivity of agriculture and access to markets. DFID supports programmes in all these areas.

 The Government recognise the devastating effect that the uncontrolled proliferation of Small Arms and Light Weapons (SALW) has on developing countries. Preventing the illicit trade in SALW is crucial to dealing with the problem. Furthermore, most illegally-held arms begin their lives as legal exports. In combating the illicit trade it is therefore vital to regulate the licit trade.

 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what help is given to sub-Saharan countries to replace and retrain health personnel recruited from those countries; and which countries <i>(a)</i> qualify and <i>(b)</i> do not qualify for this aid.  [56198]</p>








<p><a name="st_239"><a name="60313w29.html_spnew0"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 DFID provides most of its support to Africa to 16 focus countries, as outlined in its public service agreement with the Treasury. It is committed to helping country Governments strengthen their health services. Health worker shortages are a complex issue, and go beyond migration and international recruitment. There are both pull factors that attract workers away from where they are needed and push factors that motivate them to leave. That is why DFID is not only working closely with African countries but also with the UK Department of Health on both sides of this issue.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60313w29.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_238">The UK is the only developed country to implement systematic policies that explicitly prevent the targeting of developing countries in the international recruitment of health care professionals. DFID worked closely with the Department of Health to draw up a list of countries, which includes all the sub-Saharan African countries, from which the NHS does not actively recruit. In addition, the Department of Health has brokered a groundbreaking agreement for this code to apply to major players in the UK independent health care sector.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60313w29.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_239">A shortage of workers is a symptom of a health service in crisis. Health workers leave their jobs because of a lack of housing and schools in underserved areas and because of a lack of opportunity for professional career development. This is coupled with poor pay and working conditions which prevent them from doing the jobs they have been trained for, by failing, for example, to provide the required drugs and equipment. All this is exacerbated by HIV/AIDS. Workloads are heavier and health-workers themselves are dying.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60313w29.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_240">The UK invests substantially in health, supporting African country Governments to strengthen their health services and systems. We use a variety of means to do this, either through support to international agencies, direct support to Government budgets, by pooling our funds with other donors or through projects. This is complemented by operational research. For example, in Malawi, where the shortage of health workers is particularly severe, we provide &#163;100 million support for the health sector of which &#163;55 million is earmarked for the Emergency Human Resources programme. This programme focuses on improving recruitment and retention through salary increases for health workers, expanding training capacity; doubling the number of nurses and tripling the number of doctors in training; and using international volunteer physicians and nurse tutors while more Malawians are being trained. The programme is also bolstering human resources planning and management capacity in Malawi&#039;s Ministry of Health.

 Across the whole of Darfur, there are 1.8 million internally displaced people and 3.4 million dependent on humanitarian assistance. The priority is to provide help and protection for them, and to find a political solution that will allow people to return home and rebuild their lives. In the South of Sudan the humanitarian situation remains fragile. Pockets of instability, noticeably in the Upper Nile, Eastern and Western Equatoria, have resulted in continued internal displacement.
</p>


<p>

<a name="stpa_241">Although the massive humanitarian effort in Darfur has had a positive impact on malnutrition and mortality rates, the region remains highly dependant on food aid. Instability, fighting and banditry in South and West Darfur, particularly along the border zone with Chad, is severely hampering humanitarian agencies operating in those areas. Violence and attacks on humanitarian agencies&#039; staff and assets has lead to a reduction in presence, and total withdrawals in some areas, by both the UN and non-governmental organisations (NGOs).

<p>
<a name="60313w29.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_242">The UK is the second largest donor in Darfur (after the US), providing over &#163;96 million since the crisis started in September 2003. These funds have been channelled through both UN agencies and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and have meant that thousands of vulnerable people have been provided with shelter, food, water and basic health care. DFID have committed a further &#163;67 million to humanitarian relief in Sudan in 2006&#150;07. As part of this commitment, the UK is providing &#163;40 million to the Common Humanitarian Fund (CHF), a pioneering multi-donor fund, administered by the UN humanitarian co-ordinator. This new mechanism will help enable the UN to react more quickly and more flexible to both identified and unforeseen needs, not only in Darfur but across all of Sudan.

<a name="60313w29.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_243">In addition to funding vital NGO humanitarian programmes in the South, the UK is providing financial support to an emergency response fund for the South to deal with emergencies, such as the cholera outbreak. For longer term recovery and development, the UK is establishing the &#163;10 million service delivery fund which we hope will be able to move quickly to support the basic provision of education, health, and water and sanitation. This will act as a bridge to the Multi-Donor Trust Fund while it develops projects for funding to meet longer term development needs.

 We are using two multilateral instruments to ensure that our aid assistance achieves national coverage. Firstly, we have allocated &#163;40 million to the Common Humanitarian Fund (CHF). This fund is managed by the UN humanitarian co-ordinator, allowing him to fund humanitarian priorities across the whole of Sudan (in 2006 almost 42 per cent. of the CHF was allocated to the South). Secondly, we pledged at the 2005 Oslo donors&#039; conference, a contribution of &#163;47 million to the two World Bank managed Multi-Donor Trust Funds (MDTF) (&#163;23.5 million each). MDTF-National covers the war-affected areas of the North and the three transition zones of Abyei, Upper Nile, and Nuba Mountains; and the MDTF-South is for South Sudan. We have also established a &#163;17.2 million Basic Services Fund which we are using to support non-governmental organisations to provide essential services in education, health and water/sanitation in the most deprived areas of South Sudan before the MDTF-South comes on stream.

I can, however, provide assurance that there is an extensive and robust evaluation methodology in place to ensure that Bidders&#039; proposals meet Defence requirements and are evaluated on an equitable basis.

The Ministry of Defence, the International Institute of Strategic Studies and the Northern Ireland Office have jointly sponsored a series of visits to the UK by senior Russian military officers in which the proper conduct of counter-terrorist operations has been a major theme. From 14 to 16 February a Russian cruiser took part, with HMS Nottingham, in a NATO naval exercise in the Mediterranean, in preparation for forthcoming Russian participation in NATO&#039;s maritime counter-terrorist Operation Active Endeavour.

<a name="stpa_279">The United States already has one of the leading biometric systems to identify visitors, the US VISIT&quot; system. When announced in April 2003, it was made clear that it would use biometrics which could include facial image, fingerprints and iris images. Although it currently requires all foreign visitors to the United States to enrol facial image and two index fingerprints on entry, the United States Secretary of Homeland Security said in July 2005 that, in the future, first-time visitors to the United States will be enrolled in the US VISIT&quot; system by submitting 10 fingerprints. 10 fingerprint biometrics will also be used in the US in the Registered Traveller Program&quot; which has piloted the use of fingerprint and iris biometrics along the lines of our own Iris Recognition Immigration System (IRIS) to allow for fast track immigration clearance of registered passengers.

Note:<br>

The median replaces the mean as the headline statistic. The weighted mean is the sum of the weighted values divided by the sum of the weights. The median is the value below which 50 per cent. of employees fall. It is preferred over the mean for earnings data as it is influenced less by extreme values and because of the skewed distribution of earnings data.<br>

<sup>(46)</sup> Rates per 100,000 population standardised to the European Standard Population.<br>

Cancer (malignant neoplasms)&#151;ICD-10 C00-C97<br>





Coronary heart disease&#151;ICD-10 120&#150;125<br>

Deaths were selected using the original underlying cause.<br>

The causes of death for 1997 were defined using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9).<br>

The codes used are listed:<br>

Chronic lung disease (Chronic lower respiratory disease)&#151;ICD-9 490&#150;494, 496<br>

Cancer (malignant neoplasms)&#151;ICD-9 140&#150;208<br>

Coronary heart disease&#151;ICD-9 410&#150;414<br>

The introduction of ICD-10 for coding cause of death in England and Wales in 2001 means that data for chronic lung disease and cancer are not completely comparable with data for years before this date. The effect of the change in classification in 2001 on deaths from these causes is described in a report published in May 2002:<br>

Office for National Statistics. Results of the ICD-10 bridge coding study, England and Wales, 1999. Health Statistics Quarterly 14 (2002), 75&#150;83.<br>

For chronic lung disease (chronic lower respiratory disease) and cancer (malignant neoplasms) the introduction of ICD-10 caused an increase of 3.2% and 2.3% respectively in the number of deaths coded to these conditions in England and Wales. Deaths in 1997 from these causes have been adjusted to provide rates which are comparable with those for 2004.<br>

 A wide range of organisations such as KPMG and the World Economic Forum produce international competitiveness rankings, based on a variety of criteria. In addition, the Department produces an annual update of the Productivity and Competitiveness Indicators, which benchmark UK performance against the US, France and Germany. These look at performance on the Government&#039;s five key drivers of productivity, and, overall, give reason for optimism regarding UK productivity performance. But the real measures of the competitiveness of an economy is how well it is performing. On the basis the UK is doing well. GDP has grown for 54 consecutive quarters, the longest sustained expansion on record; the UK&#039;s employment rate is the highest among the G7 economies (bar Canada); and we are enjoying the longest period of sustained low inflation since the 1960s.

<p><a name="st_379"><a name="60313w44.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Sutcliffe: </b> 
 Since its introduction in April 2003, Statutory Adoption Pay has been paid at the same standard rate and for the same length of time as Statutory Maternity Pay (SMP) and Maternity Allowance (MA). We intend to continue the existing approach as we increase both the standard rate and the payment period. The higher rate of SMP available to women for the first six weeks after the birth recognises the period of compulsory maternity leave, which is for health and safety reasons. The Work and Families Bill will enable us to meet our commitment to extend the payment period of SMP, MA and SAP from the current 26 weeks to 39 weeks from April 2007, with an ambition to extend to one year by the end of this Parliament.

<p><a name="st_386"><a name="60313w44.html_spnew7"><b> Mr. Sutcliffe: </b> 
 Competition in the supermarket and grocery sectors is a matter for the independent competition authorities, in this instance the Office of Fair Trading (OFT). In August 2005 the OFT announced its intention to monitor the code more proactively, and as part of this it will:

</p>
<ul>

 An estimate of the number of heroin addicts in Northern Ireland is not available. However, the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety (DHSSPS) maintains several databases that record the number of registered addicts and the uptake of treatment for problem drug use across Northern Ireland.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60313w52.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_385">The Northern Ireland Addicts Index Database holds information on all those persons registered in concurrence with the Misuse of Drugs (Notification of and Supply to Addicts) (Northern Ireland) Regulations 1973. The 2005 Statistical Bulletin reported that on 31 December 2005, a total of 168 persons were recorded as addicted to heroin. DHSSPS also maintains the Northern Ireland Substitute Prescribing Database, which holds information on persons receiving substitute prescribing treatment for opiate dependence. On 8 March 2006, a total of 249 people were recorded as in contact with substitute prescribing services where the main problem drug was heroin. DHSSPS also maintains the Northern Ireland Drug Misuse Database, which holds information relating to problem drug users presenting to treatment services. In 2004&#150;05 a total of 237 persons reported where their main problem drug was heroin.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60313w52.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_386">It is important to note that problem drug use and dependence does not constitute addiction and that although there will be an overlap between the three databases, there will be a proportion of heroin addicts that may never be in contact with treatment services. In recognition of this issue, DHSSPS has already commissioned a research study (to include information from the Criminal Justice System) to produce a reliable estimate of problem heroin use in Northern Ireland. It is anticipated that that report will be published, via the DHSSPS website, in April of this year. A similar study conducted in 2000&#150;01 indicated that there were approximately 800 problem heroin users in Northern Ireland during that period.

 The Education (Student Support) Regulations (Northern Ireland) underpin the financial support arrangements for Northern Ireland domiciled students in higher education, including students on Postgraduate Certificate in Education courses. They broadly replicate provisions in the corresponding GB Regulations which apply to English and Welsh domiciled students.

<a name="stpa_391">There are no compelling reasons to offer financial incentives similar to those available to teacher training students in England and Wales, including NI domiciled students, to encourage recruitment to or retain teachers within the profession here, as this is not a pressing problem in NI. Applications to teacher training courses in Northern Ireland currently exceed by 8 to 1 the number of places available. Moreover, there is no evidence that the existence of incentives elsewhere is diverting applicants away from the NI institutions. The position, however, is kept under close review.
