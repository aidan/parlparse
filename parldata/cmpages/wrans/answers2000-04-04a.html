 The Government commissioned the British Council last year, as part of the initiative to bring more international students to the UK, to research the relative attractiveness and the actual and perceived costs of studying in the UK compared with other developed anglophone countries. No distinction was made between students with or without bursaries. The summary of this research, the Brand Report, is available on the EducationUK website at www.educationuk.org. We have made no similar studies on other European Union member countries.

 <i>[holding answer 3 April 2000]:</i> The Department does not collect information on the cost of providing free school meals. We estimate that the annual cost in England of extending free school meals to children in full-time education <i>(a)</i> whose families are in receipt of working families tax credit would be over &#163;400 million; <i>(b)</i> whose families are in receipt of working families tax credit with less than half the average family income would be slightly lower than &#163;400 million; and <i>(c)</i> from families where a parent is in receipt of disabled person's tax credit could be in the region of &#163;0.5 million.

To ask the Prime Minister if he will make a statement on his policy in relation to information derived from interception of communications of United Kingdom citizens where that has been undertaken by foreign powers, and where Her Majesty's Government's policy would not have allowed such an interception to have been initiated by any of the security and intelligence agencies.  [116902]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00404w02.html_spmin0"><B>The Prime Minister</B> 
 <i>[holding answer 30 March 2000]:</i> The Interception of Communications Acts make clear that the interception of communications on a public telecommunications network in the United Kingdom may not lawfully be carried out without a warrant signed by a Secretary of State. These arrangements will be enhanced by the provisions in the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Bill, now in Standing Committee.

 The Maternity and Parental Leave Regulations 1999 give both employed parents of a child born or placed for adoption after 15 December 1999 a minimum entitlement of 13 weeks unpaid parental leave during the first five years of parenthood. These regulations implement the Parental Leave Directive and reflect the Government's wish to help the parents of young children strike a better balance between their work and family commitments. The Government encourage employers to improve on these minimum requirements where this accords with the needs of employees and is compatible with the efficient running of the business.

 It is the policy of my Department to encourage greater devolution of responsibility and support to the regions. I therefore fully support, for example, the policy of the Arts Council for England to bring decisions on funding closer to those most affected by them by devolving many responsibilities to the regional arts boards. Furthermore, the Regional Cultural Consortiums have been given the task of producing regional cultural strategies which will set out how they can best support and promote each region's distinct cultural identity.

 Information on the quantity and value of unused medicines is not collected centrally. It is important both that patients take the medicines they need, and that they are not prescribed more medicines than they need, since this wastes money which could otherwise be used to benefit other patients. We have put in place a number of initiatives to reduce the quantity of unused medicines, such as making regular review of patients' medication by general practitioners a condition for payment of the Sustained Quality Allowance and funding pilot schemes where pharmacists manage repeat prescriptions, including checking that patients are taking the medicines that they have been prescribed and actually need further supplies. We will consider extending this initiative if the results of the pilots show that this reduces waste.

<a name="00404w04.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 Following the move of the Headquarters 2 Division from York to Edinburgh, a total of up to some 262 staff posts are planned to be accommodated within Annandale Block, which is the Headquarters 2 Division HQ Building, Craigiehall. Of this total, some 204 are civilian and 58 military. Some 35 of the total number work for organisations other than Headquarters 2 Division. All these staff can be safely accommodated within the building.
<P>

<a name="00404w04.html_para5">The gross floor office space of the building, excluding corridors, is approximately 4,000 sq m, some 3,475 sq m of which will be utilised by Headquarters 2 Division staff. It is not possible to provide a meaningful figure of the maximum number of personnel and amount of office equipment that could be safely accommodated within the building, as the occupation of each room would be dependent on individual circumstances. Planning for reorganisation of accommodation within the building has been undertaken with due regard to The Workplace (Health, Safety and Welfare) Regulations and the Approved Code of Practice 1992, Regulation 10 (Room Dimension and Space).
<P>

<a name="00404w04.html_para6">The presence of asbestos as an insulator behind convected heating panels and in ceiling tiles of the building was identified in December 1997. Although it was judged to be safely inert, it was nevertheless recorded as a potential hazard and brought to the attention of all staff. In line with the requirements of the Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1992, Regulation 3 (Risk Assessment), a reassessment was carried out on Annandale Block in early 1999, and the judgment was that it remains safely inert.
<P>

<a name="00404w04.html_para7">In addition, a Legionellosis Risk Assessment relating to the building was carried out in February this year. The assessment made a number of minor recommendations to comply with statutory obligations, and implementation of these recommendations is now in hand.
<P>

<a name="00404w04.html_para8">Currently, alterations relating to the reconfiguration of the reprographic room in Annandale Block are being carried out at an estimated cost of &#163;3,400. Safe systems of work have been applied and all necessary precautions have been taken in accordance with the control of Asbestos at Work (Amendment) 1992. No further work is currently planned for the building.
<P>

<a name="00404w04.html_para9">An intrusive structural survey has been carried out in March this year by Posford Duvivier Scotland Ltd., Edinburgh on behalf of the Estate Adviser Scotland and 



<P>
<P><I>4 Apr 2000 : Column: 400W</I><P>
this confirmed that the structural integrity of the building and, in particular, the steelwork remained sound. The survey made a number of recommendations about the positioning of heavy objects such as filing cabinets on the upper floors with which the Headquarters is complying.
<P>

<a name="00404w04.html_para10">The health and safety of personnel accommodated within the building, and indeed throughout the HQ 2 Division, Craigiehall remains a high priority. This will remain the case.
<P>

<a name="00404w04.html_para11">No formal representations have been made concerning accommodation at Craigiehall. Prior to the move of the Headquarters 2 Division from York to Edinburgh, a formal consultation document associated with the restructuring, which included cost data, was given to the national and local trade unions in October 1998. Local trade unions have been kept informed of office moves within the headquarters of HQ Scotland, Craigiehall, including internal moves within Annandale Block, on an informal basis.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if he will make a statement on the financial difficulties caused to public utility ETM customers when extra emergency credit is given to them without advanced notification; and what is being done to safeguard their interests in the future.  [114627]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00404w05.html_spnew8"><B> Mrs. Liddell </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 23 March 2000]:</i> At the end of 1999 the Office of Gas and Electricity Management (Ofgem) asked energy suppliers to increase temporarily the amount of emergency credit (where this was available) to people using electronic token prepayment meters, so as to ensure that vulnerable customers would be protected from loss of gas or electricity supplies over the long Christmas/Millennium holiday period. For example, the amount of emergency credit available on Centrica (British Gas) after prepaid supplies had been used up was increased from &#163;2 to &#163;10. Ofgem decided that it would be unwise to publicise this measure--which would in some cases effectively increase consumers' level of debt because they would consume extra energy which would need to be repaid--and so the advance publicity before the holiday period merely encouraged customers to ensure that they had sufficient prepaid credit to get through the holiday, and advised them of the availability of charging points over the period.
<P>

<a name="00404w05.html_para0">In the event, a relatively small number of customers used a significant amount of emergency credit, such that some of the money they spent after the holiday to recharge payment cards was taken up in repaying this emergency credit rather than providing new supply. This may have come as a surprise to some customers--although the information displays on the meters would have warned them of the increased emergency credit level; and they were not obliged to use it.
<P>

<a name="00404w05.html_para1">The need to ensure continuing energy supplies to vulnerable consumers over the long Christmas 1999/ Millennium holiday period was very much a "one-off" problem, and the extension of emergency credit was designed to resolve any potential difficulties arising from it. The level of emergency credit has now reverted to the pre-holiday norm. Ofgem will ensure that if such a measure should be needed again, there will be a more proactive campaign of informing customers of the change.

 As the Government made clear in their October 1998 Energy Sources White Paper, the stricter consents policy is a temporary measure to protect diversity and security of supply while distortions in the electricity market are removed. The Director General of Electricity Supply is keeping my Department informed of progress in addressing the competition issues and the Government expect that the policy will be relaxed as soon as they conclude, on the basis of that advice, that the reform programme is under way and the distortions removed.

Where systems cannot be funded entirely from local sources or by the private sector, promoters must demonstrate that their scheme provides good value for money, forms an essential part of a local transport plan, and that the objectives of that plan cannot be met in better ways.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what assessment he has made of the extra congestion which will be created by greenfield development in areas without developed transport links in the next 10 years.  [116177]<P>

<P>
<a name="00404w08.html_spnew11"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 In drawing up their regional transport strategies and local transport plans, local authorities will wish to take full account of the distribution of housing development. Planning Policy Guidance note 3, "Housing", provides that local planning authorities should seek to exploit opportunities to locate larger housing developments around major nodes along good quality public transport corridors.
<P>

<a name="00404w08.html_para2">Authorities should also seek to ensure that all housing developments are accessible by a range of non-car modes, and draft PPG13, "Transport", proposes that all major development proposals should be supported by a transport assessment.

 In the Budget, the Government announced a total of &#163;210 million of new funding to encourage innovation, enterprise and the use of IT by businesses. This includes &#163;50 million new funding over the next two financial years for the Regional Development Agencies to support their plans for developing clusters and business incubation. This is in addition to the &#163;4 million RDAs will receive in 2000-01 from the Competitiveness Development Fund to spend on priorities they identify for increasing competitiveness in their regions.

An additional &#163;60 million package will promote use of electronic commerce by small firms and a 100 per cent. tax allowance will be made available for small firms buying information and communications technology equipment. A new research and development tax credit will encourage R&D by small and medium sized companies.

agreement, with particular reference to employees currently being transferred to Severn Trent plc; if the Government will ensure that employees are offered a bulk transfer of past service rights from the Local Government Pension Scheme to the new employer's pension scheme; and if it will amend the LGPS Regulations urgently to permit an agreement enabling staff to remain in the LGPS.  [117601]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00404w09.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 The Local Government Pension Scheme Regulations 1997 allow bulk transfers of pension rights to be negotiated between local authority employers and private sector employers following any transfer of an undertaking. Within these provisions, the onus to ensure fairness and the protection of employees' pension rights rests with the appropriate employers involved in any transfer.
<P>

<a name="00404w09.html_para3">The extent to which employees in local authorities work on the delivery of privatised water company services through agency agreements, and the availability of alternative broadly comparable pension arrangements to those employed under them, is being established with the co-operation of the Local Government Pension Committee of the Employers' Organisation. In the light of that survey, I will consider carefully the need for any amendments to the Scheme Regulations.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what guidance his Department gives to local authority environmental health officers about dealing with householders whose homes have high levels of radon.  [117155]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00404w10.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 My Department is in regular contact with local authority environmental health officers (EHOs) in the areas most affected by radon. We advise that they should encourage householders with high levels of radon in their homes to carry out remedial measures to reduce the concentration of radon to which those householders are exposed.
<P>

<a name="00404w10.html_para0">In order to assist the EHOs and the householders, maps have been produced showing the areas most affected by radon. Three guidance booklets have been produced:

This guidance is supported by two telephone hotlines: one to the National Radiological Protection Board, who give advice on radon measurements and on the health effects of radon; and one to the Building Research Establishment, who give advice on radon remedial measures. These hotlines are provided for the benefit of EHOs as well as householders.
<P>

<a name="00404w10.html_para5">For over a year, my Department has been working in partnership with three local authorities that have been piloting a new approach to encourage householders to carry out remedial action. A Good Practice Guide is in preparation, and proposals on how we shall work with other local authorities in a similar way in the future are being developed. I hope to make an announcement on these shortly.

<P>

<a name="00404w10.html_para6">The Government's Farm Scale Evaluations programme, which I announced on 17 March, is designed to allow independent researchers to see what effect the growing and management of certain herbicide tolerant GM crops might have on farmland wildlife, compared with equivalent non-GM crops. The programme this year will involve up to 80 field sites.
<P>

<a name="00404w10.html_para7">Up to 12 public meetings will be held in towns near the trial sites, at which officials from my Department and representatives from the independent researchers, the industry body, SCIMAC, and a representative from an environmental group, will give presentations about the Farm Scale Evaluations programme and answer questions.

 I am pleased to announce that this week the first pilot of the quality mark scheme--in Birmingham--is being opened to builders who want to join. A list of approved builders will be available to consumers in the city later in the summer. The pilots in Birmingham and, later, Somerset are a key stage in testing and developing the scheme. Once we have extracted the lessons from them we will review the quality mark and then roll it out across the country.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00404w10.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 I have arranged for the Secretary of State's power to take decisions on water abstraction and impounding appeals, under section 43 of the Water Resources Act 1991, to be exercised by the Planning Inspectorate. This came into effect on 1 April 2000. All decisions will be taken by Inspectors on behalf of the Secretary of State, except in rare cases of major importance or difficulty where the Secretary of State may recover the case to determine himself. The Planning Inspectorate will shortly issue guidance for use by potential appellants.

 As part of the establishment of the Greater London Authority under the GLA Act 1999, the London Research Centre (LRC), the London Planning Advisory Committee (LPAC) and London Ecology Committee (LEC) were abolished on 1 April 2000. At the same time, the appropriate property, rights and liabilities of the three bodies were transferred by means of transfer schemes to the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions. The intention is that these will transfer to the Greater London Authority on 8 May 2000, with the exception of a small number of functions of the LRC which will transfer to Transport for London on 3 July 2000.
<P>

<a name="00404w10.html_para8">I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the very valuable work which the LRC, LPAC and LEC have each undertaken on a wide range of cross-London subjects, since their establishment. I am confident that this tradition will be carried on by the Greater London Authority itself in the future.

<P>
<a name="00404w10.html_wqn5"><B> Dr. Tonge: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what representations he has received concerning the re-opening of trade in turtle shells.  [116490]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00404w10.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 Cuba has submitted two proposals to the forthcoming Conference of Parties to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). The first seeks to transfer the Cuban part of the Caribbean population of Hawksbill turtles from Appendix I to Appendix II in order to allow the export of existing shell stocks and a subsequent quota of up to 500 turtle shells per year. The second seeks agreement to allow a one-off shipment of existing stocks of shell with no subsequent annual quota.
<P>

<a name="00404w10.html_para9">Several organisations and scientific bodies have provided us with their views. Some believe that populations of Hawksbill turtles remain too vulnerable to allow any international trade. Others consider that carefully managed trade would contribute to species conservation. We have also received a large number of campaign postcards opposing the Cuban proposals.
<P>

<a name="00404w10.html_para10">The European Union looks set to oppose the first proposal but to keep an open position on the second pending further consideration at the Conference. The United Kingdom will continue to argue that international trade quotas should be contemplated only in the context of wider action to secure the future of marine turtles by countering threats from fisheries by-catch and the destruction of nesting and breeding sites.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00404w10.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 Comprehensive data on disruptive incidents occurring on UK airlines have been collected only since April 1999. When initiating the reporting scheme my Department and the CAA undertook to respect the confidentiality of airlines submitting commercially sensitive information. The analysis published in February, therefore, does not include any data that could identify a specific carrier or aircraft type. The data collected show that, in the period April to October 1999, 47 incidents involved first or business class passengers.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00404w11.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 During 1997-98 and 1998-99 an estimated 36,160 new dwellings and housing units were completed or facilitated with support from my Department's regeneration programmes. Figures for affordable housing are not recorded separately and the full impact of regeneration schemes on new housing is not available.
<P>

<a name="00404w11.html_para0">Early evaluation evidence suggests that, overall, the Single Regeneration Budget is cost effective, taking account of the severity of problems in partnership areas. Also an interim evaluation of English Partnerships acknowledged its significant achievements, often working closely with the Housing Corporation, in facilitating housing, predominantly on brownfield sites.
<P>

<a name="00404w11.html_para1">The recent revision of Planning Policy Guidance note 3 (PPG3) on housing reaffirms our policy that a community's need for a mix of housing types, including affordable housing, is a material planning consideration which local planning authorities should take into account.

<a name="00404w12.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Mitchell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions when EU legislation relating to the use of lorries weighing up to 44 tonnes came into force; and what studies have been undertaken by his Department into the effect of such legislation on the transport of freight by rail.  [116860]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00404w12.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 My right hon. and noble Friend the Minister for Transport recently announced the Government's decision to set a target date of 1 January 2001 for raising the maximum general lorry weight limit to 44 tonnes for lorries with six axles, a maximum drive axle weight of 10.5 tonnes and Euro II or better engines. This is not connected with EU legislation. The decision follows the publication of an interim report by the Commission for Integrated Transport (CfIT) on permitting the general use of 44 tonne lorries. CfIT commissioned independent work from Professor Alan McKinnon of Heriot-Watt University to assess the environmental effects including the possible effects on rail freight. This work showed a clear net environmental gain from allowing 44 tonne lorries.
<P>

<a name="00404w12.html_para0">The Integrated Transport White Paper set out our aim to establish an integrated, sustainable freight distribution system to support economic growth and to bring social and environmental benefits. To that end we are keen to support rail freight where it is practicable and good value for money. We are equally keen on improvements to efficiency in other modes, including road transport, where these meet the same ends.
<P>

<a name="00404w12.html_para1">The Government accept CfIT's view that allowing 44 tonne lorries for general use could have a negative effect upon rail freight traffic, both existing and predicted. The shadow SRA are considering proposals for rail freight and their strategy will include proposals to support rail freight.
<P>

<P>
<a name="00404w12.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Mitchell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions, pursuant to the answer of 22 March 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 544W, concerning airport slots, on what date decisions on slot allocation became the sole responsibility of an independent co-ordinator; what is the name of the co-ordinator; where his office is located; what European legislation governs his independence other than EEC Regulation 95/93; and if his decisions on slots apply to internal and international aircraft movements.  [116834]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00404w12.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 The UK Airports Slot Allocation Regulations 1993 came into force on 12 May 1993. Among other things, they provided for Airport Co-ordination Ltd. (ACL), which had been performing the co-ordination role at several airports including Heathrow on a non-statutory basis before that date, to be approved and appointed as co-ordinator in accordance with 



<P>
<P><I>4 Apr 2000 : Column: 428W</I><P>
EC Regulation 95-93. The appointment was subsequently reaffirmed following consultation with air carriers and other interested parties, as required by Article 4(1) of EC 95/93. ACL's Managing Director is Peter Morrisroe OBE; its principal office is in Bath Road, near Heathrow. There is no relevant legislation other than EC 95/93 that relates to the independence of the co-ordinator. His decisions apply to both internal and international traffic.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what assessment he has made of the impact on demand for housing as a result of the expected increase in the number of single parent families in the South-East; and what steps he is taking to help ensure this demand is met.  [116752]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00404w12.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 The latest household projections indicate that around 2 per cent. of the net increase in the number of households likely to form in the South-East between 1996 and 2021 will be lone parent households. PPG3 encourages local authorities and housebuilders to ensure that the additional dwellings to be provided in the region offer greater choice and affordability for all households.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what steps he is taking to ensure that sufficient affordable housing is available to meet the demand in the South East.  [116753]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00404w12.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 Draft Regional Planning Guidance 9 (Proposed Changes) sets out a new approach to meeting housing needs in the South East. It emphasises the need for local authorities to undertake rigorous assessments of housing need to ensure that sufficient affordable homes are provided. Housing capital allocations to local authorities in the South East for 2000-01 total &#163;187 million, over &#163;50 million up on 1999-2000 and these increased resources will allow authorities to support the provision of more new affordable housing where this is a local priority. This is in addition to the resources for new affordable housing provided directly to registered social landlords by the Housing Corporation (&#163;70 million in 2000-01).

<P>
<P>
<a name="00404w12.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 The site of the Millennium Dome has been decontaminated for its current purpose. It is intended that the Dome remains and is not redeveloped for housing. However, while the standard of remediation would not necessarily be sufficient to allow houses with gardens to be built on the site, the exact nature of the remediation that would be necessary could be determined only once the exact details of any development were known. This has been the philosophy throughout the remediation of the whole of the Greenwich Peninsula.

<a name="00404w12.html_para3">The Government's general policy on telecommunications is to facilitate the growth of new and existing telecommunications systems while keeping environmental impact to a minimum. The planning system is the mechanism for achieving that balance.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what regulations govern the number of passenger seats that can be accommodated in a civil aircraft.  [117228]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00404w13.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 The maximum seating capacity of any large passenger aircraft is determined by the aircraft certification standards. Annexe 8 to the Chicago Convention requires that an aircraft may be issued with a Certificate of Airworthiness only if it complies with a comprehensive and detailed airworthiness code established by the State of Registry. Within Europe, the Joint Aviation Authorities agree harmonised aviation safety standards, including airworthiness codes, for their 32 member states. The JAA airworthiness code for new types of large passenger aircraft is contained in Joint Airworthiness Requirement 25, which has also been adopted as the EC standard by Council Regulation 3922/92. JAR 25 requires that in an emergency an aircraft in maximum seating configuration must be capable of being evacuated within 90 seconds.
<P>

<a name="00404w13.html_para1">The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) has also set minimum requirements relating to the spacing of passenger seats for aircraft on the UK register. This is because, in the event of an emergency, it is one of a number of factors which can have an effect upon the evacuation of an aircraft. The minimum requirements are contained in Airworthiness Notice 64.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00404w13.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 There are already some planning controls over external lighting. Where development proposals require a planning application, the local planning authority can control the lighting installations by imposing conditions to prevent or minimise light pollution. However, the courts have ruled that light itself is not development as understood in planning law, so the creation or use of light in itself does not require planning permission. In 1997, we issued "Lighting in the Countryside: Towards Good Practice" which is also applicable in towns. In our view, such guidance represents the best way forward and we are not proposing to introduce further legislation in this area.

 Although light is not a specified statutory nuisance it may be considered as a nuisance in cases where intrusive lighting is so severe as to be prejudicial to health. It is for a local authority environmental health officer to decide whether there is a "statutory nuisance" occurring in a particular situation.

<P>
<a name="00404w13.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Hill </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 30 March 2000]:</i> Vehicle Excise Duty (VED) is a matter for the Chancellor of the Exchequer. In his 1999 Budget, the Chancellor made clear that a high VED rate had been set for the new 40-tonne, 5-axle vehicle first allowed in the UK from 1 January 1999 in order to discourage its use on UK roads. This was in view of the significant extra road damage caused by lorries running these new 11.5 tonne axle weights.
<P>

<a name="00404w13.html_para2">The Changes the Chancellor made to VED rates for goods vehicles in his recent Budget and the reasons for them are explained in paragraphs 6.69 to 6.72 of the Economic and Fiscal Strategy Report, published on 21 March 2000. The VED rate of &#163;5,750 set for the new, road-damaging 40-tonne lorry on 5-axles in Budget 99 has successfully discouraged its use by domestic hauliers. However, now that domestic hauliers who need the highest weight limits have the option to use the less damaging 6-axle 44-tonne lorry within the UK, the only UK hauliers who still need to use the 40-tonne lorry are international operators using continental roads with 40-tonne lorry weight limits.
<P>

<a name="00404w13.html_para3">To boost the competitiveness of these international hauliers, the Government are cutting the VED rate for the 40-tonne lorry on 5-axles from &#163;5,750 to &#163;3,950. The rate for the less road-damaging 38-tonne lorry on 5-axles will be reduced by &#163;500 to encourage its continued use, and there will also be a reduction of &#163;500 for the lorry typically used to collect freight from UK ports to boost the competitiveness of hauliers in this sector.
<P>

<a name="00404w13.html_para4">The Government will continue to monitor trends in vehicle purchasing and plating decisions and in volumes of road haulage movements, while a sub-group of the Road Haulage Forum will continue to review the costs which different lorry types impose on the environment and the roads. This work will inform the Chancellor's future decisions on VED rates for goods vehicles.

One licence issued after 5 September 1998 was varied on 21 October 1999 to remove authority for the test. Subsequently, a review of all existing licences identified a further 13 currently containing authority for the test. Of these, 11 have now been varied to remove that authority. A final decision has not yet been made on the two remaining licences pending consideration of representations from the licensees under section 12 of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986.

 The Immigration and Nationality Directorate's Ministerial Correspondence Unit is currently dealing with letters from hon. Members received in December, the earliest being 17 December. We are aware, however, that there are some older cases within the system elsewhere in the Integrated Casework Directorate and our aim is to clear this backlog within the next few months.

 The allegations of abuse raised by the Howard League for Penal Reform give no details as to time, date or place of alleged incidents of abuse and do not identify victims, witnesses or alleged assailants. The Director General of the Prison Service has made it clear that he regards the allegations as serious, and he has twice asked the Howard League to provide this information, without which no investigation is possible. No further details have been received.

He was aware of the allegations before starting his inspection. He has raised a number of serious criticisms which are being addressed, but he did not report any evidence of the abuse of prisoners.

<a name="00404w16.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 Under the Police and Magistrates' Courts Act 1994, which was passed by the previous Government, it is for individual chief constables to determine the number of police officers in their force within the resources that are available. The Lancashire Constabulary does not have a target establishment. I understand from the Chief Constable that there were the full-time equivalent of 3,224 police officers available for ordinary duty in the Lancashire Constabulary on 31 March 2000.
<P>

<a name="00404w16.html_para0">She has also told me that as at 30 March 2000, 178 police officers were recorded by the Constabulary as absent from duty through sickness and 34 officers had formal restrictions placed upon the range of duties they are physically or psychologically able to perform. This latter figure does not include temporary arrangements made locally within the force as and when required.

 <i>[holding answer 3 April 2000]:</i> There are currently empty properties at nine sites on the non-prison Home Office estate.

 As of 29 March 2000, 18,938 offenders have been placed on the Home Detention Curfew scheme. The Prison Service has been notified of 190 offenders who have been charged with an offence committed while subject to the scheme. A breakdown of the types of offences committed is shown in the table. This breakdown has been prepared from information supplied by police forces and drawn from the police national computer. Further analysis of re-offending by those subject to the Home Detention Curfew scheme, including procedures for notification of further charges to the Prison Service by the police, is currently under way as part of a long-term evaluation of the scheme.

 We have introduced a three-year pilot scheme in the London Boroughs of Croydon, Newham and Haringey. Its aim is to test whether financial incentives can encourage Housing Benefit recipients living in under-occupied social housing to move to smaller and cheaper accommodation.

<a name="00404w16.html_para2">Under the scheme tenants who move will be entitled to a lump sum payment of about half of the Housing Benefit savings that would be expected over three years from the lower rent. This gives them a financial interest in their rents, and an incentive to move somewhere cheaper. The scheme is entirely voluntary.

1. The source is Households Below Average Income (HBAI). Estimates for 1979 to 1993-94 are derived from the Family Expenditure Survey and these estimates, including the value of half average income, relate to the United Kingdom. Results for 1990-91, 1992-93 and 1993-94 are for two years combined. Estimates for 1994-95 to 1997-98 are taken from the Family Resources Survey (FRS) and the estimates, including the value of half average income, relate to Great Britain. FRS-based estimates use a slightly different definition of income; results are therefore not precisely comparable with those for years before 1994-95, but the results presented here are broadly comparable.<P>

2. All estimates are subject to sampling error and response biases, and small changes apparent in these tables may be influenced by these. Results for individual years may be sensitive to the precise way in which household incomes are adjusted for household size and composition; the picture of changes over time is generally not sensitive to this.<P>

3. Estimates are presented on household income both Before Housing Costs (BHC) and After Housing Costs (AHC) in line with HBAI conventions.<P>

4. Results in the tables 1 and 2 are rounded to the nearest 100,000. Results in the table are rounded to the nearest 50,000. <P>

<a name="00404w17.html_para8">Past changes in pensioner incomes reflect the fact that many pensioners have simply lost out on the opportunity to invest in a second pension. Our strategy for tomorrow's pensioners will provide the opportunity for all people of working age to build a second pension. We are also determined to provide security for all of today's pensioners. The minimum income guarantee provides that security for pensioners with low incomes and our national take-up programme will encourage those entitled to claim.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer how many people in employment face a marginal income tax rate of 10 per cent; how many of those are <i>(a)</i> in part-time employment and <i>(b)</i> women; and if he will make a statement.  [117411]<P>

 In 2000-01, there are estimated to be around 1.6 million employees who have a marginal income tax rate of 10 per cent. Of those, 1.4 million people are in part-time employment. 1.1 million women in employment have a 10 per cent. marginal rate of income tax (around 70 per cent. of the women will also be included in the part-time figure).

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what <i>(a)</i> remuneration, <i>(b)</i> fee and <i>(c)</i> expenses were paid out of public funds to Mr. Martin Taylor for his report on the Government's strategy to combat tobacco smuggling.  [117649]<P>

 Martin Taylor received no remuneration or fees for his work. No out-of-pocket expenses were paid directly to Martin Taylor. The cost of train tickets for travel to and from meetings outside London were met by Customs and Excise.

<P>
<a name="00404w20.html_wqn12"><B> Mrs. Lait: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what the report by Martin Taylor on the Government's strategy to combat tobacco smuggling concluded about <i>(a)</i> the significance of the difference in the levels of tobacco taxation between the United Kingdom and other nations and <i>(b)</i> the likelihood, without a closer alignment of national tobacco tax levels, of other measures to combat smuggling having a substantial effect.  [117505]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00404w20.html_spnew12"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 Martin Taylor's advice to the Chancellor was personal and confidential. It would therefore not be appropriate to disclose his advice.
<P>

<a name="00404w20.html_para4">The Government paper "Tackling Tobacco Smuggling" dated March 2000, sets out details of recommendations made by Martin Taylor on how to tackle tobacco smuggling. A copy of the paper has been placed in the Library. In this paper it was noted that a very substantial proportion of cigarettes smuggled into the UK come from places outside the EU where duty is negligible. Bringing cigarette duty rates closer to those of other EU member states would be unlikely to deter this smuggling.

 Following the March Budget, I announced a further &#163;209 million for Customs to clamp down on excise smuggling. This will enable them to employ nearly 1,000 extra Customs officers, working at ports and inland, including additional special investigators and intelligence staff.

<P>
<a name="00404w21.html_spnew1"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 I can confirm that Customs do already provide the same information on importation procedures to both independent importers and major car manufacturers and suppliers alike. Full details are contained in their public notices and integrated Tariff. UK and EC law however precludes Customs from disclosing to third parties any confidential information which they hold in relation to a trader's business.
