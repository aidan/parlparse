<P>
<a name="30303w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Alexander: </B> 
 A copy of the current Central Office of Information (COI) Service Delivery Agreement (SDA), which was published as part of the Spending Review 2000, is already available from the House Libraries and on-line at the COI's website:.http://www.coi.gov.uk/aboutus/sda.html
<P>

<a name="30303w01.html_para0">However, the COI is currently in the process of revising its Framework Document and preparing its Annual Business Plan for 2003&#150;04. It is anticipated that the COI will announce and publish its revised Service Delivery Agreement (SDA) at the same time as announcing its annual performance targets to Parliament.
<P>

<a name="30303w01.html_para1">The current timetable for the COI to publish its annually agreed external performance targets, which will be done by means of a Written Ministerial Statement, is April 2003. Copies of these will then be placed in the Libraries of the House.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30303w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Burstow: </B> 
To ask the Minister for the Cabinet Office how many named day written questions were tabled to the Office between 15 October 2002 and 24 February 2003; how many that received a holding answer were given a substantive answer <i>(a)</i> within three days, <i>(b)</i> within seven days, <i>(c)</i> within 14 days,

<P>
<P>
<a name="30303w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Alexander: </B> 
 Seventy five named day questions were tabled to the Cabinet Office between 15 October 2002 and 24 February 2003, of these nine had holding replies. All were answered within three parliamentary sitting days.
<P>

<a name="30303w01.html_para2">Cabinet Office parliamentary questions are recorded on a parliamentary database, and progress of all parliamentary questions are monitored closely.
<P>

<a name="30303w01.html_para3">As far as ministerial correspondence is concerned, the Cabinet Office, on an annual basis, publishes a report to Parliament on performance of departments in replying to ministerial correspondence. The Report for 2001 was published on 24 May 2002, column 674W. The Report for 2002 will be published in due course.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30303w01.html_wqn3"><B> Ms Atherton: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what plans there are to appoint an independent regulator to oversee the interests of inland waterway users.  [100206]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30303w01.html_spnew3"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 I am not convinced of the need for a regulator. British Waterways and other navigation authorities are already subject to the general law against anti-competitive practice. I know that the Inland Waterways Association has written to British Waterways suggesting that it would be preferable to set up a new appeal procedure to deal with waterway managers' decisions. I understand that British Waterways is willing to consider this suggestion and I think that it should be fully explored. It may be possible to extend any agreed arrangements to other navigation authorities.

[99308]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30303w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The number of confirmed incidents of bovine tuberculosis in <i>(a)</i> Montgomeryshire and <i>(b)</i> Brecon and Radnorshire, broken down as requested is shown in the table.
<P>

<a name="30303w01.html_para4">Care must be taken in making comparisons with previous years' figures. The disruption to the TB programme caused by FMD, and the rolling nature of the testing programme means that we are now effectively catching up on two years' testing. Clearance of overdue testing has been targeted on those herds at higher risk first, therefore it will not be possible to interpret the data properly until the testing backlog has been cleared.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30303w01.html_wqn5"><B> Norman Baker: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs how many incidents of diffuse pollution have been recorded in each year since 1997; and how many resulted in <i>(a)</i> prosecutions and <i>(b)</i> fines.  [99250]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30303w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 In its records of pollution incidents, the Environment Agency has identified 4,779 incidents since 1999 where urban or rural land run-off was the likely cause and which have been attributed to diffuse sources.
<P>

<a name="30303w01.html_para5">However, by its very nature diffuse pollution often does not manifest itself as an identifiable incident. Much diffuse pollution occurs through repeated low level leaching of pollutants from land or run-off from surfaces that has a cumulative impact on water quality. So, records of pollution incidents only pick up a small part of the problem of diffuse pollution.
<P>

<a name="30303w01.html_para6">It has not proved possible to collate any information on prosecutions and fines in relation to diffuse pollution for this answer.
<P>

<a name="30303w01.html_para7">Most current legislation relating to water pollution is addressed at point sources, such as discharges of industrial effluent or specific pollution incidents, and was not designed to prevent or control more gradual diffuse pollution. This is why the Government have proposed the creation of a new statutory power to prevent and control diffuse pollution as part of action to transpose the provisions of the water framework directive into domestic legislation. This proposal was included in the "Second Consultation Paper on the Implementation of the EC Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC)", published in October 2002.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30303w01.html_wqn6"><B> Norman Baker: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what changes have taken place or are planned related to tracing the sources of diffuse pollution.  [99251]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30303w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 In the past tracing sources of diffuse water pollution has been done as part of catchment campaigns by the Environment Agency to improve compliance with river quality objectives. Such campaigns have been run in various catchments across the country.
<P>

<a name="30303w01.html_para8">As part of action to implement the water framework directive, a more comprehensive approach will be required. The directive requires that reviews are undertaken of the impact of human activity on the 



<P>
<P><I>3 Mar 2003 : Column 778W</I><P>
status of surface waters and on groundwater, including the identification of significant diffuse source pollution. The Government have proposed that a specific duty should be placed on the Environment Agency to carry out such reviews. This proposal is set out in the "Second Consultation Paper on the Implementation of the EC Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC)", published in October 2002.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what her estimate is of the number of households using water filter devices for providing drinking water in the UK in each year since 1992.  [99231]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30303w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr Morley: </B> 
 The Department has no direct responsibility for domestic water filters and does not compile or keep records of numbers of users or of sales. Based on information that British water has provided, however, a best available estimated figure for annual sales of plumbed-in water filters is between 20,000&#150;25,000 during the period 1991&#150;2001.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment she has made of the implications for the environment of adding fluoride to drinking water.  [99203]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30303w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 A review of the effect of fluoride on a range of aquatic life was carried out for the Environment Agency when deriving a non-statutory environmental quality standard (EQS) for fluoride in water, which was published in 2000. The review drew on research carried out by a range of recognised scientific laboratories and available data indicated that effects on aquatic life from fluoride occur at concentrations between 9.0&#151;350mg/l. Where fluoridation schemes are in place, fluoride is added to maintain a concentration of 1.0 mg/l in drinking water which is well below these levels. Any discharges will be further diluted upon entry to the aquatic environment through the process of collection and treatment of waste water.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30303w02.html_wqn1"><B> Norman Baker: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs how many foxhound packs there are in England and Wales; and how many hunts have taken place in each of the last five years.  [100361]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30303w02.html_spnew1"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 According to the Report of the Committee of Inquiry into Hunting with Dogs in England and Wales (The Burns Report), published in June 2000, there were 175 foxhunting packs registered with the Masters of Foxhounds Association in England and Wales. There were also nine fell packs registered with, or affiliated to, the Central Committee of Fell Packs. In addition, there were seven packs of harriers, registered with the Association of Masters of Harriers and Beagles which mainly hunt foxes. There were also another two harrier packs which were registered to hunt foxes.
<P>

<a name="30303w02.html_para1">The position in Wales was found to be less clear. There were 48 foxhunting packs registered with the Federation of Welsh Packs which included 27 Welsh based packs affiliated to the Masters of Foxhounds Association, and 30 registered with the Welsh Farmers' Fox Control Association. At the time of publication of the Burns Report these two bodies had been formed fairly recently and represented only a proportion of the total number of packs in Wales. Some estimates put the number of unregistered packs in Wales at two or three times those of registered packs (Burns, paragraphs 2.10&#150;2.11).
<P>

<a name="30303w02.html_para2">The Burns Report stated that there was a total of some 15,000 meets per season (paragraph 2.12). This figure would have been significantly less in 2001 when all hunting was suspended in England and Wales due to the outbreak of foot and mouth disease.

[98372]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30303w02.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Government have made available a total of &#163;25 million over the next three financial years to tackle illegal imports from outside the European Union of any meat, other animal products and plant products.

<P>

<a name="30303w02.html_para3">Action against illegal imports is not limited to substandard meat and bushmeat, nor will it be limited to ports and airports.

 The Environment Agency for England and Wales currently refers to its own non-statutory standards of 1 microgram per litre as an annual average, and 2.5 micrograms per litre as a maximum allowable concentration, for nonylphenol and octylphenol for the protection of the aquatic environment where appropriate for regulating discharges to water courses. These values were determined in relation to the substances' wider ecotoxicological impact, although data on their endocrine disrupting properties were taken into account.
<P>

<a name="30303w02.html_para5">Under the EU Community Strategy on Endocrine Disrupting Substances, and the Oslo Paris Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North East Atlantic (OSPAR), a number of potentially endocrine disrupting substances have been identified for which an assessment strategy is currently being developed.

Prosecutions may have been initiated in relation to substances which are potential endocrine disrupters but, owing to the large number of such substances and the level of uncertainty surrounding many of them, figures would be difficult to compile and would involve disproportionate cost.

<a name="30303w03.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Following 11 September 2001, when commercial insurance cover was partially withdrawn, the Government provided temporary third-party war risk insurance cover for UK airlines and other air service providers. Such intervention is a form of state aid and the terms upon which the UK, and other EU member states, assisted their aviation industry during the crisis was strictly regulated by the European Commission. The Government discontinued their support for third party war risk insurance on 31 October 2002, and we see no case for further intervention.

 Signs have been provided on the approaches to service areas on motorways to remind drivers of the need for regular breaks, because opportunities for drivers to stop on motorways are limited. This is not generally the case on all-purpose trunk roads.

One involves in-depth analysis of police fatal road accident reports that identify distraction as a possible contributory factor. A report is expected in the summer. The other involves on-the-spot studies of accidents in order to improve the understanding of the influences of human involvement, vehicle and highway design on accident causation and injury mechanisms. A database is expected to be available from the autumn.

 Network Rail advises that it is under no statutory duty to prevent the fouling of its structures by pigeons or other birds; and that it falls to the local highway authority to maintain the public footways and highways under the company's bridges. In specific cases of the establishment of a statutory nuisance under one of its bridges, the costs of pigeon proofing the structure and cleaning the public footway may be shared equally by agreement between Network Rail and the local authority. The company seeks to work with local authorities to tackle pigeon nuisance and to assess alternative pigeon deterrents to netting.

Epidemics can be devastating, sometimes flaring up to as many as 100,000 cases in a very short period of time. In the absence of mass vaccination, an epidemic can last for several months, draining enormous resources, overwhelming hospitals and disrupting routine care.

 Almost 3,300 Royal Navy and Royal Marines personnel were used on fire-fighting duties during the last fire-fighters strike.

 The decision was taken at the end of 2002. Our working assumption had been that some form of private sector involvement would be beneficial. A series of studies, however, demonstrated the absence of a private market for such a ship's facilities and also that a service-provision contract would be incompatible with the operational requirement.

 Recorded crime figures are generally collected by legal definitions. Recorded crimes involving domestic violence will be recorded in a range of offences, along with offences which have been committed in other circumstances. Numbers of offences involving domestic violence are therefore not available from recorded crime data.

<a name="30303w12.html_para7">The British Crime Survey (BCS) produced data by region for 2001/02, on the number of crimes of domestic violence recorded by the survey. However it does not provide information on domestic violence at a local level nor for individual police force areas.

The BCS figures are estimates only. They are derived from a sample and so are subject to sampling error. Also, the context of the face-to-face BCS interview means the estimates are certain to be underestimates of the true extent because some respondents may be unwilling to reveal experience of domestic violence to interviewers. Results from the 1996 BCS self-completion module on domestic violence were published in Home Office Research Study No. 191, deposited in the Library. This more confidential approach to measurement revealed that the proportion of women that were victims in the last year of domestic assault was over three times higher than in the main BCS.<P>

Details of homicides by constituency are not held centrally. The available information relates to currently recorded offences of homicide (murder, manslaughter and infanticide) where the relationship of the victim to the suspect includes current or former spouse, cohabitant or lover.

These sites have also been declared as Areas of Special Scientific Interest (ASSIs) under the Nature Conservation and Amenity Lands (Northern Ireland) Order (1985), with the exception of those sites, or parts thereof, which are subtidal. A full list of ASSIs is published on the website of the Environment and Heritage Service&#151;www.nics.gov.uk/ehs. As ASSIs are declared under domestic legislation, there is therefore no provision for their recognition by the European Union.

<P>
<a name="30303w16.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Browne: </B> 
 The Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety is considering the report of the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) carefully, together with the implications the report has for patients and users in both rural and urban areas, for the pharmacy profession and for Health Service policy as a whole.
<P>

<a name="30303w16.html_para0">The Department has invited views and is meeting key interests to hear their reactions to the report in order to help inform the Government response. As of 27 February, 14 written responses have been received. In addition, the Department sought the views of key interests, including community pharmacy, the Health Service, patient groups and the General Consumer Council, at a seminar on 20 February 2003. A written submission from the General Consumer Council is expected shortly.
<P>

<a name="30303w16.html_para1">The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry is responsible for co-ordinating a response across Government to reports of this type. Competition and consumer matters are reserved to the United Kingdom Government in Westminster. However, Health Service pharmacy policy is a devolved matter and the regulations imposing controls on pharmacies are a matter for Ministers in each country. They will consider and determine how they wish to respond. That will be reflected in the overall Government response. The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry is therefore working closely with Health Departments and other Government Departments to make sure that 



<P>
<P><I>3 Mar 2003 : Column 832W</I><P>
Government's response to the report takes account not only of competition and consumer interests, but wider public policy objectives.
<P>

<a name="30303w16.html_para2">In considering the OFT report and its recommendations, the Department will take fully into account the views of all interests. It is too early to say what further economic or other information might be required.

 Tax relief for work done to remove asbestos falls within the rules on relief for remediation of contaminated land. It is a general measure as it is available to all payers of Corporation tax and it is not therefore a state aid.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what the projected participation rates of people in the labour market are, given current trends, for the year 2012.  [100453]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30303w17.html_spnew10"><B> Ruth Kelly: </B> 
 The Government's projection framework goes up to 2006 and it does not forecast directly participation rates. However, the Treasury's trend output growth projections imply an estimated trend increase in the working age activity rate i.e. labour market participation rate of 0.1 percentage point a year up to Q4 2006. Further details are available in "Trend Growth: Recent Developments and Prospects", published by HM Treasury in April 2002.

As an indication of the number of people who have not claimed the relief but have subsequently claimed a repayment, the Inland Revenue currently processes around 300 claims for repayment per month.

 Precise figures are not available. But it is clear that Saddam Hussein's regime is responsible for many Iraqi civilian deaths. Amnesty International's report "Iraq: State cruelty: branding, amputation and the death penalty"&#151;April 1996, deplores "the disappearance or extrajudicial execution of hundreds of thousands of people&#151;including whole communities&#151;for political reasons, and the widespread use of the death penalty for numerous criminal and political offences after unfair trials. The Iraqi Government has sanctioned mass killings and torture as a matter of policy..." The testimonies of Iraqi exiles give credence to these and other similar reports.

 I am not aware of any guarantees given to the Kurdish administrations in Northern Iraq by Turkey. But the UK is committed to the maintenance of Iraq's sovereignty and territorial integrity within its current borders. The only secure long-term future for the Kurds and other minority groups in Northern Iraq is as part of a stable, peaceful Iraq, which gives them a negotiated degree of autonomy.

 We regularly discuss Iraq policy with out Iranian counterparts.

 In London, the average education formula spending share per primary pupil in 2003&#150;04 is &#163;2,733 and per secondary pupil is &#163;3,470.
<P>

<a name="30303w22.html_para0">Havering has the lowest EFSS per pupil in London. The main reason for this is that Havering benefits less overall than other London authorities from the top-ups in the funding formula to reflect the additional costs of educating deprived pupils, and the additional costs of recruiting and retaining staff in high-cost areas.
<P>

<a name="30303w22.html_para1">That is because, in London, only Richmond upon Thames has a lower proportion of deprived pupils than Havering. But Richmond upon Thames benefits more from the factor in the formula for area costs. The area cost adjustment for outer London authorities is split into east and west: wages in west London are generally higher than in east London so the ACA for west London is higher. Richmond upon Thames receives the (higher) ACA for outer London authorities in the west, and Havering receives the (lower) ACA for those in the east. The net effect is that Havering has a lower EFSS per pupil than Richmond upon Thames, and other London authorities.

 The Department considered a range of evidence including its own commissioned research into "Social Class and HE: Issues Affecting Decisions on Participation by Lower Social Class Groups" (published 2001), the HE extension of the Youth Cohort Study (still in progress) and preliminary results from its evaluation of the Excellence Challenge. The findings suggest that concern about debt is only one of the inhibitors on HE participation. Cultural, social and institutional influences and educational background are also important. The right kind of information is vital. Recent departmental research suggests also that the most common cause of non-completion of HE courses is poor choice of course rather than financial problems associated with participation.
<P>

<a name="30303w22.html_para2">In the light of this evidence we are introducing the measures set out in the White Paper, The Future of Higher Education, notably means tested higher education grants of up to &#163;1,000 per year and raising the loan repayment threshold from &#163;10,000 to &#163;15,000 from April 2005, but also the abolition of upfront tuition fees which were perceived as inhibiting access. In addition we are committed to improving our promotion, marketing and outreach to convince those from low income backgrounds that HE really is for them. We must also continue with our school reforms, particularly now at secondary level, to increase the number of young people with the right qualifications to benefit from higher education.

Additionally, loan support has been available to eligible students normally domiciled in the United Kingdom since 1990&#150;91 and information on the average amount of student loan is given in the table. However, because the rules for eligibility between maintenance grants and loans differ, and because the average 



maintenance data refer to students domiciled in England and Wales, whereas the average loans data refer to students domiciled in the United Kingdom, the two sets of data should not be added together.<P>

All four-year-olds have been able to access a free, part-time early education place since September 1998. Since September 1999, we have invested substantially in 



new free early years education places for three-year-olds. The table shows that the number of free early years education places taken up by three-year-olds increased from 214,200 in 1997 to 408,200 in 2002, an increase of 194,000 places. We are committed to providing all three-year-olds, whose parents want one, with free early years education places by April 2004.<P>

The latest figures on provision for three and four-year-olds were published in Statistical Bulletin 09/2002 "Provision For Children Under Five Years Of Age in England-January 2002", which is available from the Library or the Department's website www.dfes.gov.uk/statistics/.<P>

 Government support for capital investment in school buildings in England for 2002&#150;03 is &#163;3 billion; for Portsmouth the figure is &#163;4.25 million. We do not collect information on the split between new buildings and renovation. Looking to the future, I announced on 26 February proposals for a new approach to capital investment in a paper, "Building schools for the future". This will be a programme of rebuilding and renewal to ensure that secondary education in every part of England has facilities of 21st Century standard within 10 to 15 years from 2005&#150;06, subject to future public spending decisions. We will also aim to provide substantial investment in primary school buildings.

To be eligible for a homebuy loan, a potential purchaser must either be currently in social housing, or be on the housing waiting list and be recommended by the local authority as being in housing need.<P>

Information on the number of homebuy loans made to key workers is not collected. The starter home initiative is helping key workers into home ownership through equity loans based on the homebuy model and shared ownership schemes. To the end of January 2003 around 1,000 key workers in London had purchased homes with Starter Home Initiative assistance.<P>

<a name="30303w24.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 As announced by my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister on 5 February and published in "Sustainable Communities: building for the future", the Housing Corporation has agreed to lead a task force which will look at existing programmes that support sustainable home ownership. This will include both the shared ownership and homebuy schemes. The task force will examine the scope for better targeting and design of the current home ownership initiatives to ensure they are cost effective and that the home ownership is sustainable.

<a name="30303w25.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and local authority groups considered a range of indicators to reflect the costs of providing services to homeless people during the recent review of the Environmental, Protective and Cultural Services block formula. These costs vary significantly around the country and it is clear that they are related to the balance between demand and the supply of available housing in each area. However no workable formula to measure this balance or otherwise model homelessness expenditure was found. The EPCS formula has also to take account of a substantial number of other important services.
<P>

<a name="30303w25.html_para0">The new EPCS formula contains deprivation indicators that reflect the additional costs of provision across the full range of EPCS services.

 The Government are committed to the provision of social housing including sheltered accommodation and have substantially increased resources provided to local authorities and the Housing Corporation for housing investment. The Housing Corporation's Approved Development Programme (ADP) may be used to refurbish sheltered housing in the ownership of a Registered Social Landlord (RSL). Since 1999 the Housing Corporation has approved some &#163;22 million of ADP for sheltered housing accommodation schemes in respect of elderly people with warden support, and frail elderly people, improving 2,363 dwellings.

 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is providing &#163;250 million for the Starter Home Initiative (SHI) which aims to help around 10,000 key workers to buy their first homes. The assistance is primarily in the form of equity loans or shared ownership and is being administered by local scheme providers, mainly registered social landlords. The funding was allocated via two competitive bidding rounds.
<P>

<a name="30303w26.html_para5">In the first round, bids were invited to administer schemes to help key workers in any area where the high cost of housing was undermining recruitment and retention. The main factors taken into account in making allocations were: the relative need for SHI based on house prices, incomes and assessments of recruitment and retention difficulties for key worker groups in different areas; and the cost effectiveness of competing bids.
<P>

<a name="30303w26.html_para6">Second round bids were invited to help key workers in specific areas of the south east, eastern, south west and west Midlands regions. These areas were targeted taking into account recruitment and retention problems being experienced across different areas and the allocations made in round 1.

 There is no state retirement age, only an age at which state pension becomes payable, currently 60 for women and 65 for men. Between 2010 and 2020 the women's state pension age will be gradually increased to 65.
<P>

<a name="30303w27.html_para3">Figures that we published for spring 2002 showed that around 861,000 people over state pension age were in employment, 8.5 per cent. of the age group.
<P>

<a name="30303w27.html_para4">The New Deal 50 plus programme, which offers tailored help with jobsearch, and an Employment Credit and training grant, is open to people on qualifying benefits who are over 50. There is no upper age limit for eligibility to the programme, and people over the state pension age can take advantage of the help available.
<P>

<a name="30303w27.html_para5">We are encouraging people to adopt more flexible approaches to retirement. In "Simplicity, security and choice: Working and saving for retirement" (Cm 5677) published 17 December, we have proposed changes to Inland Revenue rules that will allow people to continue to work for their employer, or return to work for them, and draw their occupational pension at the same time.
<P>

<a name="30303w27.html_para6">To encourage more people to consider later retirement, we will bring forward the date of any increase to the increments people gain if they defer their state pension so that people can benefit from it as soon as possible.
<P>

<a name="30303w27.html_para7">To help people over state pension age to re-enter work we are promoting vigorously the benefits, to both employers and individuals, of an age diverse work force, including the recruitment and retention of older workers as part of our AgePositive campaign. In 2006 we will introduce legislation to make it unlawful to discriminate against people, on the grounds of age, in employment and vocational training. Under the legislation, compulsory retirement ages are likely to be unlawful, unless employers can objectively justify them.
<P>

<a name="30303w27.html_para8">The DWP has a programme of research designed to further understanding of the labour market participation of people over 50, in particular retirement behaviour and the barriers to work encountered by this age group. The research includes a project examining the circumstances under which people work after state pension age, the jobs they do, and the impact of working after state pension age on their health, wealth and happiness, compared with the non-working retired population. This research shows that 9 per cent. of women over 60 and 8 per cent. of men over 65 are in employment.
<P>

<a name="30303w27.html_para9">The report will be published in spring 2003 and will be followed by a second stage of qualitative work, which will explore, amongst other things, what would encourage people to stay in work after state pension age.

retirement ages and examine the case for allowing those who want to work on to age 65 to do so. Already 75 per cent. of civil servants now have the option to retire at 65 and the numbers able to serve beyond 60 are expected to increase.
<P>

<a name="30303w28.html_para0">All staff in the Department for Work and Pensions, below the Senior Civil Service, are able to choose to remain in employment beyond the age of 60 for any period of time up to the age of 65.
<P>

<a name="30303w28.html_para1">"Staff in the Senior Civil Service normally retire at the age of 60 but the Head of the Department and Agency Chief Executives have flexibility to retain members of the Senior Civil Service beyond age 60 if they judge it in the public interest and they are satisfied about the fitness and efficiency of the individual to carry out his or her duties. The most senior posts require written approval from the Head of the Home Civil Service to be retained for longer than three months beyond their 60th birthday."
<P>

<a name="30303w28.html_para2">This is based on an extract from the Civil Service Management Code.
<P>

<a name="30303w28.html_para3">Most public service pension schemes, however, still allow a normal pension to be taken at 60 or under. The Government is seeking views on the proposal that the rules of public service pension schemes should be changed and applied to all new members during the next few years to make an unreduced pension payable from age 65 rather than 60. Such a change would reflect improved longevity, modern working patterns and the practice in the majority of private sector pension schemes.

 Information on the numbers of admission to care homes for people over the age of 50 and 65 as a result of a fall are not collected centrally. The national service framework for older people recognises that injury resulting from a fall can be a major factor in premature admission to long-term residential care. It sets out a standard and milestones for the development of integrated falls services that cover prevention, effective treatment and care of those who have fallen and appropriate rehabilitation.

 On 7 February 2003, my right hon.

Roll-out plans include boosting national health service capacity and improving access for patients by extending public/private partnerships.
<P>

<a name="30303w29.html_para1">The pilot private sector projects in Shrewsbury and Leeds have now been evaluated. The results of the pilot show that private sector hearing aid dispensers can be contracted to fit, assess and follow-up NHS patients with no detriment to the outcome for these patients.
<P>

<a name="30303w29.html_para2">Private sector partners in Shrewsbury and Leeds provided hearing aids obtained via the NHS hearing aid contract for the NHS patients treated as part of the pilot. NHS patients were not charged for their treatment or for the hearing aids. We intend that these arrangements will apply to extended private sector partnership arrangements. There are no plans to give hearing aid dispensers access to the NHS hearing aid contract for their private patients. Hearing aid dispensers in Leeds and Shrewsbury received training to enable them to provide a modernised service to NHS patients, including fitting digital hearing aids. Dispensers involved in extended private partnerships arrangements will be required to meet similar standards of competence and experience.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health how many university students his Department and associated agencies have supported or sponsored with a work placement in the last year; what his policy is on work placements; what plans he has to develop such schemes; and what his policy is on paying their university fees.

 The Department supported nine undergraduate students in 2002&#150;03 through the Windsor Fellowship Organisation&#151;funded centrally. The Department only keeps records of centrally organised programmes and so there are no records held on ad-hoc work placement sponsorship. The information is shown in the table.

For the national health service, medical undergraduates undertake placements in a clinical setting during the third to fifth years of their degree courses. The Department reimburses NHS organisations for the additional costs they incur in providing such placements, of which there were 11,400 in 2001&#150;02.<P>

The NHS does not collect information on when NHS non-medical pre-registration students undertake their practice placements. As a general rule, NHS students are required to undertake practice placements which account for approximately 50 per cent. of the university course and these are unpaid.<P>

All pre-registration non-medical NHS students have their personal tuition fee met from departmental funds. Course tuition fees are also met by work force development confederations through the contracts they hold with universities.<P>

In the 2001&#150;02 financial year, the number of pre-registration nursing and midwifery students was 54,313 and the number of pre-registration allied health profession, dental hygienist and dental therapist students was 15,178.<P>
