<P>
<P>
<a name="10315w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Chope: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (1) what representations he has received on the draft European standard for air conditioning equipment (EN 378); and if he will make a statement;  [153619]
<P>
<UL>(2) on what date he proposes to withdraw the British Standard in respect of air conditioning equipment; and if he will make a statement on the regulation that will replace it;  [153620]
<P>

<P>
(4) what representations he has received on the continued use of hydrocarbons in air conditioning equipment; and if he will make a statement.  [153623]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10315w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Alan Johnson: </B> 
 EN 378 is a technical specification for refrigerating systems and heat pumps (which can be used in some air conditioning equipment), dealing with the safety and environmental aspects. The standard allows for hydrocarbons, which are flammable, being used as a refrigerant in certain circumstances instead of the usual hydrofluorocarbons, which are inert.
<P>

<a name="10315w01.html_para8">My Department received just one representation concerning the use of hydrocarbons as a refrigerant being included in this standard. However, responsibility for this standard, and resolving any technical issues concerned including safety ones, falls to the British Standards Institution (BSI), which is independent of Government.
<P>

<a name="10315w01.html_para9">BSI is the United Kingdom member of the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) which developed the European standard EN 378. It carries out, as part of its normal procedures, public consultations on draft ENs. Once a draft EN is adopted by CEN, the national standards bodies who are its members withdraw any conflicting national standards and publish the European one. In this instance, I understand that EN 378 was adopted by CEN last year and then published by BSI as BS EN 378.
<P>

<a name="10315w01.html_para10">Any technical questions relating to, or issues of interpretation of, the standard should therefore be taken up with BSI.

<P>
<a name="10315w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 There have been no individual import licences issued in respect of tear gas sprays and canisters (including CS gas) for import into the United Kingdom (including Northern Ireland) from the Irish Republic since 1997.
<P>

<a name="10315w01.html_para11">Imports of plastic baton rounds do not require an individual import licence. The transfer of these items is subject to the issue of a transfer document by the designated authority in the Irish Republic.
<P>

<a name="10315w01.html_para12">Seven licences have been issued for the importation into the United Kingdom from an EU member state for products that might fit the description "other riot control munitions". None of the licence holders is based in Northern Ireland.

[153514]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10315w01.html_spnew5"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 In 2000, one Standard Individual Export Licence was issued where the consignee was in the Irish Republic and the end-use destination was in another country. This covered goods controlled under the Export of Goods (Control) Order 1994 (the Military List) and rated ML6. ML6 covers ground vehicles and components thereof specifically designed or modified for military use. There were no such licences issued in 1999.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10315w01.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Corbyn: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry when the British Government issued an export licence to Royal Ordinance for the refurbishment of 30 105mm Moroccan guns in Western Sahara; who approved the export licence application for the refurbishment of 105mm Moroccan guns in Western Sahara; if Royal Ordinance (BAE Systems) completed the refurbishment of 105mm Moroccan guns in Western Sahara; what export licences have been approved for weapons or spares in Western Sahara since 1997; what export licence applications have been refused to Morocco since 1997; on what grounds they were refused; on what occasions the United Nations has been consulted about approving export licence applications to Morocco since 1997; and if the terms of the UN Peace Plan take primacy over the EU Code of Conduct for approving export licence applications to Morocco.  [150250]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10315w01.html_spnew6"><B> Dr. Howells </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 13 February 2001]:</i> On 12 July 1999 the DTI issued a standard individual export licence to Royal Ordnance to export equipment to Morocco for the refurbishment of guns. The licence was reported in the 1999 Annual Report on Strategic Export Controls.
<P>

<a name="10315w01.html_para13">All licences to export arms and other goods whose export is controlled for strategic reasons are issued by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry acting through DTI's Export Control Organisation (ECO). All relevant individual licence applications are circulated by the DTI to other Government Departments with an interest as determined by those Departments in line with their policy responsibilities. These include the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the Ministry of Defence and the Department for International Development.

<P>

<a name="10315w01.html_para14">While in general the ECO maintains records of licence applications, it does not in general compile records of actual shipments. Moreover, where the licence is for refurbishment, ECO does not monitor whether the refurbishment has been carried out.
<P>

<a name="10315w01.html_para15">The export of weapons and weapons spares are controlled under entries ML1, ML2, ML4, ML5, ML12, ML18, ML19, ML21, ML22, PL5002, PL5006, PL5017, PL5018 and PL5030 in the Export of Goods (Control) Order 1994 (the EG(C)O). The entry in the EG(C)O under which the export of goods is controlled is known as their rating. Details of export licensing decisions between 2 May 1997 and 31 December 1999 have been set out in the Government's Annual Reports on Strategic Export Controls copies of which are in the Library of the House. These Reports list by country of destination the export licences issued and refused in each equipment category and gives details of the military equipment for which licences have been granted. They also set out the value of defence exports to each country.
<P>

<a name="10315w01.html_para16">Between 1 January 2000 and 2 February 2001, six Standard Individual Export Licences (SIELs) and three Open Individual Export Licences (OIELs) were issued covering the export to consignees or end-users in Morocco of goods with the relevant ratings. Individual licences may cover a range of goods with various ratings. Where this is so, the licence is included in the total for all of the relevant ratings.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10315w02.html_spnew12"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 The Government have had ongoing discussions with EU member states and the European Commission on the 'Everything but Arms' initiative (EBA), culminating in the adoption of the Presidency compromise to the proposal on 26 February. Central to these discussions was consideration of the implications of these proposals for both UK sugar producers and ACP sugar exporters.
<P>

<a name="10315w02.html_para3">In these discussions, I made clear my belief that least developed countries are not in the position to export large amounts of sugar in the short term. Details of the final agreement are such that imports of sugar from LDCs will be limited by quotas until 2006. It is now up to the European Commission to bring forward amendments to its sugar reform proposals to achieve coherence with EBA. But since the main impact of the agreement will be deferred until 2006-09, the short-term implications for UK sugar producers are likely to be modest. The proposals will have a more immediate effect on non-LDC ACP countries who will face increasing displacement of some of their exports. The UK will work with the EU, multilateral and other donors to ensure that their adjustment needs are fully taken into account in assistance programmes.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence from what sources his Department acquired depleted uranium <i>(a)</i> materials, <i>(b)</i> components and <i>(c)</i> ammunition after 1992.  [153197]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10315w03.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Spellar </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 14 March 2001]:</i> The Ministry of Defence has made several acquisitions of equipment containing depleted uranium (DU) since 1992.
<P>

<a name="10315w03.html_para0">Two types of DU-based ammunition are in service with British Forces: the UK manufactured 120 mm anti-armour round and the US manufactured 20 mm RN Phalanx round.
<P>

<a name="10315w03.html_para1">Phalanx ammunition is sold to the UK via the US Department of Defense (DOD). All of DOD's DU comes from three US Department of Energy (DOE) gaseous diffusion plants: Paducah, Kentucky; Oak Ridge, Tennessee; and Portsmouth, Ohio.
<P>

<a name="10315w03.html_para2">Royal Ordnance, who manufacture the 120 mm anti- armour round, buy their DU from Starmet Corporation who in turn buy it from DOE. They have no practical way of determining exactly where the input material came from. They believe, however, that it was mostly from Paducah, Kentucky, but it was all produced at their plants at Concord and Barnwell in the US.
<P>

<a name="10315w03.html_para3">In 1998, Royal Hospital Haslar purchased equipment from ADAC Laboratories in which DU is used as a radiation shield. Hercules C-130J aircraft, which use DU as counter-balance weights in their Flight Control System, have been purchased from Lockheed Martin since 1992. In December 1993, the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency (DERA) acquired 2.5 tonnes of DU plate from AEA Technology, Harwell.
<P>

<a name="10315w03.html_para4">In April 1999, the Defence Radiology Protection Service, part of DERA, acquired 62 kg of DU from Royal Ordnance Speciality Materials, Wolverhampton for corrosion research. Most recently, in January 2001, three 30 mm A-10 rounds were brought back from Kosovo for research purposes.

 In reply to UK and EU representations the Israeli authorities have sought to justify their policies and actions. They have asserted that the continued closures and the practice of extra judicial killing are necessary for the protection of Israeli lives. We understand the importance of combating terrorism, but these sustained collective punishments radicalise the Palestinian population and fuel violence in the Occupied Territories. They cannot, therefore, achieve their stated purpose. We will press the new Israeli Government to end these practices and, as a specific first step, to resume the payment of revenues withheld from the Palestine Authority. We will also press the Palestinian leadership to restore security co-operation and make every effort in good faith to calm the violence.

<a name="10315w03.html_para5">The goods appear on the UK's Military List.

 The cost of establishing a home zone will vary greatly with the size of the zone and the extent of works involved. Information from the pilot projects now being monitored suggests that, in very preliminary estimates, it would be reasonable to use an indicative range of &#163;500-&#163;2,000 per household. But the costs of individual schemes could be slightly less or substantially more than these figures. These are early days, and we shall keep the estimates under review in the light of increasing experience.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what the estimated cost is of administering the Home Energy Efficiency Scheme in England in 2000-01; and what the average cost is of administration for each grant paid.  [153531]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10315w05.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The Home Energy Efficiency Scheme is managed by Eastern HEES Ltd. in the East of England, and by the Eaga Partnership in the rest of England. The two scheme managers are responsible for marketing the scheme to eligible households; carrying out independent surveys of properties; advising and agreeing with householders the most appropriate measures for their home; recruiting heating and insulation contractors through open competition; and managing payments to contractors for work completed.
<P>

<a name="10315w05.html_para1">The fees paid to the scheme managers consist of a fixed monthly element and a variable amount paid for each household where work has been completed and invoiced. In addition the Department paid start up costs of &#163;2,485,000 in the period between award of contract in March 2000 and the start of the new scheme on 1 June 2000.
<P>

<a name="10315w05.html_para2">Excluding these one-off costs, the total scheme management costs between 1 June 2000 and 31 March 2001 are estimated to be &#163;18,906,000 (excluding VAT). This is based on the 134,555 households for whom work orders have been placed with installers during the year. This equates to an average cost per household of &#163;141.
<P>

<a name="10315w05.html_para3">This estimate does not allow for profit clawback clause included within the contract with the Eaga Partnership, and the not-for-profit basis of Eastern HEES. These two factors will reduce the actual fees paid by the Department this year.
<P>

<a name="10315w05.html_para4">The average cost per household figure reflects the relatively slow start to the scheme during the period June-August 2000. The coming financial year will represent the first full year of operation for the new scheme. The total number of homes improved is expected to increase substantially, thereby reducing the average cost per household.

<P>
<a name="10315w05.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 There are no plans to abolish the three yearly driving licence renewal fee for the over-70s. Fees are required to cover the costs of issuing licences. Abolishing the fee for renewing licences from age 70 would result in an unacceptable level of cross-subsidisation, which would have to be borne by other drivers through the fees they pay.
<P>

<a name="10315w05.html_para5">The fee was reduced from &#163;8.50 to &#163;6.00 in November last year, returning it to its 1992 level. A consultation document issued in February this year proposes a freeze in the over-70s licence renewal fee.

 As announced in Spending Review 2000, an extra &#163;1.8 million is being provided in grant for home improvement agencies from 2001-02, bringing the total grant to &#163;8.5 million a year. Local authorities are being notified of their allocations today.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer, pursuant to his oral statement of 7 March 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 295-308, if he will estimate the revenue from a 1p increase in the basic rate of income tax <i>(a)</i> in the first year and <i>(b)</i> in the three subsequent years.  [153716]<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="10315w06.html_spnew6"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 Consistent with the assumptions of the March 2001 Budget forecast, the net revenue yield from reintroducing indexation and abolishing taper is estimated to be &#163;450 million for the first year, or &#163;400 million if retirement relief were reinstated also, most of which would be received in the following year. Further information in the form requested on the yield for subsequent years can be provided only at disproportionate cost.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10315w06.html_spnew10"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 Estimates of the number of families in Islington in receipt of the Working Families Tax Credit (WFTC) at May 2000 and August 2000 are shown in the WFTC Quarterly Enquiries for those months, copies of which are in the Library. These estimates are based on 5 per cent. samples of awards, and are subject to sampling error. The publications explain that care should be taken when making comparisons over time at this level of detail.
<P>

<a name="10315w06.html_para6">The average value of WFTC awards paid to families with such awards in London at August 2000 was &#163;80 per week. There are too few cases in the 5 per cent. sample to yield a reliable separate estimate for Islington.

<P>
<a name="10315w07.html_spnew6"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 Walthamstow, along with the rest of the United Kingdom, is benefiting from the long-term action we have taken to build economic stability and secure high and stable levels of growth and employment. Since the General Election, claimant unemployment in the constituency has fallen by 1,864, or 41 per cent., youth unemployment is down by 83 per cent. and long-term unemployment has fallen by 70 per cent.
<P>

<a name="10315w07.html_para3">Macroeconomic stability is being complemented at the microeconomic level by the Government's policies to ease the transition from welfare into work and to make work pay. To the end of December 2000, the New Deal for 18-24 year olds had helped 1,475 young people in Walthamstow constituency gain valuable skills and experience 585 (40 per cent.) of whom had moved into employment. The Working Families Tax Credit (WFTC), introduced in October 1999, is helping to make work pay for low and middle-income families. In August 2000, 1,300 families in Walthamstow constituency were benefiting from WFTC.
<P>

<a name="10315w07.html_para4">The Government are also committed to policies which enable pensioners to share in the country's rising prosperity. All pensioners, including 11,000 in Walthamstow constituency, will receive an above- inflation increase in the basic state pension from April 2001. Single pensioners will receive an extra &#163;5 a week,

and couples will receive an extra &#163;8 a week. All pensioners aged 75 or over have also been entitled to a free TV licence since November 2000--including around 7,400 in Walthamstow constituency.

 Secure detention facilities are routinely provided on the Immigration and Nationality Directorate's detention estate, supplemented by places in Prison Service accommodation. Police services also provide some detention on a limited, ad hoc basis. Information specifically on the cost of asylum detainees is not separately available. Assuming full occupancy, the average annual cost of a place for an immigration detainee is shown in the table:

 The London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority is defined as a Best Value authority under the Local Government Act 1999. Under the duty of Best Value, authorities are required to secure continuous improvement in the way in which they exercise their functions, having regard to a combination of economy, efficiency and effectiveness.
<P>

<a name="10315w09.html_para3">Section 16 of the Local Government Act 1999 allows the Secretary of State to exclude Best Value authorities from the application of existing legislation which prevents them from achieving Best Value or to amend the application of such legislation. It also allows for new powers to be conferred to facilitate the achievement of Best Value.
<P>

<a name="10315w09.html_para4">The Government expect to publish this month a consultation paper on the use of powers in section 16 to provide new and amended powers for partnership working. This will include proposals for Best Value authorities to provide a wider range of goods and services to partners, both in the public and private sectors. Draft orders will be laid before Parliament following the conclusion of the consultation exercise.

 There is no statutory requirement for the Royal Parks Constabulary, which is a non-Home Office police force, to be inspected by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary. A review of the Constabulary was undertaken during July and August 2000 by Mr. Anthony Speed, a former Assistant Commissioner of

The Home Office has consulted the association about community and race relations training for officers in Home Office forces in England and Wales. The association was also consulted during the development of minority ethnic employment targets and an associated action plan for all Home Office forces, published in July 1999 under the title 'Dismantling Barriers'. The association is represented on the steering group overseeing the implementation of 'Dismantling Barriers'.

Recorded crime statistics do not generally include the location of offences, and so details of those involving village shops and village post offices are not available.

For example, from that date, figures for offences of violence against the person additionally include figures for common assault and assault on a constable, among other offences.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10315w11.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The Government want to see police numbers rising. Our spending plans therefore make generous provision, intended to meet major pay, pensions and other pressures on forces as well as providing ring-fenced funding to increase recruitment through the Crime Fighting Fund (CFF).
<P>

<a name="10315w11.html_para0">As part of the police grant settlement for 2001-02, the Metropolitan police authority will receive &#163;1,822.8 million in Government supported funding. This is an increase of 5.3 per cent. over the provision for 2000-01. In addition, funding is available from the CFF to enable the Metropolitan police service to recruit an additional 2,044 officers over and above the number that the force would otherwise have recruited in the three years from April 2000.
<P>

<a name="10315w11.html_para1">Other measures which should boost recruitment in the Met include the &#163;3,327 per annum increase in London Allowance paid to officers in the Met (and City), who were recruited on or after 1 September 1994; the provision of free rail travel within a 70-mile radius of London for the Met's officers; and the National Recruitment Campaign. By 25 February the campaign had resulted in 2,304 Expressions of Interest being passed to the Met, and a further 1,160 calls transferred to the Met's own call centre.
<P>

<a name="10315w11.html_para2">Several outline bids covering the Met police area are also being assessed under the first round of the Government's Starter Homes Initiative which will enable key workers, including police officers, to purchase homes in areas of high-cost housing.

 At present there are no plans to close particular county court hearing centres as a result of my Departmental Consultation Paper on "Modernising the Civil Courts".
<P>

<a name="10315w11.html_para4">A key theme of "Modernising the Civil Courts" is to make best use of our resources to improve access to justice. As the consultation paper notes, we have a responsibility to ask whether the current court estate offers the best way of providing the services that we have a duty to provide, or whether there are more cost-effective alternatives that maintain, or improve, the level of service required. To that end we are developing a strategy for achieving best value from our estate which will include identifying the most appropriate locations for hearing centres. Part of the exercise will involve looking at opportunities to develop partnerships with other agencies, including the magistrates courts, so that hearings and other services can be provided in areas where there is no permanent county court building.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10315w11.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Lock: </B> 
 As at 12 March 2001, the Legal Services Commission had received 1,285 signed general criminal contracts from firms of solicitors across England and Wales. It is expected that some 2,800 firms, the vast majority of those that were offered contracts to sign, will elect to take up the contract.

 I am pleased to tell the House that Her Majesty yesterday made Orders in Council defining the functions of her Commissioners for Judicial Appointments and appointing Professor Sir Colin Murray Campbell, the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Nottingham, as her First Commissioner for Judicial Appointments. The Commission has commenced its work today. The recruitment of Deputy Commissioners will begin shortly, and the Lord Chancellor hopes the first of them will be appointed in the autumn.
<P>

<a name="10315w11.html_para5">Sir Leonard also recommended that a pilot scheme be produced for an Assessment Centre for judicial appointments. The tendering process will commence shortly to identify consultants who will advise on the design and development of the pilot scheme. Several of Sir Leonard's other recommendations--such as improvements to the forms used in consultations on candidates for judicial appointments, and to the procedures for appointment to Silk--have already been implemented.

 It has not been the case of the Governors of the Foundation that the Hogarth paintings or the Handeliana are held on special trusts such as would preclude their sale.

<P>
<a name="10315w12.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Stuart Bell: </B> 
 On retirement at or after age 65 with 37 or more years' full-time service, the pension benefits for clergy consist of a pension of two thirds the previous year's National Minimum Stipend plus a tax free lump sum of three times that amount. Pensions may be drawn any time after age 55 subject to appropriate actuarial discounts.
<P>

<a name="10315w12.html_para2">The benefit formula reflects best practice in occupational schemes. It recognises that clergy receive a State pension and, as housing is provided while clergy are working, also recognises that clergy in retirement need to meet the cost of housing. Discretionary help is available through the housing loan and rental schemes administered by the Church of England Pensions Board.

This would be spread over a fairly wide population and so the individual risk of exposure would be low.

 The Government have had ongoing discussions with the European Commission and other member states on the 'Everything But Arms' proposal, culminating in the adoption of the Presidency compromise on 26 February. On sugar this provides for an eight-year transitional period, comprising a duty-free interim quota for raw sugar for refining, starting at 74,185 tonnes in July 2001 and increasing by 15 per cent. each year, coupled with the phase-out of duties on all LDC sugar between 2006 and 2009. In the short term, the implications of the EBA regulation for United Kingdom sugar beet producers are likely to be minimal. We will press the Commission to include the impact of EBA in the studies it expects to undertake in preparation for the next reform of the sugar regime.

Section 34(5) of the Animal Health Act 1981 states that if the owner of a slaughtered animal has insurance on that animal, the insurers may deduct the statutory compensation from the amount of money payable under the insurance, before they make any payment.

<P>
<a name="10315w14.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The retention of deceased persons' National Insurance Numbers (NINOs) is necessary to process claims for Widow's Benefit and from 9 April 2001 for Bereavement Benefit claims. Additionally records of the deceased must be kept in order to protect the inheritable rights of the surviving spouse to ensure that they are awarded the correct rate of Retirement Pension when they reach State Pension age or the rate of Retirement Pension which the survivor already receives is increased correctly. The retention is therefore necessary to protect the rights of those making National Insurance contributions.
<P>

<a name="10315w14.html_para4">Retaining NINOs also enables checks to be made for benefit recovery against estates and assists the prevention of a further NINO being fraudulently created under the deceased's identity.

 The <i>E.</i>coli bacterium of most concern is Vero cytotoxin-producing <i>E.</i>coli (VTEC) of which <i>E.</i>coli O157 is the commonest.
<P>

<a name="10315w16.html_para0">Many outbreaks of <i>E.</i>coli O157 are foodborne and have been associated with various foods including contaminated meat and dairy products. We have a wide range of policies aimed at preventing outbreaks of foodborne disease. All of these contribute to preventing outbreaks of <i>E.</i>coli O157 food poisoning. As well as comprehensive food hygiene legislation, examples of these policies include the clean livestock policy and butchers' licensing.
<P>

<a name="10315w16.html_para1"><i>E.</i>coli O157 outbreaks also occur from contact with farm animals or environments, including water, contaminated by animal faeces. The Chief Medical Officer issued health advice for farm visits by children last year, which was sent to all directors of public health and consultants in communicable disease control. Also in 2000, the Health and Safety Executive in collaboration with the Department of Health and the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food revised guidance to farmers, farm workers and teachers on avoiding ill health at open farms. Further information produced by Government is also given to vulnerable groups, such as pregnant women, on how to avoid infection from various zoonotic diseases, including <i>E.</i>coli O157. The Food Standards Agency has recently issued guidance on avoiding the risks from camping and picnicking on fields used for grazing animals.

<P>

<a name="10315w16.html_para4">In May 2000 the CMO's Update 26, which is distributed to all medical practitioners, carried an article "VTEC Guidance" which drew attention to the seasonal increase in infection, the risks from farm visits and the susceptibility of children to developing Haemolytic Uraemic Syndrome (HUS) following infection with <i>E.</i>coli O157.

<a name="10315w16.html_para5"><i>E.</i>coli O157 therapy is limited to supportive measures to maintain the body's fluid and electrolyte balance and monitoring for the development of HUS.

<P>

 <i>[holding answer 14 March 2001]:</i> Our strategy for modernising NHS dentistry was published in September 2000 "Modernising NHS Dentistry--Implementing the NHS Plan". In that publication we announced that &#163;100 million would be invested in NHS dentistry by April 2002.
<P>

<a name="10315w16.html_para10">This year we have made available &#163;4 million through the Dental Care Development Fund to reimburse dentists who expand their practices and treat more NHS patients. We are considering the need for a similar scheme in 2001-02 when we will also make available up to &#163;35 million to modernise NHS dental practices and make commitment to the NHS even more worthwhile for dentists.
<P>

<a name="10315w16.html_para11">A new Commitment Payment Scheme was introduced from April 2000 to reward dentists in the General Dental Service for their past and present commitment. We plan to spend a sum in the order of &#163;18 million for payments made to eligible dentists in England in respect of 2001-02. From April 2001 the scheme will be revised and enhanced; we expect the funding to be around &#163;22 million in respect of payment due in 2001-02.

<a name="10315w17.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 We have embarked on a radical programme of modernisation to improve access to effective treatment and care, reduce unfair variation, raise standards, and provide quicker and more convenient services across the spectrum of mental health services. The National Service Framework for mental health, published September 1999, sets out general standards for treatment and care. In addition, the Allen Report 1989 and "Planning for Major Incidents: the National Health Service guidance" 1998 were issued to help those involved in the provision of support for people with post-traumatic stress disorder to identify psycho-social support, and disseminate messages about good practice. There is also current guidance relevant to War Pensioners (Health Service Guidance (97) 31) which says:
<P>

<a name="10315w17.html_para0"><P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="10315w17.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 Intermediate care is designed to promote independence, particularly for older people, who would otherwise face unnecessarily prolonged hospital stays or inappropriate admission to acute in-patient care, long-term residential care, or continuing National Health Service in-patient care. It is not possible to quantify precisely the number of people who will not require long-term care as a result of the development of intermediate care services following the NHS Plan. However, the initial evidence from several existing local schemes suggests a high success rate for short-term rehabilitation schemes set up 



<P>
<P><I>15 Mar 2001 : Column: 723W</I><P>
with the aim of preventing or delaying admissions to long-stay residential care. The Department is currently considering proposals from a number of research teams for the evaluative research of intermediate care schemes nationally.

 Vocational GCSEs will be introduced in September 2002.

We have introduced vocational A levels, are reforming and extending Modern Apprenticeships and are introducing Foundation Degrees. The new vocational GCSEs, to be available from September 2002, will provide a qualification of the same standard as academic GCSEs.

Trained personal advisers can help find suitable work-related training that supports the work goals of the individual and takes into account their child care responsibilities. Lone parents also receive financial support to cover the costs. From April this year we will introduce a &#163;15 weekly training premium on top of the existing help. And as we announced in the Budget, we will also introduce a self-employment option for lone parents similar to that which is available through the New Deal for 25 plus. We will also introduce greater flexibility to enable lone parents to take a wider range of intensive short work-focused courses.

<a name="10315w17.html_spnew12"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 Some 17,000 schools have so far benefited from allocations to individual projects under the New Deal for Schools programme. Over the next three years, we are investing &#163;8.5 billion, as part of the biggest school building and repair programme in decades. This includes devolving over &#163;1 billion direct to schools. It will enable 650 schools to be replaced or completely refurbished and major repair and improvement projects to be carried out at over 7,000 schools.

<P>
<a name="10315w18.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 We issued a Green Paper on Local Authority Funding on 19 September 2000 and consultation ended on 8 December. An analysis of consultation responses was published on 5 March on the DETR website at www.local.detr.gov.uk/greenpap/ analysis/index.htm. Copies of the analysis have also been placed in the Library. We will publish a White Paper on Local Government Finance later in the year. We will be working on a new formula for funding local education authorities over the coming months, with the aim of moving towards a new system in 2002-03.

<P>
<a name="10315w18.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 The percentage of 15-year-old pupils gaining five or more A*-C grades at GCSE or the GNVQ equivalent has increased from 45.1 per cent. in 1996-97 to 49.2 per cent. in 1999-2000. The overall increase was four percentage points with an increase of at one percentage point in each of the intervening years. This shows that the figures are on track to reach the target of 50 per cent. by 2002.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10315w18.html_spnew3"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 We regularly meet representatives of the teacher associations and discipline is one of the issues discussed at these meetings.
<P>

<a name="10315w18.html_para0">Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Schools' latest annual report shows that behaviour is good in three quarters of secondary schools and almost all primary schools, although he noted increasing levels of poor behaviour in the early years of secondary school. That is why we are providing record levels of funding--&#163;174 million in 2001-02--a third more than this year and 10 times more than in 1996-97--to help schools and local education authorities tackle poor behaviour and provide education for excluded pupils.
<P>

<a name="10315w18.html_para1">This is helping to pay for the 1,000 on-site Learning Support Units which take disruptive pupils out of the classroom quickly, improve their behaviour and reduce the need for exclusion. This network has been delivered a year ahead of the original target date.
<P>

<a name="10315w18.html_para2">We are giving heads the full support they need to tackle disruptive and violent behaviour, including the use of exclusion where appropriate. We have clarified our exclusion guidance to emphasise that heads can permanently exclude pupils who are very disruptive or violent. And the new guidance for exclusion appeal panels makes clear that the head's decision should not be overridden in a range of circumstances including where there is violence or the threat of violence.




<P>
<P><I>15 Mar 2001 : Column: 727W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="10315w18.html_para3">Where an exclusion is necessary provision for excluded pupils is being greatly increased. There are over 1,000 more places and nearly 600 more teachers, instructors and education support staff at Pupil Referral Units compared with 1997. Planned LEA funding for PRUs increased by 13 per cent. this year compared with last, and we expect to see a 10 per cent. rise in the number of PRUs in 2001 compared with 2000. And by 2002 all local education authorities plan to provide a full timetable for excluded pupils.

Swindon LEA has been allocated &#163;185,650 for community, foundation and voluntary controlled schools and &#163;46,750 for voluntary aided schools.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what steps he has taken to increase the supply of childminders.  [152581]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10315w18.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Hodge: </B> 
 On 15 June last year, I launched a &#163;4.5 million start-up grant, to help provide up to 39,000 childminder places in 2000-01. The grant, supported by the European Social Fund (ESF), helps people starting out in childminding to meet some of the associated set-up costs. The childcare tax credit element of the Working Families Tax Credit helps more parents to use childminding services as it pays up to 70 per cent. of childminding fees. This has the effect of allowing childminders to use the increase in revenue to invest in their business and, therefore, of encouraging more people into childminding.
<P>

<a name="10315w18.html_para4">Over the next three years, we have given Early Years Development and Childcare Partnerships the target of setting up a minimum of 145,000 new childcare places with childminders across England by March 2004, a minimum of 25,000 of which will be in areas of disadvantage. These places will be in addition to those which partnerships would normally expect to create.
<P>

<a name="10315w18.html_para5">To support partnerships in achieving these targets, we are making extensive new investment in increasing the supply of childminding reflecting the Government's determination to reverse the decline in numbers. This includes extending the childminder start-up grant by &#163;17 million over the three years.
<P>

<a name="10315w18.html_para6">We are also helping with infrastructure support for childminding by providing &#163;11.25 million for the creation of 450 childminder networks over the next three years. Networks can encourage people to enter childminding and, by providing support, help to reduce childminder turnover.
<P>

<a name="10315w18.html_para7">Last month I announced a new &#163;3 million project, again supported by ESF moneys, to support new childminder networks in four disadvantaged areas helping teenage mothers stay in full time education and training.

 <i>[holding answer 12 March 2001]:</i> The information requested is in the tables. They show that between 1996-97 and 1997-98 total funding in South Tyneside increased by &#163;50 per pupil in real terms. Between 1997-98 and 2000-01 South Tyneside's funding per pupil has increased by &#163;430 per pupil in real terms. Grant figures have not yet been finalised for 2001-02, so no comparable figure is available for that year.

<sup>(39)</sup> Prior to the local government reorganisation in 1998-99, Essex included Southend on Sea and Thurrock. The figures for 1997-98 are based on an apportionment for Essex across the three constituent authorities<P>

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. Comparable grant information is not available prior to 1997-98: all grants for 2001-02 have not yet been allocated<P>

2. The SSA figures make no allowances for changes in SSA methodology since 1990-91<P>

3. Figures are rounded to the nearest &#163;10<P>

4. Real term figures calculated using GDP deflators published by the Treasury 7 March 2001<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment how many applications he has received for the Targeted Capital Fund; how much in total has been applied for; when he expects to announce the allocations; and if he will make a statement.  [153535]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10315w21.html_spnew2"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 Proposals for a total of 208 projects seeking support from the Targeted Capital Fund have been received from 116 local education authorities. The total value of the proposals submitted is &#163;299 million. We are currently appraising these proposals, and I aim to make an announcement before the end of this month.
<P>

<a name="10315w21.html_para2">Proposals to be supported will be funded as part of the &#163;8.5 billion investment programme in school buildings over the next three years. Most of this funding is being allocated according to needs-related formulae, rather than in response to bids. This funding is in addition to more than &#163;5 billion capital invested since 1997. Capital funding this year at over &#163;2 billion is more than three times the &#163;683 million spent on schools capital in 1996-97.

<P>
<a name="10315w21.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 Admission authorities for grammar schools are responsible for setting their own arrangements for selecting pupils. Some allocate places on the basis of rank order of merit in the entrance test; others set a pass mark for the test and, if more children achieve the pass mark than there are places available, normal oversubscription criteria (for example siblings, distance) are used to allocate the places. Some admission authorities review cases of children who have marginally failed to reach the required standard in the test, taking account of head teachers' recommendations and school reports, which are likely to include reference to performance in the National Curriculum.
