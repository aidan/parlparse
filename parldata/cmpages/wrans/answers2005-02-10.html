 The Ministry of Defence&#039;s annual planning process reviews the affordability of all equipment projects and other defence expenditure. This process is not, however, a question of &quot;one programme versus another&quot; but of how best our overall capability priorities can be matched to the resources available. The future carriers remain key elements of our equipment programme.

<p><a name="50210w01.html_spnew7"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 Last year, the Army considered how best to implement the move to larger regiments and the reduction of four infantry battalions. This involved a wide-ranging and detailed consultation exercise, with the infantry being invited to express their views on how the restructuring should be implemented. Colonels of individual regiments, a number of whom are retired officers, were directly involved in the consultation via the Colonels Commandants of the Divisions of Infantry (who count among their number former, as well as current, Service personnel). The latter were responsible for representing the views of their Divisions to Executive Committee of the Army Board (ECAB); each was invited to address the Committee in person in early December. The Chief of the General Staff also received a small number of letters from retired officers.

 DFID engages with a wide range of Civil Society Organisations (CSO) as partner aid agencies.

 The UK Government have been at the forefront of international efforts to deliver debt relief to the world&#039;s poorest countries. It provides substantial debt relief through the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative. This initiative, launched with the help of significant UK backing in 1999, is delivering many benefits. To date, over US $70 billion in 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>10 Feb 2005 : Column 1635W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>

<p>
<a name="50210w02.html_para3">
The UK has committed &#163;2.3 billion of debt relief for eligible countries to cover our obligations under HIPC, including 100 per cent. relief on bilateral UK debts for these countries. It has also pledged an additional $479 million through the multilateral institutions to further support HIPC.

The UK has already cancelled the aid debts of the poorest countries under its Retrospective Terms Adjustment policy, and in 1997 launched the Commonwealth Debt Initiative to cancel the remaining aid debts of the &#039;poorer&#039; (lower middle-income) Commonwealth countries committed to poverty reduction. This initiative covers Commonwealth countries with a GNI of less than US $3,115 and small island middle-income Commonwealth countries.

The initiative already applies to 20 countries (i.e. the 15 post-HIPC countries, as well as Armenia, Mongolia, Nepal, Vietnam, and, in light of the South East Asia Tsunami, Sri Lanka) and more will benefit as they progress through HIPC and strengthen their public expenditure management. The UK is actively working to encourage other countries, in particular our G8 partners, to contribute to the initiative in order to provide full multilateral debt relief.

 DFID is aware of the international increase in electronic barter, and electronic trade exchanges. E-barter and e-payments are private sector initiatives, and international and local businesses will pursue economic opportunities in developing countries as they arise. DFID&#039;s activities in international trade policy, and capacity building, have not so far focused on electronic barter, or bilateral exchange mechanisms of this nature. DFID&#039;s trade strategy is being finalised at present, but there have been no requests from stakeholders in counterpart governments to include e-barter issues.

<p>
<a name="50210w03.html_para0">
DFID&#039;s concern on electronic exchanges, including the movement of funds, relate to the access of the poor and unbanked to electronic money and payment mechanisms. Access to electronic payment mechanisms is limited to those with access to bank accounts and credit cards in many cases, which currently excludes the majority of the world&#039;s poor. DFID&#039;s current focus on &quot;banking the unbanked&quot; is consistent with preparing the way for the poor to benefit from electronic payment mechanisms.

<p><a name="50210w08.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 The European Environment Council stated in 1996 the target of limiting global temperature rise to 2oC above pre-industrial levels, requiring stabilisation of carbon dioxide concentrations in the

atmosphere at levels below 550ppm. The Environment Council based the target on scientific evidence suggesting that the impacts arising from temperature change greater than 2oC are likely to be severe enough to be classified as dangerous, and therefore to be avoided under the terms of Article 2 of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The target has subsequently been reaffirmed, although the science is continually under review to assess the relevance of the target.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50210w08.html_para3">
The Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution supported this level of stabilisation in its report Energy&#151;the Changing Climate, published in June 2000, taking account of the scientific assessments of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The Government&#039;s Energy White Paper, published in 2003, accepted the findings of the Royal Commission. The 60 per cent. target is consistent with the emissions reductions needed by 2050 from developed countries if carbon dioxide is to be stabilised at levels below 550ppm, taking emissions from developing countries into account. Greater reductions will be needed beyond 2050. The scientific analysis is discussed in the paper The scientific case for setting a long term emissions reduction target published by Defra in 2003 and available on the Department&#039;s website.

 We expect the reforms of the Common Agricultural Policy to deliver a number of benefits to English farmers.

Initially, farm incomes in England are expected to increase very slightly, with restructuring of businesses and greater efficiency encouraged by decoupling likely to give rise to further improvements in the longer term, relative to what would have happened in the absence of reform.

 The European Environment Agency (EEA) does not operate directly within its member countries. Most of its work is carried out through contractual arrangements with national organisations. The EEA coordinates this activity within the UK and elsewhere mainly through the European environment information and observation network (Eionet), which is a partnership network of over 900 experts and over 300 organisations in 37 countries. Additionally, the EEA has established five European topic centres to support data collection, management and analysis. One of these (for water) is a consortium of institutions headed by WRc PLC, based in the UK. The EEA is responsible for developing the network and coordinating its activities. The UK network within Eionet consists of nine main 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>10 Feb 2005 : Column 1659W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
institutions either contracted to carry out work for the EEA or supplying expertise and data to fulfil national reporting obligations. Coordination of the national network within the UK and liaison with the EEA is done by the National Focal Point (NFP) based in the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, who also supply the UK representative on the EEA Management Board. The UK NFP also produces a twice yearly newsletter to keep contacts and other interested stakeholders up to date on EEA activities.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50210w09.html_para5">
In 2004 the EEA published 23 reports, technical reports and briefings on environmental topics in paper form, listed in Table 1. In addition the Agency published a brochure &#039;Eionet connects&#039;, detailing the workings of the network. The EEA makes these reports and many other documents available on its website, including its Annual Reports and Annual Management Plans.

 None of the fish stocks that involve the North Sea are exclusively within the United Kingdom&#039;s fisheries limits as they also include parts of other sea areas as well.

To calculate an estimate as requested would require information on the catches by vessels of other member states. Such information is only available in terms of totals for the sea areas involved, and this does not include any breakdown of catches in terms of those caught within the UK 200 mile or median line limit.

 Since the end of the fourth and final stage of the Multi-annual Guidance Programme (MAGP) in 2002, the existing member states&#039; fleets, including that of the UK, have been subject to overall limits on tonnage (GT) and power (kW), known as reference levels. The 10 new member states were not part of the MAGP mechanism, however the Commission is working with them to urgently establish suitable reference levels which will apply retrospectively (from the date of accession).

<sup>(6)</sup> Under European System of Accounts 95 (ESA95), the term GVA is used to denote estimates that were previously known as Gross Domestic Product (GDP) at basic prices. Under ESA95 the term GDP denotes GVA plus taxes (less subsidies) on products, i.e. at market prices. Regional accounts are currently only published at basic prices, so the figures are now referred to as GVA rather than GDP as in previous publications.

 Formaldehyde is used as an inactivating agent to eliminate poliovirus infectivity. Also, it is used to inactivate diphtheria and tetanus toxins. Gluteraldehyde, a closely related chemical, is used to inactivate acellular pertussis toxins. The quantities present in the new vaccines are low, and less than 0.1 milligrams of formaldehyde and less than 0.02 mg gluteraldehyde per 0.5 millilitre dose. Formaldehyde is present naturally in the human body at levels of about 2.5 micrograms per ml of blood. For a two month old child, this is about 10 times as much as in the amount present in a single dose of vaccine. There is no evidence that these quantities pose a risk to health and there are no plans to remove these substances from vaccines.

<p>
<a name="50210w17.html_para0">
None of the current vaccines used in the childhood immunisation programme contain mercury. Thiomersal, which releases ethylmercury, has played an important role either as a preservative or in the initial stages of the manufacture of some vaccines for over 60 years. Thiomersal was contained in the diphtheria, tetanus and whole cell pertussis (DTwP) and diphtheria and tetanus vaccines. However, with the introduction of the new vaccine Pediacel on 27 September 2004, the routine childhood immunisation programme no longer includes mercury-containing vaccines.

Foetal bovine serum is an essential growth supplement for the cells used for the propagation of live viruses. The bovine serums used have demonstrated compliance with European Union regulations for minimising the risk of transmitting animal spongiform encephalopathy agents via human and veterinary medicines.

The monkey kidney cell line used for the production of inactivated poliovirus in the new vaccines has been extensively examined for contaminating viruses. The cell line meets the requirements of the World Health Organisation and European Pharmacopoeia. To exclude the risk of extraneous viral contamination each production lot is examined for contaminating viruses during the production process. The viral inactivation process has been fully validated.

<a name="50210w20.html_para1">
In 2000, DfES issued non-statutory guidance to schools on the teaching of SRE.

 The &quot;Future of Air Transport&quot; White Paper recognises the importance of ensuring that aviation meets its external costs, including its environmental costs. The UK has made it clear that tackling climate change will be a priority for our presidency of the EU in 2005. We believe that the best way of ensuring that aviation contributes towards the goal of climate stabilisation would be through a well-designed emissions trading regime. The European Commission has recently commissioned a study to look at options for aviation participating in the EU emission trading scheme. We intend to press for the inclusion of intra-EU air services in the EU scheme from 2008, or as soon as possible thereafter, and to make this a priority for our EU presidency. However, we will also continue to explore and discuss options for the use of other economic instruments.

<p><a name="50210w22.html_spnew3"><b> Charlotte Atkins: </b> 
 Privately owned car parks are private property and charges and conditions for their use are a contractual matter between the owner and users. This is not a matter that is the subject of public legislation concerning fines and it would be for the owner to pursue any unpaid charges as a civil rather than criminal matter. The Secretary of State has no powers to issue guidelines on the management of private car parks. When using a private car park a motorist is effectively agreeing to abide by the terms and conditions of its use, which should be displayed clearly.

<p><a name="50210w25.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Mullin: </b> 
 Resolution 1564 requested the establishment of an International Commission of Inquiry (ICI) to investigate reports of violations of international humanitarian law and human rights law in Darfur. The report was presented to the Security Council on 31 January. It concludes that the Government of Sudan, the Arab militias and the rebels are all guilty of serious violations of human rights and humanitarian law, which may amount to crimes against humanity and/or war crimes. The ICI has given the UNSG a list of suspects it believes may have perpetrated these crimes, and recommends that he pass this list to a competent prosecutor.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50210w25.html_para0">
We called for the establishment of the ICI and welcome their report. We, and our fellow member states in the UN Security Council are united in our determination that there can be no impunity for these crimes and will be discussing the next steps over the coming days.

<p><a name="50210w25.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Mullin: </b> 
 We call on both the Government of Sudan and the rebels to abide by their commitments under the Abuja protocols, which include provision for the release of all persons detained in relation to the hostilities in Darfur, excluding those detained through due process of law.

Our embassy in Khartoum regularly raises abolition of the death penalty with the Government of Sudan. We also held detailed discussions on this subject during the joint Sudan/EU dialogue meetings in September 2004. We will continue to follow these cases closely.

<p><a name="50210w25.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Mullin: </b> 
 We are concerned about the use of helicopter gunships in Darfur and continue to liaise closely with the African Union who are investigating the incidents. The latest report by the UN Secretary General, dated 4 February, notes that

<p><a name="50210w25.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Mullin: </b> 
 The Government of Sudan mobilised troops around El Fasher and Nyala in December 2004, citing the need to prevent roads being blocked by the rebels. There are no definitive figures about the size of the Sudanese army deployment. The African Union reported renewed fighting between Government troops and rebel forces during this period.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50210w25.html_para3">
We raised this matter with the Government of Sudan both bilaterally and during the Joint Implementation Mechanism (JIM) meeting on 20 December. The UK, and our partners in the JIM, called for an immediate cessation of all hostilities. At the JIM meeting the Government of Sudan agreed to cease this campaign in the region.

<p><a name="50210w25.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Mullin: </b> 
 The African Union, UN, and non-governmental organisations reported claims of Sudanese air force activity around Thabit in Darfur around 8 December. The UN subsequently reported that the fighting around Thabit on 7 and 8 December resulted in four civilian fatalities and 20 injuries.

&quot;Travel by Ministers&quot; makes clear that special flights may be authorised when a scheduled service is not available, or when it is essential to travel by air, but the requirements of official or parliamentary business or security considerations or urgency preclude the journey being made by a scheduled service.

The list published in 1999 covers the period 2 May 1997 to 31 March 1999. Where RAF/Private Charter aircraft are used this is shown in the list.

In order to achieve our challenging targets for increased participation in sport and physical activity, we have invested in thousands of new and refurbished public sports facilities.

Eight other sports facilities in Burnley have also benefited from Sport England Community Capital awards totalling over &#163;2 million and Burnley football club has received a Football Youth Development award of &#163;289,000 from Sport England. In 2002 we launched the first ever comprehensive national physical education, school sport and club links strategy with an investment of &#163;459 million, benefiting schools throughout the country.

People in Burnley will be among those who benefit from Culture Online. Between 2002 and 2004, &#163;13 million was allocated to fund 20 Culture Online projects.

We have ensured a secure funding base for the BBC and Channel 4, while giving them the freedom to develop commercial operations which complement and support their public service remit. The Communications Act 2003 includes provisions to ensure that public service broadcasting will continue to have a key role to play in the digital future.

Our support for, and promotion of, the film and broadcasting industries have contributed to the general success of film-making and television activity in the Burnley area.

A new feature film is currently filming in Burnley.

We have changed the licensing laws to allow people to hold and attend commercial dances on Sunday, to make it easier for restaurants to open an hour later, and to relax the alcohol licensing hours from 11 pm on New Year&#039;s Eve to 11 am on New Year&#039;s Day in all future years; and we have given the police greater powers to take action against under-age drinking and disorderly and noisy licensed premises. The Licensing Act 2003, when fully implemented, will introduce a streamlined, consistent and fair licensing regime for the provision of alcohol, public entertainment and late night refreshment. It will provide greater choice for consumers, bring regeneration and increased employment opportunities and protect local residents whose lives have been blighted by disturbance and antisocial behaviour.

The Gambling Bill will, when implemented, transfer responsibility for licensing gambling premises to local authorities.

A recent British Beer and Pub Association survey indicated that none of the 30,500 public houses and bars in England and Wales owned by its members expected to apply to open for 24 hours.

 European law (Council Directive 64/221 EEC) provides that nationals of member states may be expelled from the territory of another member state only on grounds of public policy, public security or public health.

 The answer of 25 January 2005, <i>Official Report</i>, column 276W gave projected volumes of passport demand between 2005 and 2014. During this period we anticipate fluctuating demand for both adult new applications and adult renewals. The pattern is different for each demand type and is based on the constraints detailed as follows.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50210w30.html_para6">
The forecast decline in adult new passport applications is due to the following:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">Since 1999, the majority of applications for new passports have been from children, as opposed to adults due to the policy introduced in 1998 that children require their own passports and should no longer be included on parents&#039; passports.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">When a child passport holder turns 16 and applies to renew their passport, the application is treated as an adult renewal (since we already have a record of them on our database and have carried out previous identity checks). The absence of children turning 16 as a major source of adult new applications has resulted in the approach of saturation of new passport uptake within the adult population.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">Adult new passport intake has fallen from a peak of 2.2 million applications in 1996 to approximately 820,000 in 2000&#150;01. It has gradually declined since to only 660,000 applications in 2004. The UKPS estimates that this gradual decline will persist to approximately 540,000 applications by 2009.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">Once saturation has been achieved, the actual new adult passport demand will be susceptible to variations in the number of immigrants who take up British nationality (as a consequence of Government policy) and the number of children that have not held a passport by the age of 16.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50210w30.html_para7">
Adult passport renewal volumes are forecast to reflect fluctuations in the volumes of passports that are available to be renewed during the period. Passports that are available to renew include:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">Adult passports issued 10 years previously; and</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">Child passports issued five years previously to 11 to 15-year-old children.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50210w30.html_para8">
The peak in renewals around 2006 is partly driven by the fact that this is the tenth anniversary of the year when the one year &quot;British Visitors&#039; Passport&quot; was abolished and the fifth anniversary of the initial bulge in children passport issues, following the above mentioned policy change.

<p>
<a name="50210w30.html_para9">
General Group in IND deals with applications for leave to remain, including those from students. Internal management information for General Group shows there were 53 letters issued for passports reported lost or mislaid from April 2001 to March 2002; 335 issued from April 2002 to March 2003; 469 issued from April 2003 to March 2004; and 207 issued from April 2004 to November 2004. This should be balanced against the number of decisions made in the same period which were 380,000 (0.01 per cent); 403,000 (0.08 per cent); 534,000 (0.08 per cent); and 271,544(0.07 per cent) respectively.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what measures <i>(a)</i> are in place and <i>(b)</i> he plans to introduce to ensure that people and bodies in the arts field can work together to increase the range, quantity and quality of activities for prisoners.  [213359]</p>




<p><a name="50210w31.html_spnew0"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 Arts can make a significant contribution to the effective and humane operation of the prison regime. Financial support to arts activities for offenders are provided centrally to several national arts organisations. It is recognised that the arts can act as a gateway into education for prisoners who have not been engaged with formal learning. Most prisons now have a head of learning and skills, a post funded by the Department for Education and Skills (DfES), and the heads determine the part that arts activities can play within the establishment.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50210w31.html_para0">
At a prison arts conference last year a guide on provision of voluntary sector activities in prisons was launched for heads of learning and skills and managers in the voluntary sectors.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50210w31.html_para1">
The unit produces a regular e-mail newsletter for arts organisations working with offenders, hosts a Forum for Arts and Offenders, and provides training to artists wanting to work with prisoners. The Unit for Arts and Offenders will be members of the newly formed NOMS Voluntary and Community Sector Advisory Group. Activities being undertaken by arts organisations in prisons and the community are documented in the Directory of Arts Activities in Prisons, which has been produced annually by the Unit for Arts and Offenders with financial support from DfES.

<p><a name="50210w31.html_spnew1"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 The National Offender Management Service is developing a joint prison probation strategy for establishing and maintaining links with employers. These links are focused on sectors that have significant labour shortages nationally and regionally, such as: 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>10 Feb 2005 : Column 1743W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
construction; catering; industrial cleaning; utilities; sports and fitness; driving, and distribution. Opportunities are also being explored in horticulture and information communication technology. These sectors were identified following consultation with the Confederation of British Industry, Jobcentre Plus and Sector Skills Councils.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50210w31.html_para2">
The Prison Service is taking the lead on a cross-Government work programme for engaging with employers which has been agreed by the Employment, Training and Education Sub-Board of the Reducing Re-offending Programme Board. This work programme includes contributions from NOMS, the Probation Service, Jobcentre Plus, DfES and the Learning and Skills Council. Its aim is to build on existing work to encourage employers to contribute to the training of offenders and to commit to the recruitment of those who achieve an agreed level of skills.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50210w31.html_para3">
At a local level, employer links are being developed and maintained by the Heads of Learning and Skills and Resettlement Managers in establishments. They work closely with Jobcentre Plus, Learning and Skills Councils and voluntary organisations to involve employers in work and training programmes for prisoners, and to encourage them to recruit prisoners upon their release.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50210w31.html_para4">
The Prison Service is currently developing an employer database, holding information on those who are willing and able to offer work to ex-offenders.

 International students bring significant economic and social benefits to the UK.

Our analysis, which is set out in the recently published Regulatory Impact 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>10 Feb 2005 : Column 1745W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
Assessment, indicates that at the level proposed, the postal charges were unlikely to have a significant impact on the UK&#039;s ability to attract and retain international students. However, in order to ensure that remaining to study in the UK remains a competitive option, we have decided that charges should be at a lower rate of &#163;250 for the standard postal service. The higher, premium fee is an optional service which students can take advantage of if they so choose.

Travel by Ministers makes clear that special flights may be authorised when a scheduled service is not available, or when it is essential to travel by air, but the requirements of official or parliamentary business or security considerations or urgency preclude the journey being made by a scheduled service. In respect of overseas travel by Ministers, since 1999 the Government has published an annual list of all visits overseas undertaken by Cabinet Ministers costing &#163;500 or more during each financial year. The list published in 1999 covers the period 2 May 1997 to 31 March 1999. Where RAF/Private Charter aircraft are used this is shown in the list. The Government has also published on an annual basis the cost of all Ministers&#039; visits overseas. Copies of the lists are available in the Libraries of the House.

 To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Department for Constitutional Affairs if he will set out, with statistical information relating as directly as possible to Pendle constituency, the effects on Pendle of his Department&#039;s policies and activities since 2 May 1997.  [215008]</p>




<p><a name="50210w32.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Leslie: </b> 
 The Department for Constitutional Affairs is the Government Department responsible for upholding justice, rights and democracy. The Department&#039;s aim is to provide for effective and accessible justice for all, to ensure the rights and responsibilities of the citizen, and to modernise the law and constitution.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50210w32.html_para2">
Currently, the Department has six strategic objectives, which cover the delivery of justice, civil and administrative law, protecting the vulnerable, modernising the constitution, increasing consumer choice and working in partnership with the independent judiciary. The Department also has seven Public Service Agreement targets to help deliver its strategic objectives.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50210w32.html_para3">
Examples of the activity in 2004 to deliver these objectives include work with partners to make sure criminal trials are more efficient with the numbers of ineffective Crown Court trials falling from 24 per cent. in 2002&#150;03 to 16 per cent. in September 2004. The rate has reduced from 31 per cent. to 25 per cent. for the same period in the magistrates&#039; courts. The Department has also been involved in work to help people resolve their disputes in the most effective way, including pilots to test the effectiveness of court-based mediation. During 2004 there was a reduction from almost 49 per cent. to 41 per cent. in those cases that had eventually to be resolved by a hearing. Another area where pilots were used successfully was for all postal voting in four regions of England at the combined European and local elections in June 2004. Voter turnout doubled in the pilot regions compared with 1999.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50210w32.html_para4">
The range of the Department&#039;s policies and actions is wide and the statistical information relating to all of that activity is not collected on a constituency basis. Consequently, the information requested in the question cannot be provided in the form requested except at a disproportionate cost. However, statistical information about the Department&#039;s activities can be found at: http://www.dca.gov.uk/statistics/statfr.htm as well as at www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk
</p>


<p>
<a name="50210w32.html_para5">
An example of the information available on those sites is data on persistent young offenders. The average number of days from arrest to sentence for persistent young offenders sentenced between August and October 2004 was 59 days in the Lancashire criminal justice area, which covers the constituency of Pendle. This compares with 124 days in the Lancashire criminal justice area in the 1997 calendar year.

<p><a name="50210w33.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Leslie: </b> 
 Records held centrally show that, during 2004, no rape trails were listed as floating cases at the Central Criminal Court, Teesside Crown Court and Newcastle upon Tyne Crown Court.
</p>





<p><a name="50210w33.html_wqn2"><b> Vera Baird: </b> 
 To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Department for Constitutional Affairs what criteria are used to determine whether to list rape trials at Crown courts as floating trials.  [215581]</p>






<br>&nbsp;<br><i>10 Feb 2005 : Column 1750W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>



<p><a name="50210w33.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Leslie: </b> 
 Cases selected as floating trials are generally short and uncomplicated, involve few witnesses all of whom are located reasonably locally and, in the assessment of the listing officer, have a particularly good prospect of being reached. Certain cases, including rape cases, because of their sensitivity, should normally be given a fixed trial date.
</p>





<p><a name="50210w33.html_wqn3"><b> Vera Baird: </b> 
 To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Department for Constitutional Affairs what arrangements are made by the Courts Service for the presence at court of complainants in rape trials which are listed as floating trials.  [215582]</p>




<p><a name="50210w33.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Leslie: </b> 
 Court Service policy is that, Courts list rape trials as fixtures and not as floating trials. Arrangements for the presence of complainants, as with all prosecution witnesses, are a matter for the prosecuting solicitor. Complainants in rape trials would be offered a pre-court familiarisation visit. Arrangements can also be made for the complainant to enter the court building through a separate entrance or at a specific time and be met by a member of the court staff. Most venues of the Crown court now have dedicated witness facilities for witnesses to wait without fear of meeting the defendant. The Witness Service, which is present in all criminal courts, offers emotional and practical support for witnesses at court. Subject to judicial discretion, special measures, such as giving evidence by way of a video link or the use of screens in court, would also be available.
</p>





<p><a name="50210w33.html_wqn4"><b> Vera Baird: </b> 
 To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Department for Constitutional Affairs what training judges in sexual violence cases are given in preparation for the trial of rape cases.  [215584]</p>




<p><a name="50210w33.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Leslie: </b> 
 Judicial training is the responsibility of the Judicial Studies Board (JSB), an independent body chaired by Lord Justice Keene.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50210w33.html_para0">
No judge may hear a case involving rape or a serious sexual offence without first having received appropriate JSB training. This consists of a two-day (over three) residential seminar. The seminar programme includes talks on: research into public attitudes to sexual offending and the views of complainants and victims on the way in which sexual offences proceedings are handled; the policies and practices of the police and Crown Prosecution Service in handling serious sexual offences; issues of evidential and procedural law and practice which bear on the conduct of trials in such cases; sentencing issues and the assessment and treatment of sexual offenders in the community and in prison. Also included in the programme is a series of discussions, in small groups, of trial and sentencing issues. All judges who exercise the criminal jurisdiction will receive training on the provisions of the Sexual Offences Act 2003 as part of a programme of training on the Criminal Justice Reforms, between January and March 2005.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what assistance is available to people with disabilities to return to work in Hendon; how many people have taken up this assistance in each of the last five years; and if he will make a statement.  [211036]</p>




<p><a name="50210w41.html_spnew0"><b> Maria Eagle: </b> 
 There are a number of programmes, such as Access to Work, Work Preparation and Workstep designed to help disabled people return to work. Jobcentre Plus also offers interviews with a personal adviser to all disabled people making new or repeat claims to qualifying benefits to ensure they are aware of the help and opportunities available to them.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50210w41.html_para0">
Access to Work is a specialist disability programme, which provides practical advice and support to help disabled people enter or stay in paid employment.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50210w41.html_para1">
Work Preparation is an individually tailored, work-focused programme that enables disabled people to address barriers associated with their disability and prepare for working with the confidence necessary to achieve and sustain their job goal.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50210w41.html_para2">
Workstep provides support in jobs for disabled people who have more complex barriers to finding and keeping work but who, with the right support, can work effectively and develop in their job. Longer-term support continues to be available for those who need it and is a major element of the programme.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50210w41.html_para3">
Details of the number of disabled people helped to return to work through Access to Work, Work Preparation and Workstep in each of the last five years are not available at constituency or Jobcentre Plus district level.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50210w41.html_para4">
Disabled people may also receive help through the new deal programme. New deal for disabled people is a voluntary programme which gives customers on qualifying disability or health-related benefits in England, Scotland and Wales access to a network of Job Brokers. Job Brokers work with customers to help them compete in the labour market and support them in finding and keeping a job.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50210w41.html_para5">
Disabled people may also receive help through other New Deal programmes such as the new deal for young people, new deal 25 plus, new deal 50+, and new deal for lone parents. Over the last five years we estimate that around 430 disabled people have been supported through these new deal programmes in Hendon, of which around 180 have entered work.

Notes:<br>

1. Figures are for Great Britain only, in 2004&#150;05 price terms, using the Gross Domestic Product deflator index, rounded to the nearest &#163;100 million. They assume overnight introduction for all citizens above state pension age.<br>

2. It is assumed that the rules are changed from 2005&#150;06 and that basic state pension is increased in line with prices. It is assumed that all individuals above state pension age (65 for men; 60 for women) receive the full category A rate of basic state pension (currently &#163;79.60 per week) regardless of contribution record or marital status.<br>

3. Gross additional basic state pension costs are estimated by the Government Actuary&#039;s Department and are consistent with Budget 2004 assumptions and use 2002 based population projections. basic state pension costs refer to the additional costs after allowing for consequential changes to national insurance fund benefits and non-income-related vote benefits.<br>

4. Costs are net of income related benefits and income tax. For illustrative purposes it is assumed that the proportion of savings calculated is constant after 2006&#150;07.<br>

The rise in SLC Grant expenditure in 2004/05 is due partly to the introduction of the Higher Education Grant which was introduced for new students in 2004/05 to help cover the cost of participating in Higher Education. It is also due to a change in accounting arrangements whereby prior to 2004/05, local education authorities were responsible for paying certain grants and allowances. In 2004/05, the SLC are responsible for paying all grants and allowances hence the increase in the SLC expenditure.
