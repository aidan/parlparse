<a name="40331w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Drew: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry when she will respond to the Office of Fair Trading's assessment of the Supermarket Code of Practice.  [164073]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40331w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Sutcliffe: </B> 
 The Office of Fair Trading (OFT) announced on 20&nbsp;February 2004 that it would carry out an audit of the supermarkets' own records to determine whether there is evidence to support complaints about the Code made by various suppliers. When OFT have finalised their assessment, DTI is ready to look closely at the findings and any recommendations for action.

<P>
<a name="40331w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Connarty: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry pursuant to her answer of 17&nbsp;March 2004, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 326&#150;27W, to the hon. Member for Clydesdale (Mr. Hood), on the Competitiveness Council, for what reasons no agreement was reached on the regulation for the Community Patent.  [164294]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40331w01.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 Agreement was not reached because of an unresolved issue over whether translations of the claims of the patent, which are required to be filed in all official languages of the European Union, should be for information only, or whether they should have full legal effect. One view is that a company should not be disadvantaged if it infringes a patent due to a bad translation. At the other end of the spectrum, various delegations believe that giving legal effect to translations would raise costs for everyone and increase uncertainty. The UK is anxious to see a compromise which recognises industry's clear view that excessive translation costs would make a Community Patent of little value compared to existing arrangements.

 The government has a range of services and initiatives in place aimed at helping those thinking of starting a business. A comprehensive range of advice, information and support is delivered through the network of Business Link Operators and its partners. The Businesslink.gov website contains tailored advice and information aimed at those thinking about starting a business. This includes a new online training directory to help people thinking of starting a business, or in their first year of trading, to access training in order to innovate, improve, grow and be more competitive. Steps have also been taken to address concerns expressed by those starting in business about understanding their responsibilities with the publication of the 'No Nonsense Guide to Government rules for setting and running your business'. This brings together in one place all the rules and regulations that affect start-up businesses.

[163537]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40331w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 ECGD does not pay agent's commission on contracts it supports. However, the element of the contract price which reflects commission payments can be financed by banks within the loans ECGD guarantees.
<P>

<a name="40331w01.html_para0">ECGD is normally obliged to treat all information provided by its customers on the payment of agent's commission confidentially, using it to establish that the payment and value of the commission are acceptable.
<P>

<a name="40331w01.html_para1">Following our request, the exporter has agreed that ECGD can disclose that it employed a private engineering company to act both as local agent and sub-contractor.

<a name="40331w01.html_para3">OECD's review of EU countries ('Regulation, Productivity and Growth Economic Survey of the United Kingdom' (January 2003) shows the UK has almost the lowest administration cost and fewer regulations for entrepreneurs than any other EU country and that across Europe tax burdens on small business are lowest in the UK.

 Government are committed to reducing the regulatory burden on small business, in particular those regulations that act as a barrier to start-up and growth. We are determined to ensure that we only regulate when there is good reason to do so and when the benefits clearly justify the costs. Government have strengthened both the Regulatory Impact Assessment process and the guidance on the small firms impact test. Costs and benefits of proposed regulations are now properly analysed&#151;and published.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40331w02.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 The 6th triennial meeting of the ICAO Committee on Aviation Environmental Protection (CAEP) was held in Montreal, 2&#150;12&nbsp;February 2004. Progress was made on a number of issues. The principal achievements were (i) agreement on a new international standard for the minimum NOX performance of new aircraft engine types in the landing and takeoff cycle that is 12&nbsp;per cent. more stringent than the current standard, coming into effect in 2008, (ii) agreement on the text of a guidance document on the application of the ICAO 'balanced approach' to noise management at airports, (iii) agreement to continue work on two possible avenues for the future participation of aviation in emissions trading at a global level, and (iv) agreement on a stretching programme of work for the period 2004&#150;07, with a particular emphasis on long term goal-setting and the proper examination of trade-offs between different environmental impacts. Progress was also made on various lower-profile technical issues, but there was no progress on the use of charges to address the global environmental impacts of aviation, on which CAEP remains deeply divided.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40331w02.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 An annual survey of vehicle operators carried out by the Department for Transport indicates that approximately 30&nbsp;per cent. of the 48,000 full size buses operating in Great Britain as Public Service Vehicles, are low floor vehicles offering access for wheelchair users. The percentage operating in any given area will vary but in major cities it is likely to be considerably higher. The current figure for London is around 90&nbsp;per cent.




<P>

<a name="40331w02.html_para2">These vehicles comprise 6,300 that meet the full wheelchair accessibility requirements of the Public Service Vehicle Accessibility Regulations 2000, and a further 7,700 which were manufactured prior to these regulations coming into force, which are low floor vehicles providing a good level of accessibility for wheelchair users.

<a name="40331w02.html_para5">Over recent years, VOSA has sought to improve its targeting regime in order to ensure that those who tend to comply with legal requirements are less likely to be stopped and checked, and those who are pre-disposed to ignore legal requirements are more likely to be detected. Greater effort now goes into researching, targeting and stopping/investigating vehicles selectively and this is reflected in the above trend (figures).

 The estimated yield from the 19&nbsp;per cent. minimum rate of corporation tax on distributed profits for the next three financial years is given in Table A1 of the Financial Statement and Budget Report. Alongside the revenue raised by the measure, unincorporated businesses have benefited from lower tax rates by incorporating.

 The Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs keeps the situation in respect of all controlled drugs under review. Methylamphetamine was considered at the ACMD's Technical Committee meeting on 11&nbsp;March. Evidence given at the meeting suggested that the level of methylamphetamine use in the UK at present is not a significant problem, and there is no evidence to suggest it is likely to become one in the foreseeable future. The Advisory Council is to further consider the matter at its meeting on 1&nbsp;April.
<P>

<a name="40331w05.html_para4">It was highlighted at the meeting on 11&nbsp;March that methylamphetamine is a dependent inducing drug that is stronger than normal amphetamine. It has links with the development of mental illness, with users sometimes showing signs of violence, paranoia and anxiety. The effects of the drug last longer than cocaine or crack. The effects of amphetamine are similar to, but generally less severe than for methylamphetamine. Cocaine is a very dependence-inducing drug. Its harms include chest pains which can lead to potentially fatal heart problems. Crack has the same short-lived effects as cocaine but is much stronger. Crack is very addictive and chronic users are likely to suffer from mood swings, paranoia, aggression and mental illnesses.
<P>

<a name="40331w05.html_para5">The level of methylamphetamine use in the United Kingdom is not at present significant. In 2003 only 415 grams of methylamphetamine was seized by the police. Laevoamphetamine and dextroamphetamine are two isomers that are used to make amphetamine and are not misused separately. According to the British Crime Survey 2002&#150;03, 1.6&nbsp;per cent. of the population in England and Wales in the 16 to 59 age group have used amphetamine in the last 12 months.
<P>

<a name="40331w05.html_para6">No specific assessment has been carried out of the extent to which amphetamine use leads to violent and aggressive behaviour. The Advisory Council last formally considered amphetamine in November 1995. As stated above, the Advisory Council's Technical Committee considered the harms of methylamphetamine at its meeting on 11&nbsp;March.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40331w06.html_spnew0"><B> Caroline Flint: </B> 
 The Home Office has not commissioned or evaluated any formal research on the efficacy of animal experiments. Animal experiments must be judged to be potentially efficacious in order to be licensed under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, which requires that animals may only be used in scientific procedures where such use is fully justified, where the likely benefits outweigh the costs to the animals involved, and where the procedures are most likely to produce satisfactory results. Also, under the conditions attached to their certificates of designation under the 1986 Act, all places that undertake animal experiments are obliged to have an ethical review process, one of the functions of which is to review the efficacy and conduct of the work undertaken under licence at the establishment. In addition, research councils and charities fund many research projects carried out under the 1986 Act and the work done is reported to and evaluated by them. Other work is funded by pharmaceutical companies and is subject to internal scrutiny within those companies. The safety and efficacy testing needed before people are exposed to new drugs is evaluated by the relevant regulators.

 The deployment of officers to units dealing with child abuse investigations and their training in forensic investigation skills is a matter for individual chief officers. In addition a number of private companies provide forensic examination services which are regularly utilised by law enforcement agencies. There is no centrally aggregated figure of these resources.

<P>

<a name="40331w06.html_para0">In addition to the on-going support for high tech crime, in December 2002 the Home Office provided a one-off payment of &#163;&#189; million to the Association of Chief Police Officers to support operations to combat child abuse on the internet. This money has been used in part to provide relevant hardware and software, and also to train 86 individuals within forces in basic forensic analysis this financial year. The Home Office is currently producing tactical guidance for managers of computer crime units within forces which will include advice on running these units and practical guidance on procedures and tools for forensic analysis.
<P>

<a name="40331w06.html_para1">Every police force in England and Wales has a computer crime unit and a child protection/child abuse investigation team which has expertise in the recovery of forensic evidence and network investigation. These skills are utilised in on-line child abuse investigations. Whilst the degree of expertise and training within these units will vary from force to force, all forces have specialists in dealing with such cases.
<P>

<a name="40331w06.html_para2">With regard to training police who are not part of specialist units, there is a module included in the probationary training for all new police officers covering the internet and new technology to raise their awareness of how paedophiles and other criminals can exploit this technology. Centrex are also developing an on-line training package for existing officers. I have also made available &#163;100,000 to facilitate the development of a joint awareness package covering how children and those who exploit them use these technologies. This package will be aimed at all professionals with a role in child protection, including social workers, police and probation officers.
<P>

<a name="40331w06.html_para3">A major consultation on the future of police reform was launched on 4&nbsp;November 2003 entitled 'Policing: Building Safer Communities Together'. This raised a number of questions including whether there is a need for larger strategic forces, and specialised 'lead' forces to tackle certain issues, such as on-line paedophilia. Responses to the consultation paper are now being considered and we will publish firmer proposals for consultation later this year in relation to these issues.
<P>

<a name="40331w06.html_para4">I understand from figures provided by the Internet Watch Foundation that from the images reported to them in 2003, 55&nbsp;per cent. of child abuse content is believed to be hosted in the United States.

<a name="40331w06.html_para6">A problem for all law enforcement agencies is the identification of children featured in child abuse images.

<P>

<a name="40331w06.html_para9">Secure remand powers are intended for young people charged with the most serious and persistent offending.

 Information relating to the number of Drug Treatment and Testing Orders (DTTOs) made in the York Petty Sessional Area (PSA) broken down by bench areas together with success rates of these orders and the number that have been revoked and reasons for this is not centrally available.
<P>

<a name="40331w07.html_para0">Data provided by probation areas to the National Probation Directorate show that in England and Wales between October 2000 and December 2003 18,397 orders were made. 16&nbsp;per cent. of these were completed successfully, and 34&nbsp;per cent. remained on the order. In the same period, 11,750 orders terminated, 24&nbsp;per cent. of which were for successful completion.
<P>

<a name="40331w07.html_para1">Completion rates of DTTOs do not necessarily show the whole picture in respect of success of these orders. An evaluation of the three DTTO pilots found that, on average, offenders committed 75&nbsp;per cent. fewer offences while on the order and reduced their spend on drugs by over 90&nbsp;per cent. A two-year follow-up reconviction study found that there was a significant reduction in the average number of convictions per year in the two years following the order in all three pilot sites.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40331w08.html_spnew9"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 The humanitarian crisis continues to be fuelled by a number of factors including the HIV/AIDS epidemic, Government of Zimbabwe's misguided economic policies, the fast track land programme, and late rains. Up to 8&nbsp;million Zimbabweans are currently facing food shortages prior to the harvest in April 2004. In addition, the Government of Zimbabwe is increasingly incapable of providing basic social services such as water and sanitation, health and education to its population.
<P>

<a name="40331w08.html_para2">The 2004 harvest may provide less than half the food needs of the population, mainly due to lack of seeds, fertilizer and other agricultural inputs. Even with a change in the political climate, the need for a humanitarian response in Zimbabwe will continue at least until the April 2005 harvest, and possibly beyond.

 According to the EFA Global Monitoring Report 2003&#150;4, girls' enrolments have increased faster than those of boys over the decade to 2000. The Net Enrolment Ratio (NER) for girls' primary enrolment in developing countries has increased from 73.5&nbsp;per cent. in 1990, to 78.9&nbsp;per cent. in 2000. The Gender Parity Index (GPI), which measures the ratio between girls' and boys' enrolments rates, has also improved from 0.89 in 1990 to 0.93 in 2000 for primary education, thereby closing the gap in East Asia and the Pacific. Of the 128 countries for which there is data currently available (including developing countries), 81 countries have achieved gender parity in primary education.

 Substantial progress has been made since 2002 in improving the Palestinian Authority's financial management, oversight of public spending and accountability.

DFID has helped the World Bank carry out a thorough Country Financial Accountability Assessment, which has set out an agenda for further improvements in these areas. The continuing need for donors to support the Palestinian Authority budget directly will ensure that these areas remain under close scrutiny.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40331w09.html_spnew1"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 The Great Lakes region is emerging from 10 years of conflict, from the 1994 genocide in Rwanda to five years of war in the Democratic Republic of Congo, in which appalling human rights violations were committed and which involved, amongst others, Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi. There has been real progress but expectations of progress in reconstruction must be seen in this context.
<P>

<a name="40331w09.html_para0">The UN Secretary General is assisting preparations for an International Conference to address all the issues arising from reconstruction within the Great Lakes region. The UK fully supports this and will assist as appropriate.
<P>

<a name="40331w09.html_para1">In the Democratic Republic of Congo, a transitional national government was inaugurated in July last year. It brings together the main warring factions in a power-sharing arrangement. This is a major step towards providing an environment in which reconstruction can take place. Its task is to take the country to the first democratic elections in 30 years in 2005&#150;06. It has also started to reconstruct the country but the challenge and needs are huge given the high levels of poverty, dilapidated infrastructure and continuing ethnic tension.




<P>
<P><I>31 Mar 2004 : Column 1433W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="40331w09.html_para2">In Rwanda, in the context of the events in 1994 and the reconciliation challenges posed since, progress towards national reconstruction has been remarkable. In order to deal with the large numbers of accused "g&#233;nocidaires" in prisons throughout Rwanda, the Rwandan Government introduced a traditional system of community justice to handle the lower categories of crime. The Rwanda Demobilisation and Reintegration Programme (RDRP), which co-ordinates the demobilisation, reinsertion and reintegration of ex-combatants, has led to the demobilisation of 46,000 soldiers since 1997. 2003 saw the culmination of the transition period marked by a referendum on a new Constitution and the election of a new government&#151;the first pluralistic elections in Rwanda's history. Despite mixed reviews from some election observers, the election process represented a significant milestone in Rwanda's democratic evolution.
<P>

<a name="40331w09.html_para3">Uganda has benefited from a period of relative internal stability since 1986. Significant progress has been made in relation to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The HIV/AIDS MDG was achieved in 1996 and Uganda is on track to meet the income poverty MDG, which requires that only 28&nbsp;per cent. of the population be living in income poverty by 2015. High economic growth has been achieved over a sustained period through sound economic policies, favourable terms of trade, and the positive effects of rural livelihood diversification. The latest data suggests 38&nbsp;per cent. of the population currently live below the national poverty line compared to 56&nbsp;per cent. in 1992. Much of this success has been achieved through the implementation of the Government's Poverty Eradication Action Plan. This is now being revised, and will be the basis for future poverty reduction activities. The current conflict in northern Uganda could negatively affect the progress that has been made. We are monitoring this situation closely.
<P>

<a name="40331w09.html_para4">Burundi's three-year transition from civil war to peace and a democratically elected government is due to be complete in November this year. However, conflict still continues between the government and the FNL, the remaining rebel force. The international community, within which the UK is playing an active part, is helping Burundi achieve the goal of a fully comprehensive ceasefire, prepare for elections, and begin the process of demobilising the combatants and reintegrating the bulk of them into civilian life.
<P>

<a name="40331w09.html_para5">DFID fully supports all the countries of the Great Lakes region in their efforts towards reconstruction, with programmes in 2003&#150;04 of &#163;20&nbsp;million for the DRC, &#163;37&nbsp;million for Rwanda, &#163;64.5&nbsp;million for Uganda and &#163;11.6&nbsp;million for Burundi.

In this respect, we welcome the signing in New York on 25&nbsp;September 2003 of a Good Neighbourly Pact, which included commitments by the governments that all support for armed groups should end and that there should be no involvement in any illegal exploitation of natural resources of the DRC.

 The Department is involved in projects implemented under the Community Assistance for Reconstruction, Development and Stabilisation (CARDS) programme by contributing the UK's share of the European Commission budget allocated to CARDS and by participating in the Management Committee established to define country strategies and oversee the programme. In addition proposals for spending in Serbia, Montenegro, Kosovo, Albania and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM) are approved by the Governing Board of the European Agency for Reconstruction, on which the Department is also represented. Implementation of specific projects (including procurement, which is governed by EC procurement rules) is the responsibility of the Commission.
<P>

<a name="40331w09.html_para13">When considering Commission funding proposals, the Department took a wide range of factors into consideration, including likely impact, cost-effectiveness and value for money. Many of the 2002 projects are in the early stages of implementation. An assessment of the projects will only be possible once they have been completed. The EC, through its results-orientated management system and strengthened evaluation systems, is best placed to carry out such an assessment.

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what estimate he has made of the number of <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;teachers, <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;nurses and <i>(c)</i>&nbsp;front-line health sector staff other than nurses that are likely to die from HIV/AIDS and related illnesses in sub-Saharan Africa in the next 10 years.

: In sub-Saharan Africa HIV/AIDS is killing people in the prime of their working lives and weakening the ability of many countries to fill key public service posts needed to maintain essential service delivery. The problem is compounded by the increased demand for HIV/AIDS services (treatment, care and prevention) that must be met by a diminishing workforce.

<a name="40331w11.html_para0">We are, however, still at an early stage of understanding the direct extent of the impact on front-line health and education personnel as a result of death and illness from HIV/AIDS. The data available has limitations in terms of consistency and comparability.
<P>

<a name="40331w11.html_para1">The Department for International Development is working with development partners to assist Ministries of Education in assessing the impact of HIV/AIDS on teachers and in developing educational and management plans to mitigate those impacts. We have supported the preparation of impact assessment studies on the education systems in Botswana, Zimbabwe and Rwanda. We are working as a member of the UNAIDS Inter-Agency Task Team on Education and HIV/AIDS, to train education planners on HIV/AIDS through a programme of workshops under the leadership of the World Bank. We are further supporting the UNESCO International Institute for Educational Planning to carry out research on the impact of HIV/AIDS on education in sub-Saharan Africa. DFID also supports the work of the United Nations Commission on HIV/AIDS and Governance (CHGA), which is currently undertaking research to map the implications of capacity losses from HIV/AIDS for the maintenance of state structures and economic development in Ethiopia, Kenya, Senegal, Zambia, and the Democratic Republic of Congo. The research will specifically investigate the implications of HIV/AIDS on service provision in the public and private sector. It will report its findings to the UN Secretary General, Kofi Annan in 2005. One study by CHGA estimates that 10&#150;15&nbsp;per cent. of health service staff in Mozambique could die from HIV/AIDS between 2002 and 2010. This would have very damaging consequences for an already extremely weak and under-staffed health system.
<P>

<a name="40331w11.html_para2">The UK's new strategy on HIV/AIDS is being developed in consultation with stakeholders. The strategy, which will be published in July, will emphasise the importance of assisting countries to develop both short-term "emergency" solutions to address the current shortage of health and education personnel, and to take a longer-term view of human resource planning and management in the light of the impact of the HIV/AIDS epidemic.

 The Department for International Development (DFID) recognises the hazards of indoor air pollution from cooking on poorly designed wood, dung and coal burning stoves&#151;the main source of cooking and heating for half the global population. Women are disproportionately affected because the burden of cooking tends to fall on them. In addition,

 DFID's assistance to St. Helena in the coming Financial Year, as part of a new three-year package, will be discussed with the island Government in St. Helena next month.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40331w12.html_wqn2"><B> Hugh Bayley: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what support <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;his Department and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;UK educational institutions have given to develop courses for African educational institutions in respect of (i) teacher training courses, (ii) training of health professionals, (iii) distance learning courses and (iv) other courses; and if he will make a statement.  [164422]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40331w12.html_spnew2"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 The existence of high quality teacher training institutions and infrastructures is central to the delivery of Education For All in Africa. Likewise, well-educated health professionals are critically important for the delivery of programmes designed to reduce the impact of HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis. Appropriate distance education programmes, delivered in part through the use of modern Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs), can help to provide courses and resources to teachers and health professionals who would not otherwise have access to them.
<P>

<a name="40331w12.html_para0">DFID is therefore committed to providing support to African Governments and educators to help them to develop sustainable and relevant programmes that will deliver such training. We do this both through the substantial budgetary support that we provide for African Governments, and also through more focused programmes of technical assistance. The Department for International Development is committed to spending over &#163;1 billion for education in the next three to five years, including a substantial investment in Africa. Furthermore, the &#163;7&nbsp;million Prime Minister's Imfundo initiative (www.imfundo.org) is working in eight African countries to use ICTs to deliver enhanced educational programmes in association with partners drawn from the private sector, civil society and academic institutions, and focuses particularly on teacher training. We are also working closely with 



<P>
<P><I>31 Mar 2004 : Column 1447W</I><P>
colleagues in the Department for Education and Skills, to help ensure that best UK practice in educational training can be shared with our partner governments in Africa.
<P>

<a name="40331w12.html_para1">Other relevant initiatives supported by DFID include &#163;2&nbsp;million support for the African Virtual University (www.avu.org) which delivers distance based university level courses across Africa, and &#163;1&nbsp;million a year funding for the Commonwealth of Learning (www. col.org), an intergovernmental organisation created by Commonwealth Heads of Government to encourage the development and sharing of open learning and distance education knowledge, resources and technologies.
<P>

<a name="40331w12.html_para2">The UK Higher Education Institutions are independent and autonomous bodies, and as such no central record is kept of the number and range of distance learning courses suitable for delivery in Africa, or indeed elsewhere. The Higher Education and Research Opportunities (HERO) website (www.hero. ac.uk) has details of courses available at UK Higher Education Institutions, including those delivered by distance learning. However, many UK institutions do indeed provide support for capacity building and course development in the fields of education and health. DFID has, for example, supported specific distance-learning initiatives between African and British universities in these fields through the Commonwealth Scholarship Commission, and organisations such as The British Council also help to co-ordinate such collaborative activities.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs how much money overseas students applying for a visa to study in the UK are required to show that they have available to support themselves while they are in the UK.  [164155]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40331w12.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 There is no set amount of money that overseas students need to show that they have available in order to gain entry clearance to study in the UK. The Immigration Rules state that students must be able to show that they have sufficient funds to pay for their course and accommodate themselves without working or help from public funds. There are two exceptions to this. A student can meet some of his/her costs through earnings from employment if that employment is either at a publicly funded institution of further or higher education which is itself providing and guaranteeing the employment or a sandwich course placement which the college or university can guarantee will be available to the student.
<P>

<a name="40331w12.html_para3">As a rough guideline the British Council estimates student living costs (excluding fees) for 2002&#150;03 as &#163;768 per calendar month (&#163;6,912 per academic year, which is a nine month period) for a course in London and &#163;600 per calendar month (&#163;5,400 per academic year) for a course outside London. Offer letters from educational establishments often contain an estimated cost for living expenses and the Entry Clearance Officer can also use these figures as a guide.

<P>
<P><I>31 Mar 2004 : Column 1462W</I><P>
were concerned about the resource implications of the proposal, both for the fishing industry and government. In discussion we dropped our request for exemptions from mandatory use of acoustic deterrent devices ("pingers") in the 0&#150;6 nautical mile zone and in ICES Area VIId. We argued against exemptions for under 12 metre vessels to have to use "pingers" on fishing nets and for those under 15 metres to be exempt from observer requirements. We thought only smaller vessels should be exempted but most other Member States supported the proposal. We were pleased that the Regulation offers flexibility for those member states which already have robust bycatch data to design appropriate monitoring schemes alongside provisions for mandatory monitoring schemes for those that do not. A requirement has been included in the Regulation for pilot projects to monitor the effects of "pinger" usage and to observe bycatch on under 15 metre vessels. These pilot schemes have to be designed to deliver good quality scientific data which will be used to review the Regulation after two years' experience. The Regulation also provides for the progressive phasing out of drift nets in the Baltic, which will culminate in a total ban on 1&nbsp;January 2008. Taken as a whole the package is an important advance in the protection of small cetaceans.

 Since the Department's creation in June 2001, we have placed sustainability at the heart of our actions to protect and ensure a better quality of life for both humans and livestock. Our policies for food, health, the environment and animals can only prosper and endure if they are fully integrated so that they don't undermine each other. The elements of protecting human health and protecting and promoting animal welfare are complementary. By improving animal welfare, the risk of disease in animals, including diseases transmissible to humans, is reduced.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40331w16.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Ecologists have tried to classify setts according to size and function. The normal convention in ecological badger surveys is to recognise four categories of setts: main, subsidiary, annex and outlier, although there are other methods of surveying. Defra Wildlife Unit staff distinguish main setts on the basis of a number of factors including the number of holes, activity, latrine location, topography and relationship to other larger setts; secondary or 'other' setts are those not fitting the description of main setts.
<P>

<a name="40331w16.html_para9">Population estimates may be based on the number of main setts, with an estimated average number of badgers for a social group being applied per main sett. 



<P>
<P><I>31 Mar 2004 : Column 1464W</I><P>
This approach relies upon accurate identification of main setts, and would not be affected by any other type of sett being missed; however if a main sett were mis-classified e.g. as a subsidiary sett, it would affect the population estimate.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what conclusions her Department has reached on whether the proportion of diseased badgers in road traffic accidents is representative of the incidence of the disease in the badger population as a whole.  [158806]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40331w16.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The road traffic accident (RTA) survey has been designed to establish whether the incidence of bovine TB in badgers collected from road verges and other locations is representative of the prevalence of the disease in the badger population in that area. A first analysis, using the information from carcases collected so far, is expected to be completed in April.

<a name="40331w16.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The levy which we have in mind would be raised on a per head basis, on all the animals susceptible to any disease covered by the levy fund. Different rates of levy would be set for different categories of animals, in line with the categories which are set for the compensation regime.

 The Government will pay compensation to farmers and other keepers, when livestock is slaughtered for the purpose of disease control under Section 31 or Section 32 of the Animal Health Act 1981. No compensation is payable for consequential losses. Farmers, like other businesses, need to take into account any risks to their business, including the risk of disease posed by wildlife.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40331w16.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The Government recognise that eradication of bovine TB is unlikely to be achieved in the next 10 years using current control methods. The public consultation on a revised TB strategy for Great Britain is looking at what might be achieved in this time scale. A desirable outcome would be to achieve Officially Tuberculosis Free status, as defined in EU Directive 64/432/EEC. Our priority in the shorter term must be to prevent the spread of the disease from areas of GB where incidence is high to areas where it is low.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what her best estimate is of the total costs of bovine TB for each of the years from 2004&#150;05 to 2012&#150;13, based on the assumptions used for the graph on page 23 of her consultation document, "Preparing for a new GB strategy on Bovine Tuberculosis", but in the absence of a significant wildlife reservoir.  [158810]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40331w16.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 It is not possible to estimate this figure. To do so would require knowledge of the quantitative contribution of wildlife to the causation of TB in cattle, a fact not currently known.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs whether the current objective of badger TB vaccine research is to <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;achieve a high level of immunity in the badger population and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;reduce bacterial shedding by badgers which have succumbed to the disease.  [158811]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40331w16.html_spnew14"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 A vaccine targeted at badgers would not be required to protect individual badgers against TB, but would need to reduce the transmission to cattle. Thus a vaccine that reduces the severity of the disease and/or reduces shedding of the bacteria from infected badgers by inducing protective immunity could have the desired effect. This is the current objective of badger TB vaccine research.

<P>
<a name="40331w16.html_spnew15"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 There are no plans to develop a generic animal vaccine at present. However Defra is funding research into the development of specific badger and cattle vaccines and associated diagnostic tests.
<P>

<a name="40331w16.html_para12">In particular, Defra is organising a workshop aimed at progressing badger vaccine development from the current research to delivery of a licensed product (BCG based vaccine) to badgers in the field.

The workshop should clarify timescales, costs and the roles for various partners, and possible models for engagement between Government, Industry and beneficiaries in the development of a badger vaccine.

<P>
<P>

 The amount of perturbation is a factor of the degree of culling, and the number of badgers surviving it. The more or, conversely, the less effective a badger culling programme is, the less the perturbation effect may be. To make the sort of assessment the hon. Member suggests would require a study designed to quantify accurately the effects on the levels of perturbation that different culling programmes would have. Given the number of replicates that would be required, at varying levels of culling efficiency and badger density, this would be difficult to achieve.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what assessment he has made of the implications for <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;acute services and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;care for the elderly as a result of the funding shortfall within the Ulster Community and Hospitals Trust.  [164574]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40331w19.html_spnew1"><B> Angela Smith: </B> 
 The Department is aware that there have been additional service pressures placed on the Ulster Community and Hospitals Trust as a result of funding issues, but at this stage the Trust expects to achieve a break-even position for 2003&#150;04.
<P>

<a name="40331w19.html_para0">In recognition of the demands placed on the Trust, during 2003&#150;04 an extra &#163;1&nbsp;million funding was made available to support Acute Services and the Elderly Programme of Care in the North Down and Ards area. Further work is also being carried out on re-balancing funding allocations, with a subsequent consultation exercise planned to take place in May 2004.
<P>

<a name="40331w19.html_para1">In the longer term, developments at the Ulster Hospital, including the current major re-development programme, are expected to address the equity gap. The Department continues to monitor the position and has been assured that all reasonable steps are being taken to address pressures on local community and hospital services.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40331w19.html_spnew2"><B> Angela Smith: </B> 
 Equity in resource allocation to localities such as that covered by the Ulster Community and Hospitals Trust is a matter for the Board concerned. In 2003&#150;04, the Eastern Board has allocated &#163;0.7&nbsp;million specifically to address the equity issue in North Down and Ards. In addition, a further &#163;1&nbsp;million funding was made available to support Acute services and the Elderly Programme of Care. The Eastern Board will continue to address the issue of equity within its resource constraints.
<P>

<a name="40331w19.html_para2">On-going developments at the Ulster Hospital are expected to close the equity gap in Acute services over a number of years. In addition, a review of the formula currently used to allocate resources to HSS Boards, due for consultation in May 2004, may alter the equity position to some extent at locality level. The Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety will continue to work closely with the Eastern Board on this matter.

<P>
<a name="40331w20.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The Ministry of Defence has no record of missiles being lost in the Bristol Channel or Severn Estuary in either 2001 or 2003. We are aware of only one incident of armaments being lost in the Bristol Channel or Severn estuary in the last five years. In March 2002, a pallet of munitions was lost at the St. Thomas' Head range near Weston-super-Mare, which is operated by QinetiQ. The pallet is presumed to have been swept away by very strong spring tides. The pallet contained eight anti tank bar mines (with the fuses removed) and 20 warheads which had been removed from Swingfire missiles.
<P>

<a name="40331w20.html_para4">Extensive searches have been undertaken by the Avon and Somerset Constabulary, HM Coastguard, the Royal Air Force, the Royal Navy Southern Diving Group (SDG) and QinetiQ. The pallet has not, however, been located.
<P>

<a name="40331w20.html_para5">The SDG conducted two searches of the range area, consuming around 160 man-hours in March 2002 and about 220 man-hours in October 2002. QinetiQ carried out searches on foot and by boat and helicopter, expending a total of more than 110 man-hours. The RAF consumed a total of 15 man-hours on the task, including transit to and from the search area. The MOD does not have details of the resources consumed by either the Avon and Somerset Constabulary or HM Coastguard.
<P>

<a name="40331w20.html_para6">Use of the St. Thomas' Head range continues to be covered by the Long Term Partnering Agreement that has been negotiated with QinetiQ for the delivery of a long term test and evaluation capability to the MOD.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40331w21.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The gifting of military equipment is permissible under the Global Conflict Prevention Pool (GCPP) where it is considered essential to the success of an agreed strategy and endorsed by Pool officials on the relevant strategy Steering Team or Ministers. Gifts over &#163;100,000 require a Departmental Minute to be laid before both Houses, under the normal 14 working days rule, before a final decision is taken. An export licence, or export licence waiver, is sought as appropriate. Potentially lethal military equipment (such as weapons and ammunition) can only be gifted through the GCPP with the approval of Ministers.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will make a statement on his policy towards postal services for forces on operations overseas.  [164197]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40331w21.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Postal services for HM Forces on overseas operations form part of the overall Operational Welfare Package (OWP). The postal element of this consists of free Forces Air Letters ("Blueys") and their electronic equivalent, the "e-Bluey", and airmail letters and packets up to 2kg at a subsidised rate equivalent to UK inland first class postage. When operational circumstances permit, a surface parcel service is also made available at a subsidised rate.
<P>

<a name="40331w21.html_para1">In addition to these comprehensive arrangements, an exceptional extension to the service for Iraq only was provided from 17&nbsp;April 2003 to enable families of deployed personnel to post airmail letters and packets up to 2kg free of charge. The free packet service was introduced in recognition of the particularly austere conditions faced by personnel in Iraq and of the fact that parts of the OWP were not available to them. Since the entire OWP will be available from April, I advised the House in my Written Statement of 27&nbsp;February 2004, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 69&#150;70WS, that this temporary free postal service would be discontinued with effect from 8&nbsp;April 2004, to bring provisions in Iraq into line with those for other operational theatres.

<i>[holding answer 25&nbsp;March 2004]:</i> The Department has been developing plans for a reduction of up to 18,000 posts since 2002. This is now part of a four-year plan to reduce the number of posts by 30,000. This will reflect the new business model being rolled-out in Jobcentre Plus including more front-line staff conducting work-focused interviews; a Pension Transformation Programme and reductions in staffing in the Pension Service; the introduction of Child Support reform; and savings in "back office" functions in HR, finance and IT support.
<P>

 The borrowing powers of elected regional assemblies were set out in Chapter 5 of the White Paper "Your Region, Your Choice: Revitalising the English Regions", published in May 2002 (Cm 5511).
<P>

<a name="40331w27.html_para9">In summary, the White Paper states that regional assemblies' capital expenditure will generally be funded by central Government grant. But there may be circumstances in which an assembly wishes to borrow to raise money for capital expenditure in addition to that provided by central Government. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister propose to give regional assemblies borrowing powers subject to set limits to fund capital expenditure where they can afford to finance it from their revenue budgets. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister also propose to give them temporary borrowing powers for cash management purposes.

We look forward to working with the industry and other key stakeholders on this voluntary social responsibility scheme.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what the average income is of <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;NHS and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;private sector dentists.  [158180]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40331w28.html_spnew10"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 The average gross fee income of a general dental service (GDS) dentist for national health service work in 2002&#150;03 was &#163;98,000 in England. 



<P>
<P><I>31 Mar 2004 : Column 1513W</I><P>
Gross fee income of a NHS dentist includes both their personal remuneration as well as business expenses such as staff salaries, laboratory charges and dental consumables.
<P>

<a name="40331w28.html_para6">The income distribution is very wide reflecting the large differences in the amount of GDS work done by individual dentists. Principal GDS dentists do not have a standard working week. They are self employed and choose the amount of GDS work they do. Most dentists will have other income either from private dentistry or from other NHS work. Almost one-quarter of GDS dentists had gross fee income of less than &#163;40,000 in 2002&#150;03; these dentists will have spent only a small proportion of their week doing GDS work.
<P>

<a name="40331w28.html_para7">To produce an income estimate for dentists with a reasonable commitment to the GDS, dentists with gross fee income of less than &#163;55,600 may be excluded. This gives average gross fee income for dentists with a reasonable GDS commitment of &#163;137,000 in 2002&#150;03. The excluded dentists with gross fee income of less than &#163;55,600 will have spent about two days a week or less doing GDS work.
<P>

<a name="40331w28.html_para8">Taking into account estimated expenses, average net fee income of a GDS dentist with a reasonable GDS commitment was around &#163;61,000 in 2002&#150;03. The average GDS net fee income for all dentists including the lowest GDS earners was about &#163;43,000 in 2002&#150;03.
<P>

<a name="40331w28.html_para9">In addition dentists receive other payments such as commitment payments which increase average net income by about &#163;2,000 in 2002&#150;03. So total net income from the GDS averaged about &#163;63,000 for dentists with a reasonable GDS commitment whilst the average net income from the GDS for all dentists including the low GDS earners was about &#163;45,000.
<P>

<a name="40331w28.html_para10">Income of dentists working solely privately is not available. Inland Revenue information for 2001&#150;02 shows that for GDS dentists' average gross income for all self employed work in Great Britain was 163,000 gross or 71,000 net of expenses. This average covers both full-time and part-time dentists.

 A comprehensive range of drug treatment is available to address the differing needs of drug misusers. The general health examination/assessment a prisoner receives on first reception into custody aims to identify past and present drug usage and engagement with community drugs teams.

This can be either detoxification or substitute prescribing, as a prelude to a broader based drug treatment programme.

 The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990 provides a regulatory framework for the provision of treatment involving in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and human embryo research. These activities are licensed by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA). Inspection of licensed establishments is the cornerstone of the HFEA's work to ensure compliance with Act, the HFEA's code of practice and the conditions upon which the establishment's licence has been granted.
<P>

<a name="40331w29.html_para6">It is not a simple matter of an establishment either "passing or failing" a HFEA inspection. Licensed establishments are expected to operate to set standards and regular inspections take place to ensure these standards are maintained. Where an inspection team considers that an establishment needs to make improvement in a certain area of its operation, a HFEA licence committee that considers the inspection report may decide to attach additional conditions to the licence, with a deadline for implementing improvements if necessary. Failure to comply with the conditions of a licence would be considered by a licence committee and could lead to the revocation of the licence. Were practice to be found of so poor a standard that patients were placed at risk, a licence committee would, as a matter of urgency, consider suspension of the licence and, if necessary, revocation.
<P>

<a name="40331w29.html_para7">The HFEA code of practice sets out standards of conduct and practice that licensed establishments are expected to observe. The new edition of the code, which came into force on 1&nbsp;March 2004, limits the number of eggs or embryos that can be placed in a woman under age 40, in any one treatment cycle, to a maximum of two. The purpose of this is to limit, as far as possible, multiple pregnancies, which can have a significant medical and social impact on the resulting children and their families, as well as having cost implications for the national health service for the care of the mother and babies. This guidance is supported by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence's guideline on fertility treatment which also recommends that ovarian stimulation should not be offered where the female patient has no fertility problems herself to prevent the risk of a multiple pregnancy. Together these measures should reduce the number of multiple births.
<P>

<a name="40331w29.html_para8">There are no plans to require licensed treatment clinics, a number of which operate within the NHS, to reimburse the health service for costs resulting from the care of multiple pregnancies and births.
<P>

<a name="40331w29.html_para9">The Government have not commissioned any research into the long term effects of in vitro fertilisation (IVF). However, the HFEA has been working with the Medical Research Council to determine what follow-up studies may be needed to assess both the treatments used and any long-term health implications for patients and children born as a result of fertility treatments, including IVF.
<P>

<a name="40331w29.html_para10">When considering applications for embryo research, members of the HFEA are required to reach decisions on the basis of a fair and impartial assessment of the

facts. The HFEA only licences embryo research to take place in circumstances specified by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990 and in accordance with the requirements of the Act. No HFEA members have expressed objection to the principles in the Act.
<P>

<a name="40331w29.html_para11">Compliance with the prohibition in section 3(4) of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990 on the keeping or using in treatment or research of embryos beyond the 14 day limit is monitored though the HFEA inspection process.

<a name="40331w29.html_para12">Section 3A of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990 prohibits the use in fertility treatment of eggs taken from aborted fetuses. There are no plans to change this. Under the Human Tissue Bill storage of fetal tissue for research purposes would be subject to licensing by the Human Tissue Authority.

 The Department is concerned about wastage from over-prescribing of medicines and has introduced a number of initiatives to address this. These include; the medicines management collaborative schemes, that demonstrate innovation and good practice in medicines management and the joint medicines partnership task force, that encourages the involvement of patients in their treatment decisions and repeat dispensing which enables the pharmacist to check whether patients still need the medicines prescribed for them. Improved prescribing and medicines management is also being encouraged through the quality and outcomes framework, within the new general practitioner contracts.

Health Development Agency) considered the evidence from all high quality systematic and other reviews and meta-analyses published since 1996. They concluded that 'good' evidence (for example, drawn from high quality reviews) exists for the effectiveness of 'school-based sex education', particularly linked to contraceptive services (measured against knowledge, attitudes, delaying sexual activity and/or reducing pregnancy rates).

<a name="40331w31.html_para5">Pension liabilities, how they are funded and what pension entitlements staff are legally entitled to, are matters for the directors of ECBP and the trustees of the pension scheme. The Department cannot take on the liabilities of private organisations. The Department's primary concern is to maintain continuity of service to young people in England.

1996&#150;97 was &#163;2,220, as recorded by the authority on its RO1 form. The figures are not directly comparable since the former reflects the total provision made available to the authority whereas the latter reflects what the authority actually spent within schools. 2004&#150;05 funding figures are based on pupil numbers used in the Education Formula Spending Share calculation. Expenditure figures are calculated using pupil numbers from the annual school census adjusted to the appropriate financial year.

 The organisation of school provision, including the viability of schools, is a local matter. The Department does not promote a particular organisational model since this depends on the needs and circumstances of an area. Our plans for transforming secondary education remain fixed on improving teaching and learning supported by a drive for building strong school leadership teams; specialism and collaboration; reforming the school workforce and developing partnerships beyond the classroom. Whatever the pattern of local school provision, our aim is that all schools should be equipped to personalise learning to ensure high expectations for all, based on a sound knowledge and understanding of each child's learning needs.

<a name="40331w34.html_para6">The TPS is a group scheme where the cost of scheme benefits is shared between employers and employees, with the greater part being met by employers. All TPS employers pay the same contribution rate which is currently 13.5&nbsp;per cent. Between 1972 and 1988, the scheme has provided automatic family benefits for married male teachers and female teachers with a financially dependent husband. In 1988, the scheme was extended to provide automatic family benefits cover for all married teachers.
