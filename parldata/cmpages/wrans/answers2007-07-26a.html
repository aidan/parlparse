<i> [holding answer 25 July 2007]:</i> The Fleet relies on a layered defence approach to defeat an aerial attack. The backbone of the Fleet's ability to defend itself from air attack in the outer layer of maritime air defence will continue to be provided by destroyers. At present, this is achieved using the Type 42 Destroyers equipped with the medium range Sea Dart surface to air missile system. Type 45 Destroyers will gradually replace the Type 42 destroyers. These new ships will be armed with the Principal Anti Air Missile System, enhancing the Fleet's capability to counter the most sophisticated aircraft and anti-ship missiles in the world.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_130"><a name="70726w0001.htm_para0"><a name="07072670000042">In the inner layer of Maritime Air Defence the Fleet's close range air defence capability will continue to be provided by Type 22 and Type 23 Frigates equipped with the Seawolf point defence missile system. Additional air defence capability will also come from a combination of close-in weapon (gun) systems, such as Goalkeeper and Phalanx, and decoys.</p>

 The Ministry of Defence has current research programmes relevant to enhanced blast munitions valued at approximately &#163;10 million, spread over more than five years. These are to investigate the underlying science and are aimed at the assessment of the threat to UK armed forces, what protection is appropriate, and the advantage of incorporation of such technology into weapons.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_132"><a name="70726w0001.htm_para2"><a name="07072670000046">The MOD has one programme which incorporates enhanced blast technology, the Anti Structures Munition (ASM), as announced by my predecessor on 6 February 2006, <i> Official Report,</i> column 34WS, due to enter service at the end of 2009. It will enable infantry to defeat hardened structures such as buildings or bunkers, reducing casualties to our forces while minimising collateral damage. In the interim an 'off the shelf system has been procured until the ASM becomes available. There are currently no plans for future procurement of enhanced blast munitions.</p>

We have identified and published the lessons of the past, accepting that mistakes were made in 1990-91, particularly with regard to medical record keeping. The Government&#146;s view is that there are no substantive issues to be addressed by a public inquiry and that, in particular, it would not help to resolve the long outstanding issue of why veterans are ill; only scientific research might do this. We have funded a substantial programme of research designed to address the key candidate causes so far put forward, but recognising that it would not be sensible to duplicate work being undertaken elsewhere.</p>

regularly reviewed as circumstances change. North West Ambulance Service NHS Trust has recently provided information to the Department on projected numbers for paramedics. I understands that the trust intend to have 1,347 whole time equivalents in employment as paramedics in 2007-08, 1,361 in 2008-09 and 1,375 in 2009-10.</p>

This included the introduction of a code for emergency care practitioners and the North West Ambulance Service NHS Trust recorded 39 ECPs in 2006.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_194"><a name="70726w0009.htm_para7"><a name="07072712001156">More accurate validation processes in 2006 have resulted in the identification and removal of 9,858 duplicate non-medical staff records out of the total workforce figure of 1.3 million in 2006. Earlier years&#146; figures could not be accurately validated in this way and so will be slightly inflated. The level of inflation in earlier years&#146; figures is estimated to be less than 1 per cent. of total across all non-medical staff groups for headcount figures (and negligible for full-time equivalents). This should be taken into consideration when analysing trends over time.</p>

This means that the requirement for the provision of social housing will need to be negotiated and agreed with the local planning authority. The Government have implemented a number of initiatives to assist with land supply for housing. A register of surplus public sector land held by central government bodies has been established. English Partnerships review the sites on the register to identify those which could have the potential for housing development. As at June 2007, there were over 700 sites on the register. Sites are continually being added as they are identified as surplus by landowners and removed once expressions of interest are received after a site has been marketed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_213"><a name="70726w0013.htm_para7"><a name="07072712001985">The Department for Communities and Local Government and English Partnerships also maintain the national land use database of previously developed land (NLUD-PDL). This covers vacant and derelict land and also land in use with potential for development in public and private ownerships. Information on the sites is available from the NLUD website</p>

The procedures for the latter require that a draft order is published and consulted upon at least three months before the amended order is laid before Parliament. Other matters requiring legislation will be considered by the stakeholder working groups which will be advising on implementation of the White Paper. We will be publishing their terms of reference and membership shortly.</p>

 The 2010 inequalities targets for life expectancy, cardiovascular disease and cancer are based on narrowing the gap in mortality between the population as a whole and the fifth of local authority areas with the worst health and deprivation indicators (the Spearhead Group), and the primary care trusts that map to them, by 2010.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_242"><a name="70726w0018.htm_para9"><a name="07072712003432">Life expectancy has increased for both males and females for England as a whole but it has improved more slowly in the Spearhead areas. In England, average life expectancy for males is 76.9 and for females 81.1, in the Spearhead group it is 74.9 for males and 79.6 for females. The slower rate of improvement in has led to a widening of the relative gap in life expectancy between England and the spearhead group. The latest data for 2003-05, show that the average life expectancy in the Spearhead Group was 2.61 per cent. lower than the England average for males, and 1.91 per cent. lower than the England average for females. Therefore, the relative gap has widened by 2 per cent. for men and 8 per cent. for women since the baseline (1995-97).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_243"><a name="70726w0018.htm_para10"><a name="07072712003433">However, although the 2010 target for life expectancy is a challenging one, data for 2003-05 also show that some 60 per cent. of the 70 Spearhead areas are on track to narrow their own life expectancy gap with that of England by 10 per cent. by 2010, compared to baseline for either males or females or both. The information is set out in the following table, with comparison data for 2002-04.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_244"><a name="70726w0018.htm_para11"><a name="07072712003434">Data for 2003-05 have also shown continued improvements in CVD and cancer mortality inequalities between Spearhead areas and the national average since the 1995-97 baseline.

In 2005, the latest year for which data are available, about 95 per cent. of infected pregnant women were diagnosed before delivery. During the 1990s, before antenatal testing was routine, the majority of infected women remained undiagnosed at delivery and therefore appropriate treatment and advice could not be offered.</p>

1. ICD-10 Code: I50.0 Congestive Heart Failure<br>
2. Bed Days During the Year<br>
Bed days within the year include only those days falling between 1 April and 31 March of the data year including unfinished episodes, unless otherwise stated.<br>
3. Diagnosis (Primary Diagnosis)<br>
The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 14 (seven prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data set and provides the main reason why the patient was in hospital.<br>
4. Data Quality<br>
HES are compiled from data sent by over 300 national health service trusts and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England. The Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br>
5. Assessing growth through time<br>
HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. During the years that these records have been collected the NHS there have been ongoing improvements in quality and coverage. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series.<br>
Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example a number of procedures may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and may no longer be accounted in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.<br>
6.Ungrossed Data<br>
Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (ie the data are ungrossed).<br>

2. Data are for International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes V01 to X59, which cover external causes of accidental injury. Data represent a count of all episodes where this diagnosis was mentioned in any of the 14 (seven prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in a HES record.<br>
3. HES are compiled from data sent by over 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts in England. The Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br>
4. When analysing time series of HES data, the impact of improvements over time in data quality and coverage, and of changes in NHS practice need to be borne in mind. For example, a number of procedures may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and may no longer be accounted in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.<br>
 5. Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (ie the data are ungrossed).<br>

<i> Notes</i>:<br>
1. Mental health nurses are those qualified nurses who work within the community psychiatry, other psychiatry, community learning disabilities and other learning disabilities areas.<br>
2. More accurate validation processes in 2006 have resulted in the identification and removal of 9,858 duplicate non-medical staff records out of the total work force figure of 1.3 million in 2006. Earlier years&#146; figures could not be accurately validated in this way and so will be slightly inflated. The level of inflation in earlier years&#146; figures is estimated to be less than 1 per cent. of total across all non-medical staff groups for headcount figures (and negligible for full-time equivalents). This should be taken into consideration when analysing trends over time.<br>

 Aluminium salts are an essential ingredient of some vaccines in enhancing the protection offered by the vaccine. The safety record of aluminium in vaccines has been demonstrated over more than 50 years of use. There are no serious health risks associated with the small quantities of aluminium in some vaccines. As with many vaccine ingredients, aluminium can cause localised reactions such as redness, swelling and/or tenderness at the injection site.</p>

1. Finished Consultant Episode (FCE)<br>
An FCE is defined as a period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. The figures do not represent the number of patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the year.<br>
2. Main Specialty<br>
The main specialty refers to the specialty under which the consultant is contracted.<br>
3. Specialty<br>
Care is needed when analysing Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data by specialty, or by groups of specialties (such as acute). Trusts have different ways of managing specialties and attributing codes so it is better to analyse by specific diagnoses, operations or other recorded information.<br>
4. Low Numbers<br>
Due to reasons of confidentiality, figures between 1 and 5 have been suppressed and replaced with &#145;*&#146;(an asterisk).<br>
5. Data Quality<br>
HES are compiled from data sent by over 300 national health service trusts and primary care trusts in England. The Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br>
6. Ungrossed Data<br>
Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (ie the data are ungrossed).<br>
