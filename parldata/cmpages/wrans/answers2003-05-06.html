<P>
<P>
<a name="30506w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 We plan to publish the consultation document in the very near future.

<P>
<a name="30506w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Lidington: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment she has made of the impact of the European Commission's proposals for CAP reform on growers of unsupported crops.  [109849]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30506w01.html_spnew1"><B> Margaret Beckett: </B> 
 Our published economic analysis of the Commission's proposals for reform of the CAP indicates an overall economic benefit to the UK of about &#163;500 million. We are in discussion with industry representatives about the impact of the proposed new system on producers of unsupported crops.

<a name="30506w01.html_sbhd2"><H3 align=center>Farming</H3>


<P>
<P>
<a name="30506w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Lidington: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment she has made of the financial impact of the European Commission's decoupling proposals on those farm businesses that have acquired IACS registered land since the end of the reference period now proposed by the Commission.  [109837]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30506w01.html_spnew2"><B> Margaret Beckett: </B> 
 It is difficult to predict precisely what the financial impact on such farm businesses will be. However, we are in discussion with the European Commission about possible ways of protecting the interests of such businesses, such as by ensuring that entitlements to the decoupled payment flow to those farming the land on the introduction of the new system. Some producers who have purchased land since the publication of the Commission's proposals will have benefited from lower land prices.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30506w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Lidington: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what representations she has made to the European Commission about the impact of the Commission's decoupling proposals on people who have entered farming after the proposed reference years.  [109838]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30506w01.html_spnew3"><B> Margaret Beckett: </B> 
 The European Commission's proposals include provision for a national reserve of decoupled payment entitlements. The Commission has confirmed that member states can use this reserve to 



<P>
<P><I>6 May 2003 : Column 536W</I><P>
allocate full or enhanced entitlements to producers who have entered farming since the start of the proposed reference period.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30506w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Lidington: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment she has made of the position, under the European Commission's mid-term review proposals, of land rented for grass keep; what her policy is on this matter; and if she will make a statement.  [109844]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30506w01.html_spnew4"><B> Margaret Beckett: </B> 
 It is difficult to predict the likely impact on individual businesses, but our initial analysis suggests that, at an aggregate level, the proposals will not have a significant impact on the rental value of land for grass keep.

<a name="30506w01.html_sbhd4"><H3 align=center>Information Technology</H3>


<P>
<P>
<a name="30506w01.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Lidington: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will make a statement on the compatibility of the information technology systems operated by the <i>(a)</i> State Veterinary Service, <i>(b)</i> British Cattle Movement Service and <i>(c)</i> Rural Payments Agency.  [109843]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30506w01.html_spnew5"><B> Margaret Beckett: </B> 
 The main IT system used by the State Veterinary Service (SVS) to administer their work has been in service for a number of years. When the British Cattle Movement service came into existence, the Cattle Tracing System was set up with links and interfaces to the SVS's system.
<P>

<a name="30506w01.html_para0">A major investment in IT improvements is being made at the BCMS. The system will be moved onto a more secure platform and a facility is being developed to provide for the issue of 'statements' to producers showing details of the animals recorded on their holdings.
<P>

<a name="30506w01.html_para1">The new computer system being developed for bovine schemes under the RPA Change Programme will provide interfaces to the systems used by the BCMS.
<P>

<a name="30506w01.html_para2">Defra is moving forward in a co-ordinated way, using the RPA to lead in the development of Customer and Land registers which will form the basis of Defra-wide information. Care will be taken to ensure interoperability between existing and planned systems.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30506w01.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Lidington: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment she has made of the impact on long leys systems of farming of the European Commission's mid-term review proposals.  [109845]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30506w01.html_spnew6"><B> Margaret Beckett: </B> 
 We have been pressing the European Commission to introduce sufficient flexibility within the rules of the proposed decoupled system to allow such systems of farming to continue.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30506w01.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Lidington: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will make it her policy to press in the Council of Ministers for an exception to be made from the European Commission's definition of permanent pasture to benefit farmers who operate a system of long leys.  [109846]

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30506w01.html_spnew7"><B> Margaret Beckett: </B> 
 We have been pressing the European Commission to allow a greater degree of flexibility in their definition of permanent pasture to ensure that such farmers are not disadvantaged. The Commission appear sympathetic to the issue and we are working with them on a solution.

<a name="30506w01.html_sbhd6"><H3 align=center>Milk Quota</H3>


<P>
<P>
<a name="30506w01.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Lidington: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (1) what assessment she has made of the impact of the proposed milk quota replacement compensation scheme on producers of high butterfat milk;  [110169]
<P>
<UL>(2) if she will make a statement on the method of calculation that she proposes to adopt for the purposes of the milk quota replacement compensation scheme.  [110168]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30506w01.html_spnew8"><B> Margaret Beckett: </B> 
 I assume that the hon. Member is referring to the dairy premium, which it is proposed should be paid in compensation for dairy support price cuts. Under Agenda 2000, these cuts are due to take place from 2005, and under the CAP reform proposals published on 22 January, from 2004. Under the Agenda 2000 agreement, eligibility for the dairy premium was to be based on the net litreage of quota held at the end of the quota year in each year of payment, and set by EC Council Regulation&#151;it was not within national discretion to determine the eligibility criteria. This remains the case under the Commission's current CAP reform proposals, with (decoupled) payments still currently to be based on the net litreage of quota held, but fixed as at 31 March 2004 (that is, they would not vary from year to year).
<P>

<a name="30506w01.html_para3">We have no evidence to suggest that producers of high butterfat milk would suffer any particularly adverse consequences as a result of these proposals, as compared to other dairy producers. Indeed, the reverse might prove the case, as high butterfat milk producers tend to supply the high-value, as opposed to bulk commodity, markets, and could continue to command some premium under the new support arrangements envisaged.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30506w01.html_wqn9"><B> Norman Baker: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs whether it is her policy to allow indefinite disposal of low-level radioactive waste at landfill sites.  [109625]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30506w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 Current policy for controlled burial of low level radioactive wastes at landfill sites is set out in the 1995 White Paper "Review of Radioactive Waste Management Policy: Final Conclusions" (Cm2919). The White Paper concluded that controlled burial to landfill should continue to be available as a disposal route, particularly for "small users" of radioactivity&#151;such as hospitals, universities, research laboratories and non-nuclear industries&#151;subject to agreement of the site operators and the necessary regulatory requirements being met. In addition, I accept that the agreement of local residents is also important. Despite acknowledging that there might be sound economic and radiological grounds for encouraging greater use of controlled burial to landfill, Cm2919 concluded that its greater use by the 



<P>
<P><I>6 May 2003 : Column 538W</I><P>
nuclear industry should not be encouraged due to genuine anxieties that the proposal aroused among local residents.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30506w01.html_wqn10"><B> Norman Baker: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what recent assessment she has made of the <i>(a)</i> public health and <i>(b)</i> environmental risks posed by the disposal of low-level nuclear waste in landfill sites.  [109626]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30506w01.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 An assessment of the radiological impact of disposals of radioactive waste from nuclear sites to Clifton Marsh was carried out in 2002 as part of the Environment Agency's review of radioactive waste disposal authorisations from the BNFL Springfields site. This showed that the operational and post-closure risks were acceptable and in line with regulatory guidance.
<P>

<a name="30506w01.html_para4">An assessment of the impact of disposals to Hilts Quarry will be carried out in 2003 as part of the Environment Agency's review of the radioactive waste disposal authorisations for the Rolls-Royce Derby site.
<P>

<a name="30506w01.html_para5">The Environment Agency has an established programme of environmental monitoring at current and disused landfill sites, focusing on levels of radioactivity in leachate which might arise at landfill sites. The results of this programme are included in the Agency's annual Radioactivity in the Environment report, copies of which are available in the Library of the House. In most cases results show that radioactivity concentrations are not elevated above levels expected to be found naturally.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30506w02.html_wqn0"><B> Norman Baker: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (1) what plans she has to incorporate annual emissions of pollutants from <i>(a)</i> local authority integrated pollution prevention and control sites (Part A(2) sites) and <i>(b)</i> local air pollution prevention and control (Part B sites) into the Environment Agency's pollution inventory;  [110380]
<P>
<UL>(2) if she will make a statement on plans for incorporating annual emissions of pollutants from <i>(a)</i> local authority integrated pollution prevention and control sites (Part A(2) sites) and <i>(b)</i> local air pollution prevention and control sites (Part B sites) into the Environment Agency's pollution inventory.  [111104]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30506w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The pollution inventory contains information about emissions to air, land and water from various industrial installations, including all processes subject to integrated pollution control (IPC). Operators have to report annually from a list of 150 substances where they exceed the reporting thresholds.
<P>

<a name="30506w02.html_para0">As part of the development of the pollution inventory, the Environment Agency has been preparing for the implementation (in June 2003) of the integrated pollution prevention and control (IPPC) European pollutant emission register (EPER). This requires European Union member countries to report on 50 pollutants released to air and water from all IPPC sites every three years, whether or not they are yet permitted under IPPC.




<P>
<P><I>6 May 2003 : Column 539W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="30506w02.html_para1">Under EPER, local authorities are required to collect emission data from the Part A(2) sites that they regulate under IPPC and this data are being incorporated into the UK report to the European Commission.
<P>

<a name="30506w02.html_para2">The Department commissioned consultants in 1999 to investigate the feasibility of establishing a pollution inventory for processes under the then local air pollution control (LAPC) regime. The report was issued for comment to some 200 organisations on 18 January 2001 and received seven responses. The report reviewed a range of options and recommended that inventory data for air emissions should be collected only for those substances covered by the national air quality strategy together with a list of 15 additional substances.
<P>

<a name="30506w02.html_para3">Those LAPC processes with the greater potential for pollution are now being transferred to Part A(2) and are subject to the EPER. Of the remainder, local authorities already need to collect Part B emissions data for the purposes of local air quality management review and assessment, and the national atmospheric emissions inventory includes data about all significant sources of man-made emissions, including those emitted from Part B installations. In view of this, and the likelihood that relatively few Part B installations not transferred to A(2) will emit substances above the reporting threshold levels set in the Environment Agency's pollution inventory, the Department has not considered it a priority to extend the inventory to Part Bs. However, this is being kept under review, in consultation with the Environment Agency.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what recent assessment she has made of sulphur emissions in the UK.  [111589]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30506w02.html_spnew4"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 The latest estimate of UK atmospheric sulphur emissions is 1,125 kilotonnes in 2001. This is a 70 per cent. reduction on the 1990 emission (of 3,719 kilotonnes), and ahead of the UK's 2005 target of 1,470 kilotonnes in the 1994 UN/ECE protocol on the further reduction of sulphur emissions. The reductions are mainly attributed to lower emissions from power stations, homes and industry from the use of cleaner fuels and the fitting of emission abatement equipment, and from transport following the introduction of low sulphur fuels. Time series of UK emissions of pollutants are published annually in the National Atmospheric Emissions Inventory (NAEI), which can be viewed on the Internet atwww.naei.org.uk.

<P>
<a name="30506w02.html_spnew7"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 Those married women who choose to pay the reduced liability of national insurance contributions were made aware of the consequences of their decision. We therefore have no plans to introduce a reduced basic pension for those women. However, they will get a basic pension of around 60 per cent. of their husband's entitlement when both have reached state pension age and made claims.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30506w02.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Wray: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what the national insurance contribution requirements are for a basic pension; and whether those currently paying the reduced rate of national insurance will qualify for a basic pension. [110772]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30506w02.html_spnew8"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 In order to become entitled to the basic state pension, a person has to satisfy two conditions. The basic state pension is available to both the employed and self-employed. In addition, anyone may make voluntary national insurance contributions, subject to a time limit, if this is necessary to build up entitlement.
<P>

<a name="30506w02.html_para6">The first basic state pension entitlement condition is that a person has either: one qualifying year since 6 April 1975 which is derived from the payment of class 1, 2 or 3 national insurance contributions or from class 1 contributions treated as paid; or paid 50 flat rate contributions at any time before 6 April 1975.
<P>

<a name="30506w02.html_para7">The second basic state pension entitlement condition relates to the number of qualifying years a person has. Currently to get a full basic state pension a man needs 44, and a woman 39, qualifying years. The number of qualifying years can be reduced if a person is entitled to Home Responsibilities Protection. The basic state pension cannot be paid if a person has less than 25 per cent. of the qualifying years needed for a full state pension.
<P>

<a name="30506w02.html_para8">In certain circumstances a person may be credited with earnings to help them get a state pension if they do not have enough earnings in a tax year to reach the level needed to make it a qualifying year.
<P>

<a name="30506w02.html_para9">The payment of the reduced rate contribution does not give entitlement to the basic state pension but married women will get a basic state pension of around 60 per cent. of their husband's entitlement when both have reached state pension age and made claims.

 The contract with the Council for the Advancement of Communication with Deaf People (CACDP) to improve the training infrastructure for British Sign Language was worth a total of &#163;198,750. Separately, a contract exists with the Royal National Institute for Deaf People (RNID) to recruit and train interpreters, to which DfEE/DWP and the RNID will each contribute &#163;245,400 over its lifetime.

<P>
<a name="30506w03.html_spnew1"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 We are absolutely determined to ensure that we give accurate and up to date information to our customers. That is why we have introduced an electronic ordering system which makes it impossible for staff or outside organisations to order out of date stock, and why we are undertaking a Mystery Shopping Pilot at four Pension Centres. This will give a measure of performance against set quality standards&#151;such as the content of a telephone greeting or the availability of leaflets, while offering an objective view of customer service.

In addition, information for staff and external bodies about current editions of leaflets is available electronically and kept up to date continuously.
<P>

<a name="30506w03.html_para2">The Pensions Service has recently introduced an information management system which ensures that all products for the public are the responsibility of a named senior civil servant.

We are committed to ensuring that the Government's pension reforms improve women's pension rights. The introduction of stakeholder pensions, state second pension, winter fuel payments, improvements to the minimum income guarantee and, from October 2003, pension credit together with the &#163;100 a year payment to people aged 80 and over announced in the Budget are, or will be, of particular help to women.

 The Government's information campaign, to support the move to Direct Payment, provides customers with factual information on the banking options available to them, including information on the Post Office card account.

 The current system which allows "casual agents" to collect money on behalf of the customer is one of the reasons order books and girocheques are so prone to fraud.

 The Department is contacting 13.5 million customers over a two-year period, providing them with information (including letters and leaflets) which clearly sets out the account options as part of the move to Direct Payment. 87 per cent. of our customers currently have access to an account suitable for Direct Payment.

<P>

<a name="30506w03.html_para13">Direct Payment is now the normal method of paying benefits and pensions. Over the next two years order books will be phased out. From 2005 they will no longer be an option so customers will normally have to be paid by Direct Payment.

<P>

<a name="30506w03.html_para14">Customers do not need to take any action to change to Direct Payment until the Department contacts them. Once they receive a letter from us and they want information about the Post Office card account they are asked to contact the Department. This will ensure they have considered all their options and have the information they need to choose the account that best suits their needs. If the customer chooses to opt for a Post Office card account, the next stage is to issue them with a letter inviting them to apply for a card account, this is known as the Personal Invitation Document (PID).

Energy Consumption: this is weather-corrected in the usual manner, using annual degree days relative to the 20 year average for 1990&#150;91. The figures are those reported on for the Central Government Estate campaign, and generally include each department's main estate plus all agencies, but not NDPBs.<P>

Energy Expenditure: this is actual spend, and from April 2001, includes the Climate Change Levy.<P>

Energy/m2: this variable allows for changes in both weather and estate size on energy consumption. So annual changes will generally reflect efficiency changes.<P>

Savings over 1997&#150;98: These have been expressed as percentage savings relative to the first year quoted here, and are based on the figures in the preceding column.<P>

Energy efficiency spend: Investment in energy efficiency measures is made by the Departments Estates Partners; as such we are unable to include details of expenditure for commercial reasons. A number of investment scheme projects were initiated during 2002, which are currently being rolled out across the whole estate.<P>

 <i>[holding answer 1 May 2003]</i>: In each of the years 1998&#150;99, 1999&#150;2000 and 2000&#150;01 the Health and Safety Executive's Field Operations Directorate (FOD) deployed approximately 24 staff-years/year to workplace contact officer (WCO) work. In 2001&#150;02 and 2002&#150;03 respectively an additional six and eight Railway Inspectorate Contact Officers (RICOs) were deployed in HM Railway Inspectorate (HMRI), making a total for HSE in those years of around 30 and 32 staff-years.

<sup>(1)</sup> Invalid care allowance (ICA) was renamed carer's allowance (CA) on 1 April 2003.<P>

<P>

<sup>(2)</sup> Figures are not available on a monthly basis. The figures given in the table are for the end of each quarter and are rounded to the nearest 5.<P>

<P>

<sup>(3)</sup> Figures for 'claims received' refer to numbers of people making claims, as input to CACS in that quarter. Figures for 'successful' claims refer to numbers of awards of entitlement, including cases where payment is not made because of the operation of the overlapping benefits regulations (although people in these circumstances may qualify for the carer premium in the income-related benefits). The date of input of a successful claim may fall in a later quarter than that in which the claim was received or from which entitlement to the allowance started.<P>

<P>

<sup>(4)</sup> A person may make more than one claim and have more than one award, and these may be input on the CACS in different quarters. Therefore, the difference between the figures for the numbers of people from whom a claim is received and the figures for the numbers of awards in successful claims will not equate to the figures for the numbers of unsuccessful claims.<P>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The National Statistician has been asked to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question on what work has been completed since 1997 on redefining the ratio between the number of Jobcentre vacancies and the total number of vacancies in the economy and the extent to which this ratio varies in different areas across the country. I am replying in his absence. (110685)</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Direct comparisons between Jobcentre vacancies and estimated totals of vacancies in the economy are not presently possible, as the numbers of unfilled vacancies at Jobcentres have not been published since April 2001. This is because of distortions to the data which occurred as a result of the introduction of the 'Employer Direct' initiative by Jobcentre Plus which altered the method of dealing with notified vacancies. Nevertheless, the ratio between the Jobcentre vacancies and the number of vacancies in the economy has been investigated by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) as part of an assessment last year of estimates of the total number of vacancies from a new survey of job vacancies now being published monthly on an experimental basis. The assessment included a review of information available from previous occasional surveys conducted on behalf of Jobcentre Plus.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Details of the ONS survey and the assessment were published in an article 'A new survey of job vacancies' in the October 2002 issue of Labour Market Trends (pages 535 to 548). On the basis of the pilot of a question on notified vacancies included in the survey, this concluded that the proportion of all vacancies notified to Jobcentres, as reported by employers, was likely to be in the range of around a third to around a half. There is no information currently available on the extent to which the proportion varies in different parts of the country.</FONT></UL>

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>As Jobcentre Plus is an Executive Agency, I have been asked to reply to your question concerning how we take the views of our customers into account when decisions are made to change our services, and what consideration we give to accessibility by public transport. This is something which falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Acting Chief Executive of the Agency.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In creating a network of about 1000 sites we are increasing the access and availability of our services to people who use only ex-Benefits Agency sites, and reducing the need for other customers to visit both a Jobcentre and a social security office. Our current arrangements for undertaking home visits and permitting certain individuals to sign by post still apply.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The introduction of advanced telephony and modern IT. equipment is enabling us to provide new ways of accessing our services. To make a claim for a Jobcentre Plus benefit the customer contacts us on a local rate phone number. Personal details are taken, forms are posted out and an appointment with a Personal Adviser is arranged. Providing access to job vacancies by telephone and the Internet also enables customers to access our services at a time and from a location of their choice.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Jobcentre Plus District Managers have many criteria to consider when they are planning the location of sites and the delivery of services in their areas. In particular they consider the availability of public transport, travel time and cost. The availability and cost of public transport varies widely across the country, so it is not possible to be prescriptive. Planning for the implementation of Jobcentre Plus is a local process designed to meet the needs of local communities, with decisions best being made by local managers. This means that many different and specific factors can be considered at that level.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>With regard to travel time, we have asked District Managers to ensure that, as far as possible, customers will not have to travel for an unreasonable amount of time as a result of closing an existing office. Careful account is taken of population size and spread, where people are located, and many other factors, to ensure that we agree the best location for our new offices.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In our early planning for each JobCentre Plus district we are sharing our proposals for service delivery with a wide variety of people and organisations. While these are determined by local management they will include, for example, local MP's, Local Authorities, service delivery partners, employers' representatives, Citizens Advice Bureaux, welfare rights organisations, other Government Agencies, Health Authorities, Housing Associations, our staff and trade union representatives. After views and comments have been taken on board District Managers then share the finally agreed plans with the people and groups described above.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We do survey our customers to find out their opinions of the service that we provide. This information is used to improve that service. It is not however practical or possible to consult all our customers and potential customers about major changes to our service, including possible office closures.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>For districts introducing the new service in 2002/03 the main communications exercises took place between June and September, and we were pleased to receivecomments and views on many aspects of our plans. We have taken account of those views, changed our plans where appropriate and responded to those who contacted us.</FONT></UL>

<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The national roll-out of Jobcentre Plus is bringing together the old separate Jobcentres and Benefit Offices to form our new integrated offices, which will provide both services in one place.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Jobcentre Plus is contributing to the wider DWP modernisation and efficiency agenda and the workforce planning levels agreed for Jobcentre Plus in London form part of this. The allocation of resource budgets within Jobcentre Plus is linked to expected workloads and performance targets. Each Region, including London, has a share of the total Jobcentre Plus performance target. The headcount target for London region, like all regions, is based on this.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Between April 2002 and February 2003, Jobcentre Plus London region reduced its permanent staffing by 668 in line with workforce efficiency plans. This was achieved through a combination of staff moving to The Pension Service, other parts of the Department for Work and Pensions, other Government Departments or through natural wastage. In reaching the reduction in staffing figures, no permanent members of staff were dismissed or made redundant.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>A number of meetings, at both Regional and District level, have taken place with union representatives since last summer about this matter. These meetings have also been supplemented by ongoing correspondence. Headcount target figures were shared with PCS Regional colleagues in September and a discussion on measures required to manage towards those workforce numbers took place at a meeting on 25 September 2002. More recently, a meeting took place in January 2003 and was followed up by detailed letters, with a further meeting taking place in February 2003.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In managing our target headcount level in London 350 temporary staff were released prior to the end of the 2002/03 operational year. Where operational needs were identified, 250 temporary staff were retained in London Region Jobcentres and Social Security Offices after 31 March 2003.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The radical modernisation of our services as part of the Jobcentre Plus rollout will inevitably lead to some disruption. However, we are managing these changes to minimise any negative impact on the delivery of our services to customers.</FONT></UL>

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The current criteria for defining TTWAs are that at least 75 per cent. of the area's resident workforce must work in the area and at least 75 per cent. of the people who work in the area must also live in the area. The area must also have a working population of at least 3,500. For areas with a working population in excess of 20,000, the self-containment rate is reduced to 70 per cent. TTWA boundaries must be non-overlapping and contiguous, covering the entire United Kingdom. TTWAs do not cross national boundaries.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>TTWAs are produced by analysing commuting flows from the decennial Census of Population. The current geography, based on the 1991 Census, was published in May 1998. A report of this exercise, entitled "1991-based Travel-to-Work Areas", is held in the House of Commons Library. Prior to May 1998, the TTWAs were based on the 1981 Census and were published in September 1984; they were created using the current methods.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The TTWA geography in existence in 1979, based on the 1971 Census, was published in July 1978. While this map was also based on a self-containment rate of 75 per cent. there were several methodological changes introduced for the 1984 map. These improvements to the precision and robustness of the map were made possible by the introduction of computers and postcoded data. More details are available in an article in an Occasional Supplement to the Employment Gazette 92 (9), which is also available from the House of Commons Library.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The 1979 TTWA map was defined in terms of Employment Office (Jobcentre) areas. Since the TTWA map based on the 1981 Census, the definition has been by aggregations of wards.</FONT></UL>

In 2003&#150;04 the Global Conflict Prevention Pool (&#163;74 million&#151;managed jointly with MOD and DFID), Human Rights Project Fund (&#163;7 million), and various bilateral programmes all contain elements of democracy building.

Furthermore, the FCO works in partnership with DfID and MOD as part of the Africa Conflict Prevention Pool (&#163;50 million) which seeks to address the peace and security challenges in Africa&#151;a prerequisite for democracy. Some of the new Global Opportunities Fund will also be used for some democracy building work.

 We were disappointed that the EU sponsored resolution on Sudan was not carried at the UN Commission on Human Rights (CHR) on 16 April. The result of the vote (24 in favour, 26 against and three abstentions) was the first defeat for this resolution in 10 years and means the termination of the mandate of the Special Rapporteur, Gerhard Baum.

SSVC also re-broadcasts BBC 'News 24' and 'Sky News' as additional 24-hour news channels. To receive these channels, SSVC has installed a large number of stand alone satellite television systems, initially in Kuwait and more recently in Southern Iraq.
<P>

<a name="30506w11.html_para6">For the British forces onboard ships equipped with stabilised receiver dishes (eg HMS Ark Royal and HMS Ocean) the fall range of television channels has been available, however many ships do not have this capability and therefore for those with connectivity to the Skynet satellites a single television channel capability has been developed. The programme content is specified by the Royal Navy and has during the past two months included BBC News 24, Sky News and some news programmes from the BFBS channels. RN and RFA ships and submarines without access to the Skynet satellites have not been capable of receiving live television but have been provided with a taped SSVC television service that specifically excludes news programmes due to its non-live nature.

<a name="30506w11.html_para7">SSVC is providing two radio channels for the Gulf area: BFBS Radio 1 includes Independent Radio News (IRN) on the hour, plus each weekday the re-broadcast of several BBC Radio 4 and 5 programmes including PM, '6 o'clock News' and 'The World Tonight'.

<P>
<UL>(2) what assessment has been made of the use of existing UK legislation to target illegal timber imports, with particular reference to legislation on stolen goods, fraud and forgery; and if she will make a statement.  [111036]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30506w12.html_spnew4"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 The Government have contributed to a study on measures that the EU could take to control illegal logging and trade in illegally sourced timber products. The study indicated that UK's money laundering legislation under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 could be used as a possible measure by which the proceeds of illegal logging entering the UK financial system could be identified and persons involved convicted. However, this would require illegal logging in other countries and associated trade to be defined as criminal offences under UK law.
<P>

<a name="30506w12.html_para4">The study also indicated that some forms of illegal logging could be targeted under the Theft Act 1968 that applies to goods that have been stolen abroad as well as within the UK. For this to be effective, there must first be a request by a court or prosecuting authority in the country of origin for the suspected stolen goods to be

seized and criminal proceedings initiated or a person arrested for the offence. Therefore, using UK legislation in this regard is dependent on the activities of enforcement agencies in the countries of origin of illegal timber. Provided these actions have been taken, sale within the UK of timber known to be illegally sourced may be considered an offence.

 The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) created the Bureau for Crisis Prevention and Recovery (BCPR) in November 2001, in order to address the increasing demand for well-co-ordinated assistance on crisis prevention and recovery and the need for a strengthened capacity within the UN system to help bridge the gap between humanitarian response and longer-term development assistance. The main purpose of BCPR is to provide technical support to UNDP Country Offices and their programmes, rather than carrying out directly executed projects. Since its

 DFID has contributed &#163;51 million to help Zimbabwe since the humanitarian crisis began in mid 2001. We are currently supporting the World Food Programme, which is feeding nearly five million people, while government and non-governmental organisations are also supplying food. DFID is directly funding NGOs that are providing supplementary food to 1.5 million, mostly children, pregnant and nursing women and the elderly. We have supported home care programmes for families affected by HIV/AIDS and have provided seeds and fertilisers to 180,000 households to assist food production.
<P>

<a name="30506w13.html_para2">The international response has helped avert a crisis and malnutrition rates have increased only marginally. Adequate supplies of food have been secured until June when the harvest will improve the situation. However, it is already evident that the crisis in food production will persist for a third year, as the structural causes of agricultural decline have not been addressed. The economic crisis also means that poverty is rising and many people will remain vulnerable. Detailed assessments and the plans of the Zimbabwe Government are awaited; from there we will develop specific programmes for 2003&#150;04.

The aggregation project is aimed at extending broadband availability in the UK, as well as securing value for money, and will thus be of benefit to rural areas such as East Yorkshire.

<P>

<a name="30506w14.html_para4">The procedure, set out in regulations and based on existing best practice, ensures that all requests are dealt with seriously and consistently, and assists those employers who may not have had experience of handling such requests before.

In addition, employers may only refuse an application on one or more of eight business grounds, which are specified in the Employment Act 2002.

 The Government have made no such estimate. It is for the owners of spent fuel to make judgments about the relative merits of reprocessing spent fuel on an early timescale in currently available reprocessing facilities as compared to other spent fuel management options that might be available. It can be noted that, should an owner choose to store spent fuel for an extended period pending future decisions on its final management, the option to reprocess the fuel would be dependent upon the necessary reprocessing facilities then being available.

 "Working Together to Safeguard Children", the Government's child protection guidance, sets out how all agencies and professionals should work together to promote children's welfare and protect them from abuse and neglect. It is intended to provide a national framework within which agencies and professionals at local level&#151;individually and jointly&#151;draw up and agree upon their more detailed ways of working together.
<P>

<a name="30506w16.html_para0">The Protection of Children Guidance, produced for agencies, voluntary organisations etc. to accompany the Criminal Justice and Court Services Act 2000, makes it clear that in any case of suspected child abuse the police must always be contacted immediately.

 The Government are considering the suggestion that there should be a statutory obligation to report allegations or suspicions of child abuse.

The code stipulates that sufficient time should be allowed for considered responses from interested parties. Twelve weeks is the standard minimum period for consultation unless Ministers conclude that exceptional circumstances require a departure. In order to improve the Department's performance against the code, we have put in place new guidance and arrangements in August 2002. There has since been a significant improvement in the Department's performance.

<P>
<a name="30506w17.html_spnew5"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 The Public Service Agreement target to bring 1.2 million recorded offences to justice by 2005&#150;06, with an improvement in all Criminal Justice System areas, a greater increase in the worst performing areas, and a reduction in the proportion of ineffective trials, is referred to as the 'Narrowing the Justice Gap' target. This target applies to the criminal justice system in England and Wales as a whole. The various criminal justice services have not been set their own 'Narrowing the Justice Gap' targets: rather, the services in each area need to work together to deliver the target. For 2003&#150;04, each Local Criminal Justice Board has been set a 'Narrowing the Justice Gap' target to increase the number of offences brought to justice in its area by 5 per cent., compared with the area's performance in 2001&#150;02. From 2004&#150;05, the worse performing areas will be expected to achieve a greater performance increase than the national average performance improvement required in order to achieve the 2005&#150;06 target. Local Criminal Justice Boards have been asked to set a 2003- 04 target for their own area for reduction of ineffective trials.

<a name="30506w18.html_para2">With the exception of the &#163;195,000 and &#163;108,039.25 penalties imposed on Altcourse in November 1998 and February 2000, the &#163;750,000 penalty imposed on Parc in November 1998 and the &#163;11,865 penalty imposed on Lowdham Grange in February 2000, the imposition of a penalty resulted in each case in the withholding of the corresponding amount from the contractor concerned. In the case of Altcourse and Parc, the penalties were reduced to take account of early problems with contract monitoring and in the case of Lowdham Grange the penalty was waived in return for a commitment from the contractor to provide additional services beyond the requirements in the contract.

 The National Probation Directorate (NPD) does not have reliable data on the cost of management, maintenance of the commercial estate and hostels facilities in 2002&#150;03 and therefore there is no realistic baseline by which any cost increase can be measured. The cost of management, maintenance of the commercial estate and hostels facilities in 2003&#150;04 will not accurately be known until the end of the year when audited accounts are produced. The total revenue budget for 2003&#150;04 is about &#163;60 million for the commercial estate and about &#163;14 million for the approved premises. This includes rents, rates, utility costs, depreciation and capital charges and also management and maintenance costs. The exact split of this budget for 2003&#150;04 is still being determined as the NPD collects more accurate detailed data on costs. This will also depend on a number of factors, which will include the numbers and types of properties that are occupied and disposed of during the year and the extent of the repair and maintenance required.

 An evidence-based approach to probation practice is essential if the National Probation Service's work with offenders is to be effective in reducing re-offending and improving public protection. "What Works" is therefore at the heart of the Director General's on-going change programme for the Service and is vital to its success.

Other important elements of What Works include the introduction this year of Enhanced Community Punishment, the development of community re-integration approaches in relation to employment, training and education, and the development of a national case management framework. What Works is underpinned by the new Offender Assessment System, the implementation of which is well advanced.

Each local authority must use its own discretion when allocating funds in this area. No formal assessment of access to reading for the visually impaired has been made. The Government are committed to ensuring that disabled people can participate in every aspect of normal life, although, in considering public expenditure, the Government must also take into account a wide range of competing priorities.

 VisitBritain's new domestic marketing campaign 'Enjoy England' was launched on 23 April 2003. The campaign features aspects of England's core products centred on the four key themes of experience, discovery, exploration and relaxation. There are many references in the campaign's promotional material to regional food and drink products and events. The VisitEngland website provides a full listing of annual food and drink events and festivals and provides links to details of Farmers' Markets by county.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30506w20.html_spnew5"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 It is fundamental to the Government's policies for environmental stewardship that there should be effective protection for all aspects of the historic environment, including market towns. The Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 



<P>
<P><I>6 May 2003 : Column 610W</I><P>
provides specific protection for buildings and areas of special architectural or historic interest. The Government is currently undertaking a review of heritage protection legislation to improve the effectiveness of the current designation system, and to approach the designation and management of the historic environment more holistically.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30506w20.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Rosindell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what representations she has received from heritage groups in the United Kingdom regarding the preservation of market towns.  [110692]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30506w20.html_spnew6"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The Department has received no representations specifically on the preservation of market towns, but is fully committed to ensuring that all aspects of the historic environment are both valued and protected effectively.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what plans she has to introduce a television licence fee for deaf people.  [110652]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30506w20.html_spnew7"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The Government recognise the importance of access to television services for deaf people but believe this is best achieved by increasing the proportion of programmes that are subtitled and translated into sign language, rather than by introducing television licence fee concessions. There are already targets for subtitling on analogue and Digital Terrestrial Television (DTT) and for signing on DTT. The Communications Bill extends these requirements to digital cable and satellite broadcasters for the first time. Amendments to the BBC Agreement will require the Corporation to observe Ofcom's code relating to provision for deaf and visually impaired people.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what measures <i>(a)</i> are in place and <i>(b)</i> are proposed to ensure passenger safety in terms of the efficiency of aircraft cabin air-conditioning and filter systems.  [111038]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30506w20.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 There are no Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) requirements for airlines to fit air filtration systems to aircraft air-conditioning systems. However, most modern large airlines are fitted with High Efficiency Particulate Air filters as a matter of airline choice.
<P>

<a name="30506w20.html_para4">Where filters are fitted, the CAA requires that airlines have in place a maintenance programme that ensures that air conditioning filters are used and maintained in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations and that, when specified by the aircraft manufacturer, these airlines implement a reliability programme that monitors system performance to ensure that it does not fall below the manufacturer's limits.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30506w21.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Available evidence suggests that aircraft noise, either at current levels or at the far higher levels experienced in the 1970s around Heathrow, has no detectable direct effect on the physical health of communities near airports. However, health may be interpreted more widely to encompass impacts upon quality of life, including sleep disturbance and serious annoyance otherwise caused. Some indication of the scale of annoyance is available from noise contours, which have substantially contracted at Heathrow and Gatwick over the past two decades or so (but have expanded at Stansted).

<P>
<P>
<a name="30506w21.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B>

<P>
<a name="30506w22.html_spnew6"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 The introduction of the Construction Industry Scheme in August 1999 was successful in bringing in at least 75,000 previously unknown subcontractors and around &#163;280 million additional Exchequer yield in 1999&#150;2000. None the less complaints persist about the cumbersome processes and the costs to business of complying with the rules and requirements.
<P>

<a name="30506w22.html_para5">As a direct consequence of these representations the Inland Revenue consulted on alternative proposals in November 2002 ("The Inland Revenue and the Construction Industry: Working together for a new scheme").

 The Government announced in this year's Budget that the Construction Industry Tax Scheme will be replaced in April 2005 in order to reduce the regulatory burden on the Industry. The key features are:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>To replace the Registration Cards (CIS4) and Gross Payment Certificates (CIS5 and CIS6) with an Inland Revenue verification service to tell contractors whether to pay net or gross of tax. This will mean that there will no longer be cards or certificates and therefore subcontractors will not have to spend time in travelling to present them.
<P>
<BR>
To replace vouchers with periodic returns to the Revenue of payments to subcontractors thus reducing the amount of paperwork required by the scheme.
<P>

To introduce an employment status declaration to encourage the Industry to get the employment status of its workers right.

<a name="30506w22.html_para9">In terms of the stability of New Earnings Survey estimates over time, the survey is based on a 1 per cent. sample of employees comprising all those whose National Insurance numbers end with a specified pair of numbers (the same pair of numbers has been used since 1975). Those individuals for whom completed questionnaires are received in successive surveys constitute about 80 per cent. of the total. As such, the estimate of the change in average weekly pay between successive years is based largely on the changes in pay for individuals who were in the sample in both years.
<P>

<a name="30506w22.html_para10">However, for small areas, the stability of estimates of mean pay over time can be more volatile, reflecting in part the underlying volatility of earnings, but also the variability associated with sampling.

 The longstanding rule&#151;recognised by successive Governments&#151;is that Crown Servants, wherever they are serving, are chargeable to income tax on their Government salaries. We have no plans to change it.

 HM Customs and Excise have no information on the amount of duty saved as a result of EU/Israel Association Agreement.
<P>

<a name="30506w24.html_para0">The HM Customs and Excise Tariff lists both full and preferential rates of duty. As indicated in my answer on 10 April, a copy of the Tariff has been laid in the Library of the House. While the EU/Israel Association Agreement does specify duty rates, these are set out in terms of exemptions and percentage reductions rather than a list of rates.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer who will qualify to pay the reduced rate of national insurance; and whether they will qualify for the basic retirement pension.  [110770]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30506w24.html_spnew2"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 Reduced rate contributions are paid by married women who, prior 11 May 1977, made an election to pay at the reduced rate, and whose election is still valid. Payment of married womens reduced rate contributions do not count towards basic state pension. However, these women will get a basic pension based on their husband's contributions when both have reached state pension age and made claims.

 Eligibility to participate in the Saving Gateway pilots is not determined by entitlement to the new child tax credit and is therefore unaffected by the measurement of income used in determining the level of child tax credit.

<P>
<a name="30506w25.html_spnew2"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 Modern smuggling is carried out by well-organised, well-financed and highly adaptable criminal groups who use ever more sophisticated methods. To tackle them, Customs are building more intelligence-led, flexible and mobile teams capable of far greater impact than the smaller, static, predictable and less productive teams that, in some locations, they will replace.
<P>

<a name="30506w25.html_para2">The changes are designed to improve the effectiveness of Customs Law Enforcement in Wales. Customs' impact on smuggling&#151;rather than the number of

 Any supplier claiming to supply sustainable furniture and timber products is expected to provide relevant evidence of this, including for example details of independent third party certification.

 Borrowers become liable to repay their loans from the April after they finish or leave their course, depending on their earnings. Students who started their course before academic year 1998/99 repay their loans on a mortgage style basis. The table shows the average repayment of mortgage style student loans in financial years 1999&#150;2000 to 2001&#150;02 (the latest year available) for borrowers who became liable to repay their loans in the financial years 1998&#150;99 to 2001&#150;02 and who are making repayments; the table excludes any voluntary repayments made by borrowers before becoming liable to repay their loans.
<P>

<a name="30506w26.html_para14">Students who started their course from the 1998/99 academic year will repay income contingent loans. Repayments of income contingent loans, apart from voluntary repayments and repayments from overseas borrowers, are made through the tax system. The scheme started in April 2000 and details of repayments are notified to the Student Loans Company by the Inland Revenue from the end of the relevant financial year. Therefore complete data on the average repayment of income contingent loans are not yet available.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30506w26.html_spnew20"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 The proposed change in the income threshold for repaying income-contingent loans from &#163;10,000 to &#163;15,000 in April 2005 will benefit existing borrowers and new students. It will benefit existing graduates because those earning below &#163;15,000, will no longer be liable to make repayments, and those earning above &#163;15,000 will have a reduction in their repayments.

<P>
<a name="30506w26.html_spnew21"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 Individual universities' admissions policies and procedures will be outside the remit of the access agreement and the Office for Fair Access (OFFA). We have asked Professor Schwartz, Vice-Chancellor of Brunel University, to lead a team to identify good practice in admissions. We expect one of the results of this work to be a statement of principles about admissions which we hope all universities will adopt. Those wishing to charge a higher tuition fee will wish to demonstrate to OFFA that they subscribe to these principles.

 As a result of a recent report by the Parliamentary Ombudsman on a complaint from a learning provider, the Department has decided, in line with Government Accounting guidance, to offer compensation to registered Individual Learning Account (ILA) learning providers in respect of those learners who properly applied to open accounts before 24 October 2001; were committed to purchase ILA eligible learning with a specific learning provider; and who had not been issued with account numbers by the time the system closed down at 6.30 pm on 23 November 2001, subject to the provision of appropriate evidence.

<a name="30506w27.html_para2">It is very difficult to estimate the likely cost as it is uncertain how many of these learners would have been committed to learn with a specific learning provider.

 John Harwood is retiring after three successful years as chief executive of the LSC. He has been a key figure in building a new learning system which will support a prosperous economy and an inclusive society.

 All public sector bodies have 31 March as their financial year end, and in the case of the Learning and Skills Council (LSC), this is specified by statute. Public funding is allocated to the LSC by financial years, but it plans and funds the bulk of its provision on an academic year basis, as this best meets the needs of the key providers involved. There are no plans to re-align the LSC's financial year.

 The Moser Report (1999) indicated that around 7 million adults in England have poor literacy skills, and that even more have a problem with numbers. The Department has commissioned a new representative sample survey of working age adults in England to provide an up-to-date assessment of the scale of literacy and numeracy need. These estimates will be mapped to the new national basic skills standards and will be published in summer 2003.
<P>

<a name="30506w27.html_para8">In March 2001, the Government launched Skills for Life, the national strategy for improving adult's literacy and numeracy skills. The strategy aims to improve the basic skills of 1.5 million adults by 2007 by boosting demand for learning, ensuring the capacity of basic skills training, raising standards in teaching and learning, and increasing learner achievement. Between April 2001 and July 2002, 300,000 adults improved their literacy, language or numeracy skills.

Students who continue to study languages post 14 are more motivated and more likely to continue studying a modern foreign language into higher education. So we are requiring all [maintained] secondary schools to ensure that modern foreign languages remain available to any 14&#150;16 year old pupil who wishes to study them. Our goal is to move to a position where young people are motivated to study modern foreign languages, rather than being forced to do so.

 Shropshire Local Education Authority offers all permanently excluded pupils of compulsory school age in North Shropshire full-time educational provision, where appropriate, after 15 school days. The provision would typically involve either an alternative school, the tuition service or, for older pupils, a shared placement arrangement with the further education sector and other providers. Schools set and mark work for pupils they exclude for short fixed period, and also during the early stages of a longer exclusion. For longer fixed period exclusions, schools will involve the LEA as necessary in planning for the child's return. The nature, management and organisation of provision for excluded pupils is a matter for the LEA having regard to pupils' individual circumstances.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30506w28.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 Funding for both behaviour improvement and to increase standards in rural schools comes from a wide variety of sources and to varying degrees of aggregation with funding to support other areas of activity. It is not therefore possible in either case to give discrete total figures. Key contributions on behaviour-related initiatives have been the around &#163;560 million (including Government grant and LEA contributions) allocated through the Standards Fund between 1997&#150;2003 and the &#163;50 million provided to targeted LEAs since September 2002 to improve behaviour and attendance. Specific contributions on rural schools have included some &#163;56 million of funding for rural Excellence Clusters and rural EAZs. Many rural schools are also small schools and benefit from the Small Schools Fund, which was set up in 2001 by the merging of two previous grants (the Administrative Support Fund for Small Schools and the Small School Support Fund). The Small Schools Fund is worth a total of &#163;80 million a year.

 There is a clear Government commitment to the inclusion of children and young people with special educational needs (SEN) in mainstream education. The Special Educational Needs and Disability Act 2001 was a major milestone in promoting inclusion for children with disabilities or SEN, including those pupils with Down's syndrome.
<P>

<a name="30506w29.html_para0">There is a general duty to educate children with special educational needs in mainstream schools unless this is against their parent's wishes or incompatible with the efficient education of other children and there are no reasonable steps that can be taken by the LEA or the school to prevent that incompatibility. However, for some children a mainstream placement may not be right, or not right just yet and therefore provision in special schools will continue to play a vital role.
<P>

<a name="30506w29.html_para1">Education Law does not distinguish between different types of SEN. Children with Down's syndrome will vary as widely in their development and progress as typically developing children and each will have their own talents and aptitudes.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what the budgeted departmental expenditure is on <i>(a)</i> legal aid in asylum and immigration cases for 2003&#150;04 and <i>(b)</i> all legal aid in the magistrates courts for 2003&#150;04.  [110163]<P>

<P>
<a name="30506w29.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 Budgeted expenditure for asylum and immigration cases for 2003&#150;04 is yet to be agreed by Ministers. All expenditure for asylum and immigration cases (including legal aid), will now for the first time fall under a single asylum fund, to be agreed between my Department, the Home Office and the Treasury.
<P>

<a name="30506w29.html_para11">There is no separate budget for legal aid in the magistrates courts as it forms part of the overall legal aid budget. However, magistrates courts legal aid expenditure falls within that for the General Criminal Contract, which covers all levels of service up to and including representation in the magistrates courts. Currently we expect to spend around &#163;525 million in 2003&#150;04.

<a name="30506w30.html_para0">"Children Missing from Care and Home&#151;a guide to good practice" was issued to every English local authority in November 2002, under section 7 of the Local Authority Social Services Act 1970, which means that, except in exceptional circumstances, councils must follow its advice. The guidance requires that where a child in care is assessed to be missing, the authority responsible for their care must ensure that all is being done to locate them and return them to a place of safety. Where there is reason for an authority to be concerned that a child may go missing at the time that a care placement is made, then the guidance recommends that the authority should ensure that there is a proper "risk assessment" as to the likelihood of that child going missing. This assessment should lead to action being taken to minimise any potential risk. Each local authority must appoint a senior manager to be responsible for monitoring the effectiveness of its missing from care protocols and procedures.

Waiting time statistics from HES are not the same as the published waiting list statistics.

Also, HES calculates the waiting time as the difference between the admission and decision to admit dates. Unlike published waiting list statistics, this is not adjusted for self-deferrals or periods of medical/social suspension.<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Health (1) what guidance his Department gives to local authorities about charging for domiciliary care services to disabled children;  [111125]

<P>
<P>
<a name="30506w32.html_spnew0"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 The legal position, as set out at section 29 of the Children Act 1989, is that where a local authority provides services, with the exception of advice, guidance or counselling, they may make such charges for that service as they consider reasonable.
<P>

<a name="30506w32.html_para0">The Government recognise that this may put undue pressure on low income families and this is why the Act provides that no one receiving income support, any element of child tax credit other than the family element, working tax credit or an income-based jobseeker's allowance is liable to pay a charge. The local authority will take into account the means of the family in each case. Local authorities may not require parents to pay more than is reasonable.
<P>

<a name="30506w32.html_para1">It is a matter for local authorities as to whether or not a charge is made and, if so, how much any charge might be. We have not issued new guidance to local authorities since 1991 (paragraph 238 of the Children Act Guidance, Volume 2). This guidance covers services provided under Part III of the Children Act 1989 which includes domiciliary care.
<P>

<a name="30506w32.html_para2">The Department of Health does not collect data about the number of local authorities charging for these services and therefore has no central information about the criteria used by local authorities to make such charges.

<i>[holding answer 28 April 2003]:</i> The new contract for general medical services negotiated between the General Practitioners Committee of the British Medical Association and the NHS Confederation provides for an unprecedented level of additional investment in primary care services. If the contract is accepted, overall investment in England would rise by 33 per cent. The proposed Minimum Practice Income Guarantee will also mean that no practice loses out, provided it is achieving 100 quality points in 2004&#150;05 and 150 in 2005&#150;06.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what discussions he has had with the Secretary of State for Health and the Northern Ireland Assembly concerning a definition for an unreasonable period of delay for treatment within the NHS, as phrased in the European Court of Justice ruling on treatment of patients abroad for patients from Wales.  [109880]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30506w37.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Browne: </B> 
 The European Court ruling regarding the authorisation to receive medical treatment in another member state of the European Economic Area, the E112 system, did not define what was meant by "undue delay" by implication leaving that a matter for determination by each member state. If "undue delay" is considered when dealing with applications for E112s the yardstick used is waiting time. The Department's definition of excess waiting times is similar to the national UK targets for waiting times as published in the NHS Plan.

 The South-Eastern Education and Library Board continually monitors the demand for places at all its special units.

 I am happy to confirm that there have not been any probable cases of SARS so far in Northern Ireland. The Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety has been working in close liaison with the Department of Health (DOH)(L) and arising from that we have provided early, accurate information to both the public and the health service.
<P>

<a name="30506w37.html_para3">The Chief Medical Officer contacted all doctors on 14 March, 18 March and subsequently on 8 April with detailed information on the symptoms and signs of SARS, and what to do if they encountered a possible case. The Department has also put in place high quality public health surveillance to enable the disease to be tracked closely. The Chief Medical Officer has also issued advice, on 2 April and on 24 April, to people travelling abroad, in line with WHO recommendations. Up to date information is available to the public on the Department's website and on those of the World Health Organisation, the new Health Protection Agency and the DOH(L).
<P>

<a name="30506w37.html_para4">Finally, the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety has provided and made arrangements for posters to be displayed at appropriate points in air and sea ports advising incoming passengers, from those areas affected by SARS, about the symptoms of the disease and the importance of seeking medical attention, if they become ill, showing any of the symptoms.

 The predominant factor in determination of service provision will be the needs of clients and patients and, while the board is placing greater emphasis on more effective alternative provision within the community, there will continue to be a need to commission psychiatric in-patient services at Tyrone and Fermanagh Hospital.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what plans he has for maintaining and developing acute services and sub-regional services at the Tyrone county hospital pending the putting in place of the proposed new hospital north of Enniskillen.  [110207]

 I do not envisage any change in the status of Tyrone county hospital, pending the development of the new acute hospital in the south-west. During the transition phase I expect every effort to be made to sustain acute services at Tyrone county hospital.
