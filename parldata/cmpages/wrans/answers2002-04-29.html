 To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what recent discussions he has had with the Indian Government concerning the sale of Royal Navy Sea Harriers; and if he will make a statement.  [50964]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20429w01.html_spnew1"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The Ministry of Defence's Disposal Services Agency has not entered into any talks with the Indian Government with regard to the sale of Sea Harriers. However, as part of its marketing strategy for the sale of these aircraft, the DSA will follow up all expressions of interest subject, of course, to normal export controls.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what his assessment is of the threat to the United Kingdom from attack by weapons of mass destruction.  [50956]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20429w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 As of today we assess that there is currently no direct threat of attack by weapons of mass destruction to the United Kingdom. We do, however, continue to monitor developments very closely, particularly as they might affect British forces deployed in other parts of the world.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what assessment has been made of the type of weapons of mass destruction that are most likely to be used by countries he has defined as of concern to the UK; and if he will make a statement.  [52285]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20429w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 We monitor continuously the capabilities of countries which possess, or are seeking to acquire, weapons of mass destruction and the means to deliver or use them. Currently we assess that none of the countries we are monitoring has the specific intention to use them against the United Kingdom. Should a direct threat materialise, its exact nature will depend on the capabilities of the country concerned and the political and military context in which it arises.
<P>

<a name="20429w01.html_para0">Our assessment of the weapons of mass destruction programmes of a number of countries was included in our "Supplementary Memorandum to the House of Commons Defence Committee: The Ballistic Missile Threat" of 18 March 2002.

18. <a name="20429w01.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Liddell-Grainger: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will make a statement on the production of ordnance in the UK.  [50957]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20429w01.html_spnew6"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 Royal Ordnance Defence, the UK's major producer of munitions to the armed forces, has been operating against a background of sharp decline in the world-wide demand for defence equipment over the last 15 years. Like any other commercial company competing in world markets, it has had to take the hard decisions necessary to optimise its manufacturing capacity to remain viable and competitive in this sector. The Ministry of Defence is aware that the company is currently conducting a manufacturing review, focusing particularly on its sites at Birtley, Bridgwater and Chorley.
<P>

<a name="20429w01.html_para1">While the final result of this review is not yet known, I am able to inform the House that Royal Ordnance Defence has recently announced that it intends to pursue a consolidation option at the Birtley site. Although, regrettably, there will be some job losses over a period of years, the company expects that this option will secure the future of the site as part of its core business.
<P>

<a name="20429w01.html_para2">They have also informed MOD that they intend to invest heavily in a number of sites across the United Kingdom. Royal Ordnance Defence are retaining expertise in the crucial areas of propellant charge design at Bishopton, ordnance engineering design at Leicester, and small arms ammunition design and manufacture at Radway Green near Crewe, as well as investing substantially in its filling, assembly and packaging plant at Glascoed. There is no doubt that the company does possess and plans to retain world-class research and development personnel and production facilities in the United Kingdom.

<a name="20429w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The achievement of manning balance is being tackled as a matter of the highest priority. In particular we have introduced a number of initiatives aimed at improving retention. Although there are variations between the Services, the overall manning position is stabilising.
<P>

<a name="20429w01.html_para3">Our aim is to achieve higher levels of retention through policies that genuinely reflect the priorities of our people and their families.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what measures are being employed in Afghanistan to minimise the risk to British troops of friendly fire incidents.  [52472]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20429w01.html_spnew14"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The planning for operations in Afghanistan included detailed work to establish a number of clear, reliable measures to minimise the risks of friendly fire incidents. All coalition forces operate in accordance with strict Rules of Engagement and British forces operate in their own area of responsibility with equipment to ensure that they have accurate positioning information. Additionally, individuals and vehicles are clearly marked using indicators that are visible by day and at night through night vision aids.
<P>

<a name="20429w01.html_para6">There is also a close working relationship between coalition forces, with liaison officers placed at all levels in headquarters and in lower formations. Procedures to co-ordinate fire and air support have been established at the Coalition Combined Air Operations Centre and at Divisional and Brigade Headquarters and several lines of communications are also in place (including satellite- based equipment) to allow close co-ordination between headquarters, troops on the ground and aircraft to ensure deconfliction.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what the trained strength of the regular Army was in <i>(a)</i> 1997 and <i>(b)</i> 2001.  [50961]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20429w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 It is difficult to make direct comparison between Army strength figures for 1997 and 2001 as we now provide figures for Army strength incorporating UK Trained Personnel, the Full Time Reserve Service and Gurkhas for the last two years. Prior to this strength figures based on this definition were not available. I have therefore restricted my answer to UK Trained Army Personnel only. This stood at 97,812 as at 31 December 1997 and 96,373 as at 31 December 2001.

 No forward manpower targets have been set to reduce the work force in the Defence Aviation Repair Agency (DARA). However, DARA has reduced its work force year on year as a direct result of rationalisation initiatives and the introduction of new working practices. There has been no requirement for any compulsory redundancies as a result of any of these initiatives. In line with the assumptions made when it was established as a trading fund, the Agency will continue to pursue

 To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will make a statement on the impact of the suspension of courts-martial on the workings of military discipline.  [50976]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20429w02.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Army and Royal Air Force courts-martial scheduled to begin in the period immediately after 26 February were postponed in the light of the judgment on that day of the European Court of Human Rights in the case of Morris v. the United Kingdom. This was to enable those services to address the concern expressed in the judgment, about the potential for external influence over certain members of court martial panels. The Army and Royal Air Force have now followed the Royal Navy in including in Queen's Regulations a prohibition on reporting on court martial members for the performance of these duties. All three services have also included in Queen's Regulations a reminder that it is an offence to attempt to influence a member of a court martial.
<P>

<a name="20429w02.html_para0">Army and Royal Air Force courts-martial resumed on 3 and 23 April respectively. The backlog of 54 Army and nine Royal Air Force trials that had been postponed should be cleared by the end of June. We regret the inconvenience to the accused and their representatives, and to witnesses, but the postponements have had only a marginal effect on the operation of the discipline system as a whole. Moreover it has been valuable to have clarified the position regarding the very proper independence of court martial members.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20429w02.html_spnew8"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The Ministry of Defence is committed to its in-house guard force, which has provided first class unarmed protection to the Defence Estate for almost 10 years. The organisation of the MGS has recently been reviewed, and it has been decided, subject to consultation with the trade unions, to move to a centralised structure, under the direction of the Chief Constable, MOD Police, so as to provide a more efficient and effective unarmed guarding service.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20429w02.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The task of air defence of the United Kingdom falls to the RAF, particularly RAF Strike Command. The UK continues to meet its commitment to NATO to preserve the integrity of our airspace using a combination of air surveillance radar and quick reaction aircraft. Those assets could also be used in a national capacity.

In the case of Sea Harrier decision, further to the answer I gave to the hon.

The net savings accruing from the current plan to hold HMS Sheffield at extended readiness between 2002 and 2004 are estimated to be some &#163;28 million over the period 2002&#150;03 to 2004&#150;05. All savings are compared to previous plans.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20429w02.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 Eurofighter will be a multi-role aircraft, conditioned primarily for air defence. It will, however, have an initial air-to-surface capability as soon as it becomes available for operational deployment, in the second half of the decade. We plan to enhance this capability during incremental upgrades.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence which of the services of his Department have not been reviewed under the Better Quality Services Initiative; and when they will be reviewed.  [50315]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20429w02.html_spnew12"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The Better Quality Services (BQS) programme was launched in 1998 and adopted by the Cabinet Office in the Modernising Government White Paper of 1999 as a means of delivering continuous improvements in the quality and effectiveness of Government activities and services. It requires all Government Departments to review every activity and service over a five year period starting in October 1999. The scheme covers all activities in Departments, agencies and executive non-departmental public bodies, and is similar in remit to the Best Value programme in local government.
<P>

<a name="20429w02.html_para1">The Ministry of Defence is committed to the regular and rigorous review of its business activities. BQS is one of a range of approaches we have taken to achieve this. Progress against our BQS programme has been published in our departmental performance reports. As at the end of March 2001, over 70 per cent. of the plan had been completed. The activities then outstanding were largely small-scale management reviews, possible public-private partnerships, retendering of service contracts and reviews of individual agencies.

<P>
<a name="20429w03.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The Joint Strike Fighter has been identified as having the best potential to meet our Future Joint Combat Aircraft requirement. The United Kingdom's procurement costs are currently estimated to be up to &#163;10 billion, depending on the number of aircraft required and the variant selected. Subsequent costs will be determined by the through life support strategy that we decide to adopt.

 The latest available figures (1998&#150;99) for the number of United Kingdom jobs estimated to be directly dependent on Ministry of Defence equipment expenditure is 81,000. Of these, approximately 3,000 were employed on MOD equipment contracts in the north-east. The Defence Analytical Services Agency does not provide estimates for regional employment derived from MOD non-equipment expenditure or exports.

<a name="20429w03.html_para1">So far as service family accommodation in mainland UK is concerned, a stock condition survey was commissioned by the Defence Housing Executive (DHE) in mid-1997 and completed in early 1998. The task was complex, involving 650 data entries per property and full survey of 90 per cent. of the total stock of some 64,000 properties. Against an agreed standard for condition very few properties met the highest standard. DHE had already 



<P>
<P><I>29 Apr 2002 : Column 531W</I><P>
embarked on a programme to refurbish all of the properties then forecast as required for the long term but, on the basis of the information contained in the survey and the amount of work required, the target date was revised from 2003 to November 2005.The survey report is now outdated, in that some 12,000 properties have since been disposed of, and significant new build and upgrade projects carried out. It would therefore be inappropriate to place a copy in the Library of the House. However, the latest information is as follows:

<P>
<P>
<a name="20429w03.html_spnew3"><B> Dr. Moonie </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 25 April 2002]:</i> The introduction into service of a range of programmes has led to significant improvements to the armed forces' Command, Control and Communications (C3) capability since July 1998. Examples include the upgrade and expansion of our Joint Force Maritime and Air Operational Command Systems, and upgrades to the Skynet 4 satellite system. We have also introduced specific additional communications capabilities to improve interoperability with allies to ensure maximum operational flexibility for our deployed forces in the particular demands of the Afghanistan environment. Furthermore, the Personal Role Radio was released into service in January 2002, two months earlier than scheduled, and is currently deployed with troops in Afghanistan.
<P>

<a name="20429w03.html_para2">These enhancements are backed by a significant programme of investment in our future capability that, over the next few years, includes the introduction of Bowman, Skynet 5, and Falcon.

<P>
<a name="20429w03.html_spnew4"><B> Dr. Moonie </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 25 April 2002]:</i> The armed forces have made significant improvements to their ISTAR capabilities since 1998, introducing into service a variety of assets to improve surveillance and intelligence gathering capabilities. Examples include the introduction into service of the PHOENIX unmanned aerial vehicle in 1999, improvements to our EW capability for land and maritime forces, and improved imaging capabilities for the RAF. In addition, recent operations have led to the introduction of specific ISTAR capabilities in support of our deployed forces, including mobile weapon locating radars, improvements in our intelligence distribution networks and an increase in the provision of tactical level surveillance devices.
<P>

<a name="20429w03.html_para3">ISTAR remains a priority area for future investment. Among our programmes due into service over the next few years are: ASTOR, delivering significant improvements to our airborne surveillance capabilities; and the WATCHKEEPER unmanned aerial vehicle project that will greatly enhance our battlefield surveillance capabilities. As well as primarily ISTAR assets, the planned introduction of platforms with integral ISTAR systems, such as the Attack Helicopter, will further enhance our capabilities in this area.

<P>
<a name="20429w04.html_spnew6"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The Ministry of Defence Form F680 Process allows industry to seek preliminary Government approval for the release of classified military information, or advice on the prospects for eventual approval of an export licence application, at the marketing stage. In the case of the latter, the Government consider applications against the consolidated EU and national arms export licensing criteria. It is, however, routinely made clear that preliminary advice to companies under this procedure does not constitute an export licence nor guarantee that any future export licence application would result in the issue of a licence.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20429w05.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Boateng </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 26 April 2002]:</i> The apparent growth in climate change levy receipts between 2001&#150;02 and 2002&#150;03 is largely due to start-up effects reducing the cash received in 2001&#150;02.
<P>

 The International Monetary and Financial Committee met in Washington DC on 20 April 2002. The Committee had a broad agenda, covering the global economy, the IMF's policy agenda and progress in combating money laundering and the financing of terrorism. Based on the Committee's discussions, management will determine the forward work programme and priorities for the International Monetary Fund over the next six months.
<P>

<a name="20429w06.html_para0">In their discussion of the global economy the Committee welcomed the international community's decisive policy actions, especially following the tragic events of 11 September 2001, to maintain financial stability, restore the momentum of world economic growth, and reinvigorate the fight against poverty. The Committee also urged the Argentine authorities to co-operate with the IMF to reach agreement on a sustainable economic programme.
<P>

<a name="20429w06.html_para1">Going forward the Committee will continue to work together for sustained, broad based growth, creating opportunities for productive employment, reducing vulnerabilities, opening up economies for trade, providing resources for durable poverty reduction, and sustaining global action to combat money laundering and the financing of terrorism.
<P>

<a name="20429w06.html_para2">The Committee also made recommendations for strengthening the IMF's surveillance, including in financial sectors, and crisis prevention and for enhancing the existing framework for crisis resolution, including consideration of innovative proposals to improve the process of sovereign debt restructuring.
<P>

<a name="20429w06.html_para3">The Committee fully endorsed the Monterrey consensus and encouraged the IMF to work closely with the World bank, regional development banks, the United Nations and bilateral donors in monitoring progress towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals. The Committee welcomed the outcomes of the recent reviews of the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility and of the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper process and were encouraged by progress in implementation of the heavily indebted poor countries (HIPC) initiative. However, they noted that debt sustainability remains an issue for a number of HIPC countries and called on the IMF and the World bank to review the situation.

 The Government expect the Community Development Venture Fund to be launched and begin operating shortly.

The investment profile and timing will depend on the opportunities that the fund identifies, the time taken to bring companies to the point of investment readiness, and on market conditions.

 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="20429w07.html_para0">Under a Common Position reached at the December 2001 EU Environment Council, member states set an EU-wide maximum limit for sulphur of 10ppm (termed "sulphur-free" fuel) from 1 January 2009, this date being subject to review by the Commission with respect to diesel fuel. The Common Position would also require member states to ensure the widespread availability of these fuels from 1 January 2005 in order that it is available for the latest technology vehicles that can take best advantage of it. The European Parliament will now consider the Common Position at its Second Reading.
<P>

<a name="20429w07.html_para1">Almost all petrol and diesel sold in the UK is already ultra low (50ppm) sulphur. Sulphur-free petrol and diesel has now been introduced at 18 retail sites in and around Edinburgh. Current availability of sulphur free fuels in most EU member states is minimal. However, sulphur- free diesel is quite widely available in Sweden and all super unleaded petrol is sulphur-free in Germany.
<P>

<a name="20429w07.html_para2">In the period up to 1 January 2009, the availability of sulphur-free fuels will be influenced by the rate of investment in new refinery technology needed to produce the fuels and also the level of fiscal incentives offered by individual member states to encourage its supply. In this respect, the Chancellor, in his recent Budget statement, announced plans to introduce duty incentives favouring sulphur-free fuels in 2003, subject to European agreement. Germany has also announced similar plans. The Benelux countries are also expected to follow this UK and German lead with the result that fairly widespread availability may be expected in these countries from 2003 onwards. Under the terms of the directive, widespread availability is to be expected in all EU member states from 2005.

 The Department has been involved with Cross River communities, in the use and management of forest resources on a sustainable basis, at varying times over the last seven years. Implementation on the latest programme commenced in July 1999 and is due to complete in January 2003.
<P>

<a name="20429w08.html_para0">This project was last formally assessed during an Output-to-Purpose Review (OPR) in September 2001 in conjunction with the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA). The review team observed significant achievements over the two-year period compared to the slow progress under military rule prior to 1999. Most notably, the conclusions from the OPR related to economy, efficiency and effectiveness highlighted the following:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>33 forest management committees (FMCs) have been established. Strong partnerships have developed between all stakeholders in a number of these and communities are organising themselves according to a common constitution to protect their rights and forest.
<P>
<BR>
Communities have shown more commitment to the sustainable management of their forest resources and to curbing illegal exploitation. This has been largely due to public awareness of the value and importance of sustainable forest management undertaken by the project.
<P>
<BR>
Communities are receiving a greater share of forest royalties more promptly while changes in forest laws promoted by the project, which will strengthen communities' rights over forests, are about to be submitted.

Capacity of community based forest organisations and of the forestry commission staff have improved with training provided under the project.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="20429w08.html_para1">An important component of the project worked on the institutional strengthening and capacity building of the Forest Commission (FC) to enable it to facilitate implementation of the forest sector strategy and action plan. The capacity of the state to play its role in joint management of forest resources is crucial to sustaining the productive capacity and biological resources and to ecological significance of the tropical high forest. Notable achievements here are:

Illegal logging and transport of timber have been reduced.
<P>
<BR>
A number of short-term (international and local) consultancies have provided valuable input into the project implementation eg the Non Timber Forest Products consultancy while the Legal Framework consultancy provided groundwork for the proposed changes in the laws.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="20429w08.html_para2">Overall, the review team concluded that the project purpose was likely to be partially achieved, which is significant given the original risk assessment rated this project as medium to high risk, later amended to high risk. This achievement rating could be changed during the next review. CIDA have agreed to continue working with the forestry commission and the communities when DFID's input completes next year. DFID's withdrawal is solely linked to our stated strategy to focus on a limited number of reforming states (four). These states are in the south-west, south-east, north and middle belt. Cross River state is in the south geo-political zone.

 The latest carbon dioxide projections are published in the UK's Third National Communication to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Projections, taking account of the policies and measures as quantified in the UK's Climate Change Programme, show estimated emissions in 2010 at about 19 per cent. below the 1990 level. Additional measures that cannot yet be quantified could increase this to a 20 per cent. reduction. Although the uncertainties are greater, current projections indicate about the same level of reduction in 2015 without further policies and measures.

 The Environment Agency has now issued the final version of its guidance on the recovery and disposal (including storage) of refrigerators and freezers. In addition, a list of treatment companies has been placed on the DEFRA website to facilitate contact between local authorities and the waste management industry.
<P>

<a name="20429w08.html_para4">A leaflet for householders advising on how to dispose of old fridges, originally available only on the DEFRA website, has now been published in hard copy as well, and widely distributed. Guidance on the disposal of commercial refrigeration equipment has been placed on the website and we hope to issue a paper version shortly.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what plans the Government have to utilise biomass fuelled CHP technology on the Government Estate; and when these plans will be implemented.  [51964]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20429w08.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 All Government Departments have a target to ensure that by 31 March 2003, at least 5 per cent. of their electricity comes from renewable sources, or from self-generation, provided this does not entail excessive cost. They also have a longer-term target for at least 10 per cent. of their supply by 31 March 2008, which is subject to review after March 2003.
<P>

<a name="20429w08.html_para5">Biomass is just one of the renewable technologies that can help Departments meet this target. I am not aware of any current plans to utilise biomass production technology on any significant scale on the Government Estate, and it is for each Department to determine the extent to which self-generation is a practicable and cost-effective option.
<P>

<a name="20429w08.html_para6">However, DEFRA, PIU and the National Lottery are funding research and development into energy crops and biomass as fuel for CHP schemes, and I will encourage Government Departments to examine the scope which such technology may in future offer.

 Torbay was one of a number of authorities selected for corporate governance inspection. Corporate governance inspections have been a powerful diagnostic tool to examine the corporate capabilities and management systems of local councils. Torbay was selected in response to concerns raised by the Audit Commission and other inspectorates about the council's management capabilities for key services. The inspection is not yet complete and the report is unlikely to be published before this summer.
<P>

<a name="20429w10.html_para0">The inspection of Torbay was large, involving a range of representatives from different inspectorates working with the Audit Commission to examine the full range of service issues. The estimated cost of the inspection is approximately &#163;70,000 based on a team of eleven people. Torbay council's net budget is approximately &#163;123 million. It is hoped this inspection will result in significant improvements to the quality and efficiency of local service delivery with clear benefits for local people and the authority.

 Our comprehensive agenda for reform of the local government finance system was set out in last December's White Paper "Strong Local leadership&#151;Quality Public Services".

<P>
<a name="20429w11.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The contract between Associated British Ports and Humber Pilots Ltd. is a matter for the parties and it was not appropriate for Ministers to become involved in the dispute which arose between them over it. The Pilotage Act 1987 provides for there to be a contract between authorised pilots and their competent harbour authority, and for authorisations to be revoked if there ceases to be one.
<P>

<a name="20429w11.html_para4">I understand that, when Humber Pilots Ltd. gave notice on their contract, expiring in January 2002, the authority responded by formally advising each authorised pilot that his authorisation would then be revoked by virtue of termination of the contract between the authority and Humber Pilots Ltd.

[53086]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20429w11.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 I understand that no pilots worked for Humber Pilots Ltd: it was established as a co-operative under the Friendly Society Act 1965 with its members treated as self-employed.

 None. The Walthamstow area is mainly affected by overflight of aircraft inbound to London Heathrow and outbound from London City. It may sometimes also be overflown by aircraft inbound to London Stansted, when that airport is operating in a north easterly direction.

 My Department carried out a public consultation last year on a proposal to revise Department of the Environment Circular 2/92 on the official safeguarding of aerodromes, technical sites and military explosives storage areas. Following the end of the public consultation period, and discussions with the main stakeholders, my Department last month issued for further comment by those stakeholders a second draft of a revised Circular. In doing so the Department has reinstated the recommendation contained in the 1992 Circular, to operators of smaller aerodromes and of sites for other aviation activities, such as gliding or parachuting, to lodge an 'unofficial' safeguarding map with local planning authorities, together with the offer by the Civil Aviation Authority of advice on a format for such maps.

<P>
<a name="20429w12.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 I understand from the Civil Aviation Authority that it has undertaken to publish guidance on aerodrome safeguarding for all aerodrome operators. A complete draft of the guidance is at present being considered by an industry working group, and the intention is that the final version will be available to complement the proposed new Departmental Circular to local authorities on safeguarding consultation requirements. Notwithstanding the proposed changes to those requirements, and the proposed publication of guidance, the Civil Aviation Authority will maintain its own safeguarding expertise and will continue to provide advice to aerodrome operators as the need arises.

<P>

 Public financial support for bus services has helped to maintain service levels and passenger numbers by reducing operators' costs and subsidising services which are not commercially viable, including some 1,800 new or enhanced rural services supported by Rural Bus Subsidy Grant introduced in 1998. Funding has also provided for concessionary fares for pensioners and a number of other groups and helped operators to achieve high levels of investment in new vehicles.

2. While the change in the number of registered child minders is of concern it has coincided with increases in alternative forms of child care over the past few years, which have offered a greater diversity in services for parents and children.<P>

3. The Government value registered child minding and are concerned about the decline in child minder numbers. The Government's strategy to help to reverse this trend includes:<P>

a four year national recruitment campaign to raise the status of working in the sector;<P>

child minder start up grants;<P>

grants to help child minders in disadvantaged areas when they have a vacancy; and<P>

the creation of networks to support child minders. <P>

 Data drawn from local Asset Management Plans and sent to the Department in 2000&#150;01 by local education authorities show that the overwhelming majority of secondary schools have indoor facilities for physical education. Appraisal of this information and data has focused on LEAs' overall assessment processes, rather than the details for each school. It is not therefore possible to list those schools which do not have such facilities. Information about individual schools can be obtained from the appropriate local education authority.

 Pay and conditions for teachers in maintained schools, including those with sixth forms, is determined on a statutory basis under the School Teachers' Pay and Conditions Act 1991. The pay and terms and conditions of the lecturers who work in sixth form colleges and general further education colleges are matter for the employers to determine, in discussion with the relevant unions. A wide range of pay and conditions now exist in the FE sector, reflecting the diverse learning needs of the colleges' local communities and colleges' individual decisions on implementing the nationally recommended pay settlement each year.

 The Teachers' Pension Scheme is an unfunded scheme, with a "notional" account maintained and valued periodically by the Government Actuary. The last valuation, as at 31 March 1996, revealed that total liabilities of the scheme (pensions currently in payment and the estimated cost of future benefits) amounted to &#163;65,670 million and total assets amounted to &#163;61,710 million. The 1996 report is available in the House of Commons Library.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20429w14.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 Where a teacher is considered to be permanently unfit to teach as a result of illness or injury, they become entitled to receive payment of ill health retirement benefits, consisting of a pension and lump sum. Arrangements for the payment of benefits are made by the administrators of the Teachers' Pension Scheme. The cost of ill health retirement benefits, alongside the cost of all other benefits payable under the provisions of the scheme, is taken into account by the Government Actuary as part of the periodic scheme valuation. The results of the valuation determine the employer contribution rate needed to defray the costs of the scheme. Teachers pay a contribution of 6 per cent. of salary towards the cost of their pension scheme benefits; the current employer contribution rate is 8.35 per cent. of salary.

 My right hon. Friend the Chancellor announced in the Budget an additional &#163;85 million investment in 2002&#150;03 in school and college buildings in England. This means that every maintained school in England, including those in Cheltenham, will receive in 2002&#150;03 an additional allocation of about 20 per cent. of New Deal for Schools devolved formula capital for schools. Colleges and other educational establishments will also receive their proportionate share.

 My powers are broadly for England, with some also extending to Wales. The education and training functions previously exercised by my right hon. Friends the Secretaries of State for Scotland and for Northern Ireland have transferred to the devolved Administrations in Scotland and Northern Ireland. My officials work closely with officials in the devolved Administrations on matters of mutual interest across the UK. My Department also represents the UK at international level on education, skills and youth issues, briefed, where appropriate, by the devolved Administrations. Under the Industrial Training Acts, I have levy powers across England, Scotland and Wales to fund the Industrial Training Boards.

 It is for each college to agree annual pay rises and conditions of employment with its staff in the context of the overall resources available to them. We are, however, aware of the funding gap between schools and FE and have pledged to bring up levels of funding and allow upwards convergence over time as resources allow.
<P>

<a name="20429w16.html_para2">We are investing significant funding in the FE sector. In 2001- 02, &#163;527 million extra was planned for FE&#151;a 12 per cent. real terms increase, with a further 3 per cent. increase this year. By 2003&#150;04, annual funding for FE will have increased by &#163;1.4 billion compared with 1997&#150;98, a real terms increase of 20 per cent. The substantial additional investment we are making in the sector should help colleges and the trade unions reach agreement on appropriate salary increase this year.
<P>

<a name="20429w16.html_para3">We are also investing more than &#163;311 million in the teaching pay initiative during the period 2001&#150;04 to allow colleges, including sixth form colleges, to reward high quality teaching. This is separate to any general pay rise a teacher may receive.

Both parties have agreed to form a transitional government of national unity, to work together through dialogue to find a sustainable solution and to bring to an end to the violence and the various blockades which have brought Madagascar to a virtual standstill. Both parties need to live up to this undertaking. We will continue, with our EU and international partners, to monitor developments.

<a name="20429w18.html_para1">The paper expresses our disappointment at the failure of the States Parties to agree on the text of a Protocol to the Convention last year, despite all our efforts.

 The costs of the public inquiry completed in 1985 and attributed to the then Department of Energy, or recoverable from the Central Electricity Generating Board, totalled some &#163;2.5 million. However the full costs of the inquiry would be several times that amount and would include the costs of CEGB applying for consent for the power station and the costs of other parties that participated in the inquiry. As the information is not held centrally within my Department, and the length of time since the inquiry, an estimate of the full costs cannot now be obtained without disproportionate costs.

 The most recent data on the electricity output from renewable, wind and CHP sources were published on 31 August 2001 by Ofgem in its "Report to the DTI on the Review of the Initial Impact of NETA on Smaller Generators", covering the first two months of NETA operation. It found that, for those two months, compared with the corresponding two-month period a year earlier, output had decreased as follows:

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(b) for hydro, by 14 per cent;</FONT></UL>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(c) for wind, by 13 per cent; and</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(d) for CHP, by 61 per cent.</FONT></UL>
<P>

<a name="20429w19.html_para0">A significant rise in gas prices that occurred in the same months may have contributed to the very large fall in CHP output recorded in the survey period.
<P>

<a name="20429w19.html_para1">Ofgem has committed in its corporate plan to carry out a review of NETA covering the first year of operation, to be published in the second quarter of 2002. Ofgem has indicated it intends to include as part of its one year review a chapter on the impact of NETA on smaller generators during the first year of NETA operation. In addition, further data on the output of electricity from renewables (including wind) and CHP sources are expected to be published in July 2002 in the DTI's annual "Digest of UK Energy Statistics".
<P>

<a name="20429w19.html_para2">Following the Ofgem report of 31 August 2001, the Government set up a consultation on NETA and smaller generators, and on 4 April 2002 published their response. This identifies action to help smaller

<P>

<a name="20429w19.html_para3">The introduction of the Renewables Obligation on 1 April this year provides a substantial impetus to the use of renewable electricity. On CHP, DEFRA are working to produce a draft strategy that will be out to consultation shortly. In the recent Budget, several measures were announced that would benefit CHP, including extending the exemption of CHP from the climate change levy.

 Terms and conditions of secondments into the Department are set out in contractual agreements. The standard terms for all secondees in relation to travel and subsistence costs are that the Department reimburses direct to secondees the cost of any travel, subsistence and other expenditure that they may incur in the course of their work while on secondment. Reimbursement is at DTI rates and is made in accordance with departmental rules. The only exception to this arrangement is where any secondee has the use of a company car and uses it on DTI business. In these instances the secondee is not paid a DTI mileage rate but is reimbursed actual costs of petrol used.

 While neither permanent staff nor secondees have to sign the Official Secrets Act all secondments into the Department are subject to specific contractual terms. The contracts, which are signed by the secondee, make it clear that they are subject to the provisions of the Official Secrets Act 1989 and to certain other Acts which prohibit unauthorised disclosure of various categories of information and that they are therefore required to conform to the Department's security procedures. An explanatory booklet summarising the provisions of the Official Secrets Act 1989 is sent to each secondee with their contract. Additionally the contract makes clear that secondees, like civil servants, are also required to exercise care in handling information that they acquire in the course of their official duties and to protect information that is held in confidence.

Member for Runnymede and Weybridge to the Under-Secretary of State at her Department of 6 November 2001 remained unanswered until 16 April 2002 and <i>(b)</i> the reason for the delay in her Department determining that the question posed in the original letter falls outside its remit.  [52401]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20429w20.html_spnew7"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 I apologise for the delay in replying to the hon. Member. His letter was transferred to the Department of Trade and Industry as that Department is responsible for advertising and advertising campaigns. Unfortunately there was a breakdown in communications during this process and action has now been taken to ensure this does not happen again. In 2001, the Department answered 90 per cent. of Members' correspondence within 18 working days and I am satisfied that this was an isolated incident.

 Entry to the permanent collections at all the main museums and galleries sponsored by my Department is now free to everyone. This policy took effect from 1 December 2001 and represents the delivery of a key element of our manifesto commitment. In the first four months since the introduction of free admission at those museums and galleries that previously charged visitor numbers have increased by an average of seventy five per cent. This means that an extra 1.7 million people have been able to enjoy admission to these priceless collections free of charge, no matter what their income or background.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport (1) what assessment she had made of the implications of the collapse of ITV Digital for the provision of ITV franchise licence fees under the digital dividend of <i>(a)</i> Granada plc and <i>(b)</i> Carlton Communications plc;  [50712]
<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="20429w20.html_spnew9"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 Under the provisions of the Broadcasting Act 1996, the percentage of qualifying multiplex revenue payable to the Independent Television Commission by the digital terrestrial licencees has been set by order at nil for the duration of the licences. The purpose of this is to promote the availability of free-to-view digital television by offsetting related costs. The ITV companies therefore do not make payments to the Treasury on the proportion of their advertising revenue attributed to viewing in homes that are digital. There are no plans to review or alter this framework.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what the cost in 2000&#150;01 was of <i>(a)</i> the maintenance of each of the Crown courts in England and <i>(b)</i> administering each of the Crown courts in England; and what the average cost per case heard was of each of the Crown courts in 2000&#150;01.

 <i>(a)</i> The table provides the cost of maintenance of each of the Crown (and combined) courts in England for the financial year 2000&#150;01. The figures reflect gross cash expenditure and are based on routine maintenance works only. They do not include figures for any major maintenance/building enhancement works. Figures for the combined courts reflect the total costs of the buildings including non-Crown court areas. For information purposes, the average cost of maintenance per square metre of each court centre is also included.

<a name="20429w21.html_para8"><i>(b)</i> A significant proportion of the cost of administering the Crown court is paid for as central overheads and is not held in a format which can identify the individual costs of each court centre. To do so otherwise would incur disproportionate costs to the Department. For information purposes, however, the total cost of administering the Crown court in 2000&#150;01 across England and Wales was &#163;281 million. This figure excludes legal aid costs.

<P>
<a name="20429w22.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 There is currently no backlog of asylum cases within the IAA. At the end of March the IAA was dealing with 20,626 outstanding adjudicator appeals, 1,883 outstanding leave to appeal applications and 1,753 outstanding substantive tribunal appeals. This level of work in progress for asylum cases is necessary to ensure the proper functioning of the IAA and is based on the SDA target of clearing 65 per cent. of all cases through both tiers within 17 weeks.
<P>

<a name="20429w22.html_para0">The IAA is also currently dealing with 4,114 adjudicator appeals, 36 leave to appeal applications and 39 substantive tribunal appeals in immigration cases. In each instance, this is within or in line with expectation. These immigration figures do not cover family visit visas.

 None. The purpose of the report is to advise the court. The court must take account of the Children and Family Reporter's recommendation but is not bound to follow it. If a party to proceedings has concerns about the report written by the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service (CAFCASS) or alternate proposals to put before the court, it is possible for all parties to the case to put forward their proposals, or raise concerns, at or before the hearing where the CAFCASS officer can be questioned on the content of the report.

 All practitioners from the Family Court Welfare Service and Guardian Ad Litem Service who transferred to the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service (CAFCASS) on 1 April 2001 have the Diploma in Social Work (DipSW) awarded by Central Council for Education and Training in Social Work (CCETSW), now the Training Organisation for the Personal Social Services (TOPSS), or an equivalent qualification. This is still a requirement for all staff appointed as of 1 April 2001.
<P>

<a name="20429w22.html_para1">All staff are encouraged to undertake post-qualifying training approved by TOPSS, such as the Post Qualification award in child care (PQCCA) or in some instances the Advanced Award in Social Work.

[43132]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20429w22.html_spnew8"><B> Maria Eagle: </B> 
 The cumulative value of occupational pension funds depends on a number of factors including investment growth, employer and employee contributions, tax relief, national insurance rebates, pension payments and transfers. It is not possible to calculate the cumulative value of employer contributions separately.
<P>

<a name="20429w22.html_para4">However this Department does collect information on private sector contribution rates to defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes as a proportion of employee salary, through the Employer Pension Provision (EPP) Report. The EPP Report 2000 was published on 18 March 2002, and shows that the median employer contribution rate in 'salary related' (defined benefit) schemes was 6 per cent. of pay, and the rate in 'money purchase' (defined contribution) schemes was 5 per cent. of pay. A copy of the report is available in the Library.
<P>

<a name="20429w22.html_para5">The Government Actuary's Department produces its Occupational Pension Schemes survey every five years.

 When attendance allowance recipients have been in hospital for 28 days, payments are suspended pending their discharge because the needs arising from their disability are being met free of charge.

 We have been determined that employers and organisations wishing to use the new service provided by the new Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) will have a ready means of access. To meet the needs of those employers and organisations which do not wish to register with the bureau in their own right, we have encouraged others to consider acting on their behalf, as umbrella bodies, and we shall continue to do so. Up to 16 April 2002, 707 bodies had registered with the CRB as umbrella bodies, including 419 which have indicated that they are prepared to act on behalf of others outside their own circle or sector.

The Criminal Policy Group is responsible for Home Office Aims 3 and 4. Aim 3 is "to ensure the effective delivery of justice, avoiding unnecessary delay, through efficient investigation, detection, prosecution and court procedures. To minimise the threat to and intimidation of witnesses and to engage with and support victims". Aim 4 is "to deliver effective custodial and community sentences to reduce re-offending and protect the public, through the prison and probation services, in partnership with the Youth Justice Board". Current activities include:

<P>

<a name="20429w24.html_para3"><i>(d)</i> The Home Office introduced a compensation scheme for surrender of small firearms (handguns) following events in Dunblane in March 1996. The Firearms (Amendment) Acts 1997 prohibited possession of handguns; compensation was paid for their surrender together with surrender of ammunition and related ancillary equipment (holsters etc.). Although the majority of weapons were surrendered during 1997&#150;98, some residual cases continue to be administered by the Department.

<a name="20429w24.html_para4"><i>(e)</i> The activities of the Policing and Crime Reduction Group centre around the provision of an efficient, effective police service and reduction in crime. Policing policy activity covers legislation and implementation of the police reform programme; personnel and resource measures to support the police, including recruitment and pay arrangements and work on police leadership, powers and procedures. The crime reduction focus of the group is achieved through developing and implementing strategies to address particular types of crime and disorder, by encouraging and providing a framework for partnership working and by developing and administering

<a name="20429w24.html_para5">A significant part of the group's work lies in ensuring that there is scientific and technological support for the police and crime reduction. The group sponsors a number of agencies and non-departmental public bodies in this and other areas. Through the Police Standards Unit and support for the independent inspectorate (Her Majesty's inspectorate of constabulary), the group has a major commitment to the achievement of high standards and performance in the police service.

It is of course for police forces and not police authorities to investigate allegations of child abuse.

 Action to tackle antisocial behaviour is being taken across Government Departments.

 <i>[holding answer 10 April 2002]:</i> The public service agreement for the economic cost of crime commits the criminal justice system departments to "reduce the cost of crime by March 2004 to be measured by an indicator to be developed by March 2001".

<a name="20429w25.html_para9">Estimates of the economic and social cost of crime were published in a report in December 2000, "The economic and social costs of crime" (Home Office Research Study 217).

The Criminal Justice Departments and Her Majesty's Treasury have not yet agreed how best to measure progress.

 <i>[holding answer 10 April 2002]:</i> As stated in my reply to the hon. Member on 10 December 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 701W, the target is to reduce the fear of violent crime, burglary, and vehicle crime by 2004 from their 2001 baselines. During the baseline year, 22.3 per cent. of people were very concerned about violent crime, 16.5 per cent. about burglary, and 18.5 per cent. about vehicle crime.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20429w25.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The street crime initiative is targeted at the 10 forces which account for 82 per cent. of robbery in England and Wales, but the effect of the initiative will have benefits for all police force areas. Good practice in partnership working across the criminal justice system and between other agencies will be disseminated to all areas. The 10 force initiative should serve to identify and remove any systemic blockages which may currently hinder the tackling of street crime not only in those 10 areas, but across the country. By setting up this initiative we are sending out a clear signal that we will not tolerate crime on our streets, wherever they occur.

 The Vehicle Crime Reduction Action Team (VCRAT) was set up in September 1998 to develop and oversee the implementation of initiatives to meet the Government's target to reduce vehicle crime by 30 per cent. over five years from 1998&#150;99. They published their strategy for achieving the target on 22 September 1999.
<P>

<a name="20429w26.html_para1">The main lines of action in the VCRAT strategy include improved security on new and used cars; improved car park security; better policing and community responses which target prolific offenders and crime hotspots; and new procedures for the detection of stolen cars at the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency. The Vehicles (Crime) Act 2001 took forward VCRAT recommendations for regulation of the motor salvage industry and controls on the supply of vehicle number plates, and we expect to implement these provisions between July 2002 and April 2003.
<P>

<a name="20429w26.html_para2">We expect these and other initiatives&#151;such as the introduction of best value targets for forces in England and Wales; the introduction of a vehicle crime toolkit to enable forces to exchange good practice and the provision of better information to the police at the roadside&#151;to impact on the number of apprehensions leading to an increase in the number of prosecutions for car crimes. The latest published figures show that recorded vehicle crime reduced by 10.1 per cent. in 2000&#150;01 compared with 1998&#150;99.

<P>
<a name="20429w26.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Denham </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 22 April 2002]:</i> Police forces in England and Wales act in accordance with the Code of Practice issued under the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996. This sets out the procedures for the retention and destruction of material obtained in a criminal investigation which may be relevant to the investigation. All material which may be relevant to the investigation must be retained until a decision is taken whether to institute proceedings against a person for an offence.
<P>

<a name="20429w26.html_para6">If a criminal investigation results in proceedings being instituted, all material which may be relevant must be retained at least until the accused is acquitted or convicted

or the prosecutor decides not to proceed with the case. Where the accused is convicted, all material which may be relevant must be retained at least until:

<a name="20429w26.html_para7">If an appeal against conviction is in progress when the release or discharge occurs, or at the end of the period of six months specified above, all material which may be relevant must be retained until the appeal is determined.

 The information requested is not collected centrally. Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC), however, collect data on the number of officers on long term sick leave (i.e. more than 28 days), the working days lost due to long term sickness and the number of days spent by officers on recuperative or restricted duties. 2000&#150;01 is the last full year for which data is available.
<P>

<a name="20429w26.html_para9">Not all forces have systems in place to provide the full information requested by HMIC on sick leave. The data for 2000&#150;01 is therefore incomplete but shows that at 31 March 2001, 2,591 officers were on long term sick leave. In the 12 month period ending 31 March 2001, 760,533 police officer working days were lost due to long-term sickness. Additionally the number of days spent by officers on recuperative duties in 2000&#150;01 was 241,159.

<a name="20429w26.html_para11">An officer's pension entitlements on being compulsorily retired on ill health grounds depend on his or her length of pensionable service in the police pension scheme. An ill health pension, which is payable immediately on retirement, is calculated in a similar way to an ordinary pension but is subject to enhancement where an officer has at least five years' pensionable service. This is to compensate the officer at least in part for the lost opportunity of serving until normal retirement.

<a name="20429w26.html_para13">The Police Negotiating Board (PNB) are considering ways to deliver a fair and more consistent approach towards early retirement due to ill health. This should enable forces to reduce the level of ill-health retirement and match the performance of the best quartile of forces in 2000&#150;01 by 2005. The measures under consideration include amendments to the Police Pensions Regulations and joint guidance being issued by the PNB to police authorities and senior management to ensure that wherever possible officers continue in employment where they are capable of performing sufficient duties to make their retention operationally justifiable.

 The national health service provides care for women during pregnancy and childbirth in various types, sizes and locations of maternity units, including units within general hospitals or stand-alone units. The Department expects this choice to continue. It is for area strategic health authorities, trusts and local health communities to decide on the best pattern of service provision, taking into account the needs of local people, evidence of effectiveness and available resources. The Department has also set up a maternity and neonatal work force group to consider work force issues for various models for maternity care. Its findings will feed into the development of the maternity module of the Children's National Service Framework, which will be published at a later date.
<P>

<a name="20429w27.html_para0">The acute module of the new National Service Framework for Children will among other issues consider access to appropriate hospital paediatric services. It will be published later this year.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20429w27.html_spnew3"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 No. Because of the many uncertainties surrounding this issue&#151;including the incubation period of vCJD and the difficulties of tracking individual instruments&#151;we do not consider it feasible to make such an estimate. The risk assessment therefore did not predict the scale of any secondary epidemic of vCJD, instead, it developed different scenarios to address the various uncertainties&#151;including the standard of decontamination&#151;and gaps in our knowledge about vCJD.
<P>

<a name="20429w27.html_para1">The advice we had from the spongiform encephalopathology advisory committee was that good decontamination is key in reducing the risk of person to person transmission of vCJD via surgical instruments. This was confirmed by the risk assessment. As a result of the work we did last year on improving decontamination, all national health service hospitals in England have access to decontamination services of an acceptable standard.

 Article 5 of the proposed food supplements directive would establish the approach to setting maximum limits for vitamins and minerals present in food supplements. The Food Standards Agency, which has taken the lead on negotiating this directive on the Government's behalf, is now directing its energies towards arguing the case for these limits to be based on thorough scientific risk assessments and forging strong links between the scientific committee on foods and an expert group it has set up to advise on acceptable levels.
<P>

(NTD) in women who had already been through a pregnancy affected by NTD. Following this, in 1992, the then Government issued guidance on supplementation. All women planning a pregnancy are advised to take a daily 400 milligramme supplement from before conception until the twelfth week of pregnancy. They are also advised to eat folate-rich foods.
<P>

<a name="20429w28.html_para1">In 2000, the Committee on Medical Aspects of Food and Nutrition Policy (COMA) advised that fortification of wheat flour with folic acid would help to reduce the number of births affected by NTDs. However, COMA also recognised the potential for increased folic acid intake to mask vitamin B12 deficiency, particularly in older people. The level of fortification recommended by COMA aimed to minimise the number of people having intakes of folic acid which may mask B12 deficiency.
<P>

<a name="20429w28.html_para2">A consultation document on COMA's conclusions was issued in July 2000 jointly by the Health Departments and the Food Standards Agency (FSA). The majority of residents were in favour of fortification although this was not overwhelming (59 per cent.). The most common concerns were over the potential risks of fortification and the possible restriction of consumer choice.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what estimate he has made of the level of <i>(a)</i> waste, <i>(b)</i> fraud and <i>(c)</i> inefficiency in the NHS in each of the last five years; and what measures he has introduced to reduce the level.  [46730]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20429w28.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Hutton </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 10 April 2002]:</i> The Department monitors and manages the performance of the NHS in the delivery of the key targets set out in the "NHS Plan". In addition, the NHS is subject to external independent audit by the Audit Commission and the National Audit Office. They publish a number of studies each year on the value for money of aspects of the NHS. The Department considers each of these reports, and implements their recommendations where appropriate.
<P>

<a name="20429w28.html_para4">Analysis using data from November 1998 identified &#163;117 million of pharmaceutical patient fraud.

[47131]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20429w29.html_spnew3"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 No such assessment has been made. Palliative care should involve a combination of services including hospital, hospice, community and day care. We know that, given the choice and the right circumstances, many people with cancer would prefer to die at home. Cancer networks have been asked to draw up service delivery plans on palliative care, including a review of the level of services offered in their area. These plans will aim to ensure that each network has a range of palliative care services available to suit the local population. They will be supported by the extra funding for palliative care pledged in the NHS Cancer Plan.

<P>
<a name="20429w29.html_spnew4"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 Funding for hospices is a matter for local decision, based on a strategic view of palliative care services. In the NHS Cancer Plan we pledged an additional &#163;50 million per year nationally for specialist palliative care by 2004. We are monitoring progress in providing this extra investment.

 There are wide variations both in the range of funding from the national health service and in the provision of specialist palliative care services across the country. We are committed to improving palliative care. That is why we have pledged to make available an additional &#163;50 million by 2004 for palliative care so that the NHS can make an adequate contribution to the costs hospices incur in providing agreed levels of service. The additional funding will mean that for the first time, NHS investment in specialist palliative care services as a whole will match that of the voluntary sector. We are monitoring progress in providing this increased investment.

 I am advised by the Food Standards Agency that a Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) was published in April 2000 to coincide with the introduction of the Butchers' Licensing Regulations in England.
<P>

<a name="20429w29.html_para1">The RIA estimated the annual cost per butcher's shop would be approximately &#163;490, comprising &#163;100 payable by the butcher on receipt of a licence from the local authority and an average cost of &#163;390 per shop for staff hygiene training necessary to satisfy one of the licensing conditions. The total recurring compliance costs for the butchery sector were estimated at &#163;3.3 million per annum.
<P>

<a name="20429w29.html_para2">The annual costs to public funds stem from the issue of licences by the local authorities. The RIA estimated the &#163;100 licence fee, which is retained in full by the issuing local authority, would offset these costs.

<a name="20429w29.html_para6">The NHS Plan sets a target to reduce the maximum wait for any stage of treatment to three months. Provided we can recruit and retain the extra staff, and the national health service makes the necessary reforms, we hope to achieve this objective by the end of 2008.
<P>

<a name="20429w29.html_para7">We also announced in the NHS Plan an increase in the number of training places for therapists and other health professionals including SLTs. By 2004 there will be 4,450 more training places. Current initiatives including the grading exercise under way in all speech and language therapy services in England will result in improved pay and career opportunities for SLTs. We firmly believe that this initiative will help in the recruitment and retention of SLTs currently working, the return of therapists who have left the profession, and an increase of applicants for training places.

 It is difficult to estimate the total potential demand for liver transplants. However, the median waiting time for a transplant for adults is only 60 days. At the end of March this year there were only 131 English residents on the waiting list and each year some 550 to 600 transplants are performed on English residents depending on the availability of suitable organs. The number of transplants performed in the current year should fall within the same range.

 We do not collect information on the total number of appointments and treatments provided by the private health care providers. We do, however, have information on services provided for national health service patients. Since November 2000 the Independent Healthcare Association (IHA) has collected monthly data from independent health care providers (which includes both private and voluntary sector providers) about the number of NHS patients treated by them. According to data made available to the Department by the IHA, between November 2000 and January 2002 (the latest month for which figures are available) at least 25,000 day cases, 34,500 out-patient appointments and 28,500 in-patient treatments were carried out in the independent sector for NHS patients.
