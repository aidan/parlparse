<P>
<P>
<a name="90622w01.htm_wqn0"><B> Mr. Fabian Hamilton: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what steps he is taking to negotiate a share of the EU population coverage under the urban strand of Objective 2 of the EU Structural Funds for the United Kingdom which reflects the degree of urbanisation in the United Kingdom.  [87786]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90622w01.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Wills: </B> 
 A maximum of 18 per cent. of the European Union's population will be covered by the new Objective 2. The suggested breakdown by strand for Objective 2 of 10 per cent. to industrial areas, 5 per cent. to rural, 2 per cent. to urban and 1 per cent. to fisheries is purely indicative across the EU.
<P>

<a name="90622w01.htm_para0">The UK's overall population coverage under Objective 2 is defined by the safety net which limits the reduction in coverage to one-third of the existing Objective 2 and 5b population.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90622w01.htm_wqn1"><B> Mr. Fabian Hamilton: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what steps he is taking to ensure that areas designated in the United Kingdom under the urban strand of Objective 2 of the Structural Funds will be densely populated areas made up of contiguous units with a minimum population of 100,000.  [87787]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90622w01.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Wills: </B> 
 The public consultation on the determining UK areas for Objective 2 eligibility ended on 25 May. The Government are carefully considering all the submissions received and the eligibility criteria suggested.
<P>

<a name="90622w01.htm_para1">Before the UK propose their Objective 2 areas to the Commission, the Government will define, through discussions with the Commission, the geographical unit to be used to express urban areas within the UK.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90622w01.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Wills: </B> 
 The Government announced plans to set up the Small Business Service in the Budget statement. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry reinforced this in his Post-Budget statement to the House on 10 March 1999, <i>Official Report,</i> columns 367-79.

<a name="90622w01.htm_para2">We will be publishing a consultation document in the near future on the specific role and functions of the Small Business Service. I will be pleased to hear the views of all interested parties.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90622w01.htm_wqn3"><B> Mr. Peter Ainsworth: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what assessment he has made of the effect of the national minimum wage on riding schools and equestrian centres; and if he will make a statement.  [87810]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90622w01.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Ian McCartney: </B> 
 I have made no such assessment. We have asked the Low Pay Commission to evaluate the impact of the national minimum wage, with particular reference to the effect on pay, employment and training. They will soon be gathering evidence and will no doubt invite this sector, along with many others, to provide information.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90622w01.htm_wqn4"><B> Mr. Peter Ainsworth: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if he will exempt riding schools from the national minimum wage.  [87811]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90622w01.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Ian McCartney: </B> 
 No. Under the provisions of the National Minimum Wage Act, individual sectors of employment cannot be excluded from coverage.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90622w01.htm_wqn5"><B> Mr. Baker: </B> 
To ask the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire, representing the House of Commons Commission, if the Commission will introduce workplace car park charging within the Parliamentary Estate.  [87611]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90622w01.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. Kirkwood: </B> 
 The Commission has no plans at present to introduce charges for parking in the parliamentary estate. But the Greater London Authority Bill contains provisions which would allow the authority or the London borough of Westminster to introduce a levy on parking in the Palace of Westminster. The Commission will consider the position if and when either authority makes proposals for the introduction of a levy.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90622w01.htm_wqn6"><B> Mr. Baker: </B> 
To ask the hon. Member for Middlesbrough, representing the Church Commissioners, what his policy is in respect of the use of church land to grow trial genetically modified crops.  [87608]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90622w01.htm_spnew6"><B> Mr. Stuart Bell: </B> 
 The issue of whether Government trials of genetically modified crops should take place on land owned by the Commissioners is being initially considered by the Church's Ethical Investment Working Group (EIWG), which develops a co-ordinated ethical investment policy for the Church. The EIWG is made up of representatives of each of the central Church investing bodies and the General Synod's Board for Social Responsibility.

<P>
<a name="90622w01.htm_wqn7"><B> Mr. Dismore: </B> 
To ask the Attorney-General if he will make a statement on the case of Maria Bamieh and the Crown Prosecution Service.  [87808]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90622w01.htm_spmin0"><B>The Attorney-General:</B> 
 The decision of the Employment Tribunal in the case brought by Maria Bamieh against the Crown Prosecution Service is long and detailed and needs to be studied carefully. The Crown Prosecution Service takes the decision very seriously and is giving it urgent consideration.

<a name="90622w01.htm_sbhd6"><H4><center>Hayes v. Attorney-General</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="90622w01.htm_wqn8"><B> Mr. Dismore: </B> 
To ask the Attorney-General what were the terms of settlement of the case of Hayes <i>v.</i> Attorney- General; and if he will make a statement.  [87807]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90622w01.htm_spmin1"><B>The Attorney-General:</B> 
 The proceedings brought by Ms Hayes were of historical interest only. I had put in hand a review of the system of appointing barristers to act for the Crown, with the intention that it should be made more open and transparent, before Ms Hayes commenced her proceedings. I have followed this wholly new system for making appointment, since July 1998. Settling the case has brought the matter to a close and has saved further expenditure of public money on a lengthy hearing.
<P>

<a name="90622w01.htm_para3">The terms of my agreement with Ms Hayes were as follows:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>Appointments Procedure</i></FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>1. The Attorney-General confirms that he will maintain the principles of transparency and open competition followed since July 1998 in appointments to the Panels of Treasury Counsel, including First Junior Counsel to the Treasury, namely:</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) that vacancies are advertised;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(b) that applications and written references are considered by a selection board who make recommendations to the Attorney-General on the basis of those applications and references only;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(c) that the Attorney-General does not appoint any candidate who has not been recommended to him by the selection board;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(d) that the Attorney-General does not seek opinions from persons other than the selection board and the candidate's referees.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>Jurisdiction</i></FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>2. In the event of any future dispute, the Attorney-General will accept the jurisdiction:</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) of an employment tribunal in the case of appointments as First Junior Treasury Counsel (Common Law) and First Junior Counsel to the Treasury (Chancery);</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(b) of a county court in the case of appointments of other counsel.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>The Applicant's Case</i></FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>3. The Attorney-General does not accept that the Applicant or any other prospective appointee has, in fact, been subjected to discrimination. Nevertheless, he readily accepts that it was unsatisfactory that, until he changed the appointments system in 1998, although several women barristers had been appointed to the Supplementary Panels and as standing counsel to other departments, only one had been appointed to the main Chancery and Common Law panels of Treasury Counsel. Informal consultation may have a tendency to result in the recommendation of people known personally to the consultees and the purpose of the new system set up by the Attorney-General is to end such consultation. He recognises 



<P>
</UL></FONT><P><I>22 Jun 1999 : Column: 318</I><P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>that the system of appointments which was previously in place may have contributed to the under-representation of women on the main panels. In recognition of this, he has agreed to make a donation of &#163;5,000 to the Fawcett Society.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>4. On the above basis, the parties agree that the Applicant will:</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) withdraw her county court claim;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(b) withdraw her application to the employment tribunal</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>in each case with no order as to costs.</FONT></UL>


<a name="90622w01.htm_sbhd7"><H4><center>Crown Prosecution Service</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="90622w01.htm_wqn9"><B> Ms Moran: </B> 
To ask the Attorney-General what measures he proposes to ensure that the Crown Prosecution Service communicates with families affected by their decisions in child abuse cases.  [87456]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90622w01.htm_spmin2"><B>The Attorney-General:</B> 
 Currently, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) provides to the police information about prosecution decisions for them to forward to victims, or their families, as appropriate. How much information can be given may depend on the circumstances of individual cases. The CPS must balance openness with victims with the interests of others in the case. In particular cases senior CPS lawyers will be available to meet with victims and their families to explain in general terms reasons for CPS casework decisions.
<P>

<a name="90622w01.htm_para4">I am aware that a particular case of child abuse in the hon. Member's constituency has prompted this question and that the local Chief Crown Prosecutor will be meeting the victim's family to explain the decision to discontinue proceedings.
<P>

<a name="90622w01.htm_para5">As to the generality of cases in the future, the CPS is presently considering whether or not to take from the police the responsibility for informing victims of the reasons for CPS prosecution decisions. This stems from one of the recommendations of Sir Iain Glidewell's report into the Crown Prosecution Service on which I intend to make a statement shortly.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90622w02.htm_wqn0"><B> Miss Widdecombe: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will make a statement regarding the safety of medical appliances in respect of the transmission of CJD.  [86030]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90622w02.htm_spnew0"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 Measures are in place to minimise the risk of Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease of any type in known and suspect sufferers being passed on to other patients via surgical instruments. These are set out in the joint guidance of the Advisory Committee on Dangerous Pathogens and the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee published in April 1998 entitled "Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathies: safe working and the prevention of infection". This guidance says that no instruments used on a known or suspect patient, whatever the procedure, should be re-used. In addition, for patients regarded as potentially at risk of CJD (for example recipients of human pituitary derived growth hormones), instruments used in procedure involving brain, spinal cord or eye cannot be re-used. This is kept under constant review and new findings are assessed as a matter of priority.




<P>
<P><I>22 Jun 1999 : Column: 319</I><P>

<P>

<a name="90622w02.htm_para0">We have commissioned research into ways of detecting proteins on surfaces and improving decontamination and inactivation techniques. Meanwhile, current procedures give a high degree of protection and people should not be deterred from undergoing surgery where this is clinically necessary. The benefit to the patient must be weighed against any theoretical risk from CJD.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90622w02.htm_wqn1"><B> Sir Nicholas Lyell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will set out the rest requirements for an on-call rota for junior hospital doctors, pursuant to the Health Service Circular 1998/240; and if he will list those health authorities and hospitals in which the requirements of that circular are being observed.  [86708]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90622w02.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 Doctors employed on an on-call rota are contracted to work a maximum average of 72 hours per week, 40 standard hours and up to 32 additional duty hours, with the expectation that they should not actually work more than 16 of the additional duty hours.
<P>

<a name="90622w02.htm_para1">Health Service Circular 1998/240, issued on 23 December 1998, provided further national guidance to trusts on rest requirements. Doctors should spend at least one half of the out-of-hours duty period at rest between 5pm and 9am Monday to Friday or 9am to 9am Saturday and Sunday. Within these periods there should be a minimum continuous 5-hour rest period between the hours of 10pm and 8am.
<P>

<a name="90622w02.htm_para2">We have not collected specific data on compliance solely within the terms of HSC 1998/240. However, trusts who comply fully with the New Deal are entitled to apply for accreditation. As at 31 March 1999, out of a total of 343 trusts in England, 67 trusts have been granted accreditation, and 77 are under consideration for accreditation.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90622w02.htm_wqn2"><B> Mr. Webb: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health what assessment he has made of the implications of the costs of (i) participation in the inquiry into paediatric cardiac care in Bristol and (ii) any consequent compensation for the resources available to the United Bristol Healthcare Trust and the Avon Health Authority.  [86358]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90622w02.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Dobson: </B> 
 The costs of participating in the Bristol inquiry, like unforeseen costs which affect other large trusts, fall to be borne by the United Bristol Healthcare Trust. The majority of likely implementation costs will, however, be borne by funds set aside nationally to meet such settlements and are likely to be spread over some years.

 We have pledged to tackle unacceptable levels of geographical variations in access to IVF treatment and have set in motion a programme of work to achieve that aim. A Departmental survey of current health authority infertility service provision is taking place at the moment to enable the cost implications of any policy changes to be estimated. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists aim to complete their third, and final, set of evidence-based clinical guidelines on infertility this autumn and these will indicate the circumstances in which infertility treatment can be most clinically effective. We can then move towards fairer access to National Health Service infertility services, where those most able to benefit from such treatment receive it.

 We have published the report of the Quinquennial Review of the Medicines Control Agency (MCA). Copies have been placed in the Library. The Review confirms that the MCA is a world leader in its field, with an international reputation for professional excellence. It has performed well against its targets, and has secured more work under the European licensing system than any other national authority. The Review also shows that the MCA has used Executive Agency status well, and recommends that it should retain that status. We accept that recommendation.

 The prime duty of Lords Lieutenant is to be The Queen's representatives in their county or area. Other than in four Scottish cities (where the Lord Provost is Lord Lieutenant by virtue of his/her office) Lords Lieutenant are appointed under the Royal Prerogative by The Queen on the recommendation of the Prime Minister of the day. In Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland the consultations that precede an appointment are carried out by the relevant territorial Department. In England, consultations are carried out by the Prime Minister's Secretary for Appointments. Those appointed as Lords Lieutenant are people of standing in their local communities, most frequently on account of their record of voluntary activity for the good of the community. Lords Lieutenant may serve until they are 75 years of age.

The contractor can provide transcripts to anyone else only once they have received approval in writing from the court. In this case the transcript runs to about 70 pages and would cost approximately &#163;350.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what assessment he has made of the implications of the case of Hayes <i>v</i>. Attorney-General for the secret soundings system in the appointment of silk; and if he will make a statement. [87806]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90622w03.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Vaz: </B> 
 There is no 'secret soundings' system for the appointment of silks, and the Hayes case has no implications for the silk system.
<P>

<a name="90622w03.htm_para0">The vacancy for Treasury Junior, for which Ms Hayes complained that she should have been considered, was not advertised. Applications for silk, however, are openly invited by published advertisement and all applicants are judged equally, on their merits alone, according to published criteria. The list of successful applicants is published, together with a complete statistical breakdown of applications and appointments. Unsuccessful applicants are invited to speak to a senior member of the Lord Chancellor's Department for feedback on their application; nearly 140 have already taken up this invitation this year. In addition, officials are always willing to discuss the principles, policies and procedures of the silk system.
<P>

<a name="90622w03.htm_para1">The information which, together with the application forms, informs the Lord Chancellor's decisions on silk is gathered through a comprehensive and detailed consultation system. The guide for consultees is publicly available; this explains the Lord Chancellor's policies and criteria, according to which consultees are asked to comment. A list of all those whom the Lord Chancellor consults is also published, and applicants may nominate additional consultees if they feel that the wider consultation community is not able to give the Lord Chancellor 



<P>
<P><I>22 Jun 1999 : Column: 323</I><P>
sufficient information about their suitability for silk. Almost all consultation is carried out in writing, to ensure that consultees focus on the published criteria. As an indication of the scale of this exercise, this year's silk round involved consultation with over 425 general consultees and correspondence with over 500 nominated consultees, who in total submitted over 4,600 comments to the Lord Chancellor.
<P>

<a name="90622w03.htm_para2">The silk system is not, therefore, secret. The comments are, of course, confidential, for reasons which Parliament accepted in the Home Affairs Select Committee Report on Judicial Appointments Procedures in 1996 and in the Data Protection Act 1998. Even given that, however, applicants will be invited to respond to any comment which alleges misconduct, even if this involves identifying the accuser (if the accuser is unwilling to stand by his accusation in this way, the Lord Chancellor will ignore the allegation). In addition, the substance of the comments will, while respecting their confidentiality, be freely discussed with unsuccessful applicants who ask for feedback on their application.

 Financial tensions in Brazil have eased significantly, following the IMF-led international financial support package agreed last year. The UK Government will continue to play an active role in monitoring Brazil's performance under its IMF programme. Continued adherence under the IMF programme, together with an appropriate contribution from private sector creditors, underpins the BIS co-ordinated credit line, to which the UK has also contributed.
<P>

<a name="90622w04.htm_para0">My right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer has consistently stressed the importance of preserving investment in the health, education and social programmes which are essential for growth and poverty reduction. He has pressed for the World Bank's work on good practices in social policy to be drawn upon by the World Bank and the IMF when designing adjustment programmes. In Brazil, the IMF and the World Bank and the INTER American Development Bank worked together closely to ensure that the impact of the adjustment programme on the poor and vulnerable was minimised. Both banks have undertaken a number of projects in Brazil with a social dimension. Economic recovery in Brazil should benefit all sections of society.

 MOD took legal action against Boeing Helicopters and Textron Lycoming who were both responsible for an engine overspeed during ground testing of a pre-production FADEC system at the Boeing facility in Wilmington, Delaware which resulted in damage to the MOD owned Chinook helicopter on which the FADEC had been fitted. Following the Wilmington incident, the FADEC software was redesigned before it was introduced on to the Chinook Mk2 and it was therefore of a very different standard from that installed on ZD576 which crashed on the Mull of Kintyre.

 The Government are committed to making sure that policies are inclusive and take full account of the needs and experience of all those affected by them including the assessment of the potential for differential impact on particular groups in society. In Scotland full use is made of consultation, research projects and disaggregated statistics to identify the impact of policy upon women. The Scottish Office Good Practice Guidance on consultation advises including the Women's National Commission in all consultations. In addition we have set up the Women in Scotland Consultative Forum whose members cover a wide spectrum of women's organisations and which regularly meets officials and Ministers.
<P>

<a name="90622w05.htm_para0">We have also developed a database now numbering over 600 organisations with a women's issues remit who are available for consultation.

<a name="90622w05.htm_para1">The Report, entitled "Further Education in Scotland 1998: Report by the Secretary of State for Scotland", details this Government's commitment to widening access to further education and providing lifelong learning opportunities for all.
<P>

<a name="90622w05.htm_para2">During 1998 that commitment was backed by a Comprehensive Spending Review settlement identifying an additional &#163;214 million for investment in further education over three years. We also set a new target for the expansion of FE provision. In three year's time the Government expects to see at least 40,000 more students embarking on courses in further education colleges, and from groups which to date have been under-represented among student numbers.

 The Department of Health Advisory Committee on the Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment (COT) has not yet had the opportunity to review the data used by the recent WHO consultation which recommended the Tolerable Daily Intake (TDI) for dioxins of 1-4 pg TEQ/kg bw/day. Therefore this TDI has not been adopted formally by the Government. The COT will undertake a review when a full report of the consultation is available. In the interim, current exposure data will be considered using both the current UK TDI (10 pg TEQ/kg bw/day) and the recently recommended WHO TDI.

 The Department of Health Advisory Committee on the Carcinogenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment (COC) reviewed the conclusion of the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) to classify 2,3,7,8-TCDD as a known human carcinogen in 1998. The COC concluded that there are insufficient epidemiological and toxicological data on TCDD to conclude a causal link with cancer in humans, but it would be prudent to consider TCDD as a 'probable weak human carcinogen'. A copy of the full COC statement is being deposited in the Library of the House.

<a name="90622w06.htm_spnew9"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 Two consents have been issued to Zeneca Ltd. to plant small scale trials of genetically modified poplar trees in the Bracknell area. Each application included a pre-planting environmental audit and risk assessment that were assessed by the Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment. The trees for both trials are derived from female clones and will not therefore produce pollen. The trees will be coppiced after four years to ensure that they remain in a juvenile phase and do not flower and the trials will be terminated prior to flowering after a further four years. In addition there is specific monitoring at both sites for precocious flowering each spring and any flower buds are removed to prevent pollination. A copy of the consent documents and the environmental risk assessment is available on the public register at the Department.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what the 



<P>
<P><I>22 Jun 1999 : Column: 338</I><P>
response was to the consultation paper, "A New Financial Framework for Local Authority Housing: Resource Accounting in the Housing Revenue Account"; and if he will make a statement.  [88061]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90622w07.htm_spnew5"><B> Ms Armstrong: </B> 
 Our proposals for reforming the Housing Revenue Account (HRA) were intended to make local authority housing management more efficient. Responses to the consultation generally welcomed the proposals to introduce resource accounting. I confirm that we intend to move to a new form of accounts with:
<P>

<a name="90622w07.htm_para0"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a cost of capital charge, linked to stock values, showing the resources tied up in local authority housing;
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="90622w07.htm_para1"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a major repairs (or depreciation) allowance, paid through the subsidy system, to meet the costs of keeping the stock in good condition; and
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="90622w07.htm_para2"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a requirement to prepare a business plan as the framework for managing the stock.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="90622w07.htm_para3">The proposal to remove rent rebates from the HRA, making it a pure landlord account, was also welcomed in principle. This will go ahead, subject to parliamentary approval of the necessary legislation. We will then have to redistribute surpluses to ensure that resources go to councils with the greatest need. We will be consulting on the detailed arrangements later in the year.
<P>

<a name="90622w07.htm_para4">Other areas on which we will be consulting further include: the method by which valuations are to be carried out, the calculation of the major repairs (or depreciation) allowance, business plans and the detailed form of accounts. In response to points made in consultation, we intend to make the new form of accounts simpler.
<P>

<a name="90622w07.htm_para5">On the question of the basis to be adopted for valuing housing stock for the cost of capital charge in the account, respondents overwhelmingly favoured existing use value as social housing, rather than open market value. I confirm that this will be the basis for valuation.
<P>

<a name="90622w07.htm_para6">Authorities expressed concern that the timetable for moving to the new system was too ambitious. So we are now giving them some extra time to prepare. Authorities will be required to keep the HRA in the new form (including business plans) from 2001-02. As long as they have completed the necessary preparatory work satisfactorily, including producing satisfactory business plans, they will be eligible for additional subsidy for the major repairs allowance from that year. Rent rebates will be removed from the HRA at the same time or, if the necessary legislation has not been passed by then, as soon as it is in place.
<P>

<a name="90622w07.htm_para7">Authorities were also concerned about the costs of the work needed to prepare for the changes, particularly valuations and the preparation of business plans. We will be making an extra &#163;15m available through the HRA subsidy system in 2000-01 and a further &#163;15m in 2001-02 to help with these costs, and will consult authorities on proposals for doing so later in the year.
<P>

<a name="90622w07.htm_para8">I am grateful to all those who responded to the consultation paper. I am placing a list of the respondents, excluding any who requested confidentiality, in the House Library together with a report providing an analysis of the responses. The list and specific responses are available in the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions Library, Ashdown House, 123 Victoria Street, London SW1E 6DE, telephone 0171 890 3039. We will shortly be writing to authorities setting out our response

and the next steps in more detail. I believe that, working with local government, we can move forward to a new financial framework for local authority housing which is more suitable for the modern, high-quality tenant-focused service which we want to see.

<P>

<a name="90622w07.htm_para9">In June last year the Government announced a tough new policy to stop prolonged failure in schools. Since September 1998, schools which fail an Ofsted inspection must be turned around by local education authorities within two years. If a school is not out of special measures within two years it must be given a fresh start or closed. There are too many schools which failed under the previous administration and are still failing over two years later. We have made it clear that this must not continue and of the 46 such schools on the list provided, 12 have published or had closure proposals approved (three of which will close and Fresh Start schools open), and a further nine have been removed from special measures during the Summer terms already. The rest are now making good progress and we expect virtually all of them to be removed from special measures either this term or next.
<P>

<a name="90622w07.htm_para10">The decisive action we have taken to tackle failure in our schools since May 1997 has cut the average turn-around time from 25 months to 18 months. We are moving from laying the foundations for improvement to delivering the benefits.

 <i>[holding answer 17 June 1999]:</i> Family-friendly policies can help to boost the economy by increasing the number of skilled people in the labour market, and increasing the numbers returning to education and training. These policies can enhance financial independence--especially for women--both immediately as they benefit from a higher standard of living, and after retirement as a result of building up a better pension entitlement. And these policies can help increase the sustainable level of employment, and improving productivity, leading to an increase in overall living standards.

<P>
<a name="90622w10.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 We are not conducting an investigation into police integrity. However, I was pleased to launch Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary's (HMIC) report on police integrity on 14 June. That report dealt with integrity in its widest sense, encompassing issues such as fairness, probity, behaviour and equal treatment. Its 11 recommendations, in areas such as training, recruitment, vetting, management and financial accounting, are relevant to all forces including Cleveland.
<P>

<a name="90622w10.htm_para2">The practical guidance offered by the HMIC report gives us a framework in which chief officers can tackle integrity problems and ensure corrupt and unacceptable practices are rooted out.

<a name="90622w10.htm_spnew6"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 Section 115 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 put beyond doubt the power of any person to disclose information, where necessary or expedient for any provision of the Act, to a chief officer of police, a police authority, local authorities, probation service or health authority. Such disclosure is, however, not a duty and must take account of the common law duty of confidence and statutory restrictions on disclosure, including date protection legislation.
<P>

<a name="90622w10.htm_para3">Last year, the Home Office and the Data Protection Registrar issued a joint statement on information sharing under the Act.

[87497]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90622w10.htm_spnew7"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 Multi-agency co-operation is essential for the proper assessment and management of the risk that sex offenders pose in the community, the working of area child protection committees and risk assessment panels and the setting up of written protocols for protecting the public. The composition of these bodies can be agreed locally and may include a wide range of organisations.
<P>

<a name="90622w10.htm_para4">Section 115 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 gives an explicit power to disclose information for the purposes of the Act, and we are currently working with the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO), the Association of Chief Officers of Probation (ACOP) and others to produce guidance on the disclosure of information about sex offenders who might pose a risk to children and others.
<P>

<a name="90622w10.htm_para5">Released sex offenders are supervised by the probation service within a national framework. Such offenders may also be monitored by the police. The Crime and Disorder Act empowers courts to impose an extended period of supervision and provides for a sex offender order where the present conduct of a released sex offender gives rise to concern.

It is not possible to give precise figures for only those participating in publicly funded drug treatment programmes. However, it is estimated that around two thirds of those reported as

<a name="90622w11.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 I announced last September that I had put in hand a comprehensive review of the interception regime and that a consultation document would be published in due course. The review is now complete and I am today publishing a consultation paper "Interception of Communications in the United Kingdom" in which our proposals are laid out in detail. A copy has been placed in the Library (copies are available in the Vote Office).
<P>

<a name="90622w11.htm_para2">The extraordinary pace of change in the communications industry, particularly in the last decade, has revolutionised communications and brought benefits to us all. This new technology, however, brings new opportunities for criminals and terrorists, which they have been quick to exploit. The law has not kept pace with these developments. We need to bring our interception law up to date to ensure the continued success of this essential investigative tool.
<P>

<a name="90622w11.htm_para3">There are also some areas in which we need to improve the protection offered to the individual. There is currently no basis in law, for example, for the interception of communications on private telephone networks. We intend to put such interception on a statutory footing for the first time. This will ensure that the privacy of those who use these networks is respected, and that they have a means of redress if their communications are intercepted unlawfully.
<P>

<a name="90622w11.htm_para4">The Government are committed to building a safe, just and tolerant society. In the field of interception, there is a difficult balance to be struck. I believe our proposals strike the right balance and will be grateful for views on any of the proposals in the consultation paper.

 We continue to be concerned at anti-semitic incidents in Russia. But it is the anti-semitic comments by Duma deputies Makashov and Ilyukhin last year which caused outrage in Russia and beyond. At our instigation the EU Presidency made representations to the Russian authorities on this subject in January and my right hon.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. BHC = Income quintiles calculated before adjusting for housing costs. AHC = Income quintiles calculated after adjusting for housing costs.<P>

2. Columns may not sum due to rounding.<P>

3. These figures are estimates for the latest year available, which was the financial year 1996-97. The data has been derived from the Department of Social Security's Households Below Average Income dataset, which in turn is based upon the Family Resources Survey for the same period.<P>

4. The income figures are based on household income, adjusted for household size and composition. This reflects the commonsense notion that a household of five adults will need a higher income than a person living alone in order to enjoy the same standard of living. The process of adjusting income in this way is known as equalisation and is needed in order to make sensible income comparisons between households. Each income quintile contains 20 per cent. of the population of Great Britain.<P>

5. The equivalence scales make allowance for factors such as household size and the age of any children but not for any extra costs that people with disabilities may have. Attendance Allowance and Disability Living Allowance, which are paid to help with the extra costs of disability are included as income in these estimates. Removing Attendance and Disability Living Allowance from income reduces the proportion of Incapacity Benefit recipients in the top half of the income distribution by about 5 or 6 percentage points. <P>
