 I am pleased to report that a settlement has now been reached in the dispute between the House&#039;s principal cleaning contractors, MITIE, and their employees. I understand that this involves an increase from 1 March in the basic hourly rate of pay to &#163;6.10. Employees will be entitled to 20 days paid holiday, plus the eight statutory holidays, and five days sick pay after a standard qualifying period. There will be a further rise in the basic rate in October 2006. The two parties have agreed to work together within the terms of the current contract to seek to identify further efficiency savings acceptable to the parliamentary authorities, with the aim of funding a further rise in the basic hourly rate to &#163;6.70 an hour in 2007.

the initial effects of the climate change levy&quot;, concluded that the levy is effective and should save over 3.5 million tonnes of carbon per annum by 2010. In particular, Cambridge Econometrics concluded that the announcement effect of CCL in Budget 1999 will, in combination with the price effect, have reduced energy demand in the commerce and public sector by 14.6 per cent. by 2010. Cambridge Econometrics attribute most of the emissions savings to the announcement effect. However, because these two effects interact in CE&#039;s model, it is not possible to apportion precise carbon savings to either effect in isolation.

 Data concerning the average time taken to complete a disclosure are not a performance target and are not routinely collated by the Criminal Records Bureau (CRB). However, the bureau has calculated that during 2005 it took on average 31.5 days to complete all enhanced disclosures; although this figure does include time out with the customer, where applications were returned for correction or clarification. In such circumstances the CRB cannot control when an application will be returned in a fit condition to be completed.

<p>
<a name="60208w24.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_12">The CRB operates to a set of published service standards (PSS), which are to process 93 per cent. of standard disclosure applications within two weeks and 90 per cent. of enhanced disclosure applications within four weeks. The proportion of standard checks completed within PSS was 99.4 per cent. and the proportion of enhanced checks completed within PSS was 85.5 per cent.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60208w24.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_13">For enhanced disclosures, CRB are expected to complete their part of the checking process in 90 per cent. of cases in 12 days before referring these applications to local police forces for them to complete their part of the checking process against local intelligence databases. The CRB has consistently exceeded its targets in processing disclosures up to the point at which they are referred to police forces. In December 2005, the latest period for which information is available, CRB processed 95.8 per cent. of valid enhanced applications to the police within six days of receipt. This has provided forces with considerably more time to complete their checks within the PSS.

However, a CRB-commissioned MORI customer research programme showed that in 2004, over 20,000 unsuitable people were prevented from gaining access to children or vulnerable adults, as a direct result of CRB checks. Many more unsuitable people were deterred from applying to work with children and the vulnerable as a direct result of a requirement for a CRB check.

 Taking a DNA sample (and fingerprints) from someone who has been arrested for a Recordable offence and detained in a police station is now part of the normal process within a police Custody Suite. It is no different to recording other forms of information such as photographs, witness statements etc.
</p>

<a name="60208w25.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_15">Early research has shown that sampling persons who have been arrested but not proceeded against has yielded a match with a crime scene in over 3,000 offences. These links may never have been made had the police not been given powers to take and retain samples on arrest. Retention of the DNA profile on the National DNA Database may prove to be vitally important in the event of that person committing a crime in the future.

 The Identity Cards Bill includes provisions in clause 11 to enable information to be required from public sector or other organisations to validate National Identity Register entries. The Bill also allows for information to be provided from the National Identity Register to public sector or other organisations under clause 14, with the individual&#039;s consent, and to public authorities under clause 17 for identity checks as a condition of the provision of public services and under clauses 19 to 23, without the individual&#039;s consent, for specified purposes such as the prevention or detection of crime. Apart from the provision of information with consent under clause 14, and unless named on the face of the Bill, the particular public authority will need the approval of Parliament via secondary legislation.

 There is a broad consensus arising from reviews of reputable scientific literature, consultations with anti-fraud and biometric experts as well as communication with other biometrics schemes. It indicates that supervision of the enrolment process and the implementation of anti-spoofing technologies can counter the &quot;spoofing&quot; of a biometric which in any case is very difficult to achieve. Furthermore, these consultations also indicate that the use of multiple biometrics, as envisaged in the Identity Card Scheme, will provide further protection.

Such issues will also be independently scrutinised in order for the Scheme to achieve official security accreditation.

The Identity Cards Programme has held individual meetings with over 90 commercial organisations during the course of consultations and market sounding on ID cards, and has engaged with many more organisations at conferences and other market events. These interactions have been carried out in accordance with procurement guidelines and best practice established by the Office for Government Commerce and most have been facilitated through working with Intellect, a UK based ICT trade association with over 1,000 members. Most of these organisations have commented in some way on security aspects of the scheme and several have commented on more specific operational and technology issues including security issues related to identification and verification. In particular, in October 2004 the programme ran a seminar specifically on verification issues and in December 2004 ran a seminar on security. Both of these seminars would have included representations on security issues related to verification. The seminars were hosted by Intellect. There were 35 commercial organisations represented at the verification event and 51 at the security event. A list of those represented is as follows:

The amount of packaging waste producers have to recover and recycle is determined, in part, by the amount of packaging they handle.

<p><a name="st_63"><a name="60208w30.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Bradshaw  </b> 
<i>[holding answer 31 January 2006]:</i> Information on waste management by the businesses has been collected through the Environment Agency&#039;s Commercial and Industrial Waste Survey, conducted in 2002&#150;03. This survey estimates that around 37 per cent. of waste from the commercial sector in England was recycled or re-used in 2002&#150;03. Data for other years in the period requested are not available.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what plans her Department has for increasing <i>(a)</i> recycling and <i>(b)</i> composting.  [46412]</p>




<p><a name="st_64"><a name="60208w30.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 Waste Strategy 2000 set out national recycling and composting targets for household waste, of 17 per cent. in 2003&#150;04, rising to 25 per cent. in 2005&#150;06, then 30 per cent. in 2010 and 33 per cent. in 2015. Each local authority was also set a statutory target for 2003&#150;04 and 2005&#150;06 and to assure that further progress is made, I recently consulted on options for further recycling/composting targets in 2007&#150;08. Analysis of the responses is under way and there will be a formal announcement once a decision is made. Provisional figures show more than a fifth (approaching 23 per cent.) of household waste in England was recycled, in 2004&#150;05. Furthermore, waste disposal authorities have been set challenging landfill diversion targets for biodegradable municipal waste which will drive authorities to ensure that the recycling of this waste is maximised.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60208w30.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_73">To support the attainment of these targets, Defra introduced the Household Waste Recycling Act in 2003 which provides that English waste collection authorities shall ensure, except in certain circumstances, that by the end of 2010 they collect at least two recyclable materials from doorsteps separate from the remainder of the waste. About two thirds of households in England now receive a kerbside collection of recyclable materials.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60208w30.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_74">In the Spending Review 2004 the Government announced an increase in the Environmental, Protective and Cultural Services block of &#163;888 million over 2004&#150;05, by 2007&#150;08 and over the three-year period to 2005&#150;06, authorities are also benefiting from a total of 294 million invested through Defra&#039;s Waste Minimisation and Recycling Fund. Its successor, Defra&#039;s Waste 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>8 Feb 2006 : Column 1291W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
Performance and Efficiency Grant, will run in parallel for the first year and provide a further &#163;260 million over the three years to 2007&#150;08.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60208w30.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_75">Since 2002, Local authorities have also been assisted by targeted support and advice available through the Waste and Resources Action Programme and Defra&#039;s Waste Implementation Programme&#151;which will continue to provide targeted assistance to authorities for a further two years and an announcement of its new programme will be made in December 2005.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60208w30.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_76">For the longer-term, as part of the review of waste strategy, Defra is looking at what levels and what forms of targets will be the most efficient at continuing the recent improvements we have seen in waste performance. The review will take into account existing policy levers designed to drive the management of waste up the hierarchy (such as the Landfill Allowance Trading Scheme, the landfill tax escalator, and the obligations on producers in relation to packaging and waste electrical and electronic equipment). The Government intend to publish a consultation document on the Waste Strategy review in the next few weeks, followed by a revised waste strategy in the autumn.

 The Gambling Act 2005 for the first time introduces new requirements on operators of all categories of gaming machines to ensure that gambling remains crime free, and that children and vulnerable people are protected. DCMS and the Gambling Commission are working with the industry and other interested parties to develop the relevant licence conditions and codes of practice that are needed to deliver these protections. The Gambling Commission and licensing authorities will be responsible for monitoring compliance with the new requirements once they are formally implemented in September 2007.

 Mobile phone base stations and handsets comply with national and international guidelines that were introduced to prevent thermal effects from exposure to radiofrequency (RF) electromagnetic fields (EMF). The guidelines have been based on extensive scientific reviews by the International Commission on Non-ionizing Radiation Protection, the World Health Organisation (WHO) and, in this country, the Health Protection Agency (HPA). This includes consideration of non-thermal effects in tissues and a variety of pulsed signals at the levels normally encountered from mobile phone technology in use today. Independent measurements near base stations (masts) have demonstrated that RF exposures are very much lower than the guidelines (www.ofcom.org.uk).

A description of the programme and the individual studies is available on its website at www.mthr.org.uk The studies in the MTHR programme concentrate largely on the exposures from the mobile phone handsets because these exposures are considerably higher than those from base stations.

<a name="stpa_145">Overspending and underspending by NHS bodies is carried into the following year, as part of the carry forward regime. This is operated by the Department at strategic health authority level (SHA), and SHAs have the authority to determine how the regime operates for organisations within their health economy. For this reason we do not know how much of the carry forward was applied to individual organisations, so it is not possible to distinguish between historical and recurring deficits for primary care trusts (PCTs) and SHAs. For the purposes of comparison, the turnover and financial position for all SHAs and PCTs for each of the last two years, 2003&#150;04 and 2004&#150;05 has been placed in the Library.

<p>
<a name="60208w39.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_146">All NHS Trusts and PCTs should break even every year. Where an organisation has a historic deficit, the SHA can provide financial support to the organisations to allow them more time to break even whilst the recovery plan is implemented. SHAs have the responsibility for ensuring the organisations across its area are in financial balance every year, so to provide planned support to one organisation requires other NHS organisations within the health economy to underspend over the same period. Any such arrangements would have to be subject to the agreement of local providers, commissioners and the managing SHA.

<a name="stpa_149">The latest available data, which is still being validated, is for 2004&#150;05.
