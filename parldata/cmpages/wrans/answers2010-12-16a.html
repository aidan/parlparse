<p><a name="stpa_343"><a name="101216w0001.htm_para12"><a name="10121651000259">Consequently, the Secretary of State concluded that a fresh approach to school sport is needed and has announced that he will not continue to provide ring-fenced funding for school sport partnerships. By removing all the unnecessary targets and reporting requirements placed on schools by the previous Government's strategy, schools will be freed up to provide more opportunities for competitive sport that are most appropriate for their own pupils. The best way to increase participation is to give schools the freedom and incentives to organise school sport themselves, rather than imposing a central Government blueprint.</p>

 The UK Border Agency will always first seek to achieve voluntary departure of illegal migrant families.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what the maximum length of time is that a claimant of jobseeker's allowance may attend a training course while retaining their benefit; and what assessment he has made of the appropriateness of this period. [28456]</p>

 Jobseeker's allowance is designed to support people while they are unemployed and looking for work. To be eligible, jobseekers must therefore be available for and actively seeking employment. Unless specific exemptions apply, they must be willing and able to take up full-time work immediately.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_382"><a name="101216w0001.htm_para51"><a name="10121651000522">Jobseekers can however undertake part-time education or training at any point in their claim and continue to receive jobseeker's allowance as long as they continue to meet the basic conditions of entitlement.</p>

While undertaking two weeks of work-related training within any 12 month period claimants can remain on jobseeker's allowance. This is agreed by the adviser and it can be combined with part-time learning to give a longer period of support.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_384"><a name="101216w0001.htm_para53"><a name="10121651000524">Within limits, jobseekers may also undertake full-time training for longer than two weeks where it is deemed appropriate in order to help towards a move into employment. Currently, jobseekers who undertake full-time training in excess of two weeks are transferred to a separate training allowance. Full-time training opportunities for jobseekers are ideally no more than eight weeks long as short, intensive periods of work-focused training better achieves the purpose of the jobseeker's allowance interventions regime of helping people find employment as quickly as possible. Those with basic skills needs (for example literacy and numeracy) may be able to remain on full-time training for 15 weeks or longer.</p>

<i> [holding answer 13 December 2010]:</i> Because of the poor sensitivity of the tuberculin skin test in South American camelids (llamas, alpacas, etc.), voluntary blood testing for TB can be offered to herd owners. This is currently at the Government's expense and subject to a veterinary risk assessment by Animal Health (AH). Although only optional for herd owners as it is not yet fully validated in camelids, blood testing is often recommended in order to maximise the chances of detecting all infected animals that may remain in these herds and thus speed up the resolution of the TB outbreak.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_401"><a name="101216w0001.htm_para70"><a name="10121651000628">The case veterinary officer will discuss the TB testing options and implications with the affected herd owner. Herd owners must then signify their intention to co-operate with the TB testing regime and release any animals testing positive by signing a standard letter of consent. If the owner agrees to supplement the skin test with blood testing, AH will take blood samples from all the potentially exposed animals remaining in the herd. This will normally take place 10 to 30 days after a skin test.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_402"><a name="101216w0001.htm_para71"><a name="10121651000629">Blood testing of camelids is currently undergoing full validation at Veterinary Laboratories Agency as part of a project largely funded by the British Alpaca Society and British Camelids Ltd. It is hoped that a suite of validated blood tests for camelids will be available by the end of 2011.</p>

It should be noted that 46% of businesses in the bottom quartile were classified as part-time, with insufficient agricultural enterprises to keep one person occupied on a full-time basis.

That is why we are calling for ambitious reform of the common agricultural policy in order to improve the industry's ability to respond to consumer demand, introducing the grocery code adjudicator to ensure that everyone in the food supply chain gets a fair deal, and have established a task force to conduct an industry-led review of existing farm regulations. Additionally we are providing funding to increase industry competiveness through the Rural Development Programme for England, funding scientific research into increasing food production sustainably, and working with industry to improve skills across the food chain.</p>

 The REACH Regulation makes no provision for the Government to provide direct financial assistance to businesses required to register chemicals. European state aid and competition rules also preclude provision of direct financial assistance. However, DEFRA and the UK REACH Competent Authority Helpdesk provide free information and advice about REACH implementation to UK businesses by e-mail, telephone, and on the internet. DEFRA and the Department for Business Innovation and Skills have also arranged periodic publication in HM Revenue and Custom's Employers' Bulletin of articles reminding businesses of registration duties and providing advice about best practice in preparations for registration.</p>

 Since May, DEFRA has received six written or electronic representations about the costs to business of REACH registration, all from small-medium enterprises (SMEs). These ranged from concerns about the direct financial costs to concerns about potential costs caused by interruption of supplies arising from failure by suppliers to register chemicals used, or by their not having included downstream uses in chemical registrations.</p>

While this has meant that authorities have not been able to intervene directly in addressing industry concerns about REACH registration, DEFRA and the UK REACH Competent Authority (provided by the Health and Safety Executive) have provided guidance and advice on best practice. In the case of downstream users' concerns about continuity of supply, my right hon. Friends, the Secretaries of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, and for Business, Innovation and Skills, wrote jointly in October to the relevant European Commissioners to draw attention to the issues and propose a course of action to address the concerns.</p>

<i> [holding answer 7 December 2010]:</i> Slaughterhouse operators are responsible for the welfare of animals at the time of slaughter. The rules governing animal welfare at slaughter and killing are set out in the Welfare of Animals (Slaughter or Killing) Regulations 1995, as amended (WASK). Under this regulation it is an offence to cause or permit an animal avoidable excitement, pain or suffering. There are also specific requirements that must be followed on handling, stunning, slaughter or killing of animals. In particular:</p>

 The antiviral drugs marketed as Tamiflu (oseltamivir) and Relenza (zanamivir) can be used in two broadly distinct disease settings. Firstly, in seasonal influenza, the kind of 'flu' that occurs annually over the winter months, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) have examined the effectiveness of both drugs and concluded that they both should be made available to treat at-risk patients with suspected influenza illness and when seasonal influenza virus is circulating.</p>

For this situation, the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Advisory Committee (SPI) reviewed the effectiveness of Tamiflu and Relenza in 2007 and concluded that both drugs could have a significant beneficial impact in reducing morbidity and thus mortality. SPI is currently re-examining the scientific evidence base for the use of antiviral drugs in pandemic influenza. The output from this review will be published in early 2011.</p>

Figures published in July 2010 showed that under this previous method, on any given night there were 440 rough sleepers in England. However, when the remaining 256 councils provided estimates of the scale of the problem in their areas, this added a further estimated 807 rough sleepers-taking the national total to 1,247 rough sleepers on any given night.</p>
