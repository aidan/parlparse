To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what plans he has for reviewing the legislation affecting common land and town and village greens.  [110027]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00210w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 I have today published a consultation paper on common land--"Greater Protection and Better Management of Common Land in England and Wales". The paper looks at three key areas: issues concerning the registration of common land and village greens; the consent regime for fencing and other works; and wider management issues. Copies have been placed in the Library of the House. I have invited comments on the paper by 10 April.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what will be the cost of the new building for the Greater London Authority; and if the rent will be at the market rate for similar buildings.  [110064]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00210w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 We have reached agreement with the developer, CIT Group, on a rent of &#163;36.50 per square foot, &#163;393 per square metre. This is frozen until 2007. The fixed rent at practical completion of the contract will be &#163;4.75 million per annum. There are no similar buildings in the area; however, the &#163;36.50 compares favourably with current rents, for top quality space in prime locations, of typically around &#163;50 per square foot in the City and the West End of London. The developer will meet the cost of the base building which is estimated at around &#163;40 million.

<P>
<a name="00210w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Matthew Taylor: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what studies his Department has <i>(a)</i> undertaken and <i>(b)</i> commissioned which quantify the cost to the economy of traffic congestion.  [108329]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00210w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 My Department has not commissioned estimates of the costs of congestion from external sources. A number of external estimates have been made of the value road users might place on the elimination of congestion from the road network. The CBI have put this figure at &#163;15 billion. Some estimates are lower, but agree that the figure runs into billions every year and is rising.
<P>

<a name="00210w01.html_para0">The Department has made estimates of the amount of time lost on English roads as a result of congestion in 1996 and produced forecasts for 2010 under a number of illustrative scenarios. The results of this work are set out 



<P>
<P><I>10 Feb 2000 : Column: 230W</I><P>
in our report "Tackling Congestion and Pollution", published last month. We will be doing more work in this area as part of our follow up to that report.
<P>

<a name="00210w01.html_para1">Neither the external estimates, nor those undertaken by my Department, can be translated directly into assessments of the cost of congestion to the economy. This is because they relate only to the benefits road users might derive from reduced delays and take no account of the costs of achieving these reductions. The true costs of road congestion to the economy are the net benefits we forgo if we fail to tackle it.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00210w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Mitchell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions who determines the areas in respect of which bids can be made by water supply companies based outside the area served by an existing company; and, in the event of a successful bid, which company retains <i>(a)</i> ownership of water pipes and <i>(b)</i> responsibility for their maintenance.  [108741]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00210w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 A company can be appointed as a water undertaker or sewerage undertaker by the Director General of Water Services under the Water Industry Act 1991. There is no restriction on the areas in respect of which appointments may be sought within England and Wales. A water company may seek to become the supplier for any area within that of another company by means of an 'inset' appointment: where that company consents to the appointment; where the appointment is in respect of parts of that area where none of the premises is served by that company; or where it is in respect of an area occupied by premises, each of which is supplied with, or likely to be supplied with, not less than 250 megalitres of water in any year. Ownership of water pipes and responsibility for their maintenance rests with the company holding the appointment for the area in question.
<P>

<a name="00210w01.html_para2">The Competition Act 1998 comes into effect on 1 March, providing potential opportunities for greater competition. The Office of Fair Trading and Office of Water Services have issued guidance on the application of the 1998 Act to the water and sewerage sectors. If shared use of a water undertaker's network is agreed, ownership and responsibility for maintenance would remain with the undertaker, but with arrangements for sharing the costs between the two companies.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what plans he has to encourage industrial users of <i>(a)</i> kerosene and <i>(b)</i> gas oil to switch to cleaner fuels.  [108712]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00210w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 Under the Marketing of Gas Oil regulations 1994, the sulphur content of gas oil marketed in the UK is limited to 0.2 per cent. The Sulphur Content of Certain Liquid Fuels Directive (1999/32/EC), due to be transposed into member states legislation on 1 July 2000, will prohibit the use of gas oil with a sulphur content higher than 0.2 per cent. from 1 July 2000 and 0.1 per cent. from 1 January 2008.
<P>

<a name="00210w01.html_para3">The combustion of kerosene and gas oil in industrial processes above 20 Megawatts thermal input is regulated under the Environmental Protection Act 1990. Over the past decade the Environment Agency has encouraged 



<P>
<P><I>10 Feb 2000 : Column: 231W</I><P>
operators of the processes they regulate under the Act to switch to less polluting fuels, initially from heavy fuel oil to gas oil, and then (over the last few years) to gas. For example, most gas turbines now use gas as their main fuel with gas oil or kerosene only as a backup in case of an interruption to the gas supply. The Environment Agency will continue to encourage these changes to cleaner fuels.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what plans he has to fund further tram or light railway systems; and if he will make a statement.  [108725]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00210w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 Central Government support is available to local authorities to fund light rapid transit systems in the form of grant under section 56 of the Transport Act 1968. Revenue support is provided through the local government finance system to meet the cost of borrowing undertaken by authorities to finance capital expenditure on major transport schemes and for eligible expenditure on local authority Private Finance Initiative projects.
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what research his Department has undertaken into the benefits of tram/light railway systems <i>(a)</i> in the UK and <i>(b)</i> in other European Union countries; and if he will make a statement.  [108726]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00210w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 My Department has contributed to studies on the impact of Manchester Metrolink, South Yorkshire Supertram and Croydon Tramlink. Reports on Manchester Metrolink and South Yorkshire Supertram have now been completed. The Department has also funded a report into light rail and complementary measures, which covers European systems. This was published in May 1998. A follow-up study is being undertaken. Copies of the completed reports have been placed in the Library.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what data he collects from local authorities on the proportions of invoices paid by them within the agreed contract time. [109049]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00210w01.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 Under the provisions of the Local Government Act 1999, authorities will be required to report annually their performance against specified national performance indicators. An indicator is included in respect of the percentage of undisputed invoices paid within 30 days, or mutually agreed terms. The Secretary of State has set targets for such payment of invoices of 95 per cent. for 2000-01, 97.5 per cent. for 2001-02 and 100 per cent. for 2002-03.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what resources are available to his Department to make one-off payments to cover overhanging debt following the transfer of local authority housing stock in <i>(a)</i> 1999-2000, <i>(b)</i> 2000-01 and <i>(c)</i> 2001-02.

<P>
<a name="00210w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 There are proposals within the Spring Supplementary Estimates to allow for &#163;25 million to assist with the repayment of overhanging debt in the current financial year. The sum required in future years will depend on Ministers' decisions in response to applications for a place on the housing transfer programme from local authorities with overhanging debt. The Government's contribution to extinguishing overhanging debt will be by taking on an agreed amount of a local authority's outstanding debt principal, rather than through the use of programme resources.

[109023]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00210w02.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 We have no plans to review planning policy on affordable housing. Draft PPG3: "Housing" reaffirms existing policy that local planning authorities may require an element of affordable housing to be provided in suitable residential developments where a local need exists.

 <i>[holding answer 8 February 2000]:</i> National Air Traffic Services (NATS) and the Ministry of Defence (MOD) already enjoy a good working relationship and provide a joint and integrated air traffic control service. These working arrangements are being formalised in order to facilitate the public private partnership for NATS. Copies of the heads of terms of what will be the contract between the MOD and NATS have been made available to members of the Standing Committee considering the Transport Bill. I have sent a copy of this document to my hon. Friend today.

 The Department has received a range of representations on planning guidance and procedures for telecommunications over the last three years. We issued proposals to improve the arrangements in "Telecommunications Development Control" published in July 1998. This attracted 269 responses. Changes were implemented, by way of amendments to the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995, in July 1999 and explained in Circular 4/99. We also issued for consultation in December 1998 the draft of a joint DETR/DH circular on "Land Use Planning and Electromagnetic Fields". This received 147 responses. The circular will be finalised as soon as practicable after the Independent Expert Group on Mobile Phones has reported in the spring.

The Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions has asked me to respond to your question about what road noise reduction surfaces his Department has recently approved for use. In the absence of the Chief Executive I am responding to the question.
<BR>
In addition to porous asphalt and exposed aggregate concrete which are included in the specification for trunk road construction, to date the Highways Agency has approved, for use on trunk roads in England, fifteen proprietary surfacing products which have been shown to generate significantly lower noise levels than conventional surfaces. Six of these products were approved in the past year. They are already being widely used for surfacing roads that need maintenance.
<BR>
For the future, a new scheme for approving a range of innovative products has been set up with other highway authorities under which the British Board of Agreement will certify that products meet the specified performance requirements.

 The farm scale evaluation programme is now starting its second year. The studies are designed to evaluate the impact on farmland wildlife of the management of herbicide tolerant GM crops, with their associated herbicide, as compared with equivalent non-GM crops managed conventionally. The ecological studies are being funded by the UK Government and carried out by independent contractors on fields of GM and conventional crops provided by the industry body SCIMAC. The studies are being overseen by an independent Scientific Steering Committee reporting to the Secretary of State.
<P>

<a name="00210w03.html_para1">The first year of the farm scale evaluations included plantings of oil seed rape and fodder maize in the spring, followed in the autumn by winter oil seed rape. The Scientific Steering Committee reported at the end of the first year that the methodology of the farm scale evaluations was scientifically robust, and gave a firm base from which to proceed to full-scale trials this year. A further announcement about this year's sites will be made shortly.
<P>

<a name="00210w03.html_para2">In November 1999, a renewed agreement between Government and the industry body SCIMAC on the conduct of the farm scale evaluations was reached, to cover the three years through to harvest of crops planted in 2002, including agreement that no general unrestricted cultivation of GM crops will take place in the UK until the farm-scale evaluations are complete. Under the renewed agreement, the farm scale evaluations are likely to be extended in scope this year to cover a further crop, GM beet, dependent on the advice of the Scientific Steering Committee on the scope and validity under UK conditions of similar trials being carried out in Denmark.
<P>

<a name="00210w03.html_para3">The fields grown for this year's trials will also be used to monitor the gene flow between the GM and non-GM crops to determine the depth of cross pollination.

<P>

 <i>[holding answer 7 February 2000]:</i> The actual financial costs of winding up the New Millennium Experience Company would depend on the commitments and liabilities outstanding at the time when any such decision were taken. Neither the Government, nor the Millennium Commission, nor the Board of NMEC have plans to wind up the New Millennium Experience Company prior to the completion of its remit to run the Millennium Experience to 31 December 2000.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00210w03.html_spnew4"><B> Janet Anderson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 24 January 2000]:</i> The Millennium Commission has not made any loans to the New Millennium Experience Company (NMEC) or any other organisation. The Commission cannot make loans as it has no statutory powers to do so.




<P>
<P><I>10 Feb 2000 : Column: 237W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="00210w03.html_para4">All grant made to NMEC is repayable if any surplus is achieved from its operations or asset disposals after the organisation has met its other contractual liabilities. However, this grant does not constitute a loan as there is no guarantee of repayment or certainty of the amount which might be repaid to the Commission. It is open to the Commission to impose, as a condition of grant, the terms on which it will be repaid.

<a name="00210w03.html_spnew6"><B> Janet Anderson: </B> 
 The New Millennium Experience Company's target is 12 million. Visitor numbers in the first month, at just over 366,400 represent just under 4 per cent. of the target. This mirrors the visitor attraction industry norm for January.

 The "Big Time" event on New Year's Eve in central London incorporated a wide range of activities and entertainment throughout the day attended and watched, safely, by about 3 million people. The River of Fire was one part of a spectacular firework display which itself was one part of Big Time. The 17 minute display was enjoyed by people along the Thames embankment and from other vantage points, as well as by a world-wide television audience. No public or lottery funds were involved in paying for the pyrotechnics. The New Millennium Experience Company, who were asked by the Government, the Millennium Commission and other public agencies and organisations involved in the event to co-ordinate and manage it, have, in the absence of major commercial sponsorship for the London-wide event to complement Millennium Commission's grant under their Millennium Festival programme, underwritten these costs.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department, pursuant to his answer of 31 January 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 472W, on computers, if any of the hackers accessed computer files containing <i>(a)</i> the personal details of jurors or witnesses and <i>(b)</i> details of the jury selection procedures.  [109388]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00210w03.html_spnew9"><B> Jane Kennedy: </B> 
 There has only been one recorded instance, in 1995, when a member of staff was found to have possible unauthorised access to juror details. The person, a casual employee, had discovered a supervisor's password and had altered system access permissions. Subsequent investigation found no evidence of tampering with data. The staff member was dismissed.

<a name="00210w03.html_wqn10"><B> Mr. Burstow: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department, pursuant to his answer of 31 January 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 472W, on computers, what action has been taken to prevent internal hacking incidents on Court Service computers, particularly files containing <i>(a)</i> the personal details of jurors or witnesses and <i>(b)</i> details of the jury selection procedures.  [109387]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00210w03.html_spnew10"><B> Jane Kennedy: </B> 
 The Court Service carries out security risk analyses on all its major computer systems to ensure they comply with the security guidelines laid down in HMG's Manual of Protective Security. The countermeasures implemented include unique user names, secure passwords and access to systems and areas of systems on a 'need-to-know' basis. Passwords are changed regularly. All staff are provided with guidance on how to maintain system security. Some juror details are held on systems which are owned and managed by the Department's PFI partners. Security measures have been conveyed to them and are contractual.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department, pursuant to his answer of 31 January 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 472W, on computers, what type of information was accessed by the hackers from computers in the Court Service; and what action was taken <i>(a)</i> to identify the hackers and <i>(b)</i> to discipline Court Service staff involved in the incidents. [109389]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00210w03.html_spnew11"><B> Jane Kennedy: </B> 
 The type of information potentially available to an internal 'hacker' varies according to the system accessed. Approximately half of the incidents involved stand-alone PCs or networked PCs used in the Headquarters of the Lord Chancellor's Department for administrative purposes; the remainder involved operational systems, such as those used for case management. Most incidents involved misuse of another member of staff's user name and password. The information potentially at risk was either a person's own work in progress, or in a few instances, details of cases. All incidents were investigated and remedial action applied. No evidence of compromise of Protectively Marked (or classified) information nor of a breach of the Data Protection Acts was found.
<P>

<a name="00210w03.html_para5">The staff responsible were identified in half of the incidents and all received verbal warnings, except for one who received a written warning and one who was dismissed.

 <i>[holding answer 8 February 2000]:</i> Estimates of the United Kingdom's remaining recoverable reserves of gas are given in the Department of Trade and Industry's "Development of the Oil and Gas Resources of the United Kingdom 1999", a copy of which is in the Library of the House. This shows that discovered reserves could yield 1,795 billion cubic metres (bcm). This is equivalent to 18 years of production at current rates. If the full potential from as yet undrilled structures were to 



<P>
<P><I>10 Feb 2000 : Column: 243W</I><P>
be realised, this could raise discovered reserves to 3,625 bcm. Estimates of reserves are, however, not constant over time and exploration may add to these estimates.
<P>

<a name="00210w05.html_para0">Whether production from these reserves will fully meet UK demand for any future period depends on a number of variables such as the timing of commencement and cessation of production in particular fields. As the Government indicated in their Energy White Paper in October 1998 (Cm 4071), it is likely that some gas imports would be required by the end of this decade.

 Local authorities have an independent statutory responsibility to enforce weights and measures legislation. As with the earlier stages of metrication, DTI has encouraged the local authorities to provide small traders with information and advice about the change to metric weights for the sale of loose goods, and to recognise the difficulties that some small traders have had in changing to metric weights by 31 December 1999.

 There is a wide range of Community and bilateral programmes which support the EU/Ukraine Partnership and Co-operation Agreement. The main Community programme is TACIS, from which over 600 million euro was committed between 1991-98. The TACIS 2000 budget for Ukraine has not yet been decided. Since 1991, Ukraine has also benefited from EU grants towards the closure of Chernobyl (210 million euro), EU macro-financial loans (565 million euro) and humanitarian aid (12 million euro). In addition EU member states have provided bilaterally some 2.5 billion euro in loans and grants between 1991 and 1997. The European Commission's proposals for TACIS spending appear in its Country Strategy Papers, which are not made public. Reports of TACIS expenditure are, however, published annually. An independent evaluation of TACIS in Ukraine was published in 1998.

 It is an offence under section 1 of the Prevention of Crime Act 1953 for any person to have with them an offensive weapon in a public place, including private premises to which the public have access. In addition the Criminal Justice Act 1988 banned the manufacture, sale and importation of 14 bladed, pointed and other offensive weapons in addition to flick knives and gravity knives, the sale of which was already banned under the Restriction of Offensive Weapons Act 1959.

The offences of gross indecency with a child, unlawful sexual intercourse with a girl under 13, and unlawful sexual intercourse with a girl under 16 are the only sexual offences recorded which explicitly involve children as victims. Offences of violence against the person which explicitly involve children as victims include cruelty to and neglect of children, abandoning a child under two years, and child abduction. There are many other violent and sexual offences which could involve children as victims. Cruelty to and neglect of children has been a recorded crime since 1 April 1998.

Domestic Violence

<a name="00210w07.html_wqn7"><B> Dr. Kumar: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many cases were reported to the police alleging domestic violence in (a) Cleveland, (b) Northern Region and (c) the United Kingdom in each of the last three years; and how many in each category resulted in a conviction.  [109461]<P>

 "Domestic violence" is not a specific offence, but a means of describing a number of offences when committed in particular circumstances. This means that the available information is derived not from the usual recorded crime statistics but from specific returns

submitted by police forces in England and Wales to Her Majesty's Inspector of Constabulary. The figures are set out in the table.

<a name="00210w07.html_para9">The definition of domestic violence used for these returns was:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Any form of physical, sexual or emotional abuse which takes place within the context of a close relationship. In most cases, the relationship will be between partners, married, co-habiting or otherwise; or ex-partners".
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="00210w07.html_para10">Unfortunately, this definition was interpreted in differing ways by different police forces, for instance because some forces included child abuse. This prevented proper statistical comparisons or a clear understanding of what the returns indicated. From 1 April 1999, the definition of domestic violence for the purpose of statistical returns to Her Majesty's Inspector of Constabulary has been:

<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The term 'domestic violence' shall be understood to mean any violence between current or former partners in an intimate relationship, wherever and whenever the violence occurs. The violence may include physical, sexual, emotional or financial abuse".

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, pursuant to his answer to the right hon. Member for Maidstone and The Weald (Miss Widdecombe) of 2 February 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 596W, how many curfewees charged with an offence while on home detention curfew were charged with an offence similar in character to that for which they were serving a sentence of imprisonment prior to being released on the curfew.  [109509]<P>

<P>
<a name="00210w08.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 According to Prison Service records, of the 174 curfewees referred to in the answer I gave to the right hon. Member for Maidstone and The Weald (Miss Widdecombe) on 2 February, who have been charged with a further offence while subject to Home Detention Curfew, 69 have been charged with an offence similar to that for which they were serving a sentence of imprisonment prior to being released on curfew. In one case it has not been possible, in the time available, to confirm whether the further offence is similar in nature to the original offence. I will write to the hon. Member when this information is available.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what assessment he has made of the advantages and disadvantages of extending the requirement for a certificate of compatibility with the Human Rights Act 1998 to private legislation.  [107914]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00210w08.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The Human Rights Act 1998 applies equally to Public and Private Bills, once they are enacted. Under the Human Rights Act 1998, Acts of Parliament will have to be interpreted compatibly with the Convention rights if possible. Where this is not possible, a higher court will be able to issue a declaration of incompatibility. This applies to all primary legislation as defined by the Human Rights Act, which includes private Acts, 1998.

<P>
<a name="00210w08.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 Information is available on the new racially aggravated offences which were introduced under the Crime and Disorder Act in October 1998. The latest information indicates that 10,982 offences were recorded by all police forces in England and Wales for the period 1 April 1999-30 September 1999, 218 in Thames Valley and 7,473 in the Metropolitan police.
<P>

<a name="00210w08.html_para0">Additional information is also available on the number of racist incidents that were recorded by the police which is wider in definition than crimes. Information covering 1993-94 to 1998-99 was published in December 1999 in Statistics on Race and the Criminal Justice System, a copy of which is in the Library. Owing to the broader definition of such offences than those covered by the recorded crime statistics it would be misleading to compare the two figures. It is currently not possible to say what proportion of such offences resulted in successful prosecutions.

<P>
<a name="00210w08.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The Government stand firmly by their ban on the testing of tobacco products which was announced in November 1997. There will be no approval for any such tests. Two recently approved applications are for programmes that do not test the effects of tobacco smoke, but enable the development of treatments for chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases such as bronchitis and emphysema, which seriously debilitate many people. These health problems derive mainly from smoking, 



<P>
<P><I>10 Feb 2000 : Column: 257W</I><P>
including passive smoking, as well as occupationally related lung diseases, such as those caused by the inhalation of coal dust. Tobacco smoke is the only test material to model reliably the effects that will enable a better understanding of the disease processes and improved medical treatments. The licensed research programmes are to investigate medical treatments, not the safety approval of tobacco products.
<P>

<a name="00210w08.html_para1">The Inspectorate and the Animal Procedures Committee have advised that the licences are justifiable and that the benefits to man and animals would outweigh the costs to the animals involved. As with all project licence applications, these two licences were issued only after a full and careful assessment, including whether there were alternatives which replace animal use, reduce the number of animals needed or refine the experimental design to minimise suffering.
<P>

<a name="00210w08.html_para2">Strict conditions were made in authorising these two programmes of research. The maximum number and species of animal that may be used per year are 1,100 mice and 1,100 guinea-pigs in one; and 2,000 mice, 1,000 rats and 1,000 guinea-pigs, in the other. Tobacco smoke is to be administered by placing the animals in inhalation chambers for set periods. They are not expected to suffer convulsive spasms. the severity bands for both project licenses are classed as moderate. To date, no animals have died as a result of the research.
<P>

<a name="00210w08.html_para3">Table 5a of the Statistics of Scientific Procedures on Living Animals shows the number of animals used in non-toxicology procedures each year. Figures for the use of tobacco as a pharmacological tool or standard are not separated out, but there were no instances where tobacco smoke was administered to conscious animals in 1996, 1997 and 1998. No licenses were issued for the administration of tobacco smoke to conscious animals and no animals were used for tobacco research in any of these three years.
<P>

<a name="00210w08.html_para4">Table 10a of the annual statistics gives details of the number of animals used in toxicology (safety) testing. In submitting the data for this table, licensees are instructed to include tests on tobacco alternatives with data for protocols that have used tobacco in any form. Again, the tables show that no animals were used for the safety testing of tobacco of tobacco substitutes during 1996, 1997 and 1998.
<P>

<a name="00210w08.html_para5">Evaluating research proposals involving the use of animals is difficult and requires a delicate moral balance to be struck. Scientific developments have saved many human lives and cured many illnesses and have contributed to the health of animals and the protection of the environment. Much knowledge has come from experiments on animals. To have failed to allow that work may have resulted in many humans dying and suffering where instead they have been cured or helped. The Government want to prevent unnecessary experiments involving animals but it would be immoral, in our view, to deny victims of diseases like bronchitis and emphysema the assistance that new scientific knowledge could bring from work such as projects PPL 70/04972 and PPL 70/04956.

 The epidemiologists' definition of an epidemic is an increase in the frequency of occurrence of a disease in a population above its baseline level for a specified period of time. The term epidemic can be used when describing the pattern of either infectious or chronic diseases in the population.
<P>

<a name="00210w09.html_para2">Administrative definitions can be set for diseases in which an arbitrary threshold is selected above which the term "epidemic" is applied. In the case of influenza, the Department introduced in 1996 an administrative

definition of an "epidemic" for a rate of consultation (with a sample of general practices) of 400 per 100,000 population in a week.
<P>

<a name="00210w09.html_para3">Such influenza activity in England is thus monitored through the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) sentinel surveillance scheme.

<P>

<a name="00210w09.html_para5">The severity of the disease itself can also vary from year to year. This year the elderly have been particularly affected by the complications of influenza. The level of cases of acute bronchitis, a serious complication of influenza, is the highest the RCGP surveillance system has seen for 15 years. In describing epidemics some other countries formally include measures of severity in the definition of an epidemic.

 BCG vaccine is currently being made available at the request of clinicians who have determined, on the basis of clinical need and in accordance with existing recommendations, that an individual is at higher risk from tuberculosis and that immunisation with BCG vaccine is necessary. The Department is advised on BCG vaccination policy by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation. The recommendations are contained in the Health Departments' handbook, "Immunisation against Infectious Disease". Those at higher risk of tuberculosis include health service staff who may have contact with infectious patients or their specimens; veterinary and other staff who handle animal species known to be susceptible to tuberculosis; staff of prisons, old people's homes, refugee hostels and hostels for the homeless; contacts of cases known to be suffering from active pulmonary tuberculosis; and, immigrants from countries with a high prevalence of tuberculosis and their children and infants wherever born.

The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question if he will pay compensation to Mrs. J. Duffy of Kingsbridge, following the outcome of her appeal against the Benefits Agency on 6 October, 1999 and the reinstatement of her benefit.

Mrs. Duffy's case has been carefully considered and an award of &#163;50.00 consolatory special payment has been made for gross inconvenience. Mrs. Duffy has been invited to submit evidence to allow consideration of further ex-gratia payments for her out of pocket expenses.
<BR>
Compensation by way of interest on delayed arrears of Disability Living Allowance is not payable in Mrs. Duffy's case as she has not been deprived of benefit as a result of clear and unambiguous official error or exceptional delay. Guidelines for which are laid down in the Department's "Financial Redress for Maladministration" manual.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. Estimates are derived from the Family Resources Survey for 1997-98, and relate to Great Britain. All estimates are subject to sampling error.<P>

2. Single pensioners are defined as single (non-cohabiting) people over State pension age (65 for men, 60 for women); pensioner couples are defined as couples (married or cohabiting) where the man is over State pension age.<P>

3. All estimates are expressed in July 1996 prices and are rounded to the nearest &#163; per week, although they are not necessarily accurate to that degree.<P>

4. The distribution of income has been calculated separately under the before housing costs and after housing costs measures of income. The distribution of income is also calculated separately for each group, i.e. estimates for pensioner couples show the median income for the bottom quintile of the pensioner couples' income distribution.<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security what steps he is taking to ensure that local authorities collect accurate and verifiable information to meet the reporting requirements of the housing benefit best value performance indicators numbers 176-180 for 2000-01.  [109191]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00210w11.html_spnew0"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 Best value performance indicators will from this April be the main yardstick against which local authorities' performance is judged. Authorities are required to set out each year in published best value performance plans details of past performance against the indicators and challenging targets for future improved performance. These plans and the performance information they contain are subject to statutory audit.
<P>

<a name="00210w11.html_para0">Auditors are responsible for ensuring that authorities have adequate systems in place for producing accurate performance data. In addition, the Department has made arrangements for performance data to be reported periodically by authorities as part of the normal provision of housing benefit management information.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00210w11.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Bayley: </B> 
 The mobility component of Disability Living Allowance is payable at two rates. The higher rate is payable to people who are unable or virtually unable to walk and the lower rate is paid to people who need guidance and supervision out of doors on unfamiliar routes.
<P>

<a name="00210w11.html_para2">Currently both components are payable to children from the age of five years. From April 2001, we are extending the higher rate of the mobility component to severely disabled children aged three and four years old in recognition of the fact that many children are able to walk reasonable distances unaided by the age of three years.
<P>

<a name="00210w11.html_para3">Estimating the cost of extending either component to children aged two and under would not produce a meaningful result. This is because all children of this age have limited walking ability and will require constant guidance and supervision whilst out of doors.

<a name="00210w11.html_para22">The Royal Mail has advised that as at the end of January the 248 local authorities in the following list have implemented in full the Royal Mail "do not redirect" service. Of the remaining 161 authorities, a number are preparing to implement the service and some are operating their own local arrangements. It would be inaccurate to describe such authorities as not operating "non-redirection" of post. However, information on which authorities fall into these categories could be collected only at disproportionate cost.

 <i>[holding answer 7 February 2000]:</i> I did not discuss this issue with Dr. Kharrazi during his recent visit, but the subject was covered by my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary. Co-operation between the United Kingdom and Iran to stem the flow of drugs from Afghanistan forms an important part of the developing UK/Iran relationship. We have provided

<P>
<P>
<a name="00210w12.html_spmin2"><B>The Prime Minister:</B> 
 We are moving to automated credit transfer from 2003 as a modern, more secure and efficient method of paying benefits. As I made clear in my reply of 2 February, I expect that by then the Post Office will have developed more agency arrangements with banks to provide banking services--it already has arrangements with Alliance and Leicester, Lloyds TSB and the Co-operative Bank. This will enable benefit recipients to withdraw the full amount of their entitlement in cash at the Post Office if they want.
<P>

<a name="00210w12.html_para0">In addition, the Post Office is planning to install 3,000 cash machines in local Post Offices.

<a name="00210w12.html_spmin3"><B>The Prime Minister:</B> 
 The table shows the numbers of appeals and petitions for leave to appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council from independent Commonwealth countries in each of the last five years. No direct contribution to the costs of running the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council is made by the countries concerned as such, save that certain countries, especially New Zealand, provide (at their own expense) serving judges to sit as members of the Judicial Committee from time to time. However, court fees are payable by the parties to proceedings, which in some cases are the governments or other public authorities of the countries concerned. The table also shows the total fee income of the Judicial Committee in each of the last five years, the greater part of which will have been paid in respect of petitions and appeals from independent Commonwealth countries.

 My Department's competitive tendering processes are overseen by officials.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what is the average time taken for the Government Actuaries Department to complete the headroom check where a pensions mis-selling case involves excess contributions; and if he will make a statement.  [109220]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00210w13.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Andrew Smith </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 8 February 2000]:</i> The information requested cannot be obtained without disproportionate cost. The Government Actuary's Department (GAD) has no general responsibility for work on compensating victims of pensions mis-selling, but it does provide actuarial services to a number of public service pension schemes whose members were mis-sold personal pensions in the past. In most of the main public service pension schemes the number of cases involving excess contributions is relatively small, and the normal procedures for carrying out headroom checks have been applied without causing delay. In the Teachers' Pension Scheme there has been a large number of such cases and new procedures are being implemented to allow the scheme administrators (Capita Teachers' Pensions) to carry out most of the calculations using tables supplied by GAD. This should allow speedier processing.

 The Government will introduce a new Children's Tax Credit from April 2001.

 The childcare tax credit is available to families in receipt of the Working Families' Tax Credit or Disabled Persons's Tax Credit who meet the work requirements and have eligible child care costs. There are no plans to make it available to families where no-one is in work.
<P>

<a name="00210w13.html_para2">If a separate weekly credit of &#163;70 were to be given to all families with a child under one, subject to a taper of 55 per cent. for net income over &#163;90 per week, the estimated cost for 2000-01 would be about &#163;800 million. If households with a mother in receipt of statutory maternity pay are not included, the cost would reduce by about &#163;30 million for the first 18 weeks of maternity pay and by about &#163;10 million for the first six weeks of maternity pay.

The Director of the Office for National Statistics (ONS) has been asked to reply to your parliamentary question asking for the number of children aged 15 years or under who live in a) the Birkenhead constituency and b) Merseyside constituencies in total. I am replying in Dr Holt's absence.
<BR>
Mid-year population estimates are not compiled for areas such as parliamentary constituencies. The lowest level at which these are available is the local authority level. Each local authority in Merseyside Metropolitan County is made up of at least two parliamentary constituencies. Data is therefore unavailable for the parliamentary constituencies within the county, one of which is Birkenhead. The table provided shows the numbers of children aged 15 years or under resident in each local authority in Merseyside as well as Merseyside as a whole. Also shown is how the local authorities are made up of parliamentary constituencies. These estimates are the mid-1998 population estimates which are the most recent available.

The Director of the Office for National Statistics (ONS) has been asked to reply to your parliamentary questions on the percentage of births outside marriage by ethnic minority. I am replying in Dr. Holt's absence.
<BR>
The current form of birth registration does not include ethnicity. Figures on live births by country of birth of mother are available in Birth Statistics 1998, FM1 which is available in the House of Commons Library. However, it should be noted that birthplace does not necessarily indicate ethnic origin or race. More information on these statistics can be found in an article in Population Trends 52, 1988.

 Subject to Parliamentary approval of the necessary Supplementary Estimate for Class XIV, Vote 1 (The Welsh Office, the Wales Office and payments to the National Assembly for Wales) the Welsh Departmental Expenditure Limit for 1999-2000 will be increased by &#163;8,285,000 from &#163;7,217,489,000 to &#163;7,225,774,000. The increase is a result of net transfers to other Government Departments of &#163;74,000 and additional funding of &#163;7,939,000 and &#163;420,000 for Health and Agriculture respectively.

<a name="00210w14.html_para4">Transfers are from Class 1 Vote 1 (&#163;200,000), Class 2 Vote 1 (&#163;11,000), Class 3 Vote 2 (&#163;113,000), Class 3 Vote 3 (&#163;150,000), Class 18 Vote 1 (&#163;300,000) and to Class 2 Vote 1 (&#163;177,000), Class 10 Vote 2 (&#163;260,000) and Class 4 Vote 1 (&#163;411,000). The balance will be met by a charge on the Departmental Expenditure Limit Reserve for the increases announced in the Pre-Budget Report and the Aid Package for farmers and will not therefore add to the planned total of public expenditure.

industry. The points they are making are well understood, but this is not an easy issue. The cost would be considerable and it would have to conform with strict EU rules. Communications with the European Commission have shown how difficult this would be. This is an issue which Ministers have looked at very closely and will continue to do so. As the Prime Minister said on 1 February any investment by Government must be linked to long-term change in the structure of the industry. It must also be part of an agrees overall strategy; to this end, my officials are in touch with the National Pig Association and others.

 The Meat Industry Red Tape Working Group recommended in its report published on 13 December 1999 that the current meat inspection rules be replaced by a risk-based system of checks applying Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points (HACCP) principles. We have accepted this recommendation, but a new meat inspection system to replace existing controls will entail changes to EU legislation. We strongly support the Commission's initiatives to review and modernise meat hygiene controls and will be pressing for early progress.

 Following consultation with industry and enforcement authorities we published revised guidance on origin labelling on 1 February making it clear that origin labels on food must be clear and unambiguous. This is an important step forward in our drive for better labelling and more informed choice. We will encourage the European Commission to take similar steps at EU level and raise the issue for wider international discussion at the forthcoming meeting of the Codex Committee for Food Labelling in Ottawa in May.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00210w15.html_spnew9"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 8 February 2000]:</i> To date we have granted four experimental approvals under the Plant Protection Products Regulations 1995 (as amended) for the use of glufosinate ammonium on genetically modified crops.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00210w15.html_spnew10"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 The only foods available in the UK which have been produced from GM crops containing antibiotic marker genes are highly processed products in which all the genetic material, including antibiotic marker genes, has been rendered inactive through extensive degradation. The two marker genes, in either a complete or disrupted form, that have been used in these crops are kanamycin and ampicillin resistance genes. The intact genes convey resistance to aminoglycoside antibiotics including kanamycin, neomycin and geneticin; and narrow spectrum . lactam antibiotics such as ampicillin and amoxycillin respectively.
