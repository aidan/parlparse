from either incapacity benefit or severe disablement allowance. In

Plaskitt:</b> New claims to severe disablement allowance were
stopped on 6 April 2001. From that date new customers need to apply for
incapacity benefit or income support on grounds of incapacity. At that
time youth rules were introduced to incapacity benefit, whereby those
incapable of work before the age of 20 (25 years old in certain
circumstances) are eligible for the benefit without needing to meet the
national insurance contribution
condition.</p><p><a name="06103065000077">Existing
severe disablement allowance customers, apart from those aged under 20

benefit. Instead payment of severe disablement allowance continues as

satisfied.</p><p><a name="06103065000078">Entitlement
to severe disablement allowance does not passport its recipients to
other benefits, such as housing benefit, in the way that income support
and income related jobseeker's allowance do. Many customers on severe
disablement allowance may also qualify for income support and so be
passported to other benefits in that way. People on severe disablement
allowance with a low income, but not also receiving income support
would need to be considered for housing benefit on low-income
grounds.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="61030w0001.htm_wqn2"><a name="06103065000007">Benefits (Earnings

(including notional income from savings) that someone could have and
still qualify for pension
credit.</p><p><a name="06103065000994">People over
the age of 65 who are severely disabled and have personal care or
supervision needs can claim attendance allowance. It is
non-contributory, tax free and is not affected by income or
savings.</p><p><a name="06103065000995">We want to
make sure pensioners claim all the benefits to which they are entitled
and know that some pensioners need support in doing so. The Pension
Service Local Service, local authorities and sometimes the voluntary
sector are joining forces nationally so that older people will receive
a full and joined up service that can deal with a variety of issues and
queries. Many older people dislike having to go through claim processes
over and over again with different organisations and these joint teams
can help reduce this by providing a single access point to social care
and benefit entitlements such as pension credit, housing benefit and
attendance

to link sexual and reproductive health and HIV and AIDS services. For
example a South African NGO, LoveLife, provided youth friendly services
for sexual and reproductive health and HIV in combination with a
multi-media information campaign aimed at young people. Changes in HIV
prevalence and sexual behaviour were tracked through the National Youth
Survey. The survey results demonstrated that participation in the

increased the odds of young men and women using
condoms.</p><p><a name="06103073000054">The DFID

evidence, on the main priorities for developing links between sexual

caused by the conflict with Israel; an economic downturn due to
restrictions on movement and access and the Palestinian

influenced by our conclusions on the Stonehenge scheme. In considering
the timetable for these scheme we will also take account of the
south-west region's advice that, within the regional funding allocation
for major transport schemes in the south-west, a start should be made
on either the A303 Stonehenge scheme or on the A303 Ilminster bypass
improvement and improvements to the A358 to Taunton within the next 10
years, and that other A303 schemes are for the longer term, beyond

crossings in the form of tunnels and adapted farm crossings and
underpasses. Appropriate fencing may be included to both prevent
animals crossing the carriageway and direct the animals to a safe
crossing facility. They also undertake specific enhancement measures,
such as the provision of bat boxes as part of commitments set out in

part 5 of the General Permitted Development Order (GPDO), in

of part 5 permitted development rights being exercised by statutory

rights in part 17 of schedule 2 of the GPDO, though there is nothing to
prevent a statutory undertaker from enjoying the benefit of any of the
other permitted development rights in the GPDO that might apply to
their land in a particular case. Were there to be a dispute about
whether permitted development rights applied in a particular case, it
might be resolved either by an application made to the local planning
authority for a certificate of lawfulness to confirm the existence of
such rights in respect of a particular development proposal, or by
enforcement action taken by the local planning
authority.</p><p><a name="06103081000202"><b><a name="61030w0008.htm_spnew582"><a name="06103081000287">Helen

Bradshaw:</b> The Environment Agency (EA) is required, in
accordance with HM Treasury's guidance and the &#147;polluter pays
principle&#148;, to recover the full costs of regulation from those
it regulates. The EA have worked with the farming sector to develop a
straightforward, least-cost approach for farmers. It is for the EA, as
the regulator, to assess the level of effort required to meet the
pollution prevention and control requirements. In parallel, my
Department continues to encourage the EA to demonstrate full
transparency on what costs are for. The EA is also being set targets to
drive efficiency throughout the organisation and gains will in turn
offset charges as
appropriate.</p><p><a name="0610311000411">In
response to concerns raised by the industry, the EA presented a
proposal on subsistence charging in February this year. The EA's
proposals were accepted by the British Poultry Council, as well as
other intensive livestock trade associations in May. A subsistence
charge of &#163;1,471 for an existing small farm and &#163;1,844
for an existing large farm will therefore be charged to the industry
from August 2007 until March 2008, provided that the industry stage its
applications over the three month application window (from 1
November 2006 to 31 January
2007).</p><p><a name="0610311000412">The annual
subsistence fee not only covers the EA's costs for inspections, but

Food Standards Agency (FSA) to improve our understanding of how
Campylobacter infection develops and spreads. We have also considered
effective methods for controlling the spread of this bacteria at all
levels of the food chain, including controls on farm and best practice
guidance in the
kitchen.</p><p><a name="0610311000415">For the period
2005-08, DEFRA has committed &#163;2.65 million towards research on
the control of Campylobacter and the development of intervention
practices to reduce the incidence of the bacteria within poultry
production systems. This includes a DEFRA/FSA joint-funded three year
survey, starting in 2007, to determine the prevalence of Campylobacter
in UK flocks of chicken for meat
production.</p><p><a name="0610311000416">A report
published by the Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of
Food in July 2005 concluded that the control of Campylobacter is a
practical proposition in housed flocks where producers maintain
rigorous biosecurity measures and high flock management standards. As a
result, priority action at farm level has focused on the importance of
meeting good biosecurity standards. This action reinforces wider food
hygiene initiatives in the commercial and domestic food handling
settings.</p><p><a name="0610311000417">These
research and education projects will help to support the FSA and the
poultry industry in meeting their target to achieve a 50 per cent.

Fitzpatrick:</b> The Employment Equality (Age) Regulations
2006 introduce a default retirement age of 65 together with procedures
whereby the employee has a right to request that he or she be allowed
to continue in work beyond the employer's normal retirement age. The
employer has a duty to consider this request, and if both the employer
and employee agree then the employee can continue in work. This will
move towards a culture where a retirement decision is influenced by the
individual circumstances and preferences of employers and employees,
rather than an assumption about the norm. These arrangements were
introduced in order to deliver the Government's labour market
objectives recognising the need for workforce planning and avoiding
adverse impact on the provision of occupational pensions and other
work-related
benefits.</p><p><a name="0610319000295">In March this
year we published the Survey of Employers' Policies, Practices, and
Preferences Relating to Age that will provide the baseline for
assessing the impact of the Employment Equality (Age) Regulations 2006.
Once the legislation has bedded in, we intend to carry out a follow-up
survey, to inform the review of the default retirement age in 2011. We
will also explore, with the Office for National Statistics and the
Department for Work and Pensions, the process for collating better
statistical data on employee retirement intentions and
behaviour.</p><p><a name="0610319000296">The default
retirement age has been developed as a result of extensive
consultation. We have been interested in how other countries have
approached age discrimination and seeing what lessons we could draw on.

circumstances.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="61030w0016.htm_wqn0"><a name="0610319000026">Retraining

Harrier GR7/9 fleet were introduced in 2005. This has improved aircraft
availability by an average of two aircraft per day. The airworthiness
of the aircraft is also considered to have benefited from equalised
maintenance packages but this aspect has yet to be quantified. The
total technical support and man hour requirement of the new scheduled
maintenance cycle is similar to the previous arrangements, albeit
delivered more effectively; accordingly, there have been no measurable
cost savings to date.</p><p><a name="0610319000436">Equalised
maintenance packages are currently being introduced for the RAF's
Nimrod MR2/R1 fleet. At this stage it is too early to measure
accurately the full benefits of this change, but it is forecast that
the new scheduled maintenance regime will deliver significant
improvements in aircraft availability, and financial savings of
approximately &#163;2 million per annum from financial year 2008-09.
Before implementing this change a full safety assessment was carried
out on the Nimrod MR2/R1 fleet and further safety assessments will be
undertaken as the transition to equalised maintenance moves
forward.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="61030w0017.htm_wqn3"><a name="0610319000042">Animal

Save programme now reflects full cost recovery in its bidding rounds;
the Department of Health&#146;s third sector commissioning taskforce
report emphasises the importance of reflecting the full cost of
