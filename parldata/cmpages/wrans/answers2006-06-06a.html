to all tables:</i><br>1.
The groupings Bottom 10 per cent., Top 10 per cent., Bottom 20 per
cent. and Top 20 per cent. of the Before Housing Costs and After
Housing Costs income distributions are consistent with DWP's National
Statistics' series, Households Below Average Income (HBAI). It is
presented in this manner to be consistent with HBAI. The Bottom 10 per
cent. relates to individuals in households with the lowest 10 per cent.
of equivalised household income.  2. Real income growth is
represented by the percentage change in decile or quintile income
medians that have been adjusted for inflation. Year on year growth
estimates are volatile.  3. Comparisons for the bottom decile
should be treated with particular caution. Decile medians for the
bottom 10 per cent. are more volatile as they are affected to a greater
extent by fluctuations in households reporting very low
incomes.  4. The Family Expenditure Survey (FES) data covers
selected years from 1979 until 1995-97 where information is available.
The Family Resources Survey (FRS) data is for all financial years
1994-95 until 2004-05.  5. Comparisons of estimates between
the two sources should be treated carefully: FES figures are for the
United Kingdom, FRS figures are for Great Britain;<br>
The reference period for FRS figures is
single financial years. FES figures are single calendar years in 1979,
1981 and 1987, two combined calendar years from 1988-89 to1992-93 and
two financial years combined from 1993-95 to
1995-97;<br>The FRS was
established by the then Department of Social Security in order to meet
the Department's analytical demands; A review, available on the
internet, into the differences in income values between the two surveys
concluded that the differences in monetary value estimates across
surveys were too large to justify publishing direct comparisons.
Furthermore, large fluctuations in the difference between surveys for
overlapping years mean that a spliced time series may be no more
accurate than the unadjusted series. 6. Page 5 of the Child Poverty
Progress Report showed growth by quintiles AHC and much higher growth
for Q1 than Q5. This is borne out in this PQ. However, BHC progress was
only slightly better for the bottom quintile than the top
quintile.  <i> Source:</i>  The Family Resources

less than perfect. They also take account of the effects of sampling

eligible for the Savings Credit, with or without the Guarantee

2004-05, with incomes and benefits projected forward into the future in
order to estimate the eligibility for each pensioner household on the
