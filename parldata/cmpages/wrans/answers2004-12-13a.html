<br>&nbsp;<br><i>13 Dec 2004 : Column 811W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="41213w05.html_para8">
<a name="stpa_59">Defra has improved its organisational and administrative processes to help deliver sustainable development in three main ways:

<a name="stpa_62">Energy efficiency is an integral element of the UK&#039;s strong domestic programme to address climate change. The 2003 Energy White Paper identified energy efficiency as the most cost-effective way to deliver all four of our energy policy goals. Energy Efficiency: The Government&#039;s Plan for Action was published in April 2004, setting out a clear framework for improving energy efficiency at an unprecedented level.

The plan stands as an up-to-date compilation of the Government&#039;s delivery plans to make a step change in the rate of improvement in energy efficiency.

Progress since 1997 has been encouraging; for example, the 2002 reporting round revealed positive trends for more than a third of the UK BAP species and nearly 60 per cent. of the habitats. This year&#039;s figures for wild bird populations show some encouraging signs that our policies for biodiversity are resulting in positive outcomes for birds, but there is no room for complacency and more remains to be done.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41213w05.html_para17">
<a name="stpa_67">In 2002 the Government published &quot;Working with the grain of nature: a Biodiversity Strategy for England&quot; which sets out a programme of activity to ensure the integration of biodiversity into policymaking and practice. The strategy sets out five key policy areas where integration needs to be achieved: agriculture, water, woodland, marine/coastal management and urban. It also includes four areas where cross-cutting improvement is needed: driving local and regional action; the economics and funding of biodiversity; the engagement of business and promoting education and public understanding.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41213w05.html_para18">
<a name="stpa_68">We have put in place other measures including our extensive network of protected sites and the development of agri-environment schemes. We have also set challenging PSA targets to bring into favourable condition by 2010 95 per cent. of all nationally important wildlife sites; and to reverse the long-term decline in the number of farmland birds by 2020. The UK BAP is about to embark on its 2005 reporting round which we hope will provide more evidence to show that our work on policy integration is resulting in further biodiversity gains.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41213w05.html_para23">
<a name="stpa_73">In March 2000 the Government launched the Action Plan for Farming, which was developed in partnership with industry to support industry restructuring and adaptation in response to very low income levels. In August 2001, the Government set up the Policy Commission on the Future of Farming and Food to advise the Government on how to create a sustainable, competitive and diverse farming and food sector. The Policy Commission produced its report in December 2001, containing 105 recommendations around the theme of reconnecting farmers with the market and aligning their activities with the needs of society and with the market.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41213w05.html_para24">
<a name="stpa_74">The Government incorporated the vast majority of the Policy Commission&#039;s recommendations in its Strategy for Sustainable Farming and Food&#151;Facing the Future in England, which was launched on 12 December 2002. The strategy outlines how industry, Government and consumers can work together to secure a sustainable future for our farming and food industries, as viable industries contributing to a better environment and healthy and prosperous communities. An independent Implementation Group, chaired by Sir Don Curry, has been established to oversee delivery of the strategy.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41213w05.html_para25">
<a name="stpa_75">The strategy sets out the basis for a new relationship between Government and the farming industry in England. At its heart is a drive to make farmers more market, and less subsidy, focused while managing their businesses in more environmentally and socially responsible ways. The Government pay &#163;1.8 billion in direct support to agriculture each year through the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). Last June&#039;s CAP reform deal, which has allowed member states to decouple CAP subsidies from production, is crucial to delivering the strategy.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41213w05.html_para26">
<a name="stpa_76">The England Rural Development Programme provides a framework for the operation of 10 separate but integrated schemes which provide new opportunities to protect and improve the countryside, to develop sustainable enterprises and to help rural communities to thrive.

To encourage this, wood is one of the priority materials under the Government-funded Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) which was established to create materials for recycled materials. By 2006 WRAP is aiming to deliver an additional 150,000 tonnes recycling capacity for waste wood, with the majority going into added-value end markets.

 I am gravely concerned about the situation in Darfur, Sudan and keep a close watch on developments. The World Food Programme&#039;s (WFP) decision to suspend operations in north Darfur was in response to attacks on Talwilah town on 22 November. This prompted the UN Security Co-ordinator (UNSECOORD) to stop all UN movement out of the state capital and suspend all UN operations in SLA areas. The tension has eased in some areas allowing food distributions to re-start on 28 November. However, some parts of north Darfur are still designated as &quot;NO GO&quot; for UN personnel. The humanitarian community has tracked an estimated 30,000 people who fled the 22 November attacks and is in the process of registering and providing food and other assistance to them. Insecurity in north Darfur continues to affect the UN and its agencies ability to access all parts of Darfur.

 My Department&#039;s Five Year Strategy for Children and Learners published in July 2004 sets out an ambitious agenda for reform and makes clear that delivery of the Strategy will require a major reform of the Department, one involving a radical transformation of its role and ways of working, changes that will lead to a smaller, more strategic Department.

 The Race Relations Act 1976 (as amended) protects all individuals from direct and indirect discrimination and victimisation on racial grounds in the fields of employment and training, the provision of goods facilities and services, education, housing and other public authority functions (with certain limited exceptions). &quot;Racial grounds&quot; is defined in the 1976 as meaning on grounds of of colour, race, nationality, or ethnic or national origins, but the Act does not specify which particular groups meet these criteria. That is a matter for the courts. Subsequent case law has established that discrimination in the fields covered by the Race Relations Act against an individual on grounds of being Romany gypsy or Irish traveller constitutes unlawful racial discrimination on the grounds of ethnic origin.

 We have no plans to extend payment of bereavement benefits to common law partners of deceased persons, nor have we made an estimate of the cost of doing so. A founding principle of the social insurance system is that all rights to benefit derived from another person&#039;s contributions are based on the concept of legal marriage.

 Carer&#039;s allowance, (previously invalid care allowance), has always been subject to the overlapping benefits rules which put into effect one of the principles of the social security system that only one benefit at a time can be paid for the same purpose.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41213w16.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_150">The reason why carer&#039;s allowance and state pension overlap is that they are both directed at providing a benefit for those whose circumstances typically mean that a traditional source of income is no longer available. Carer&#039;s allowance replaces income where the carer is over working age or has to give up the chance of working to look after a severely disabled person; state pension replaces income in retirement.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41213w16.html_para7">
<a name="stpa_151">Although an entitlement to both benefits will mean that carer&#039;s allowance is not payable, or not payable in full, an underlying entitlement to carer&#039;s allowance gives access to the carer premium in housing benefit and council tax benefit and the additional amount for carers in state pension credit.

1. Figures are taken from a 5 per cent. sample and are therefore subject to a high degree of sampling variation.<br>

2. Numbers are rounded to the nearest hundred.<br>

3. A full basic state pension, &#163;77.45 in 2003&#150;04, is paid to those who fully satisfy the contribution conditions either in their own right or where applicable, on the basis of their late or former spouse&#039;s contributions.<br>

Further, cases are not heard or decided by juries but by family judges. Judges that are ticketed to hear family cases will have undergone training to deal with domestic and sexual abuse cases sensitively. It is the attitude and understanding of the judge toward the victim in family proceedings that is as important as any special measures that may be available.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41213w23.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_202">Judges in the family courts already have wide powers when hearing cases where they decide a victim is vulnerable or scared, for instance victims of domestic or sexual abuse, to take action to assist them to give evidence. Hearings are usually heard in private and wigs and gowns are not worn. If the judge decides it is necessary, and they are available, screens and video links can be used. We are also looking to develop integrated domestic violence courts where civil and criminal aspects of domestic violence cases will be heard in one court. This should also make the availability of special measures more readily available across the jurisdictions. A letter to county courts will be sent shortly to remind them of the need to make known to victims any special facilities that are available in the court and a poster will be provided to aid awareness of these facilities.

 To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Department for Constitutional Affairs, how much the Department has spent on its Programme on IT and e-Government in each year since 1997; and how the money has been apportioned between different initiatives. (201476)

<p><a name="st_225"><a name="41213w23.html_spnew6"><b> Mr. Leslie: </b> 
 For my Department, expenditure incurred on IT between 1997 and 2004 covered three main areas; Crown and County Courts, magistrates&#039; courts and Headquarters. These three areas are covered by separate contracts, namely Local Office Court Computer Systems&#151;various court-based IT systems (LOCCS), Magistrates&#039; courts IT systems (LIBRA) and Resource Accounting and Management Information System (ARAMIS). The e-Government Unit lists 35 eGovernment initiatives under the Department for Constitutional Affairs in its Electronic Service Delivery Report for January 2004. Most of the significant expenditure on these initiatives is contained in the figures below, but to provide information on the money spent on each of them for each of the last seven years would incur disproportionate cost.

 Our analysis of the effects of increased fuel price rises suggests that fuel poverty is likely to rise by a limited amount in 2004 and 2005 (perhaps by up to 200,000 vulnerable households in England. However any potential increase in the numbers needs to be set against the very real progress that has been made: the number of households in fuel poverty in the UK has fallen by over 3 million since 1996, to 2.25 million in 2002 and further reductions are expected for 2003. The effects of the recent price increases will also be countered by other measures that we have put in place on incomes and benefits. The assumptions behind this estimate are set out in two DTI publications which accompanied publication of the &quot;Fuel Poverty in England: The Government&#039;s Plan for Action&quot; on 30 November. These internet publications are available to view at www.dti.gov.uk/energy/consumers/fuel&#095;poverty/index.shtml.

This regulation, along with a regulation disbursing 259 million euros of aid to northern Cyprus, has yet to be agreed. The Government strongly support the presidency in their determination to agree these regulations and to fulfil the Council mandate to end the isolation of the Turkish Cypriots.

We are of the view that it contains no new substantive or scientific evidence to support its conclusions and recommendations.

We understand this refers to those veterans who have claimed a war pension. Although these veterans have served in the Gulf, many of the claims will be for disablements and illnesses unrelated to their Gulf service. The number of veterans in receipt of pensions or gratuities for unspecified, symptomatic Gulf-related illnesses is approximately 1,400, less than 3 per cent. of the personnel who served in the Gulf. Additionally, only some 100 claimants have failed to receive an award for Gulf-related illnesses, not the 272 stated by the Lloyd report. I announced on 29 November 2004, <i>Official Report,</i> column 354, that the MOD will investigate and review these cases that do relate to Gulf illness where these can be identified.

 The new Disability Discrimination legislation that came in on 1 October 2004 affected businesses both as employers and as providers of services to the public. The Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (Amendment) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2004, which implemented the Employment Framework Directive, extended the Disability Discrimination Act to cover certain new occupations and employers with fewer than 15 employees. Also 1 October 2004 saw the introduction of the final stage of duties on service providers. From that date they have had to make &#039;reasonable adjustments&#039; in relation to the physical features of their premises to overcome physical barriers to access. In effect this means that where a physical feature of a building makes it impossible or unreasonably difficult for disabled people to make use of services, a service provider will have to take reasonable steps to remove, alter or provide a reasonable means of avoiding it.

<a name="stpa_306">There is no specific funding available to help businesses with duties under the Disability Discrimination Act to meet these new requirements.

<p><a name="st_366"><a name="41213w37.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Spellar: </b> 
 The Housing Executive&#039;s adaptation service for its tenants is driven by demand and budgets are set to reflect that demand. The availability of new houses would not be a factor in setting budgets. Rehousing people whose circumstances have changed, and as a consequence whose homes are no longer suitable for their needs, would most likely only be considered in areas with a greater supply of housing stock, especially newer housing.

 I utterly deplore and condemn the vicious attacks highlighted in section 2 of the Chief Commissioner&#039;s overview, which in many cases have left the victims physically and mentally scarred for life. Despite making every effort to bring to justice those responsible for these acts, the police can be hampered when in their investigations if the victims fail to cooperate either through fear or because to do so may implicate them in other crimes. Prosecutions are therefore extremely rare.

Furthermore, the Government recognises the continuing hurt that many feel about the number of deaths that remain unresolved. For those who have suffered the loss of loved ones, the possibility of coming to terms with what has happened in the past is made more remote because there remain significant unanswered questions.

<a name="stpa_314">The Serious Crime Review Team within the Police Service of Northern Ireland was established by the Chief Constable this spring to re-examine the files on some of these murders, and to establish whether there is any prospect of fuller reinvestigation leading to an outcome. It is recognised that this is painstaking work and places significant demands on police resources. As a consequence the Government has been working with the Police Service of Northern Ireland on how this work might be expanded to process greater numbers of unresolved deaths and to do so in a way that commands the confidence of the wider community.

 The Planning Service has decided to concentrate as many of the agency&#039;s resources as possible for a period of time, initially for six months, on the operational side of the business to deal with planning applications. This is because of the rapidly increasing and unprecedented workload pressures in this area. The temporary reallocation of resources will, however, have a knock-on effect on emerging area plans and progress on the remaining area plans will be slower then previously anticipated.

<p><a name="st_371"><a name="41213w37.html_spnew6"><b> Angela Smith: </b> 
 To date, the legislation regarding possession and supply of controlled drugs has confined the authority to possess or supply controlled drugs in the operating department to the nursing sister in the department and it has not been appropriate to delegate the holding of the controlled drug keys to other professional groups. However, as of September 2004, the Operating Department Practitioners and Miscellaneous Amendments Order has opened a new part of the Health Professions Council register (part 13) for Operating Department Practitioners. Although the number of Operating Department Practitioners in Northern Ireland is small, this does enhance their professional standing and it is anticipated that the role of the Operating Department Practitioner vis-&#224;-vis the Registered Nurse will continue to evolve. The Department is about to undertake a review of non medical peri-operative staffing skill mix, roles, education and training needs and the issue of handling of controlled drugs will be revisited following the outcome of this review.

It is prepared to take even tougher capping action in 2005&#150;06 than it did this year. This applies to all authorities, including fire and police authorities.

 The Local Government Act 1974 sets out the procedures which the Commission for Local Administration in England (the local government ombudsman) must follow in carrying out his investigations. Anyone who has a concern about the outcome of their complaint to the ombudsman, or the manner in which their complaint has been dealt with by the ombudsman&#039;s staff, can contact the ombudsman&#039;s office. The matter will then be considered by a senior member of staff, usually the deputy ombudsman. If the concern is about the actions of the ombudsman himself then the matter would be considered by the ombudsman. If he is unable to satisfy the concern raised, then the complainant can pursue in the courts an allegation of failure to carry out an investigation in accordance with the provisions of the Act.

 The mobile telecommunications and health research programme supports about 30 studies of the potential effects of mobile phone telecommunications. Many of these are generic and accordingly relevant to TETRA. Some studies include a specific examination of the effects of TETRA. The programme is described on the web site www.mthr.org.uk. An associated programme, specifically on TETRA, is being funded by the Home Office www.policereform.gov.uk/implementation/tetra/index.html. In general, the studies are concerned mainly with mobile phones rather than base stations (masts) because the public exposure from base station emissions is very much lower than the international guidelines.

In 2001, at the request of the Home Office, AGNIR reported on TETRA and concluded that &quot;current evidence suggests that it is unlikely that the special features of the signals from TETRA mobile terminals and repeaters pose a hazard to health&quot; (Documents of the NRPB, Vol 12, No 2, 2001).

 The policy objectives for this legislation are as follows:
</p>


<p>
<a name="41213w46.html_para7">
<a name="stpa_406">The Food Supplements Directive was adopted in July 2002 and applies in member states from 1 August 2005. The Government must ensure that food supplements on sale after 1 August comply with the relevant legislation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41213w46.html_para8">
<a name="stpa_407">The Government&#039;s objective is to improve consumer protection from misleading and fraudulent nutrition and health claims on food, with proportionate measures that minimise new burdens on business.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41213w46.html_para9">
<a name="stpa_408">The Government&#039;s policy in relation to proposals for European Union legislation on sports nutrition is to press for proportionate legislation, which protects public health and supports consumer choice.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41213w46.html_para10">
<a name="stpa_409">All Departments will be concentrating efforts on progressing the agenda of Council work, which will include the nutrition and health claims proposal. It would not be appropriate for discussion on the food supplements directive to be considered as Council business during this period as the Directive was adopted in July 2002 and applies from 1 August 2005. The Commission is expected to produce a formal proposal on sports nutrition products, but it has yet to publish its 2005 work programme. It is therefore unclear at this stage whether this will be available for discussion during the United Kingdom Presidency.

<p><a name="st_509"><a name="41213w50.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 The national programme for information technology (NPfIT) will over the next nine years, revolutionise the way health information is accessed and shared in the national health service. The NPfIT focuses on the developments that will make a significant difference to improving the patient experience and the delivery of treatment, care and services. It will connect more than 30,000 general practitioners and 270 acute, community and mental health NHS trusts in a single, secure national system, providing doctors and nurses with the right information in the right place at the right time, and allow patients much greater choice in how and where they receive their care. NPfTT is a key component of delivering the vision of a truly modern and patient-centred NHS.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41213w50.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_442">NPfIT has four key deliverables: electronic appointment booking, an electronic care records service, electronic transfer of prescriptions and an underpinning IT infrastructure with sufficient connectivity and broadband capacity to support the critical national applications and local systems.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41213w50.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_443">Under the NPfIT, an incremental approach is being adopted to building up any new applications or systems. This approach is intended to ensure that implementation is achievable and minimises disruption to the day-to-day business of the NHS. As a consequence the NPfTPs strategy underlines the importance of making best use of the existing asset base. NHS users, including general practitioners, will not be expected to change clinical systems while their current systems are compliant with the NHS care record service and continue to serve them well. We have repeatedly made it clear, in particular when speaking with general practitioners, and in written guidance, that practices may continue to use existing systems subject to their remaining compliant, and being able to deliver the required functionality, until the national programme&#039;s local service provider (LSP) is able to implement a viable alternative system. LSPs are required to provide a choice of GP system as part of their service offering.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41213w50.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_444">The NPfIT was planned and is being delivered, within expenditure assumptions set in line with the recommendations of the 2002 Wanless Report &#039;Securing our Future Health&#039;. Wanless anticipated an increase in the level of spending on NHS information and communications technology, rising to around 4 per cent. of the total NHS budget on NHS IT in general by 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>13 Dec 2004 : Column 977W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
2008. The Government is committed to seeing this target, which extends beyond just the NPfTT national clinical systems, achieved. The costs of the procurement contracts let for the programme&#039;s four core components amount to &#163;6.2 billion over 10 years. This figure relate to contractual commitments and covers ongoing funding of core deliverables and the connection of existing systems to national applications from central budgets. It does not include costs of training NHS staff or local change management costs, which will be borne by individual NHS organisations. Future funding to the NHS, determined by the next and future expenditure settlements, is expected to support trusts in meeting and sustaining the 4 per cent. target.
