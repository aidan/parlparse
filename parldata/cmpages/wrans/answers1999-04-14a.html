8. <a name="90414w01.htm_wqn0"><B>  Mr. MacShane: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development if she will make it her policy to support the creation of a joint working party between the ILO and WTO to examine relevant issues.  [79110]<P>

<P>
<a name="90414w01.htm_spnew0"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 The Government are working for the world-wide observance of core labour standards for all workers. We believe that the right way to do this is through the ILO and that the recent ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work presents a key opportunity for progress. Developing countries--who make up nearly three quarters of WTO members--are opposed to the formal introduction of labour issues to the WTO agenda. They are concerned that labour standards would be used for protectionist trade purposes. We do not therefore believe the creation of a joint working party between the ILO and WTO to discuss labour issues is the right way forward, but we do support more systematic reporting between the two secretariats.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90414w01.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Foulkes: </B> 
 We have been leading the international effort to provide humanitarian relief and improve the security situation in Sierra Leone.
<P>

<a name="90414w01.htm_para0">We are co-ordinating closely with the EC, other donors and the UN to maximise effectiveness and encourage the burden sharing.
<P>

<a name="90414w01.htm_para1">We are also restarting longer term development programmes such as demobilisation of fighters, support to the reform of the police force and security forces, support for independent media and the peace process.

<a name="90414w01.htm_spnew2"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 We provided &#163;10.5 million in 1996-97 financial year, &#163;3.4 million in 1997-98 financial year and &#163;9.7 million in 1998-99.
<P>

<a name="90414w01.htm_para2">We have provided humanitarian assistance and support for demobilisation, reform of the judiciary and legal systems, the independent media, and reform of the police and security force.

 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development if she will make a statement on the assistance her Department is providing for refugees in the Balkans.  [79112]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90414w01.htm_spnew3"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 We have been one of the largest and most active donors in helping improve the provision of humanitarian relief to the refugees from Kosovo. We have supported NATO in erecting camps, international agencies in bringing people and resources to the region--so far we have provided 23 flights and we have teams working in Tirana airport and supporting the Albanian Government. We are now preparing for the hand-over of camps to UNHCR and the NGOs and are helping establish two refugee centres in Albania.
<P>

<a name="90414w01.htm_para3">Our greatest concern is the situation of displaced people in Kosovo. We are considering all possibilities of providing support but no option is easy--in the face of deliberate Serbian repression. Milosevic will have to answer for this to the International Criminal Tribunal.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90414w01.htm_spnew4"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 We made clear in our White Paper in November 1997 that we are strongly committed to the implementation of the international development targets which include universal primary education by 2015. We have worked consistently to encourage the World Bank and IMF to incorporate the targets in their programmes.
<P>

<a name="90414w01.htm_para4">In recent discussions with the Managing Director of the IMF and the President of the World Bank, I have underlined the importance of protecting spending on health, and education for the poor.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90414w01.htm_spnew5"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 As the White Paper on International Development makes clear, good governance is essential to the economic and social policies which are necessary to the reduction of poverty. Our country strategies--20 of which have been published so far--apply this to all our programmes.

 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what assessment she has made of the need for development aid in the Caribbean if the banana crop in that region is priced out of international markets; and if she will make a statement.  [79118]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90414w01.htm_spnew6"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 Substantial amounts of development assistance are already being made available through the European Commission to improve the competitiveness of the Caribbean banana producers and to support economic diversification programmes for those high cost growers

<P>
<P>
<a name="90414w01.htm_spnew7"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 Our contributions to the EC's external assistance programmes absorb approximately 30 per cent. of the Department for International Development's budget.
<P>

<a name="90414w01.htm_para5">In December 1998 we published our 18 point strategy to improve EC development spending. This reflects our concern that EC aid spending is both skewed against the poorest countries and often of poor quality. Our strategy includes a proposal for the agreement of a coherent overarching statement of EU development policy.
<P>

<a name="90414w01.htm_para6">We are pursuing vigorously our strategy with the Commission and with other EC member states. I agreed a Joint Declaration on improving the EC's contribution to international development with my French and German opposite numbers in February. I expect to discuss specific measures for improving the quality of the EC's development spending at the EU Development Council in May, in the context of the follow-up to recently completed evaluations of the EC's development programmes.

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what assessment she has made of the impact of the resignation of the Commissioners of the European Union on the co-ordination of British development aid with that of the EU.  [79113]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90414w01.htm_spnew8"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 The events surrounding the resignation of the Commission provide a major opportunity to reform the EC's external assistance programmes. We need an overhaul of approval, auditing and financial management systems, and more accountability. We also need to avoid sanctioning EC programmes or budget levels which cannot be effectively managed. Strengthening co-ordination is a priority of the German EU Presidency and we will support all sensible proposals at the EU Development Council next month.

 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what assessment she has made of the extent which the work of the Inter-American Development bank is focused on the relief of poverty.  [79122]




<P>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90414w01.htm_spnew9"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 Since May 1997, we have been working to increase the poverty focus of the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB). The Bank recognises that poverty remains a persistent problem in Latin America, which is the most unequal region in the world. In February, I co-chaired with IDB's President Iglesias a seminar which took as its starting point the Bank's recent Report entitled "Facing up to Inequality in Latin America". We welcome this as a contribution to raising awareness.
<P>

<a name="90414w01.htm_para7">In 1997, the IDB adopted a poverty reduction strategy that charts a broad course for attacking poverty in the region. This calls for the promotion of sustainable and labour-intensive economic growth, investments in human capital and special efforts to reach those groups which are unlikely to benefit from economic growth. Recognising that poverty in the region is principally a rural phenomenon, the Bank adopted a rural poverty reduction strategy in 1998 which emphasises the need to develop national rural poverty reduction strategies, and calls for activities that stimulate participation of beneficiaries including access to land and credit for farmers with productive potential, and non-agricultural employment in micro-enterprises for other rural inhabitants.
<P>

<a name="90414w01.htm_para8">During 1998, the Bank approved $3.3 billion for social sector and poverty reduction projects, which represented about 46 per cent. of the year's lending (the highest level ever achieved by the Bank) or 53 per cent. of the total number of projects approved. We believe that the Bank has made a good effort, but that more could be done, particularly on the link between poverty and ethnicity. We are also urging the Bank to commit itself to the International Development Goals on the elimination of poverty.

 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what support her Department plans to give to the development of the world micro-credit scheme.  [79123]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90414w02.htm_spnew0"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 We are constantly expanding its support for microfinance institutions targeting some of the world's poorest communities who have no access to formal financial services. Our current commitments for ongoing and planned project activities in this sector amount to &#163;75 million.

 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development if she will make a statement on her recent visit to India.  [79124]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90414w02.htm_spnew1"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 I visited India from 22 to 27 March. India is of critical importance in achieving international targets for poverty elimination since 1 in 3 of the poor of the world live there. I agreed with the Indian Government a new country strategy which will soon be published and will focus DFID assistance in a few states which are committed to implementing essential reforms for poverty elimination. These include Orissa and Andhra Pradesh which I visited to discuss how to strengthen our development partnerships with them.




<P>
<P><I>14 Apr 1999 : Column: 235</I><P>

<P>

<a name="90414w02.htm_para0">The visit reinforced my view that India has the potential to make much more rapid progress in eliminating poverty. I confirmed Britain's commitment to support Indian partners who share that objective.

 Our Country Strategy Paper for Zimbabwe will be published shortly.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90414w02.htm_spnew4"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 The WTO provides a forum for all countries to participate in a global trading system which is rules based and which operates in an open and transparent way. All decisions are taken by consensus. This is particularly important for developing countries, who are sometimes at a disadvantage in negotiations with the developed world. My Department is working to strengthen the capacity of developing countries so that they can participate effectively in the existing system and in future negotiations. A copy of a recent speech in which I outlined our thinking on developing countries and the WTO will be sent to the hon. Gentleman. I will also place a copy in the Library of the House.

<P>

<a name="90414w02.htm_para1">In our bilateral programme we are supporting Governments that give priority to the education of girls and women. We have committed over &#163;200 million to basic education in a number of countries including Ghana, India, Zambia, Malawi, South Africa, Pakistan, Bangladesh and our largest ever single education commitment of &#163;67 million for Uganda.
<P>

<a name="90414w02.htm_para2">We are also working in the multilateral agencies to increase the commitment to girls' and women's education.

 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what is her Department's assessment of the amount of debt cancellation for indebted poor countries that is required in order for the Government to meet their poverty reduction targets for 2015.  [79129]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90414w02.htm_spnew6"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 It is impossible to calculate an amount of debt relief needed to meet the International Poverty eradication targets. The reduction of debt for heavily indebted poor countries (HIPCs), with good policy performance and a commitment to reduce poverty, does however have a crucial part to play in the achievement of the international development goals. A review of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative is currently underway, and we are pressing for a link between debt relief and poverty reduction. In particular, the review needs to assess whether the amount and timing of the debt relief being provided is freeing up sufficient resources to allow governments to tackle poverty effectively. This has to be done on a country-by-country basis.

[79130]<P>

<P>
<a name="90414w02.htm_spnew7"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 In our 1999 Departmental Report we published detailed current and planned figures for all areas of development assistance. Actual expenditure will and should vary reflecting changes, for example, in a country's commitment to poverty reduction.

 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what steps her Department is taking to support security sector reform in developing countries.  [79131]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90414w02.htm_spnew8"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 On 9 March, I announced my Department's new plans to help developing countries reform their security sectors. The security sector consists of those who are responsible, or should be responsible, for protecting the state and communities within the state. Included in the security sector are military, paramilitary 



<P>
<P><I>14 Apr 1999 : Column: 237</I><P>
and intelligence services, as well as those civilian structures responsible for oversight and control of the security forces.
<P>

<a name="90414w02.htm_para5">All countries have legitimate security needs. But a major obstacle to making progress in development and reducing poverty in many countries is the existence of bloated, secretive, repressive, undemocratic and badly structured security sectors. Reforming the security sector is therefore a priority. Eliminating violence and reducing insecurity is a precondition for development.
<P>

<a name="90414w02.htm_para6">I outlined seven priority areas for future action which focus on the issues of good governance, conflict prevention, human rights promotion and post-conflict reconstruction. The priority areas are:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>to integrate a security sector reform perspective into country aid programmes, and into the thinking of other donors and multilateral development institutions</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>to secure partnership programmes with the United Nations and with regional organisations who wish to co-operate with us on conflict and security issues</FONT></UL>

<P>

<a name="90414w02.htm_para7">Within these priority areas, we plan to provide assistance to strengthen the democratic accountability and transparency of the security sector and facilitate the transition to peace; and second, to strengthen capacities of the uniformed security services, for example through training in conflict prevention and reduction. In doing this, we will work in co-operation with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Ministry of Defence, but it is essential that authorities in developing countries both want our help and are committed to strengthening their effective control over their security sectors.

<P>
<a name="90414w02.htm_spnew9"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 One of my key international poverty eradication targets is to secure primary education for all children in the world by 2015. Education is therefore of crucial importance in the work of my Department. We are working in the multilateral system to increase its commitment to the 2015 target. In the Government's first year in office (1997-98), we spent over &#163;13 million of bilateral funds on primary education. This was an increase of &#163;5 million over the previous year. Subsequent major commitments have been made of over &#163;200 million to basic education in a number of countries including Ghana, India, Zambia, Malawi, South Africa, Pakistan, Bangladesh and our largest ever single education commitment of &#163;67 million for Uganda. These and new programmes being developed reflect a major contribution

There is not a figure available within NATO for the total number of personnel participating. I understand from NATO that the cost of the NATO Exercise Fund of this exercise has been estimated at some &#163;210,000. The additional cost to the UK of participation in the exercise totalled some &#163;11,000, with about 100 personnel participating. We do not know what the national costs to other participating nations were. Exercise Distant Thunder provided excellent training in both deployment procedures and in practising Combined Air Operations.

 The MoD has had a technical programme in place since 1996 to scope and address the problem of computer system compliancy with the Year 2000 date change. This programme is progressing well, with over 60 per cent. of MoD's critical systems now compliant. In addition, comprehensive contingency plans are being developed against the possibility of unexpected failure of MoD systems, or the failure of other non-MoD systems on which we rely, such as the public utilities. These plans seek to ensure the continuity of military operations and the requisite levels of defence capability throughout the period 1 September 1999 to 31 March 2000. There are also well-established procedures for crisis management on a 24-hour basis, which will apply throughout this period.

The goats are closely monitored throughout the experiments and if signs of decompression sickness occur the goats may be recompressed in the same way as divers and submariners. Alternatively, if their condition warrants, they are humanely killed at that point.

Since 1 January 1999, 9 goats have been humanely killed during or following experiments. It is likely that the total number of goats killed in 1999 will be higher than in recent years for three reasons. Firstly, two research programmes are being carried out concurrently 



<P>
</UL></FONT><P><I>14 Apr 1999 : Column: 244</I><P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>and, secondly, the conditions of the co-operative rescue programme are such that more animals will be humanely killed in the early stages. Thirdly, a restocking programme has started as many of the goats are getting old and these also, will be humanely killed.
<BR>
None of the goats are injured prior to the experiments.
<BR>
The anaesthetics administered to the goats are as follows
<BR>
Rompun and Domitor (sedative/analgesic)
<BR>
Torbugesic (analgesic)
<BR>
Halothane/oxygen/nitrous oxide (general anaesthetic)

This calculation looks at the impact of all the tax and benefit measures announced in the last two Budgets, the introduction of the Working Families Tax Credit and National Minimum Wage.
<P>

<a name="90414w04.htm_para3">This method is one snap-shot indicator of one dimension of relative poverty. Child poverty is complex. It is characterised by a number of related problems, including persistent low family incomes caused by parental unemployment, damaged opportunities later in life, and too often a poor education in childhood.
<P>

<a name="90414w04.htm_para4">The Government's strategy for reducing poverty and social exclusion is tackling all aspects of poverty and tackling it at source. It is focused on investment in prevention, work as the best way out of poverty and regenerating the poorest communities, while providing support for those who cannot work.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what estimate he has made of the numbers of higher rate taxpayers who will pay a 46 per cent. marginal rate of income tax consequent upon the tapering of the children's tax credit <i>(a)</i> in total, <i>(b)</i> where the taxpayer is the sole earner in the family and <i>(c)</i> where the taxpayer is the sole higher rate taxpayer in the family.

<P>
<a name="90414w04.htm_spnew7"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 It is estimated that in 2001-02 there will be 300,000 taxpayers on the children's tax credit taper. Of these, around 90,000 will be the sole earner in the family. In very few cases will there be two higher rate taxpayers in the family.

 The New Deal for young people is delivered through local partnerships. For planning purposes, the Employment Service has provided its partners in each local unit of delivery with an indicative assumption for the numbers of young people who might join the programme in 1999-2000. Those planning assumptions are based on current unemployment levels. They are not forecasts of the actual numbers who will join the programme. They do however enable the Employment Service and its partners in each local area to plan on a better informed basis, and they help to ensure that adequate plans are in place locally to meet potential demand.

that if the inspectors are to go back into Iraq they will need a system more, not less, intrusive than before.
<P>

<a name="90414w07.htm_para1">Iraq's refusal to come clean over its weapons of mass destruction has prevented any movement on sanctions. Compliance with Security Council resolutions is an essential prerequisite for lifting sanctions. Our insistence on Iraq meeting its obligations does not mean we can ignore the suffering of the Iraqi people. We are pleased that the humanitarian panel has picked up many of our proposals on how to improve international efforts to alleviate this suffering, on how to increase the amount of money going into the oil-for-food programme and ensuring it is used as effectively as possible.

<a name="90414w07.htm_para2">Neither should we lose sight of the fate of the Kuwaitis and others still missing since the Gulf War ended in 1991, on which Iraq has remained shamelessly silent.

 The report by the Institute for the Study and Treatment of Delinquency provides a general evaluation of the complementary medical treatment pilot at Coldingley and records the broadly positive and supportive views of patients. It makes proposals for improving the organisation of the service and for future research. The report does not provide a detailed assessment of the therapeutic value of all the treatments and practices involved nor of the resource and other implications of continuing the programme or extending it to other prisons.

Provision will have to be on the basis of an assessed health need and in the context of an integrated health improvement plan, as described in the Government's announcement of 29 March 1999, <i>Official Report,</i> columns <i>556-58,</i> on the future organisation of prison health care.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what account he took of the geographical extent of bee activity when deciding the extent of the sanitary cordon around genetically modified trial crops.  [75093]<P>

<P>
<a name="90414w08.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 8 March 1999]:</i> Each application for the release of genetically modified (GM) plants for research purposes is supported by a risk assessment, which is evaluated by Government experts and independent scientists on the Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment (ACRE). Their consideration will include the possible spread of GM pollen by all means, including bee activity, and its likely consequences. One member of ACRE is an expert on bees and their behaviour. Based on the type of GM plant, how it has been modified and the circumstances of the proposed release it may be judged necessary to minimise the potential for cross-pollination of neighbouring sexually compatible crops or wild relatives by the GM plants. The precautions taken to prevent or reduce cross-pollination include the removal of flowers, specific isolation distances between GM and non-GM plants or borders of non-GM plants around the plots of GM plants. It has to be recognised however that bee activity may in some cases involve the dissemination of GM pollen beyond the isolation distances traditionally used.

In the same period, no applications for such licences were refused. Individual licences may cover a range of goods with various ratings (and OIELs may also cover a range of countries). Where this is so, the licence is included in the Table in the total for all of the relevant ratings and/or countries.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if he will make a statement about the Government's response to consultation on proposals to establish consumer councils for the energy, telecommunications and water sectors.  [81139]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90414w09.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 On 30 September last year, the Government published a consultation paper on their proposals for establishing independent consumer councils for the water, energy and telecommunications sectors. The establishment of independent consumer councils for the utility sectors is a vital element in the Government's broader agenda for reforming the framework for utility regulation so that it delivers a fair deal for consumers.
<P>

<a name="90414w09.htm_para2">The Government received over 130 responses to the consultation paper. In addition, they held discussions with a wide range of interested parties. These indicated strong support for the approach set out in the consultation paper.
<P>

<a name="90414w09.htm_para3">The consultation paper looked in detail at a number of important issues such as the functions and powers of the future consumer councils; their structure and organisation; 



<P>
<P><I>14 Apr 1999 : Column: 264</I><P>
and the framework for establishing strong and constructive links with the utility regulators' offices. The Government have considered the representations made on these matters and announced their decisions on the way forward on 8 April.
<P>

<a name="90414w09.htm_para4">In taking forward proposals for the consumer councils, the Government have had four key concerns: firstly to create independent and influential consumer advocates, with a voice at the heart of the regulatory system, advising the utility regulators, utility companies and others on consumer issues; secondly, to ensure that all consumers have a one stop shop they can go to when they have unresolved grievances about the standards of service or conduct of a utility company; thirdly, to provide consumers with a source of good quality information and advice on getting the best deal from the utility markets. Influential councils and well-informed consumers can play a key part in driving standards up, and prices down. Finally, the new arrangements must provide for an open, professional and co-ordinated relationship between the new councils and the utility regulators.
<P>

<a name="90414w09.htm_para5">Implementation of the Government's proposals will require legislation. We intend to introduce legislation to implement these proposals along with the Government's other proposals for the reform of utility regulation as soon as Parliamentary time permits.
<P>

<a name="90414w09.htm_para6">These proposals are generally intended to apply to consumer arrangements in the whole of the UK. They do not, however, extend to Northern Ireland, in respect of the water and energy sectors, nor to Scotland in respect of the water sector.
<P>

<a name="90414w09.htm_para7">We propose to give the councils broad functions within the regulatory system. They will act as public advocates for all utility consumers in their sectors, and will be expected to provide information and advice on consumer issues to regulators, Government, Parliament, the Scottish Parliament, the Welsh Assembly, the media and others. They will draw attention to areas requiring action by the companies, utility regulators and others. And they will publish information and advice of interest and assistance to consumers, such as advice on securing the best deal from utility companies. These broad functions will ensure that the councils have flexibility to investigate and advise on the consumer issues of the moment.
<P>

<a name="90414w09.htm_para8">These functions will be underpinned by a research capacity to ensure that issues of concern to consumers, including particular groups of consumers such as the disadvantaged or small businesses, or those in a particular region, can be investigated, and that the councils can speak with knowledge and authority.
<P>

<a name="90414w09.htm_para9">In addition, we propose giving the councils the specific task of handling consumer complaints against utility companies where these have not been resolved by the company concerned. Where possible, we will expect the councils to try to mediate a satisfactory outcome between the company and the complainant. Where further action such as enforcement action may be required, the council will also pass the complaint on to the appropriate regulatory authority. We also anticipate the councils working constructively with the utility companies to reduce the causes of complaints.




<P>

<P>

<a name="90414w09.htm_para10">An effective framework for collaboration between the councils and the utility regulators will be required. To achieve this, we intend to place a duty on the council and the relevant utility regulator to agree and then publish a memorandum of understanding (MoU). The detailed content will be a matter for the parties to agree, but we expect it to cover such matters as the practical arrangements for consultation between them, the co-ordination of requests for information from the utility companies, the exchange of information, and the co-ordination of work on consumer-related issues. We also propose that the water consumer council and the drinking water inspectorate should be placed under a similar duty to agree and publish an MoU to cover co-operation between them on water quality issues and the handling of water quality complaints.
<P>

<a name="90414w09.htm_para11">The councils' powers to access information will need a basis in statute. We intend to give the councils direct rights of access to the information they need from utilities so that unresolved customer complaints can be investigated. In addition, we propose that councils should receive copies of any monitoring returns that utility companies are required to send to the utility regulators to demonstrate compliance with codes of practice on complaints handling. This is intended to assist the councils in their task of tackling the causes of consumer complaints at source.
<P>

<a name="90414w09.htm_para12">We propose that other types of information should be obtained by making a request to the relevant utility regulator, or to the drinking water inspectorate, where it cannot be obtained from the utility companies on a voluntary basis. Consistent with their existing functions, we intend to give the utility regulators and the drinking water inspectorate powers to obtain information from the utilities on behalf of the councils as well as for themselves, and we intend to make the councils bodies to whom they can disclose information. These bodies will be required to comply with reasonable requests from the councils for information, both information that they hold already or have generated themselves, and new information which needs to be obtained from the utility companies. Where a request is declined, these bodies will need to give reasons. There will be reciprocal obligations on the councils to provide information to the utility regulators or to the drinking water inspectorate on similar terms.
<P>

<a name="90414w09.htm_para13">These are strong information-gathering powers which will ensure that the councils have access to the information they will need in order to play an influential and informed role within the regulatory system. The powers are consistent with the Government's vision of the councils as independent, effective consumer champions.
<P>

<a name="90414w09.htm_para14">The Government wish to establish focused and professional consumer councils. The optimum number of council members may vary between the utility sectors, and over time. Accordingly, we propose that the legislation should not specify a minimum or a maximum number of council members. This will provide the necessary flexibility. Appointments to the councils and approval of their budgets will be a matter for the Government, thus ensuring their independence from the utility regulators. Their resources will be raised, wherever possible, through licence fees, and they will be required to operate in an accountable and transparent fashion.




<P>
<P><I>14 Apr 1999 : Column: 266</I><P>

<P>

<a name="90414w09.htm_para15">The Government fully recognise the importance of the regional dimension in the provision of utility services, and recognise that some issues and concerns may be best addressed at a regional level. They also recognise that regional arrangements will need to be different in different sectors, depending on the structure of the industry.
<P>

<a name="90414w09.htm_para16">We propose to give the telecoms and energy councils a duty to ensure that regional needs are addressed efficiently and effectively, and that their work is informed by an awareness of regional issues. To meet this duty, the telecoms and energy councils will be given flexible powers to establish regional offices where they need them, and to appoint regional committees or panels where these are needed to help address customer complaints and other issues. These powers will give the councils the flexibility to change their regional arrangements in response to market developments in their utility sectors. The councils will be required to obtain the consent of the Secretary of State for their regional arrangements and to consult the Secretary of State on the appointment of any regional chairmen. In addition, the national energy council will be required to maintain offices and an appropriate consumer committee or panel structure in Scotland and Wales. The national telecommunications council will be required to maintain similar arrangements in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
<P>

<a name="90414w09.htm_para17">In the water sector, the Government propose to take an approach which reflects the particularly strong regional dimension in water supply, and the forthcoming devolution of certain functions to the National Assembly for Wales. The Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions will therefore be given powers to determine the regional structure of the water consumer council (to include an office and consumer committee in Wales), and powers to appoint both the regional chairmen of committees operating in England, and members of the national council. The appointment of the chairman to the Welsh consumer committee will be made by the Welsh Assembly. The national council will make the other appointments in line with guidance issued by the Secretary of State in respect of English regional committees, and guidance issued by the Welsh Assembly in respect of the Welsh consumer committee. The guidance will be designed to ensure that the appointments adequately reflect local consumer interests. As for the other utility councils, it is intended that the regional organisation will operate as part of a single public body.
<P>

<a name="90414w09.htm_para18">More generally, detailed operational matters are best left to the councils. The Government do not therefore wish to legislate on specific matters such as call centre arrangements, or on the detailed arrangements for handling complaints. These arrangements may need to change over time, and are not matters for legislation.
<P>

<a name="90414w09.htm_para19">The Government wish to ensure that the work of all the councils and any regional or other specialist committees is professional, and that work on such committees is attractive to a wide cross-section of the community. To this end all the councils will be given powers to remunerate the members of any regional or other specialist committees where appropriate.
<P>

<a name="90414w09.htm_para20">More generally, the councils may find it useful to establish operational links with other regulators such as the Environment Agency, the Health and Safety Executive and the Electricity Engineering Inspectorate, and with 



<P>
<P><I>14 Apr 1999 : Column: 267</I><P>
consumer bodies such as local authority Trading Standards Offices, and Citizens' Advice Bureaux. We propose to give the councils powers to establish MoUs or other arrangements with these and other organisations where appropriate, to ensure the effective referral of consumer concerns to those who can best deal or act on them.
<P>

<a name="90414w09.htm_para21">In the water sector, the Government also propose to improve the arrangements by which service standards are set. Standards can currently be set only by the Secretary of State in response to a specific proposition from the economic regulator. We believe that this is no longer appropriate in a sector where standards may need to be set for environmental and public health reasons beyond the scope of the economic regulator's functions. We propose, therefore, to extend the existing arrangements so that the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions in respect of England, and the Welsh Assembly in respect of Wales, can initiate proposals for new or amended service standards, subject to public consultation. The new procedure would normally only be exercised by the Secretary of State and the Welsh Assembly in respect of standards raising environmental and public health issues. Where any new or amended standards had a significant financial effect, they would trigger existing provisions in the water companies' conditions of appointment that enable costs to be passed through.
<P>

<a name="90414w09.htm_para22">Steps will be taken to ensure a smooth transition from the existing consumer bodies to the new councils, with the existing bodies being wound up when the transition has been achieved. This will ensure that consumer interests are effectively addressed during the interim, and that the councils can operate effectively from the moment they take over.
<P>

<a name="90414w09.htm_para23">Government will not be able to achieve the results they want without high quality staff. Already, within existing organisations, there are staff who are doing some of the things the consumer councils will be doing, and doing it well. Steps will need to be taken to ensure that full use is made of this existing expertise. Staff will need to be transferred or seconded to the councils. Staffing arrangements will be a matter for detailed discussion between the staff concerned, the utility regulators, the Gas Consumers' Council (in respect of the energy council), and any relevant unions.
<P>

<a name="90414w09.htm_para24">These proposals, taken together, will ensure that consumers have the strong and independent voice they need, and thereby help to ensure that the regulatory regime is able to respond promptly and efficiently to meet their needs.

<a name="90414w11.htm_spnew3"><B> Janet Anderson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 11 March 1999]:</i> The New Millennium Experience Company (NMEC) recognises the unique opportunity afforded by the Millennium Experience project to adopt positive environmental policies across all aspects of the project, including planning; construction; and operation. NMEC is doing so wherever possible, recognising the time and budgetary constraints within which it is operating. Underpinning NMEC's operation is its Environmental Plan (including targets and objectives) which has been presented to non-governmental organisations, and was approved by Greenwich Council in mid-1998. The Environmental Plan is regularly reviewed. The Plan is sent to all companies tendering for works, goods and services and they are required to include in their bids, statements of their own environmental polices.
<P>

<a name="90414w11.htm_para2">A number of innovative environmental initiatives are already in progress on site. Following discussions with the NMEC, Thames Water is installing a state-of-the-art grey water recycling scheme at the Dome. During the year of operation, the NMEC will adopt a waste management strategy based on the concepts of waste reduction, re-use, recycling and efficient removal from the site, providing opportunities for innovative demonstration environmental projects. NMEC is also investigating supply strategies that will minimise the quantity of packaging coming onto the site and facilities to allow separation of those major waste streams that are generated in order that they can be processed or recycled efficiently. There is daily monitoring of dust and noise levels and robust systems are in place to ensure immediate response should any problems arise. Two firms of independent environmental consultants have reviewed the environmental health and safety and the environmental integrity of the site.
<P>

<a name="90414w11.htm_para3">The Dome structure was conceived and developed as an energy and resource efficient means of housing a range of exhibits and attractions appropriate to the conditions of the Greenwich peninsula site. The Dome does not provide a conventionally controlled environment; it is not air-conditioned, and heating and cooling provisions have been minimised to reflect the fact that visitors will be wearing clothing appropriate to outdoor conditions. In addition, the translucency of the Dome cladding material allows the interior to be naturally lit for much of the year. It is inevitable that operating a large scale visitor attraction requires a significant quantity of power, but NMEC will seek to minimise this requirement wherever it is practicable to do so.

<a name="90414w11.htm_para4">In the early stages of the development of the National zone, in which there will be a significant focus on environmental matters, meetings were held with representatives from the Council of Rural England, Greenpeace, and the Natural Foresight Panel (DTI). The Environment Agency has ongoing liaison with the NMEC in light of its statutory role and responsibilities and in the light of its work in regenerating Thames River bank areas adjacent to the Dome site. In this latter respect the Dome has provided the catalyst for the creation of a new river bank ecology and ecological terrace as well as for regeneration of the Peninsula as a whole. The NMEC also has ongoing contacts with non-governmental organisations such as Greenpeace.
<P>

<a name="90414w11.htm_para5">The National zone will explore the UK's relationship with the environment and its structure will optimise use of environmentally positive materials and techniques. The Local zone, unveiled on BBC Television's Blue Peter programme earlier this year, will be one of the largest recycled cardboard structures in the world. Children across the UK have been invited to participate in the creation of the zone. Other exhibit zones and areas within the Dome will also incorporate and address issues which have an environmental aspect.

 <i>[holding answer 22 March 1999]:</i> The New Millennium Experience Company (NMEC) is in consultation with the Department for Education and Employment (DfEE) as part of the process of developing management plans for school and education visits. The procedures which the NMEC will adopt and operate will be based on established procedures for other visitor attractions. The ratio of children to teachers will be one adult to every six pupils in years 1 to 3 and special needs groups; one adult to every ten pupils in years 4 to 6; and one adult to every fifteen pupils in years 7 and above.

 <i>[holding answer 25 March 1999]:</i> The Millennium Dome itself, and the individual exhibits within it, are striking examples of the capabilities and imagination of British designers, architects and engineers. Some elements of the exhibits will also address and reflect issues within the engineering field. In addition, the New Millennium Experience Company (NMEC) is working with the Design Council to accommodate a number of its innovative Millennium Products within the Dome. Aspects of the NMEC's school curriculum resource packs (which are issued to every school in the UK) deal with a range of construction and engineering issues involved in the building of the Dome.

 The assumption of notional (tariff) income of &#163;1 for every &#163;250 of capital above &#163;3,000 reflects an expectation that people with more substantial savings can make some contribution towards their living expenses from those savings. This formula, which does not represent any assumed rate of interest, avoids the many practical difficulties that would arise if actual income were taken into account. However, we continue to review the benefit rules as part of our commitment to modernise the Social Security system.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. Estimates of the proportion of pensioner units in receipt of occupational pension income are based upon data from the Family Resources Survey 1996-97, controlled to a number of individual recipients which is extrapolated from the Surveys of Occupational Pensions of the Government Actuary's Department.<P>

2. Estimates of the proportions with occupational pension income should be treated as provisional.<P>

3. Pensioner units are defined as single people above State pension age (60 and over for women, 65 and over for men) and couples (married or cohabiting) where the man is over State pension age.<P>

4. Pensioner couples have been allocated to age bands according to the age of the man.<P>

5. The occupational pension income category includes income received by widows on the basis of their late spouse's contributions to an occupational pension scheme.<P>

<a name="90414w14.htm_spnew7"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 The Welsh steel industry is among the most competitive in the world. However, like others, it is experiencing very difficult trading conditions. The industry is therefore taking action to maintain its competitiveness, such as the introduction of new technology and team working. For example, British Steel has recently completed a &#163;121 million investment in a new continuous annealing process line at Port Talbot, which represents the biggest single investment in the industry since privatisation.
<P>

<a name="90414w14.htm_para5">The Government are also supporting initiatives aimed at improving the industry's competitiveness. We have provided grant support through the UK Steel Association and Steel Training Ltd. for a range of projects involving benchmarking, education and training.

 The Welsh Office, together with the Department for Trade and Industry and the Scottish Office, have jointly commissioned "Arup Economics and Planning" to undertake an evaluation of Regional Selective Assistance (RSA) between 1991 and 1995. Amongst other things, it will look at the influence of RSA on investment decisions. The report is expected to be ready towards the middle of this year. Previous evaluations of RSA suggest that up to a fifth of RSA funded projects would have located outside the UK Assisted Areas in the absence of RSA.

 Section 2 of the Water Industry Act 1991 does not provide the Secretary of State with order making powers in respect of single person households or pensioners. The Water Industry Bill currently before Parliament provides for householders, including the elderly and single persons, to opt to be charged on a measured basis without paying any initial costs for the installation of a meter. This may help those using less water to pay less. If the arrangement did not suit their individual needs, customers would have the right, within the first 12 months of installation, to revert to unmeasured charging.
<P>

<a name="90414w16.htm_para3">The Government believe that households on low incomes or with special needs should have available to them a range of payment options. The Water Industry Bill will enable the Secretary of State to give guidance to the Director General of Water Services on matters to be taken into account in approving water companies' charges schemes. Such guidance could cover payment arrangements. The Bill also gives powers to specify by regulation matters which must be included in charges schemes. This power will enable specially targeted protection to be offered to particular categories of vulnerable customers. It is proposed that these powers to give guidance and make regulations will transfer to the National Assembly for Wales in respect of Dwr Cymru and Dee Valley Water. Clause 14 of the Bill will provide for a transfer of functions order to be made under section 22 of the Government of Wales Act 1998, without the need for an affirmative resolution procedure.

 We have received a number of representations, both formal and informal, from a variety of farming organisations and individual farmers during the recent public consultation on the draft Food Standards Bill and associated proposals for a levy scheme. Many criticised the levy proposals and suggested that alternative methods of funding the Agency be found.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90414w16.htm_spnew9"><B> Mr. Rooker </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 13 April 1999]:</i> We received nearly a thousand responses to public consultation on the draft Food Standards Bill and associated proposals for a levy scheme. Over three quarters of these commented directly on the levy proposals. A large majority criticised the proposal that the levy be set at a flat rate, and suggested that alternative methods of funding the Agency be found or that the levy be graduated.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what discussions he had with small retailers prior to drawing up his proposals for the Food Standards Agency; what estimate he has made of the likely cost to each food retailer of the Food Standards Agency over the first five years of its operation; and if he will make a statement.  [80144]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90414w16.htm_spnew10"><B> Mr. Rooker </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 13 April 1999]:</i> Organisations and individuals representing the entire range of interests affected by the Food Standards Agency were included in consultations on Professor James's report in 1997, the subsequent White Paper in 1998 and on the draft Food Standards Bill and associated levy proposals earlier this year. In addition, I have held a number of regional meetings and officials have discussed the possible impact of the draft proposals with organisations representing small businesses.
<P>

<a name="90414w16.htm_para8">The cost to food retailers over the first five years of the Agency's operation will depend on the initial rate of levy set and any amendments made during that period. Our proposal was that the levy should be set at &#163;90 per annum. We are now considering the responses to the consultation. Additional costs due to the exercise of the Agency's functions cannot be anticipated. The draft Bill does, however, require the Agency to take account of the risks, costs and benefits of its proposed actions, consulting interested parties wherever possible.

<a name="90414w17.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 Until August 1990 badger carcases were collected and sampled as part of a national road traffic accident (RTA) survey of badgers.

[80627]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90414w17.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. Rooker </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 13 April 1999]:</i> The Codex Alimentarius Commission is an FAO/WHO--sponsored intergovernmental body charged with the development of food standards to protect the health of consumers and facilitate international trade. The Codex Committee on Nutrition and Foods for Special Dietary Uses has been discussing the elaboration of guidelines for dietary supplements containing vitamins and minerals for a number of years. When the draft guidelines were last discussed in September 1998 the UK argued, as it has done in the past, that maximum limits on the vitamin and mineral content of supplements should only be based on safety considerations. A similar line was taken by a number of other participants. But because there was a general lack of consensus on this, and other aspects of the proposal, little progress was made. The draft guidelines will not now be discussed again until the year 2000.
