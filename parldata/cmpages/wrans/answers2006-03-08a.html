General Synod however has not resolved to disinvest and the Synod&#039;s resolution does not alter the fact that the Church Commissioners have legal responsibility conferred by Parliament to make their own investment decisions.

<p><a name="st_33"><a name="60308w04.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 The Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act 2005 extends the night noise provisions in the Noise Act 1996 to licensed premises. Local authorities will be able to fine those responsible for excess noise from licensed premises between 11 pm and 7 am. Those found responsible for exceeding the permitted level of noise will be liable to a fine of up to 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>8 Mar 2006 : Column 1499W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
&#163;5,000 upon summary conviction. A local authority will be able to offer the responsible person the option to discharge liability to conviction with the payment of a fixed penalty notice of &#163;500 within 14 days. It is planned to bring these provisions into force in the autumn. They will complement the power to close licensed premises on noise grounds introduced by the Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60308w04.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_24">The Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act 2005 also gives local authorities new powers to designate alarm notification areas in which it will be a requirement for those with intruder alarms to register key-holder details with the local authority. Local authorities will be able to contact key-holders in the event that an alarm sounding for 20 minutes continuously or one hour intermittently causes annoyance to those in the vicinity. Local authorities will also be able to enter premises without force, where possible, to deactivate an alarm, and to obtain a warrant to force entry where this is not possible. Silencing misfiring intruder alarms as quickly as possible is particularly important at night. These new powers, which will be commenced in April, are additional to the existing statutory nuisance powers under Part III of the Environmental Protection Act 1990.

<a name="stpa_39">The Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) Regulations 2005 are intended to increase the recovery and recycling of packaging waste.

<a name="60308w05.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_40">Legislation is one way of reducing packaging, but consumers have a part to play. For example, if consumers made a point of choosing goods that are not heavily packaged, or bought &#039;loose&#039; food rather than pre-packaged, or used their own shopping bags or boxes, manufacturers might be encouraged to reduce the quantity of packaging on their products.

 Estimates of the type sought are not normally made or held by Government.

In turn, planning authorities are expected to prepare local development documents that reflect their contribution to delivering the regional spatial strategy. At the regional level, regional technical advisory bodies support the work of regional planning bodies and have a key role in assembling data and information on waste including from the Environment Agency.

Local/European electorate and Parliamentary electorate counts for districts in Gloucestershire can be found in Table 2. The 2004 figures are given for comparison with population estimates and the 2005 figures are the latest available data. It should be noted that the number of people eligible to vote is not the same as the resident population aged 18 and over. There are a number of reasons for this. For example not everyone who is usually resident is entitled to vote (foreign citizens from outside of the EU and Commonwealth, prisoners, etc. are not eligible), some people do not register to vote and people who have more than one address may register in more than one place.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_37">Further, there is inevitably some double counting of the registered electorate as electoral registration officers vary in how quickly they remove people from the registers after they have moved away from an area or after they have died.

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_39">Patient registers include people who are in the country for at least three months, whereas population estimates are based on a usual residence definition requiring a stay of 12 months or more. The patient registers exclude individuals who are ineligible to be registered with a GP. People may be on a patient register after having left the country and not deregistered with their GP; similarly people may have moved to another area and not re-registered. Some patients may have more than one NHS number e.g. they may have been issued a temporary number for a short period. Again, these factors have a differential impact from place to place.</p>

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_41">The most recent population estimates for wards are for mid-2002. The closest available geography to current electoral wards, for which population estimates are available, is Census Area Statistics (CAS) wards. This geography was created for outputs from the 2001 Census and is based mainly on 2003 electoral wards. The CAS ward level population estimates have been published with the status of &quot;experimental statistics&quot;. Therefore, the estimates, and figures derived from them, should be treated with some care. The margin of confidence for population estimates is proportionately larger at ward level than at local authority level.</p>

</ul>
<p>

 As part of the Government&#039;s Climate Change Programme, various policies are in place to promote energy efficiency across the economy, including in the road transport sector where most oil is consumed. These include EU level voluntary agreements with car manufacturers on the fuel efficiency of new cars and company car tax rules. In addition, the Government recently announced the creation of the Renewable Transport Fuels Obligation (RTFO) to introduce renewable fuels into the transport system. The RTFO announcement said that, by 2010, oil companies would be obliged to ensure that 5 per cent. of the fuel that they sell is made from renewable bio-sources.

1. Figures are the total local transport capital allocations (in &#163;000) made for 1998&#150;99 to 2005&#150;06. 1997&#150;98 is not included as some councils&#039; boundaries were changed, abolished or created between 1997&#150;98 and 1998&#150;99.<br>

2. London authorities and the Isles of Scilly council are not included as they are not included in the local transport plan system. The Greater London Authority makes transport capital allocations to London boroughs.<br>

3. Figures for metropolitan areas are county wide and relate to the sum of allocations made to district councils and passenger transport authorities.<br>

4. A few other councils have been combined as they produce joint transport plans.<br>

 This Department has funded research in recent years into different aspects of biofuel production and use, but not detailed consideration of these individual biofuels. Our research has focused instead on the potential environmental and other impacts of significant use of biofuels in the longer term, and on the emissions consequences and economics of various bioethanol and biodiesel blends. We have also contributed to projects being managed by the Low Carbon Vehicle Partnership which are aiming to create the carbon and environmental assurance schemes to underpin the Renewable Transport Fuels obligation. Taken together, this Department&#039;s expenditure on this research amounts to a little under &#163;200,000. Copies of the reports are available via the DfT website (and can be found by following the links to Roads, Roads and Vehicles, Vehicles, and Vehicles and the Environment).

Defra has published various research reports on the environmental and other impacts of biofuel production in the UK. All of these reports are available via their respective websites.

 I have placed a copy of the Buncefield Investigation Progress Report in the Library. The report describes the incident of 11 December 2005 and the response to it. It sets out what the investigation has determined so far about the likely nature of the explosions and fire that occurred, but contains no conclusions about how they occurred. This information is not yet available. The investigation is continuing its work to identify the root causes of the incident, including establishing exactly how the flammable mixture that gave rise to the explosions was able to form. Further information will be published as it emerges from the investigation.

Notes:<br>

1. An application is defined as cleared if a maintenance calculation has been carried out and a maintenance collection method has been set up and agreed with the non resident parent; a case has been identified as being subject to a reduced benefit decision, claiming good cause, as a change of circumstances to an existing case, as opposed to a new application, or has been closed.<br>

2. Cases in which a maintenance direct arrangement has been facilitated have been included in addition to first payments of maintenance via the collection service, as the former also represent a positive outcome generated for the parent with care by the agency.<br>

3. Figures are rounded to the nearest thousand.<br>
