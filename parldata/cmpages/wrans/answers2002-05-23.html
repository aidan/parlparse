10. <a name="20523w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Wray: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills if she will require local education authorities to implement an asthma policy; and if she will remind them of her Department's 1996 guidelines for supporting children with medical needs in schools.  [56353]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20523w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 We encourage all local education authorities and schools in England to have policies for supporting pupils' medical conditions, including asthma. We reminded them in the spring of the importance of following our guidelines.

<P>
11. <a name="20523w01.html_wqn1"><B> Dr. Cable: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills how standard spending assessments for education take into account the impact of large movements of pupils with differing needs across local authority boundaries.  [56355]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20523w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 The current system allocates extra funding for additional needs on the basis of where pupils are educated, rather than where they live. We are currently working on a new funding system for introduction in 2003&#150;04. Our aim is for the new system to be fairer and clearer, and justified by the educational needs of children. We want it to be child and school based, taking into account cross-LEA boundary migration.

<P>
13. <a name="20523w01.html_wqn2"><B> Chris Grayling: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what impact the increased national insurance contributions announced in the Budget will have on special needs schools.  [56358]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20523w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 The cost to all special schools in England will be around &#163;6 million a year from 2003&#150;04. This cost will be considered along side other priorities and pressures in the 2002 spending review.

<P>
9. <a name="20523w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Peter Duncan: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills pursuant to her answer to the hon. Member for Epsom and Ewell (Chris Grayling) of 29 April 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, column 571W, how much the increases in national insurance announced in the Budget will cost the average <i>(a)</i> primary and <i>(b)</i> secondary school, expressed on a cost per pupil basis.  [56352]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20523w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 On average, the changes will cost about &#163;15 per primary school pupil and about &#163;20 per secondary school pupil in England from 2003&#150;04. These costs will be considered as part of this year's Spending Review alongside other priorities and pressures.

14. <a name="20523w01.html_wqn4"><B> Phil Hope: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what action she is taking to improve the quality of and resources for the Youth Service.  [56359]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20523w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 Under the Government's "Transforming Youth Work" agenda we will publish later this year our view of an adequate and sufficient' Youth Service. In the longer term this will be supported by the introduction of National Quality Standards, National Performance Measures, a Common Planning Framework, a new National Management Training Programme, and a Workforce Development Strategy. In addition we have provided &#163;49 million to Youth Services over the next two years to support this agenda.

15. <a name="20523w01.html_wqn5"><B> Dr. Evan Harris: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what plans the Government have to provide more financial support for medical students in higher education, with particular regard to graduate entrants.  [56360]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20523w01.html_spnew5"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 There are special arrangements for both undergraduate and graduate medical students. Students on undergraduate courses pay no tuition fees in year five and later years and become eligible for means- tested NHS bursaries and reduced-rate income contingent student loans made on generous terms. Students undertaking the four year graduate entry programme have the same enhanced support in years two to four. In the other years medical students are eligible for DfES student support on the same basis as other students.

 We have provided extensive support to schools including funding for over 1,050 Learning Support Units for disruptive pupils, guidance on discipline and exclusion policies, and guidance on developing effective anti-bullying strategies.
<P>

<a name="20523w01.html_para0">In addition, the &#163;66 million made available through this year's Budget will fund a programme of focused support for schools in the 34 LEAs facing the toughest challenges of behaviour and criminality.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20523w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 Recurrent funding for schools is channelled through local education authorities and is made up of Education Standard Spending, the Standards Fund, the Schools Standards Grant and other special grants.
<P>

<a name="20523w01.html_para1">Education Standard Spending is the amount the Government consider appropriate for local authorities to spend on education from their total budgets and is not ring-fenced for specific purposes or activities. In addition, the School Standards Grant is paid to schools to be used by them as they wish to raise standards.
<P>

<a name="20523w01.html_para2">LEAs and schools receive Standards Fund Grant for particular specific purposes and activities such as the literacy and numeracy strategies. Other special grants are paid to schools to support payments to teachers passing the threshold and performance pay for teachers. Schools also receive funding via education action zones for particular purposes. Taken together these account for 11.7 per cent. of recurrent education funding for LEAs and schools. Of this, around half is devolved to schools from the Standards Fund for them to spend on their own priorities within the broad objectives of the Standards Fund programme.
<P>

<a name="20523w01.html_para3">Capital funding for schools is provided through a combination of credit approvals, Government grant, and through the Private Finance Initiative. Around 45 per cent. of capital funding is allocated for specific purposes or activities.

<P>
31. <a name="20523w01.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Hendry: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what extra funding she has made available to schools with classes of 8, 9 and 10-year- olds containing more than 30 children in the last 12 months.  [56376]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20523w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 In 2001&#150;02 we made up to &#163;73 million available to local education authorities to make progress on class sizes at Key Stage 2. We estimate that this has paid for around 500 additional teachers and 500 new classrooms.

<P>
19. <a name="20523w01.html_wqn10"><B> Mrs. Curtis-Thomas: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills if she will make a statement on the measures that she has taken to increase the number of young people taking AS and A-level mathematics.  [56364]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20523w01.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 Because post-16 education is not compulsory, the Government is not able to promote an individual subject at the expense of others. But we are keen to see that students take on a broader range of subjects, mixing science and art subjects, including mathematics. To encourage this, we have made available additional funding to schools and colleges.

<a name="20523w01.html_sbhd9"><H4><center>Centres of Vocational Excellence</center></H4>


<P>
20. <a name="20523w01.html_wqn11"><B> Barbara Follett: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills if she will make a statement on the new centres of vocational excellence.  [56365]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20523w01.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 On 29 April we announced new money to fund an extra 100 centres of vocational excellence. Centres of vocational excellence will develop new, and enhance existing, excellent vocational provision which is focused on meeting the skills needs of employers, nationally, regionally and locally.




<P>
<P><I>23 May 2002 : Column 456W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="20523w01.html_para4">An additional &#163;57 million is being invested into extending the centres of vocational excellence programme beyond our existing commitment to create centres of vocational excellence in half of all general further education colleges by 2004. The money, &#163;40 million of which is new resource from the Capital Modernisation Fund announced in the Budget, will fund an extra 50 centres in colleges and an additional 50 centres of vocational excellence based in organisations beyond the further education sector, such as private or voluntary training providers.
<P>

<a name="20523w01.html_para5">For the first time, we are inviting training providers outside the further education sector to become involved in the programme. These new centres will help us harness the valuable experience that many in the private and voluntary training sectors possess and is a direct response to the positive feedback we received for this proposal in our consultation.
<P>

<a name="20523w01.html_para6">We have made excellent progress to date. The first 16 centres are up and running and beginning to deliver excellent results across a range of industries. A further 70 have just been established and the first non-college centres of vocational excellence come on stream later this month. By March 2004 there will be 250 centres of vocational excellence making a vital contribution to increasing the nation's vocational skills and productivity.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what assessment she has made of the results from the inspections of further education colleges in the last 12 months.  [56366]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20523w02.html_spnew0"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 Of the 93 college inspections carried out to date under the new regime, results have been published for 44 colleges. There have been some good results, but there is still some way to go to achieve consistent quality.

<P>
30. <a name="20523w02.html_wqn1"><B> Simon Hughes: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what recent representations she has received about funding and other support for further education colleges.  [56375]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20523w02.html_spnew1"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 Ministers have received extensive recent representations about funding and other support for further education. In particular, the Association of Colleges, NATFHE, the NUS and others organised a lobby of Parliament on 23 April on the issues of further education funding, pay and support. We are listening carefully to the views of those in the further education sector and will take these into account in determining how best to use the 2002 spending review settlement.

<P>
12. <a name="20523w02.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Clifton-Brown: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills if she will make a statement on funding for further education.  [56356]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20523w02.html_spnew2"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 The Government are steadily increasing investment in further education. By next year funding for further education will have risen by 26 per cent. in real terms since 1997. The Learning and Skills Council's funding rates for programmes delivered by further education colleges are increasing by 2.5 per cent. above current rate of inflation for the 2002&#150;03 academic year. 



<P>
<P><I>23 May 2002 : Column 457W</I><P>
Beyond this we are looking to the current spending review to deliver the resources needed to meet the Government's ambitions for further education.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20523w02.html_spnew3"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 Five Trailblazer sector skills councils were announced in December 2001 covering audio visual industries, land-based industries, apparel, footwear and textiles, oil and gas extraction, chemicals manufacturing and petroleum industries and the retail sector. Four Trailblazer sector skills councils have received two-year licences, the fifth should follow shortly. The Sector Skills Development Agency is expected to call for formal expressions of interest to establish new sector skills councils in the next few weeks.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20523w02.html_spnew5"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 The latest data published by the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service show that the number of applications is 1.5 per cent. higher than last year. This is very welcome and indicates the strength of demand for British higher education. The 4.6 per cent. rise in applications from mature entrants is particularly welcome since we have introduced generous additional support for student parents, including a child care grant and a travel and equipment grant.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what guidelines she issues on ensuring that parents do not come under inappropriate pressure to enrol their children in reception classes before they are ready.  [56370]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20523w02.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 The code of practice on school admissions says that admission authorities can offer places in reception classes to parents before their children are of compulsory school age (e.g. five), but also that parents accepting the offer can ask to defer their child's entry until he or she is of compulsory school age, provided the place is taken up within the same academic year.

 The Department has commissioned Professor Alan Smithers and Dr. Pamela Robinson, from the university of Liverpool, Centre for Education and Employment Research to undertake research into this issue. The study is gathering information from a nationally representative survey of teachers leaving the profession about the factors affecting their decisions to leave teaching. The research commenced in December 2001 and we expect the report to be published in March 2003.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20523w02.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 Officials in the Department's Special Educational Needs Division support local education authorities in raising standards in meeting special educational needs through offering guidance, drawing on expertise provided by educational advisers, building consultants, members of the Office for Standards in Education, officials in other Government Departments and voluntary organisations. Education standard spending assessment support for local education authorities for 2002&#150;03 totalled &#163;23.68 billion, an increase of nearly &#163;1.2 billion compared with 2001&#150;02. By 2003&#150;04 average recurrent funding per pupil will have increased by over &#163;760 in real terms since 1997&#150;98. In addition &#163;91 million was available from the Department's Standards Fund for special educational needs for 2002&#150;03. This represents more than a fivefold increase compared with the &#163;17 million available in 1997&#150;98.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what the mandate of the Socrates Committee (and Erasmus and Comenius Subcommittees) is; how many times it has met over the last 12 months; what the UK representation on it is; what the annual cost of its work is to public funds; if she will list the items currently under its consideration; if she will take steps to increase its accountability and transparency to Parliament; and if she will make a statement.  [56717]<P>

second phase of the Socrates programme. The Socrates Committee has met formally three times over the last 12 months, with an additional informal meeting in May 2002. The sub-committees for schools and higher education have met twice each. Two officials from the UK attend the Socrates Committee meetings, and one official usually attends the sub-committee meetings. Travel expenses were met from Commission resources. The subsistence and travelling costs incurred by this Department was about &#163;8,485.00, for the committee and sub-committee meetings over the past twelve months, of which about &#163;4,860 was reimbursed by the Commission.
<P>

<a name="20523w03.html_para2">The next Socrates Committee meeting will consider approval of the selection of projects for 2002&#150;03, a discussion of the programme budget, the monitoring and evaluation of the programme, and EC and general educational initiatives impacting on the programme. The Schools sub-committee will consider the allocation of funds to the Comenius action for schools. The next meeting of the higher education sub-committee is expected to be in the autumn. An agenda will not be available until nearer the time, but it is likely to cover various aspects of Erasmus, the higher education part of the Socrates programme, and EC and general initiatives impacting on higher education.
<P>

<a name="20523w03.html_para3">Together with member states, the Commission is currently conducting a review to bring existing legislation on the conduct of comitology committees into line with Council Decision 1999/468/EC, to "simplify the requirements for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission". As an obligation to this Decision, the Commission undertook to publish an annual report on the working of committees. The first report was deposited in the Libraries of both Houses on 26 February 2002 (Com (2001) 783 Final). As part of the review process, the UK Government have encouraged the Commission to produce and maintain an electronic database of every comitology committee, its agendas and recent actions, to be accessible through its website.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20523w03.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 Dealing with children and young people who sexually abuse requires contributions from different agencies&#151;covering youth justice, child welfare, education and health, including child and adolescent mental health services. The response to these children and young people should take place within the framework of guidance set out in "Working Together to Safeguard Children", issued in December 1999 by the Department of Health, the Home Office and the Department for Education and Employment.
<P>

<a name="20523w03.html_para4">The Department for Education and Skills has made available to schools on request a guidance pack entitled "Bullying: don't suffer in silence" which is intended to help Headteachers in fulfilling their duty to draw up measures to prevent all forms of bullying among pupils. The pack refers to bullying which is sexual in nature and it sets out some suggested strategies to deal with such behaviour. It also mentions that a proven sexual assault is likely to lead to the exclusion from the school of the perpetrator. However, we recognise that excluded pupils often need further help in managing their behaviour from personnel such as Education Welfare Officers or Educational Psychologists.

 <i>[holding answer 22 May 2002]:</i> The guidance "Working Together to Safeguard Children", issued jointly by the Home Office, the Department for Education and Skills and the Department of Health in December 1999, sets out the role of statutory agencies in responding to young abusers.
<P>

<a name="20523w03.html_para5">In addition to collaborative working at the individual case level, there is also ongoing contact between schools, social services and criminal justice agencies at the strategic level, through local Area Child Protection Committees.
<P>

<a name="20523w03.html_para6">All schools should be aware of local child protection policies, (as required by DfEE Circular 10&#150;95) and should designate a member of staff to be responsible for child protection issues&#151;including children who sexually abuse other young people. In cases of suspected abuse, the designated staff member should inform social services.
<P>

<a name="20523w03.html_para7">To ensure that all information sharing arrangements between schools and social services complies with the requirements of the Data Protection Act 1998, the Circular includes a checklist provided by the then Data Protection Registrar (now the Information Commissioner).

 The dyslexia, dyspraxia and attention deficit (DDAT) treatment is one of a number of commercially available programmes of help designed to support children with specific learning difficulties.

<a name="20523w04.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 Only statistics on permanent exclusions from school are collected centrally. The statistical first release on exclusions published this morning shows that there were 9,210 permanent exclusions from school in England in the 2000&#150;01 school year. Our priority now is to provide suitable full time education for permanently excluded pupils and we have a public service agreement target to ensure that all local education authorities offer this by September 2002.

It is important that schools are properly licensed, and most suppliers will offer substantial discounts to schools. This applies both to new, second hand or reconditioned computers.

<a name="20523w06.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. McNamara: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how many violent incidents involving <i>(a)</i> injury and <i>(b)</i> death of Her Majesty's forces personnel stationed or present at the Deepcut barracks have been (i) reported in the past eight years to the army medical services and (ii) sent on for treatment at a local hospital; and if he will make a statement.  [56698]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20523w06.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 There have been four deaths at Deepcut resulting from gunshot wounds over the last eight years. It is not possible to provide details of the number of injuries as, due to differing reporting criteria for sickness and injuries in the past, these data are unreliable. This shortcoming is being addressed.
<P>

<a name="20523w06.html_para10">Since 1 January 1995, 28 personnel from 25 Training Support Regiment, Royal Logistics Corps, Deepcut, have appeared before court-martial as a result of violent incidents. In addition, a further 41 soldiers have been dealt with summarily as a result of their involvement in such incidents since October 2000, the date from which central recording of summary dealing statistics began. It is not readily possible, however, to determine whether these incidents resulted in injury and/or death and, consequently, whether the Army medical services or local hospitals were involved in providing any treatment.

<a name="20523w07.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The QinetiQ information memorandum contains details about QinetiQ's business, including future commercial plans, and is therefore commercial-in- confidence. It was prepared solely for the use of bidders to aid them in the preparation of their indicative bids for a share of the business. In accordance with normal practice, these parties were required to sign confidentiality agreements before the information memorandum was sent to them. Publishing the document more widely would not be in the interests of a successful QinetiQ transaction and would risk damaging value for the taxpayer. I am, therefore, withholding the information requested under Exemption 13 of the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information.

 As part of the Government's Wider Markets Initiative, RAF Strike Command is considering the feasibility for the exploitation of irreducible spare capacity on its airfields, which may include use by scheduled service operators. The primacy of military operations will not be diluted as a result of commercial activity. No formal proposals have been put forward by airline companies for the operation of scheduled services from RAF Leuchars. No Ministry of Defence Minister or official has met representatives of commercial airline companies to discuss the operation of scheduled services from RAF Leuchars, however, consultants advising the RAF have sought the views of the airline operator community. It is Ministry of Defence policy to consult fully and openly with representatives from relevant local and regional councils when examining the feasibility of any regular commercial airline activity at RAF bases.

<a name="20523w07.html_spnew7"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 As I made clear on 26 February 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, column 1139W, to the hon. Member for North Essex (Mr. Jenkin) the June 2002 In-Service-Date for Eurofighter was becoming increasingly challenging to achieve. Although good progress has been made by industry, with the first three instrumented production aircraft achieving successful first flights in early April, delays in bringing the detailed design to full maturity in some areas prevented the flight test programme from starting on time. Following a thorough review of the programme involving the partner nations, the NATO agency responsible for undertaking the procurement, and industry, we have jointly concluded that acceptance of the first aircraft into service should be delayed, to take place by the end of this year, and we shall plan on that basis. We shall now be working hard with industry to recover lost time and achieve the planned Operational Employment Date in the second half of the decade, thus avoiding any gap in front-line capability or extra costs to the Ministry of Defence. The delays are disappointing but reflect the complexity of the project and the major advance in technology it represents. Initial flights of the instrumented production aircraft have been impressive and the Government remain fully committed to this contribution to the United Kingdom's military capability.

<a name="20523w08.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 The Oslo and Paris convention of 1992 (OSPAR) provides for the protection of the marine environment of the north-east Atlantic. Under the convention the UK has adopted OSPAR Decision 98/3 which provides a regime for the decommissioning of oil and gas installations and effectively prohibits sea disposal. There is a presumption that installations on the UK continental shelf will be brought back to shore for reuse, recycling or final disposal on land. However, the OSPAR Decision recognises that there may be difficulty in removing the "footings" of large steel jackets weighing more than 10,000 tonnes and in removing concrete installations. As a result derogations may be granted in these cases if the internationally agreed assessment and consultation process shows that leaving such installations wholly or partly in place is justifiable. If a derogation is granted, the permit will specify who will be liable for the

remains and require suitable monitoring and management measures to prevent or mitigate any adverse consequences to both the environment and other users of the sea.
<P>

<a name="20523w08.html_para4">In the UK, to ensure the orderly decommissioning of all installations, including those subject to derogation from the OSPAR decision, the decommissioning of each installation is addressed within a decommissioning programme. The programme assesses the potential decommissioning solutions and determines the most appropriate disposal option by balancing safety, the environment, impact on other users of the sea, technical feasibility and economics. The programme must be approved by the Secretary of State under the Petroleum Act 1998.

<P>

<a name="20523w08.html_para5">On 17 January the Government and the schemes' trustees made a joint statement agreeing a review of the arrangements for the Government's guarantee of basic retirement benefits for the members of the schemes. It was agreed that the review should explore how changes in circumstances since 1994, when British Coal was privatised, might best be reflected in revisions to the guarantee arrangements which would benefit members. In doing so, the trustees and the Government recognised that any revisions will need to be based on an equitable sharing of risk and reward between the schemes and the Exchequer, and will need to be sufficiently robust to operate satisfactorily in a wide range of conditions.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry when she will announce her decision on London Waste Ltd.'s application to extend the Edmonton energy-from-waste power station.  [59158]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20523w09.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 I have today decided that consent under section 36 of the Electricity Act 1989 to London Waste Ltd.'s application cannot be given. The extension would have an annual throughput of waste of around 285,000 tonnes over and above the existing station's capacity of 550,000 tonnes per annum.
<P>

<a name="20523w09.html_para5">In deciding not to grant consent I have taken into account the hierarchy for the treatment of waste set out in the Government's Waste Strategy 2000. Our policy is that waste should be minimised and recycling and composting undertaken before energy from waste is considered. I have considered all the information placed before me, both for and against the extension, and have concluded that the existing station is large enough to deal with the North London Waste Authority's (NLWA) residual waste after recycling. To grant consent for the extension would result in a station with an overall capacity capable of handling all of NLWA's municipal waste and could mean that the NLWA had little incentive to do more recycling over and above the minimum required by statute. Also should the NLWA meet or better its recycling targets then this would lead to a shortfall in the waste stream for the extended station and could lead to waste being imported from other areas which would be contrary to the Proximity Principal whereby waste should be treated as near to its origin as possible.
<P>

<a name="20523w09.html_para6">I have also considered the measures the applicant has undertaken to incorporate at the Edmonton site to encourage recycling, composting and using heat for local district heating schemes. While these measures are to be welcomed I am aware that previous ones of a similar type in the site have been closed or not utilised. I am of the opinion they are not sufficient to justify granting consent to the extension. Indeed should such measures prove successful then there would appear to me to be less justification for the need for the extension.
<P>

<a name="20523w09.html_para7">In refusing consent I should make it clear that the Government are not against energy-from-waste stations where they are clearly required and properly sized. The requirement of our policy is that statutory recycling targets must be met and that no incineration proposal shall be permitted which will pre-empt recycling or reduce the option for recycling for the future.

 The Landfill Directive, requires significant reductions in the amount of biodegradable municipal waste landfilled to 75 per cent. of that produced in 1995 by 2006, 50 per cent. by 2009 and 35 per cent. by 2016 (although countries such as the UK may use, if they wish, a derogation of up to four years for meeting each of these targets). To help achieve this, "Waste Strategy 2000" set targets for recycling and composting of household waste. In 2001 the Government set statutory performance standards for each local authority in England, which require them to double the overall recycling and composting rate by 2003&#150;04 and treble it by 2005&#150;06 over 1998&#150;99 levels.
<P>

<a name="20523w10.html_para3">The Government strongly support composting as a way of disposing of biodegradable waste, and believes it has an important role to play.

"Waste Strategy 2000" (Part 2) indicates that 21 per cent. of household waste may be putrescible, while some 62 per cent. in total may be biodegradable. These proportions may vary seasonally (depending on green waste for example) and according to the amount of waste separated for recycling and home composting.

<a name="20523w10.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The Government strongly support composting as a way of treating biodegradable waste, improving soil quality and replacing non-renewable products such as peat. We are actively encouraging the composting of green waste&#151;at home, at municipal civic amenity and community composting sites and when separately collected by local authorities. Guidance on composting, including on safety issues, is produced by the Environment Agency.
<P>

<a name="20523w10.html_para7">To support composting activity, the 2000 spending review allocated &#163;220 million Private Finance Initiative funding for waste management that can be used to deliver increased recycling/composting rates. It also established a new &#163;140 million household waste and recycling fund to help local authorities meet their statutory performance standards for recycling and composting.
<P>

<a name="20523w10.html_para8">Although animal health legislation currently prohibits the land spreading of composted kitchen/catering waste which might contain meat, we have commissioned a risk assessment to assess the risks to public, animal and plant health from such compost. In the light of that assessment, we will review the legislation.
<P>

<a name="20523w10.html_para9">The Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) are currently working with the Composting Association to develop the existing industry standard for compost, to achieve British Standards Institute (BSI) accreditation. The delivery of these accredited industry standards for compost will help to create markets for organic waste derived products. The creation of these new markets will be relevant to the retail sector when considering whether composting has a part to play in its waste management strategy (bearing in mind the present legal requirements).
<P>

<a name="20523w10.html_para10">"Waste Strategy 2000" places composting high in the hierarchy of preferred waste management options, and set targets for England and Wales to recycle or compost at least 25 per cent. of household waste by 2005. This national target is backed up by statutory targets for each local authority in England for 2003&#150;04 and 2005&#150;06, and the 2000 spending review identified substantial additional resources to help deliver the statutory performance standards on recycling and composting.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20523w11.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 Following a European study (the first Eurohazcon study) published in 1998 that reported a 33 per cent. higher rate of non-chromosomal anomalies among people living near hazardous waste sites, the Government commissioned a programme of work on 



<P>
<P><I>23 May 2002 : Column 491W</I><P>
health effects of landfill sites including a much more extensive national study by the Small Area Health Statistics Unit (SAHSU); this was published in the summer 2001.
<P>

<a name="20523w11.html_para1">The SAHSU study found that 80 per cent. of the population lives within 2 kilometres of a landfill site (operational or closed). The SAHSU study looked at the rates of all birth defects (chromosomal and non- chromosomal) and found only a slightly higher rate (1 per cent.) in populations living near landfill sites and a 7 per cent. higher rate near hazardous waste sites. The Government's expert advisory committee, the Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment, noted that this excess risk was small and could be accounted for by factors other than the landfill sites. The study has not shown, nor indeed could it show, a causal link between landfill sites and birth defects.
<P>

<a name="20523w11.html_para2">Earlier this year a second Eurohazcon study was published. The study investigated the rates of certain birth defects (chromosomal anomalies) around 23 European hazardous waste landfill sites, including 12 sites in Great Britain. It found a 41 per cent. higher rate of chromosomal anomalies close to sites (0 to 3km) compared to further away (3 to 7km).
<P>

<a name="20523w11.html_para3">The major difference between the two studies is the scale. The Eurohazcon study looked at populations around 23 landfills spread right across Europe, whereas the SAHSU study looked at populations within 2km of 9,565 sites (80 per cent. of the British population) of which 774 were known to take hazardous waste. The SAHSU study was therefore much more comprehensive. As such the results are less likely to be skewed by the pattern of birth defects surrounding any individual landfill site.
<P>

<a name="20523w11.html_para4">Both the SAHSU and Eurohazcon reports have recommended further work and DEFRA, the Department of Health and the Environment Agency have a considerable amount of work planned or under way. A great deal is already known about the general make-up of gases that are emitted from landfill sites. However, better information is needed on the substances present in very low concentrations in landfill emissions and the levels of exposure experienced by people living near to landfills. To obtain this information, research is currently under way to analyse over 12 months the emissions from municipal landfills. This monitoring study will provide information on which to make a more informed assessment of the likelihood of landfill sites posing a risk to health. The work will be completed next summer and published as soon as possible thereafter.
<P>

<a name="20523w11.html_para5">This Department hosted a seminar on 15 May 2002 to consider where there are gaps in the research on health impacts of all waste management options and to help prioritise future research. There are no risk-free options but conducting such research will allow local authorities and others to make more informed choices about the range, type and location of facility they wish to operate.

 The role of the Advisory Committee is to assist the Commission with matters on which it is required to take a decision under the provisions of the directive such as reviewing the progress of member states and on the format of reports. There was one meeting of the committee over the last 12 months at which the UK was represented by an official from my Department. That meeting considered the format of reports required under the directive; there are no matters currently under consideration. The annual cost of the work includes the time taken to prepare for and attend meetings and the travel and subsistence costs incurred.

 Provisions relating to the lowest height at which aircraft may fly are contained in the Rules of the Air Regulations 1996 (Statutory Instrument 1996 No. 1393). These are made under the Air Navigation Order and reflect internationally agreed safety standards and recommended practices. The Rules apply to all flights.

<a name="20523w13.html_para4">In addition some airports apply their own local restrictions within the immediate vicinity of the airport (normally within the local traffic circuit) for noise abatement purposes.

The Aviation Health Working Group was established to advise Ministers on all issues relating to aviation health.

 Hon. Members were informed on 19 March of the Commission's wish to improve the arrangements to provide high quality tours for constituents and other visitors to the Palace, and its view that there should be a single official tours organisation supporting both the permanent Summer Opening and tours at other times. The Commission felt that this was an important part of its strategic aim to increase public understanding and knowledge of the House and its work.
<P>

<a name="20523w16.html_para1">At its meeting on 20 May the Commission considered the advice of the Administration Committee and the Board of Management on the way forward.

<P>

<a name="20523w16.html_para2">The House of Lords has an equal interest in visitor tours. We have sought the views of the authorities of that House on the improvements we would like to see, and will be working closely with them on the details.

<P>

<a name="20523w16.html_para3">We think it is important that Members should have the same freedom and flexibility to arrange tours for their constituents as is now the case, but we believe that there is scope for improvement. We decided that:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>for the convenience of Members and their staff, the tours office should be a "one-stop shop", making bookings, issuing permits and allocating guides, and that funds should be provided for this in the current financial year. We thought that the separate, well-understood system for allocating Gallery tickets should remain unchanged, and that the separately organised Summer Opening primarily for tourists should not be affected;
<P>
<BR>
informal visits of six people or fewer accompanied by Members, Peers, or Officers of either House, or four people accompanied by other permanent passholders, should continue as at present. The ability of Members, their staff, and staff of the House to guide their own larger parties should they wish would be unaffected;
<P>
<BR>
in the interests of fairness, unguided and unaccompanied visits should be discontinued;
<P>
<BR>
guides should be drawn primarily from staff of the House, who have given excellent service over a number of years; and that staff from all House Departments should be given the opportunity to contribute. We supported the idea of a guiding qualification that would help maintain high standards and encourage House staff to take part;
<P>
<BR>
tours should emphasise the role and work of the House just as much as the history and the heritage of the building.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="20523w16.html_para4">We thought that the new arrangements should begin to operate from the beginning of the next Session of Parliament, although some aspects (for example the guiding qualification) will need to be phased in over a longer period of time. We were also conscious of the restrictions that possible changes in sitting times of this House might impose on access. In order not to reduce the total number of visitors who are able to come to the House, Saturday opening may be an option.
<P>

<a name="20523w16.html_para5">We had well in mind the need to ensure that the costs to visitors are kept as low as possible, especially in the interests of groups such as school parties and old age pensioners. We have asked the Finance and Services Committee to look at possible cost structures and to report to us for our next meeting. We have also asked the Board of Management now to develop a detailed implementation plan.
<P>

<a name="20523w16.html_para6">The views of Members, their staff and staff of the House will be a welcome contribution to the development of the new arrangements. They should be sent to the Serjeant at Arms as the member of the Board of Management responsible for this project.

 <i>[holding answer 21 May 2002]:</i> The financial directions issued to Lottery distributing bodies require them to devise and abide by a procedure for handling potential conflicts of interest which may arise in the evaluation of applications by the body or individual members of that body. The directions also deal with the avoidance of actual or perceived conflicts when bodies solicit Lottery applications; and with conflicts which might arise in connection with applications from companies or persons which the distributing body owns, controls or is able materially to influence.

 No. The Government believe that, at present, the television licence fee retains distinct advantages over the possible alternative methods for funding the BBC. We have therefore made clear that the licence fee will remain the main source of BBC funding at least until the expiry of the BBC's current royal charter at the end of 2006. Future funding arrangements will need to be considered as part of the charter review process, which will commence in 2004.

 A World bank led team has recently completed a damage assessment. We have been fully involved in that process, including discussions about potential funding opportunities. Initial indications are that at least $150 million&#151;out of an estimated total cost of $360 million&#151;will be readily available for urgent priority repairs. We are currently discussing with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian refugees the provision of long term technical assistance to support the rebuilding of the Jenin refugee camp.

 The situation for internally displaced people in Burma remains extremely vulnerable.

As applications to the Council of Europe Secretariat take some time, Japan will not have acceded to the Convention in time for the World Cup 2002.

 Approximately 60,000 Nagorno- Karabakh Armenians were displaced by the Azeris during the heaviest part of the fighting in 1991&#150;92. 35,000 have since returned. The displaced Armenian population was largely from the Shahumian and Madakaert regions. During the same period, a large number (approximately 800,000) of Azeris were also displaced from Nagorno-Karabakh. We are not aware of any forced movement of population on either side of the line of control since the ceasefire in 1994.

<P>
<a name="20523w20.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 We have a Public Service Agreement with the Treasury that we conduct 90 per cent. of settlement interviews within a target time of 12 weeks. However, in practice applicants who apply to our visa section in Kinshasa on a Monday morning are usually interviewed on Tuesday and Wednesday; those who apply on a Wednesday morning, when the visa section opens again, are interviewed on Thursday, or the following Monday. The section would therefore expect to interview the spouse of a British national applying for settlement within three working days. Normally, a decision on the application would immediately follow this interview.

 The Government have played a leading role in the EU and the UN in pressing for substantive political change in Burma.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20523w20.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Exact figures are not available as international access to many of the conflict areas is restricted or prevented by the military authorities. Recent UN estimates have indicated that up to 600,000 Burmese may be internally displaced.
<P>

<a name="20523w20.html_para7">It is even more difficult to gauge the number of people who have been killed as a result of fighting with the military authorities. That human rights abuses continue in Burma is not in doubt. The United Nations Commission on Human Rights adopted a consensus resolution on Burma in April sponsored by the EU, which detailed the scale of the problem and expressed its continuing grave concern.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20523w20.html_spnew14"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The ethnic minorities in Burma suffer disproportionately due to the misrule of the Burmese authorities. The violence inflicted on the Karen, the Karenni and the Shan is on-going. The intensity of the fighting fluctuates, in part due to the climate of Burma, particularly the monsoon. We have consistently pressed the regime to move ahead on national reconciliation and urged all sides to resolve their differences through peaceful dialogue.

 We take every opportunity to impress upon the Burmese regime our deep concern about their treatment of the Karen and other ethnic minorities in Burma, including through our ambassador in Rangoon and visiting officials.

We have also drawn our concerns to the attention of the UN Special Rapporteur for Human Rights in Burma and the UN Secretary-General's Special Envoy to Burma.

 EC Regulation 310/2002 of 18 February 2002 places inter alia an embargo on sale or supply to Zimbabwe of equipment which might be used for internal repression. Annex II of that Regulation contains an agreed EC list of equipment subject to the embargo. This list was originally established in the context of EC Regulation 926/98 of 27 April 1998 which placed inter alia an embargo on the sale or supply to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia of equipment which might be used for internal repression or terrorism. "Electronic jamming equipment especially designed to prevent the detonation by radio remote control of improvised devices and specially designed components therefor" was included in the list annexed to Regulation 926/98 because of the potential for such equipment being used in countering anti-terrorism measures.

 The intention of Housing Benefit regulation 7(1)(h) is to halt the abuse of the scheme where an owner-occupier transfers ownership of his or her home without money changing hands, or sells it for less than the market price, and then rents it back.
<P>

<a name="20523w22.html_para1">Housing Benefit is still available to anyone who can demonstrate that he or she was forced to transfer or sell, for example because of impending repossession for mortgage arrears. A further amendment, from May 2001, allows a former owner to claim Housing Benefit provided five years have elapsed since he or she ceased to own the property.
<P>

1. Figures are taken from local authority management information returns. It is possible that there could be some double counting with Benefits Agency data if there were cases which involved a joint prosecution.<P>

2. Information is not available for all 408 local authorities. The total for Great Britain includes estimates for local authorities that have not responded. These estimates are based on historical and regional data. This type of estimate is standard practice in reporting totals where there have been non-respondents. The figures for financial years 1997&#150;98 to 2000&#150;01 have been rounded to two significant figures.<P>

3. Administrative penalties, as an alternative to prosecution, were introduced by the Social Security Administration (Fraud) Act (1997) with effect from December 1998. <P>

1. The estimates are from the Family Resources Survey 1999&#150;00 and are rounded to the nearest 10,000 or 1 per cent. As with data from any survey, these estimates should not be treated as exact as they are subject to sampling error. This is the latest year for which results are available and the survey covers Great Britain.<P>

2. The Family Resources Survey does not include information on pensioners living in residential care or nursing homes.<P>

3. Gross weekly income is at July 1999 prices.<P>

4. Single pensioners are defined as single (non-cohabiting) people aged 60 or over. Pensioner couples are defined as couples (married or co-habiting) where either partner is aged 60 or over. This differs from the definition used in the Pensioners' Incomes Series (singles over state pension age (65 and over for men, 60 and over for women) and couples where the man is over state pension age). <P>

And the branches which make up the network should have a sounder commercial basis upon which to develop customer service.

 The Pension Service will provide a modern, efficient and customer focused service for both today's and future pensioners. It will play a crucial role in our aim to tackle pensioner poverty. We are committed to encouraging pensioners to claim their full entitlements. We have already conducted a very successful minimum income guarantee (MIG) campaign which resulted in an extra 134,000 pensioners making successful claims to MIG receiving on average an extra &#163;20 a week.
<P>

<a name="20523w24.html_para1">We are continuing to look at more effective ways of encouraging eligible pensioners to claim the MIG. Initiatives include:

<P>

<a name="20523w24.html_para3">Additionally, we will:

<P>
<BR>
Use "trigger" questions which identify customers who have a match with one or more predetermined 'key life events' that may indicate a potential entitlement to MIG, for example, when customers aged 60 and over receive a new award of one or more benefits, such as attendance allowance, industrial injuries benefit or housing benefit.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20523w24.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. McCartney: </B> 
 There has been a long-term decline in the coverage of final salary pension schemes, which has accelerated as a result of increased longevity and the recent fall in the stock markets. Many companies have had to consider the financial impact on their business of continuing to run a final salary scheme for all employees.
<P>

<a name="20523w24.html_para7">Employers should take a long-term view of pensions, rather than basing their decisions on short-term considerations. Where employers do change their pension schemes, we believe that they have a responsibility to make it absolutely clear what the implications are for employee pensions.
<P>

<a name="20523w24.html_para8">The Sandler review of the long-term retail savings market and Pickering review of pension regulation will report in the summer. The Inland Revenue is also reviewing the taxation of occupational pension schemes. We will issue proposals in the autumn, aimed at making pension provision more attractive for individuals and pension providers. This will build on the reforms that have been introduced since 1998. Pension Credit will ensure that it always pays to save. State second pension will benefit 14 million low and moderate earners, and four million carers and disabled people who will get a second pension for the first time. We have introduced pension forecasts to provide individuals with the right information to make an informed decision about their retirement. And the introduction of stakeholder pensions means that everyone now has access to low-charge, flexible pension provision.

The project will be subject to rigorous monitoring and evaluation during this pilot phase. Decisions on future service provision will be made in the light of evidence from the evaluation. To inform the evaluation process I have also decided to establish a consultative group, whose members will be drawn from a range of organisations and individuals with an interest in this issue. Expressions of interest in membership of this group are now being invited.

 Section 62 of the Criminal Justice and Courts Services Act 2000 provides for the electronic monitoring of prisoners released on licence. By virtue of section 62(5)(a), this includes young people during the community element of a detention and training order (DTO).

This form of release will be a normal feature of DTOs except in the case of trainees convicted of sex offences or serious violent offences. The possibility of release on electronic monitoring at this stage in the DTO will not be available to trainees who have exhibited violent or destructive behaviour to people or property within the secure facility; made exceptionally bad progress against the training plan as a result of consistent failure to co-operate or failure to take responsibility for their behaviour.

<a name="20523w25.html_para8">Key findings from the research have been released (Home Office News Release, 12 February 2002). Annual economic costs (mainly to health service, criminal justice system and state benefits) are estimated to be between &#163;3.7 billion and &#163;6.8 billion. Adding social costs (mainly victim costs of crime) increases figures to between &#163;10.9 billion and &#163;18.8 billion. Problematic drug users account for around 99 per cent. of these costs with annual economic costs at &#163;11,000 each compared with less than &#163;20 for a non-problematic user.

 The White Paper 'Secure Borders, Safe Haven' and the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Bill set out a range of measures to create an effective end-to-end system which will enable us to return swiftly those not in need of protection. There are also measures to

 The Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Bill makes no change to the policy with regard to the detention of asylum seeking families. The policy for the detention of families is detailed in the White Paper "Secure Borders, Safe Haven" which makes it clear that families may, when appropriate, be detained while their identities and basis of claim are established, or because there is a reasonable belief they would abscond, or as part of the fast-track asylum process at Oakington Reception Centre, or to effect their removal.

 <i>[holding answer 20 May 2002]:</i> There are no statistics on the number of asylum seekers who have returned to London following dispersal to another area of the country. Nor are statistics available on those accepted as refugees or granted exceptional leave to remain (ELR) who, in both cases, are free to live where ever they like. The National Asylum Support Services (NASS) cannot require asylum seekers to remain in the accommodation provided. If they choose to leave the accommodation they can seek to alter their support package from subsistence and accommodation to subsistence only. Generally speaking asylum seekers are not provided with accommodation in London. The Home Office is currently reviewing the extent of and reasons for

<P>
<a name="20523w26.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Bob Ainsworth: </B> 
 The Working Party on Police Co-operation meeting held on 5 to 6 February 2002, proposed the setting up of a European network for the protection of public figures to be chaired by the member state holding the Presidency of the Council. Its remit was to standardise the package of support and protection afforded to visiting dignitaries against agreed criteria, as well as the exchange of resources and information.
<P>

<a name="20523w26.html_para0">Negotiations are ongoing and it is expected that a decision on the implementation of the Network's proposals will be taken in June. However, the Government feel that the United Kingdom (UK) has much to offer in the exchange of best practice ideas and procedures in the area of public figure protection. One of the key issues that the Government have sought to maintain is the principle that it is the right of the host state to determine the appropriate package of support according to the specific threat to the individual visiting that country. The network will have no power to make legislative changes to UK law.

 <i>[holding answer 22 May 2002]:</i> Under the provisions of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, animals can only be used in licensed scientific procedures when there is no alternative way to achieve the objective concerned, such as testing products using computer models, cell cultures and other in vitro methods. Animals are only used where fully justified and where the benefits outweigh the costs to the animals involved.

This proportion compares with 20 per cent. in 1999 and 25 per cent. in 1995.
<P>

<a name="20523w26.html_para3">The majority of these toxicology/safety procedures (some 84 per cent.)&#151;amounting to just over 14 per cent. of all procedures carried out in all categories&#151;were performed to conform to legislative requirements.

Recital 22 states that member states should strengthen their efforts to include and make visible a gender perspective across all the pillars (of the Employment Guidelines). This Recital clarifies the intention of the Council, and reflects the wishes of the European Parliament, that gender equality should be a horizontal objective for member states when they take the Guidelines into account in their national employment policies.

<a name="20523w29.html_para8">The UK Government fully supports the principle that a concern for gender equality needs to be reflected across the full range of employment policy.

There were 13 trusts that met both these criteria at the time of the report.

<a name="20523w34.html_para0">An investigation was already taking place in Royal United Hospitals Bath, one of the 13 trusts that met the NAO criteria. This commenced in December 2001 with the findings being made public in a press release (ref: 2001/0201) on 3 May 2002.

 The Department is aware of the difficulties facing national health service paediatric pathology services, highlighted in the recent report by the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health 'The Future of Paediatric Pathology Services.' We are committed to working closely with the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health and the Royal College of Pathologists to improve long-term staffing levels in this speciality. The establishment of three histopathology training schools and of international fellowships to attract experienced histopathologists to work in the NHS will both increase the pool from which paediatric pathologists can be recruited. The children's care group workforce team also plans to start work on this issue in June.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health how many people have died as a result of a food allergy in each of the past five years; and if he will make a statement.  [57256]<P>

<a name="20523w35.html_spnew3"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 Reliable data are not available for the number of deaths associated with food allergy. This is because deaths due to allergy are often attributed on the death certificate to asthma or some other symptom rather than to actual food allergy. The committee on toxicity reported in 2000 that of about 20 deaths annually attributed to fatal anaphylactic shock, 30 per cent. (i.e. about seven) are due to foods, the most commonly implicated food being peanut.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health how many people in the UK have been diagnosed as having a potentially fatal food allergy.  [57255]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20523w35.html_spnew4"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 Reliable data are not available for the precise incidence of potentially fatal food allergy. Most allergic reactions to food are mild, although reactions can be severe, even life threatening in a small number of cases. The food most commonly associated with fatal food allergic reactions is peanuts. In the UK, a recent study published in the <i>British Medical Journal</i> has shown that 1 in 200 children suffer from peanut allergy.

 Population data are not available by trust but have been given by health authority as shown in the table.

<a name="20523w35.html_para1">Between 1997 and 2001 the number of physiotherapists has increased by 1,640 or 14 per cent.

 The Government do not recommend the use of separate vaccines to protect children against rubella, measles or mumps and are therefore unable to comment. We recommend that children are vaccinated with the combined measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine, as the safest way for parents to protect their children against these potentially very serious diseases.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health if MMR is included in the research into the causes of autism undertaken by his Department.  [57529]<P>

<a name="20523w36.html_spnew6"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 The Medical Research Council (MRC)&#151;which receives most of its income via grant-in- aid from the office of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry&#151;is the main Government agency that funds research into the causes of medical conditions. Their most recent review of the epidemiology and causes of autism, published in December last year, notes that autism seems likely to result from a range of causes but that the strongest evidence to date is for a major genetic component. The report states that several genes may interact to create susceptibility to the disorder. In relation to the combined MMR vaccine, it advises that the evidence does not support the proposed causal link between MMR and autism.
<P>

<a name="20523w36.html_para5">We have since announced the allocation of a further &#163;2.5 million to the MRC for autism research. This will complement and add to the MRC's current support for research in this field. The MRC welcomes high quality applications for support in any scientific area which will further our understanding of autism, and especially those areas which were highlighted in the recent MRC review of autism: causes and epidemiology; this does not preclude research involving MMR.
