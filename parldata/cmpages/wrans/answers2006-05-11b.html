<a name="stpa_1">The Government and the Devolved Administrations either accept, or accept in principle, 29 of the 32 recommendations. However, some of the responses are preliminary, pending further consultation with stakeholders or completion of further studies. For many of the recommendations, the European Commission would be responsible for taking forward any necessary action. Two of the recommendations require further consideration, and one recommendation regarding pet birds has been rejected. These are detailed in the Government response.

<a name="stpa_2">There is currently an EU ban on imports of captive wild birds, which is due to expire on 31 July. A decision on whether to extend the ban will be taken at the EU Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health in June.

<a name="60511w01.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_3">The key elements of the Government response are currently being implemented and will be in place before imports resume. In addition, all approved quarantine premises will need to be reassessed against revised standards before they can accept any birds into quarantine.

<p>
<a name="60511w01.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_4">In April 2005 the European Commission requested the European Food Safety Authority to carry out a review of the animal health and welfare aspects of imports of captive wild birds, which is due to report in October 2006. This will inform EU policy and we await their opinion with interest.

 Final calculations about milk production are still being made, but Although it appears that wholesale milk production was lower in 2005&#150;06 than 2004&#150;05, it is too early to tell whether this is a long term trend or has been caused by weather, restructuring

 The Government supported the conclusion of the Environment, Rood and Rural Affairs Select Committee in 2004, that there was no compelling evidence in favour of setting up a regulatory body to oversee the dairy industry. It is difficult to see how a regulator could determine a fair price other than by reference to a market price. A price regulator would almost certainly be incompatible with EU competition law and with the (common organisation of the market in milk and milk products.

<p><a name="st_7"><a name="60511w01.html_spnew7"><b> Barry Gardiner: </b> 
 Since the Department was established in 2001, we have put in place a considerable programme of reforms and improvements. For example, action on sustainable development, climate change and energy, sustainable consumption and production, natural resource protection, sustainable rural communities, and a sustainable farming and food sector. A summary of achievements relating to these policy areas can be found at: http://www.defra.gov.uk/corporate/achievements.htm.

<a name="stpa_10">Under the Nitrates Directive, around 80 per cent. of the West Lancashire constituency was designated as an Nitrate Vulnerable Zone (NVZ) in 2002; currently about 55 per cent. of England is designated. Farmers in NVZs are required to follow an action programme aimed at reducing the risk of nitrates loss; for example by limiting the amount of Nitrogen applied on the farm during the year and by not applying manure or fertilisers during certain times of the year.

<a name="stpa_12">In March 2005 we announced that Lancashire would be one of eight rural pathfinders in England. The pathfinder initiative is a key part of the Government&#039;s Rural Strategy and reflects the Government&#039;s commitment to devolve decision-making and resources to the local level. The Lancashire rural pathfinder is helping to ensure greater co-ordination of rural delivery programmes, including testing new and innovative methods to bring about improvements in the delivery of services to rural communities and businesses.

<a name="stpa_13">Lancashire has also proved to be a fertile ground for our Defra&#039;s Project Based Schemes which are generally available to farmers to help them develop new business opportunities and widen the skills they already possess. For example, Farmer Ted&#039;s Farm Park, located at Worral House Farm just outside Southport, was opened in 2003 with the help of funding from the Rural Enterprise Scheme. In the first 18 months it received over 38,000 visitors including 480 school trips. The attraction also contributes to the local economy by employing 10 full-time and 30 part-time employees.

Between 1984 and 1992 a different interpretation ofICD-9 selection rule 3 was used to code underlying cause of death in England and Wales to that used internationally. This change means that comparisons between this period and years before and after, should be interpreted with caution. The impact of the change on mortality statistics was analysed and reported in annual mortality publications in 1984 and 1994*. The introduction of ICD-10 for coding cause of death in 2001 also means that figures are not completely comparable with data for years before this date. Comparisons between the data before and after 2001 should 



therefore also be interpreted with caution. An article specifically examining the effect of the change in classification for cancer trends was published in Health Statistics Quarterly 23**.

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_65">Firstly, please allow me to explain why it has taken a little while to reply to your questions. I understand from the House of Commons Library that you are most interested in Parliamentary electorate by local authority. This is not a standard output so it has taken some time to collate the data and ensure it is on an equivalent basis. This is further complicated by different data being available for England & Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. Electoral data are held locally by the General Register Office for Scotland (GROS), the Electoral Office Northern Ireland (EONI) and for England & Wales the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Regarding the question on total electorate for Denbighshire and the Vale of Clwyd, we do not normally publish data on total electorate (rather we publish local/European electorate and separately Parliamentary electorate data). For years up to and including 2001, data are not held electronically in a form that enables us to calculate &#039;total electorate&#039;. Therefore, in order to obtain the data you requested we have referred to the annual paper returns from Denbighshire to collate the necessary data.</p>

<p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_66">Historical UK Electorate by LA</p>

<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_67">Electoral data are available on the number of people registered to vote in Parliamentary elections and also on the number of people registered to vote in local/European elections. Annual population data are only available on a &quot;usual residence&quot; basis: the mid-year population estimates. Since population data are available by age, the mid-year population aged 18 and over can be calculated. Thus it is possible to calculate an estimate of the &#039;registration rate&#039; using &quot;the percentage of the usually resident population, aged 18 and over who are registered to vote&quot; as either Parliamentary or local/European electors).</p>
</ul>
<p>




<br>&nbsp;<br><i>11 May 2006 : Column 425W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_68">It is not possible to &#039;split&#039; estimates of the usual resident population in order to give estimates of the population entitled to vote. We do not hold data (e.g. populations of non-EU citizens) that enable us to produce such a &#039;split&#039;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_69">The attached tables (one for each year), therefore, provide information, for each local authority in the UK, on (i) the annual &#039;usual resident&#039; mid-year population; (ii) the size of the <i>(a)</i> Parliamentary electorate and <i>(b)</i> local/European electorate; and (iii) the percentage of the &quot;estimated usually resident population&quot; aged 18 and over who are registered to vote as <i>(a)</i> Parliamentary electors and <i>(b)</i> local/European electors. These are labelled as &#039;registration rates&#039; on the tables and this term is used in the remainder of this reply. These data provide the closest available approximation to the information you requested. It is not possible to calculate the percentage of the eligible population who are registered to vote: the resident population aged 18 and over is not the same as the number of people eligible to vote.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_70">This &#039;registration rate&#039; is not a published National Statistic: there are a number of issues that mean care needs to be taken when interpreting the data. In particular care needs to be taken when considering local authorities where the usually resident population differs radically from the population eligible to vote. An example of such a local authority is Forest Heath. There are a large number of United States Air Force personnel, contractors, and dependants in Forest Heath who, as American citizens, are not eligible to vote. These people are however included in the population estimates as they are usually resident. Therefore, the estimated &#039;registration rate&#039; calculated for Forest Heath is considerably reduced. However, the Office for National Statistics (ONS), in order to aid comparisons of the resident population of voting age and the number of people who are registered to vote, does calculate &#039;registration rates&#039; on occasion in the manner outlined above.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_71">The attached tables give comparisons between the number of registered electors and annual mid-year population for the ten years up to mid-2004 (the latest available population estimates for the UK) for all local authorities in the UK. Each table shows a comparison against Parliamentary electorate (where available) and against local/European electorate. The availability of Parliamentary electorate by LA differs by country as this is a non-standard output. Data availability also differs from year to year. Recent improvements to the way the data are held for England and Wales mean these data can now be calculated for more recent years. For England and Wales data on Parliamentary electorate by LA, for years prior to 2002, could only be calculated by reference to individual paper LA annual returns and would involve disproportionate cost. For Scotland, 2004 data on Parliamentary electors by LA will be available shortly and we will provide you with an update of these tables when they become available. For Northern Ireland data on Parliamentary electors by LA are not currently available.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_72">In order to give an estimate of the number of electors at the mid-year point, 30 June, a weighted average is taken of the two closest sets of electoral data. This gives the best possible comparison with the population estimates. Footnotes to the tables indicate the formulae used to calculate these weighted comparisons.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_73">Attainers have been excluded from the electorate data to give the best possible comparison. Therefore, the data may differ to that published elsewhere.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_74">We have also updated the data where there are known (small) errors in or updates to previously published data. This means that the attached data provide the best possible comparison.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_75">The local/European electorate gives a better comparison than parliamentary electorate to the usually resident population as EU citizens are included and UK citizens resident abroad are excluded from the local/European electorate. However, a number of other difficulties remain when comparing these sources. For example not everyone who is usually resident is entitled to vote (foreign citizens from outside of the EU and Commonwealth, prisoners, etc. are not eligible) and people who have more than one address may register in more than one place (e.g. students may register at parental and term-time addresses). These factors may have a differential impact from place to place.</p>
</ul>
<p>




<br>&nbsp;<br><i>11 May 2006 : Column 426W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_76">There is also inevitably some double counting of the registered electorate (both parliamentary and local/European) as electoral registration officers vary in how quickly they remove people from the registers after they have moved away from an area or after they have died. This is the main reason some areas show apparent rates in excess of one hundred per cent.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_77">In order to aid comparison two further tables are attached that show the estimated &#039;registration rates&#039; for all ten years. Table A shows these rates for Parliamentary electors and Table B for local/European electors.

 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what steps are being taken by his Department <i>(a)</i> to modernise agricultural practices, <i>(b)</i> to increase productivity and <i>(c)</i> to improve access to credit for farmers in India.  [68172]</p>




<p><a name="st_111"><a name="60511w14.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Thomas: </b> 
 Agriculture in India is generally a success story. India is self sufficient in staple grain crops in most years and stores a substantial surplus. The so-called &#039;green revolution&#039; has been the main driving force behind this success, promoting the use of improved crop varieties and fertilisers in areas with access to irrigation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60511w14.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_114">However, the benefits of new technologies have not been equitably distributed. DFID&#039;s focus has been on improving the livelihoods of farmers and other rural people in rain-fed areas which are not suited to the particular packages of improvements offered by the green revolution. The focus on livelihoods, rather than agriculture, recognises that poor people are often landless and depend on a diverse range of activities to support themselves. However, DFID-supported projects have developed and tested appropriate new agricultural technologies and tools in these areas that have resulted in increases in production and income, more efficient and sustainable use of soil and water resources and reduction of hard manual labour, particularly for women. Some examples are treadle pumps for small scale irrigation, seed drills, paddy rice transplanters, which have made work easier as well as contributing to improvements in production.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60511w14.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_115">Consistent with this approach, DFID has concentrated on micro-credit rather than agricultural credit. DFID is working with the Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI) to develop the capacity of micro-finance institutions to on-lend to individuals or groups. Approximately 45 per cent. of these loans are for agriculture, livestock, fisheries or related activities. DFID&#039;s rural livelihoods projects incorporate revolving funds at the village level to support agriculture, livestock and micro-enterprise activities.

 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development pursuant to the answer of 27 April 2006, <i>Official Report,</i> columns 1231&#150;2W, on fledgling democracies, why his Department does not track multilateral aid; and what mechanisms are in place in his Department to evaluate the effectiveness of the programmes which UK aid funds.

<p><a name="st_112"><a name="60511w14.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Thomas: </b> 
 DFID reviews the effectiveness of all bilateral projects over &#163;1 million at least once a year. This includes money which DFID country programmes channel through multilateral agencies since according to international convention this aid is classified as bilateral. DFID has a public service agreement target to achieve a sustained increase in the quality of DFID&#039;s bilateral projects. DFID reports progress towards this target in the Departmental Report and the Autumn Performance Report. This year&#039;s Departmental Report will be published on 9th May.

This monitoring system cannot track core contributions to multilateral agencies because these funds are pooled. However, DFID uses a Multilateral Effectiveness Framework and other assessments to evaluate the performance of the multilateral agencies. During 2004, DFID used the Multilateral Effectiveness Framework to assess 23 multilateral agencies against their objectives. These objectives were agreed jointly with DFID and set out in an Institutional Strategy Paper. These institutional strategies are publicly available. DFID uses the results of the Multilateral Effectiveness Frameworks and other mechanisms to inform decisions around funding for the multilateral agencies.

 There is a close relationship in action to improve reproductive health and family planning, maternal health and to make progress on HIV and AIDS. Closing the gap in unmet needs for family planning would make a big contribution to helping to lower maternal mortality. Sexual and reproductive health services are vital in ensuring that women have a choice about if and when to have children, and play a key role in helping them avoid sexually transmitted infection including HIV, including through condom provision.

The United Nations Secretary General&#039;s progress report on the 2001 Declaration of Commitment in HIV and AIDS, released in April, estimates that only 9 per cent. of HIV positive women in low and middle income countries currently receive antiretroviral drugs to prevent mother to child transmission of HIV.

In November 2005, DFID launched a new &quot;People Strategy&quot;, which outlined our vision and commitments on how we will lead, manage, develop and support our people over the next three years. Individual Departments-within DFID plan and manage development away days and team building exercises for their staff in accordance with their specific needs in the context of business planning, continual professional development and performance improvement. Costs are usually met through delegated divisional or departmental training budgets.

 DFID provides some support to sub-Saharan African countries for the development and facilitation of their national policies on trade, and specific issues like tourism, through its bilateral programmes. Much of DFID&#039;s support on trade to Sub Saharan Africa is provided regionally through programmes such as the Capacity-Building for Trade Policy and Negotiations and the Southern Africa Trade and Poverty Programme, and multilateral through institutions like the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).

<a name="stpa_119">Governments can access funds for trade delegations to the UK and other destinations from a variety of sources, many supported by DFID funds, such as the World Trade Organisation (WTO) Trust Fund for Least Developed Country Travel managed by UNCTAD. This information is not held centrally and would involve a disproportionate cost to collect. For example, a delegation of developing country trade negotiators including from sub-Saharan Africa came to the UK at the end of last year. This was funded by the European Development Fund, to which the UK makes subscriptions.

 The Department is encouraging schools to put the guidance on participation into practice in ways that are meaningful to children and young people.

We have ensured that inspection arrangements make the views of children and young people an important part of assessing how local areas are doing, and of school inspections.

 I have today placed in both Libraries copies of correspondence between my Department and the Office for National Statistics to which the hon. Member refers. No formal assessment was made in response to the letter of 18 February 2004. The Government&#039;s view is that a closure period of 100 years strikes the right balance between the access interests of family historians and the right of citizens to have the personal information about themselves in their census returns kept confidential. Maintaining the security and confidentiality of the information that citizens supply about themselves in their census returns is of paramount importance. It remains government policy to make census returns publicly available after a period of 100 years.

<p><a name="st_4"><a name="60511w21.html_spnew4"><b> Bridget Prentice: </b> 
 My Department has a retirement policy which explicitly states that if a member of staff below senior civil service level wishes to work beyond the normal retirement age of 65 we will normally agree to such a request subject to the normal standards of health, efficiency, conduct, performance and attendance being met. Individuals may not work beyond the age of 70 except in exceptional circumstances. The normal retirement age in the senior civil service is 60. However, the Department retains members of the senior civil service if it is judged to be in the public interest to do so and it is satisfied as to the fitness and efficiency of the individual to carry out his or her duties. This flexibility allows the Department to meet its business needs, retaining valuable knowledge and skills, while giving staff as much choice as possible about when they retire.

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0">As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your recent Parliamentary Questions regarding (1) the size of the electorate and the registration rate in each local authority in (i) England, (ii) Wales, (iii) Scotland and (iv) Northern Ireland in each of the last 10 years; (2) the percentage of those eligible to vote who were registered to vote in each local authority in <i>(a)</i> England, <i>(b)</i> Wales, <i>(c)</i> Scotland and <i>(d)</i> Northern Ireland in each of the last 10 years and (3) the total electorate for <i>(a)</i> the Vale of Clwyd and <i>(b)</i> Denbighshire in each of the last 10 years.

</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1">Firstly, please allow me to explain why it has taken a little while to reply to your questions. I understand from the House of Commons Library that you are most interested in Parliamentary electorate by local authority. This is not a standard output so it has taken some time to collate the data and ensure it is on an equivalent basis. This is further complicated by different data being available for England & Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. Electoral data are held locally by the General Register Office for Scotland (GROS), the Electoral Office Northern Ireland (EONI) and for England & Wales the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Regarding the question on total electorate for Denbighshire and the Vale of Clwyd, we do not normally publish data on total electorate (rather we publish local/European electorate and separately Parliamentary electorate data). For years up to and including 2001, data are not held electronically in a form that enables us to calculate &#039;total electorate&#039;. Therefore, in order to obtain the data you requested we have referred to the annual paper returns from Denbighshire to collate the necessary data.</p>

<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3">Electoral data are available on the number of people registered to vote in Parliamentary elections and also on the number of people registered to vote in local/European elections. Annual population data are only available on a &quot;usual residence&quot; basis: the mid-year population estimates. Since population data are available by age, the mid-year population aged 18 and over can be calculated. Thus it is possible to calculate an estimate of the &#039;registration rate&#039; using &quot;the percentage of the usually resident population, aged 18 and over who are registered to vote&quot; as either Parliamentary or local/European electors).</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4">It is not possible to &#039;split&#039; estimates of the usual resident population in order to give estimates of the population entitled to vote. We do not hold data (e.g. populations of non-EU citizens) that enable us to produce such a &#039;split&#039;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5">The attached tables (one for each year), therefore, provide information, for each local authority in the UK, on (i) the annual &#039;usual resident&#039; mid-year population; (ii) the size of the <i>(a)</i> Parliamentary electorate and <i>(b)</i> local/European electorate; and (iii) the percentage of the &quot;estimated usually resident population&quot; aged 18 and over who are registered to vote as <i>(a)</i> Parliamentary electors and <i>(b)</i> local/European electors. These are labelled as &#039;registration rates&#039; on the tables and this term is used in the remainder of this reply. These data provide the closest available approximation to the information you requested. It is not possible to calculate the percentage of the eligible population who are registered to vote: the resident population aged 18 and over is not the same as the number of people eligible to vote.</p>

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6">This &#039;registration rate&#039; is not a published National Statistic: there are a number of issues that mean care needs to be taken when interpreting the data. In particular care needs to be taken when considering local authorities where the usually resident population differs radically from the population eligible to vote. An example of such a local authority is Forest Heath. There are a large number of United States Air Force personnel, contractors, and dependants in Forest Heath who, as American citizens, are not eligible to vote. These people are however included in the population estimates as they are usually resident. Therefore, the estimated &#039;registration rate&#039; calculated for Forest Heath is considerably reduced. However, the Office for National Statistics (ONS), in order to aid comparisons of the resident population of voting age and the number of people who are registered to vote, does calculate &#039;registration rates&#039; on occasion in the manner outlined above.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7">The attached tables give comparisons between the number of registered electors and annual mid-year population for the ten years up to mid-2004 (the latest available population estimates for the UK) for all local authorities in the UK. Each table shows a comparison against Parliamentary electorate (where available) and against local/European electorate. The availability of Parliamentary electorate by LA differs by country as this is a non-standard output. Data availability also differs from year to year. Recent improvements to the way the data are held for England and Wales mean these data can now be calculated for more recent years. For England and Wales data on Parliamentary electorate by LA, for years prior to 2002, could only be calculated by reference to individual paper LA annual returns and would involve disproportionate cost. For Scotland, 2004 data on Parliamentary electors by LA will be available shortly and we will provide you with an update of these tables when they become available. For Northern Ireland data on Parliamentary electors by LA are not currently available.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_8">In order to give an estimate of the number of electors at the mid-year point, 30 June, a weighted average is taken of the two closest sets of electoral data. This gives the best possible comparison with the population estimates. Footnotes to the tables indicate the formulae used to calculate these weighted comparisons.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_9">Attainers have been excluded from the electorate data to give the best possible comparison. Therefore, the data may differ to that published elsewhere.</p>

</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11">The local/European electorate gives a better comparison than parliamentary electorate to the usually resident population as EU citizens are included and UK citizens resident abroad are excluded from the local/European electorate. However, a number of other difficulties remain when comparing these sources. For example not everyone who is usually resident is entitled to vote (foreign citizens from outside of the EU and Commonwealth, prisoners, etc. are not eligible) and people who have more than one address may register in more than one place (e.g. students may register at parental and term-time addresses). These factors may have a differential impact from place to place.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12">There is also inevitably some double counting of the registered electorate (both parliamentary and local/European) as electoral registration officers vary in how quickly they remove people from the registers after they have moved away from an area or after they have died. This is the main reason some areas show apparent rates in excess of one hundred per cent.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13">In order to aid comparison two further tables are attached that show the estimated &#039;registration rates&#039; for all ten years. Table A shows these rates for Parliamentary electors and Table B for local/European electors. However, any comparison of these data across years should be made carefully as electoral legislation and other changes (such as EU expansion) can change the size of the electorate.</p>

Notes:<br>

1. The Agency&#039;s caseload consists of all open pre-calculation/assessment cases, and cases with a maintenance liability (including those with both a nil and positive maintenance liability).<br>

2. The size of the Agency&#039;s caseload will be affected by the Agency&#039;s intake and the number of cases that are closed within any given time period.<br>

3. It is not possible to quantify the extent to which the Agency&#039;s clerical new-scheme caseload is or is not included in the above numbers.<br>

4. Volumes are rounded to the nearest thousand. Components may therefore not sum, due to rounding.<br>

 DWP operates the civil service wide arrangement for senior civil servants, with retirement at age 60. The head of the Department and Agency chief executives have the flexibility to retain SCS staff beyond 60 if they judge it to be in the public interest and are satisfied about the fitness and efficiency of the individual to carry out their duties. We have one SCS member of staff working beyond age 60 out of a total of 247 SCS members.

As changes have been made to some of the Disability Living Allowance (DLA) claim forms over the last year, DCS has undertaken specific consultation activity with the DCS Advisory Forum and where appropriate the wider lobby. The DCS Advisory Forum is the Disability and Carers Service&#039;s (DCS) main mechanism for consulting with the Voluntary and Community Sector. The forum was originally established in 1998 to provide advice and guidance to officials of DCS and the Department on the impact of change initiatives on disabled customers.</p>

</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_51">As a result of this consultation activity, a number of suggestions were submitted, many of which we have been able to incorporate. This has led to improvements being made to the form which will make it easier for customers to understand and answer the questions; provides customers with the option to describe the help they need and the difficulties they have at the end of each question; the layout, format and wording have also been improved and makes the form visibly clearer and easy to read.</p>

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_52">When a suggestion has been made but not acted upon, for example where the suggestion would unfairly advantage one group of disabled people at the expense of other groups, reasons were given to the Forum to explain why the suggestion was not taken up.</p>

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_53">On 20 March 2006, the provision for customers to make e-claims via the internet for a range of DWP benefits was introduced, including DLA and AA. DCS took the lead on consulting on behalf of the Department with Interactive Demonstration and Preview events of the DWP e-Services taking place in Manchester and Birmingham in November 2005. These events provided customer representative groups with early sight of the DLA, Attendance Allowance, State Pension UK, Jobcentre Plus, and Child Support maintenance application e-forms. The DCS Advisory Forum, Jobcentre Plus Key Stakeholders and the Pension Service Partnerships Against Poverty Group were invited to attend these events, with representation from wider customer representative organisations also attending on the day. As a result of the comments received at these events, improvements to the DLA e-claim form are to be made. Steps are now being taken to include the provision for customer representatives to include their details, an option to provide Textphone details and increasing the size of text boxes.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_54">Our consultation approach via the formal DCS Advisory Forum, the wider lobby where appropriate, and via customer feedback channels allows for continuous dialogue and suggestions from our customers or their representatives as to how our claim forms can be improved.</p>

 The Disability Discrimination Act 2005 placed new duties on public authorities to promote equality for disabled people, &#039;the Disability Equality Duty&#039;. This Department (DWP) has taken the following steps to meet the Disability Equality Duty:

<a name="stpa_37">DWP is host to the Office for Disability Issues (ODI), which was launched on 1 December 2005 to take forward the Government&#039;s strategy for improving the life chances of disabled people. One element of this work will be to overset the effective implementation of the Disability Equality Duty. The ODI is working in partnership with the Disability Rights Commission to support and encourage Departments to commit to meaningful actions that will improve their policies and services and realise the potential of their diverse workforces.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60511w25.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_39">DWP is currently revising its existing guidance on accessible communications with a view to introducing a new standard for information accessibility. This set of standards will form part of the disability equality scheme referred to earlier.

<a name="stpa_40">We have commissioned public access audits of all its premises used by the public during 2003. A total of 1,735 buildings were surveyed, and a programme of public access improvement works commissioned on 1,032 sites which are scheduled for completion in June 2006. The existing public access provisions are subject to annual review and any future additional requirement is built into the annual maintenance work programmes.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60511w25.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_41">The Department wants staff to understand and embrace diversity and an important part of achieving this has been the development of a diversity toolkit which makes all our diversity and equality policy and information easily accessible in one place on an internal website. The toolkit also is now being used by around 70 other organisations.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60511w25.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_42">The Department is keen to ensure we meet the workplace needs of disabled staff and potential staff and recently DWP has run two pilot exercises on a revised process for delivering reasonable workplace adjustments for staff. The development of the new process was partly in response to the length of time it took to assess and put reasonable adjustments into place, and partly to ensure that the recommended adjustment was the most suitable for that individual. A third pilot is due to start shortly. This will be followed by a formal evaluation exercise. On completion of the first two pilots, and subject to the evaluation, we will commence planning for national implementation across the Department and agencies.

<a name="60511w25.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_43">DWP encourages all business units to consider the potential impact of policy and services on all equality groups, ahead of future legislation. For example, at least three impact assessments have been completed to date by the Disability and Carers Service, taking into account disability, with a number of additional assessments in the process of being completed.

<a name="stpa_44">The Department has been working in partnership with the Employers&#039; Forum on Disability in order to address the needs of its disabled customers. In particular, it has contributed, along with other public and private organisations, to the interactive &quot;Disability Confident&quot; training resource pack which uses both video and DVD format. This addresses the key principles of dealing with disabled people in general, and particularly communications issues relating to those with specific impairments.

 The department has undertaken substantial in-house analysis to determine both the trends and the reasons for the change in the number of those claiming incapacity benefit for mental and behavioural disorders.

<p>
<a name="60511w25.html_para11">
<a name="stpa_47">The rise in the number of people with mental and behavioural disorders claiming incapacity benefits mirrors a rise in the overall number of individuals in the population with mental health problems.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60511w25.html_para12">
<a name="stpa_48">Claimants with mental and behavioural disorders as a primary diagnosis now make up an increasing proportion of the overall caseload accounting for almost 40 per cent. of the total caseload, compared with 25 per cent. in the mid 1990s; although growth in the proportion of the caseload with mental and behavioural disorders has been slowing in recent quarters. This is both because they make up an increasing proportion of inflows and because they have lower off-flow rates than other groups. It follows that, people with mental health conditions are, on average, much more likely to become long-term claimants.

<a name="stpa_55">This resulted in 6,128 reports being made to law enforcement agencies and other national hotlines around the world. The report also highlights the fact that only 0.4 per cent. of potentially illegal child abuse content identified by the IWF in 2005 was hosted in the UK. This represents a major improvement from 18 per cent. in 1997, and demonstrates the commitment of the IWF, the UK industry, and others, to work collaboratively to remove potentially illegal child abuse content wherever in the world it originates. The IWF report that there were no instances of either criminally obscene content or criminally racist content hosted in the UK during 2005.

The fact that the IWF&#039;s core funders have grown in number to over 60 is evidence of their strengthening reputation. The IWF is seen as a highly successful model of cooperation and one which other countries seek to learn from and replicate.

If the trafficked woman is engaging in prostitution under duress then we find it difficult to see how she would be considered to be freely consenting. There are also evidential assumptions at section 75 of the Act which, if proven, will mean that the complainant is taken not to have consented and these include the use and threat of violence and unlawful detention of the victim. Furthermore, creating a further offence of paying for sex with a trafficked woman may give the appearance that it is a lesser offence than rape; it is not.

<sup>(40)</sup> Offence under the Road Traffic Act 1988 s. 143 (2).<br>

Notes:<br>

Coverage and recording practice affecting the statistics:<br>

1. It is known that for some police force areas, the reporting of court proceedings in particular those relating to summary motoring offences, may be less than complete.<br>

2. Since 1990, due to the delays in implementing new counting procedures, corrective action on non-keying errors was reduced resulting in deterioration in the quality of data on summary motoring proceedings.<br>

We also take into account UK Project Programme Priorities, other donors&#039; activities in Colombia and areas where the UK can add particular value through experience or expertise. In Colombia, current priorities for UK project assistance include the protection of child rights, improvements in the rule of law, protection and promotion of freedom of expression and human rights defenders, security sector reform and conflict resolution. We aim to support sustainable institutional reform, as well as the most vulnerable communities in Colombia. The Department for International Development also supports non-governmental organisations&#039; projects in Colombia on sustainable economic development for vulnerable communities, health and education, environment, strengthening civil society and projects to help reduce poverty and inequality.

 The human rights situation in Belarus remains of concern. Following the flawed Presidential elections on 19 March the Belarusian regime has moved to crack-down on the opposition and to stifle any dissent. Demonstrations have been broken up and the main opposition leaders and their key supporters have been arrested or detained. The independent press remains muzzled or has been driven underground. Non-governmental organisations are subject to harassment and their funding severely curtailed. The attack on Mikola Kalinin, an activist on Roma rights, is an example of the atmosphere of intimidation that exists for those seeking to support the fundamental freedom and right of civil society to express its concerns.

 New disability equipment such as mobility aids, environmental controls, communication aids, posture management, pressure management and moving and handling systems which are classed as medical devices and have been placed on the European market since June 1998 are required to meet the Medical Devices Directive 93/42/EEC. This directive is brought into United Kingdom law under the Medical Device Regulations 2002 (amended 2003). Such medical devices must carry the CE mark indicating conformity to the directive.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60511w37.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_127">Before applying the CE mark the manufacturer must ensure that all risks are removed or minimised and any residual risks constitute acceptable risks when weighed against the benefit to the user and are compatible with a high level of protection of safety. If it is not possible to reduce these risks by means of inherently safe design or construction whilst providing benefit to the user then the manufacturer must inform users of the residual risks by means of labelling on the device and/or warnings contained in the user information.

Proactive and reactive investigations involving medical devices including assistive technology are carried out. Where appropriate the MHRA also works with or refers cases to other regulatory bodies in the United Kingdom such as Trading Standards and also liaises as necessary with other competent authorities within Europe and also with the United States of America, Canada, and Australia.

PCTs are responsible for ensuring that there is provision of ambulance services (which could include patient transport services) to such extent as they consider necessary to meet all reasonable requirements. It is, therefore, for the local NHS to decide who provides patient transport services for eligible patients in their area. In addition, patients on a low income may be entitled to reimbursement of their travel costs under the hospital travel cost scheme. This applies to any of the hospitals on their PCT&#039;s choice menu.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health what definition his Department uses of a small firm.  [59288]</p>

 The Department does not use any definition of a small firm. In reporting data about businesses placed with small and medium sized enterprise (SME), we define a SME as a firm employing under 250 people. This is in line with the definition of a SME provided by the Department of Trade and Industry&#039;s small business service. The Department does not differentiate between a small firm and a medium sized firm for procurement purposes.
