<P>
15. <a name="40106w01.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Simon Thomas: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what recent representations he has received on making the wearing of seat belts on school transport compulsory.  [145879]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40106w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 None. The Department is however in the process of implementing EU Directive 2003/20/EU of 8 April 2003 on seat belt wearing. This requires the wearing of seat belts by passengers in buses and coaches where they are installed.

<a name="40106w01.html_sbhd4"><H3 align=center>Train Punctuality</H3>


<P>
16. <a name="40106w01.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Cameron: </B>

<P>
<P>
<a name="40106w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 Performance figures published by the Strategic Rail Authority on 11 December showed that year on year performance was up 0.5 per cent. to the end of September 2003. We are putting in funding to reverse the decades of under-investment and improve reliability. Early indications are that performance this autumn has been significantly better than in 2002.

 We are hoping to reach a decision on the route choice for the A303 improvement west of Ilminster in the spring after we have received the comments of the Regional Assembly on the Highways Agency's further work.

<a name="40106w01.html_sbhd6"><H3 align=center>Airport Capacity (South-East)</H3>


<P>
18. <a name="40106w01.html_wqn9"><B> Tim Loughton: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport to what extent he proposes details of development at airports in the south-east of England under "The Future of Air Transport" White Paper should remain a matter of local determination through the planning system.  [145882]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40106w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 I refer the hon. Member to the Aviation White Paper which says that it is for owners and operators to bring forward airport development proposals which will need to be considered through the planning system in the normal way.

<P>
19. <a name="40106w01.html_wqn10"><B> Mrs. Calton: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport if he will make a statement on his Department's strategy for <i>(a)</i> increasing cycling journey numbers and <i>(b)</i> reducing cycling injuries and deaths.  [145883]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40106w01.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 We are improving cycling infrastructure and, having initiated the Cycling Projects Fund, we have given over &#163;4 million for local cycling facilities and training. On the safety front, we are promoting training and measures which cyclists can take to protect themselves, such making themselves conspicuous. We are also improving training and testing for motorists.

<a name="40106w01.html_sbhd8"><H3 align=center>Aviation Industry</H3>


<P>
<P>
<a name="40106w01.html_wqn11"><B> Mr. Challen: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what assessment has been made of varying levels of aviation capacity on the competitiveness of the UK's international trade.  [145736]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40106w01.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 Assessments of the impact of the growth in the aviation industry in increasing productivity growth across the economy were made by Oxford Economic Forecasting ("The Contribution of the Aviation Industry to the UK Economy", November 1999). However, the appraisal of airport development options made in the regional air transport consultation documents focus on the direct benefits to passengers of increased airport capacity. No estimates were made of wider economic benefits to the economy arising from factors such as improvements in the UK's competitiveness, but the potential effect of additional airport capacity on productivity across the economy can be gauged from the resulting increase in business passengers and air freight activity.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40106w01.html_wqn12"><B> Mr. Challen: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what assessment has been made of the effects of the growth in aviation-related employment on other employment sectors.  [145737]

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40106w01.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 Assessments of the contribution of aviation to employment growth in other sectors of the economy have been undertaken by Oxford Economic Forecasting ("The Contribution of the Aviation Industry to the UK Economy", November 1999) and by ECOTEC Research and Consulting Ltd. ("The Local and Regional Economic Impacts of the Expansion of Regional Air Services", January 2001). "The Future Development of Air Transport in the United Kingdom: North of England" consultation document included material from these studies on aviation-related employment.

<a name="40106w01.html_sbhd9"><H3 align=center>Birmingham New Street Station</H3>


<P>
<P>
<a name="40106w01.html_wqn13"><B> Mr. Laurence Robertson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport (1) what discussions he has had with the Strategic Rail Authority regarding possible refurbishment of Birmingham New Street Station; and if he will make a statement;  [145377]
<P>
<UL>(2) what discussions he has had with Network Rail regarding possible closures of Birmingham New Street Station during peak times; and if he will make a statement.  [145378]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40106w01.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 I understand that in the short term, Network Rail is developing a plan to continue to manage passenger capacity efficiently while improving passenger circulation at Birmingham New Street. The Strategic Rail Authority and Network Rail are also working together and with local and regional stakeholders to continue the safe and efficient operation of the station, and to develop a series of station capacity and infrastructure enhancements to improve its environment. This will ensure that the predicted substantial growth in demand for rail services in the region in the medium to longer term can be addressed.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40106w02.html_wqn0"><B> Dr. Murrison: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport if he will make a statement on the reasons for the delay in completing the Bristol/Bath to South Coast Study; and what estimate he has made of the likely completion date.  [145226]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40106w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 The study, which was commissioned to address the concerns of Bath and North East Somerset Council and the South West Regional Assembly over the proposed de-trunking of the A36/A46, has been further delayed because it has taken longer than anticipated for the consultants to complete the modelling and firm up their conclusions. It is now anticipated that the revised Final Reports will be cleared by the Steering Group by late January 2004. Once approved, they will be submitted to the South West Regional Assembly for comment and possibly additional brief consultation with their partners, in particular regarding the de-trunking issue which gave rise to the study being commissioned.
<P>

<a name="40106w02.html_para0">Following receipt of the study report and comments from the Regional Assembly, I will be in a position to make a response.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40106w02.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Transport made a statement to the House on 9 July 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 1175&#150;95, announcing a feasibility study into the potential for road charging in the UK, which is expected to report this summer. The Terms of Reference were published on 9 July in "Managing our Roads", which is available on my Department's website.

<a name="40106w02.html_wqn2"><B> Dr. Tonge: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what assessment his Department made of the need to widen major roads into and out of Heathrow, in the event of a third runway at Heathrow being built.  [145447]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40106w02.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 The South East and East of England Regional Air Services Study (SERAS) included an assessment of the road and rail infrastructure enhancements that would be needed to support a third runway at Heathrow. The results of this appraisal were summarised in Chapter 7 of "The Future Development of Air Transport in the United Kingdom: South East" consultation document.
<P>

<a name="40106w02.html_para1">The White Paper, "The Future of Air Transport", recognised that the further expansion of Heathrow will place pressure on already congested road and rail networks. It stated that the Government have no plans for further motorway widening in this area beyond that which we announced in our response to the Thames Valley and Orbit multi-modal studies in July 2003, and that the solution would need to be based on improvements to public transport.

<a name="40106w02.html_wqn3"><B> Jonathan Shaw: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what the thickness was of the invert of the North Downs Tunnel approved by the Channel Tunnel Rail Link Act 1996; and what change there has been in the specification.  [145977]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40106w02.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 The Channel Tunnel Rail Link Act 1996 contains no specifications of the tunnel lining thickness. The specifications relating to such details in the North Downs Tunnel were first drawn up later. The tunnel has a concrete lining with a relatively flat invert and reinforced concrete base slab, which supports the ballasted track. The concrete is about 1 metre thick in the invert and the average ballast thickness is 600 mm.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what assessment he has made of whether the Strategic Rail Authority will be liable for prosecution if railways do not have disabled access by the required date in 2004.  [145403]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40106w02.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 With effect from 1 October 2004, providers of services will be under new duties to take reasonable steps to ensure that a disabled person can make use of a service, pursuant to section 21(2)(a)-(c) of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995.
<P>

<a name="40106w02.html_para2">Section 19(2)(b) of the Act defines a provider of services as being a person concerned with the provision in the United Kingdom of services to the public or a section of the public. Interpretation is a matter for the courts, but the Strategic Rail Authority's assessment is that the section 21 duties will apply to train operating companies that lease stations, and to Network Rail in respect of the stations it operates itself.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40106w02.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 Local Transport Notes 1/95 and 2/95 cover the general assessment and design of road crossings, respectively. The latter includes guidance on installing audible and tactile signals to help disabled pedestrians at signalled crossings. In addition, we have issued specific guidance on meeting the needs of disabled people, including blind and partially sighted people, in "Guidance on the Use of Tactile Surfaces" (1999) and "Inclusive Mobility" (2002).

To ask the Minister for the Cabinet Office what proportion of internet users have transacted with a government department online in each year since 1997; and what steps are being taken to increase this proportion.  [146132]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40106w02.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Alexander: </B> 
 The Office for National Statistics (ONS) measures the use of e-government services on a quarterly basis. Currently 8 per cent. of internet users claim to have transacted with government online, where transaction is defined as submitting a form, making a payment or booking an appointment. Many more visit web sites for information&#151;50 per cent. of the internet population. These figures are based on a question recently added to the ONS Omnibus Survey and data exists for 2003 only.
<P>

<a name="40106w02.html_para5">To improve the take-up of online services the Cabinet Office is working with departments to ensure that online services become more focussed around customer needs rather than following the structure of government.

In all the instances so far investigated the consumers own masthead aerial amplifier, used to boost weak signals has had a pass-band wide enough to boost the television signal and, inadvertently, the unwanted radiocommunications signal.
<P>

<a name="40106w03.html_para6">Testing has shown that the Tetra transmitters were operating correctly and within their designated licence parameters. In most cases a suitable filter fitted between the masthead amplifier and the TV aerial will resolve the interference and affected residents have been advised to have such filters fitted to their TV installations. As a goodwill gesture Airwave has arranged for filters to be fitted to the affected television installations in certain circumstances. The problem however is with the TV aerial amplifiers or the aerial system. Consumers should take problems up with their suppliers.

 I have made no such estimate. Strike action, whether official or unofficial, is damaging and inconvenient to businesses that rely on Royal Mail's services. Royal Mail had in place contingency arrangements that attempted to minimise the impact on businesses of all sizes.

 Anne Lambert, Deputy Permanent Representative to the European Union, represented the UK at the EU Energy Council in Brussels on 15 December.
<P>

<a name="40106w05.html_para0">The Council considered several matters of interest to the United Kingdom. Chief among these were the directive on gas security of supply and a proposed directive on energy efficiency standards for energy using products.
<P>

<a name="40106w05.html_para1">The Presidency introduced a short debate on a proposal on eco-design requirements for energy using products, which will set common EU energy efficiency standards for Energy Using Products (EuP), and is intended to make environmental improvements in areas that market forces cannot not handle. Describing it as a framework directive with a flexible approach, which took account of the characteristics of each sector, the Commission said that it wished to use the proposal to encourage industry to agree sectoral voluntary agreements. The Commission commended an integrated rather than thematic or sectoral approach, but rejected the idea of a priority product list as likely to trigger lengthy debates with industry on what should be included or excluded.
<P>

<a name="40106w05.html_para2">Member states broadly welcomed the proposal and its general approach of setting selection criteria but leaving the detailed product selection to a Regulatory Committee, but many saw more clarification on the detail as needed. Most supported an integrated approach and rejected the notion of a priority product list, though some MS asked the Commission to list the kind of products expected to be covered by the instrument. The UK suggested that the Commission develop a consultation strategy to identify the product categories. Others urged that the directive sets out clearly the criteria to be applied to product selection and emphasised the need to assess the impact on competitiveness, in particular the potential adverse impact on SMEs.

<P>

<a name="40106w05.html_para3">Following withdrawal of reserves by the UK and others, a general approach was agreed on the Presidency text for the proposed gas security of supply directive which sets minimum European security of supply standards and requires member states to define and publish non-discriminatory and transparent national security of supply policies compatible with the internal market. It establishes a Gas Coordination Group, outlines an approach to dealing with a major supply disruption at Community level, puts in place reporting and monitoring requirements, and provides for Commission intervention in the case of a perceived insufficiency of supplies to meet long-term gas demand. The Commission's agreement to the text, including a legal base of Article 100 EC was subject to a new Recital stating that security of supply obligations should not impede the functioning of the internal market nor impose unreasonable and disproportionate burdens.
<P>

<a name="40106w05.html_para4">The Commission presented a package of proposals on energy security: a Regulation on access to gas network in the internal market which mirrors a similar electricity Regulation adopted earlier this year as part of the internal market package; a directive on security of electricity supply and infrastructure investment, mirroring the gas measures agreed earlier; and a directive on energy end-use efficiency and energy services, which sets an energy efficiency savings target.
<P>

<a name="40106w05.html_para5">In lunchtime discussion on security of supply, the Commission argued that the need for action was underlined by forecasts showing the EU's need for 700 MW of extra weekly capacity by 2012 and given the 6&#150;7 year time lag needed for building new capacity. The UK and most other member states argued against market intervention, stating that Governments and regulators were not responsible for investment in capacity or networks, and that the key need was for a stable investment framework. Drawing attention to our domestic evidence of the market working and sending investment signals, the UK emphasised that the Directive should not interfere with effective liberalisation and that we would not support any measures to control prices. Some member states supported the Commission's ideas, arguing the need for reinforced co-operation between transmission operators and regulators and for further reflection on the cause of recent price increases, which some consumers blamed on liberalisation, and for new impetus on interconnection.
<P>

<a name="40106w05.html_para6">In a short exchange on cost of compliance with the Kyoto Protocol, the Commission argued that the EU needs to embrace technology to combat climate change and for all options to be explored including nuclear. The Commission also said there was a need for the EU and its MS to re-assess the EU position in the light of Russia's failure to ratify the Kyoto Treaty.

<a name="40106w05.html_para9">The Commission briefed on the Energy Charter Treaty, the EU/Russia dialogue and relations with South East Europe. On the Energy Charter, given that Russia had not yet ratified and was still creating difficulties over the transit protocol, the Commission said that the EU and others needed to consider how to take things forward. In contrast, the Commission argued, progress had been made in the EU/Russia dialogue, e.g. investment increases in Russia by EU companies, and resolution of the problem of destination clauses (which prevent on-selling of Russian gas by the initial importing MS). The Commission defended itself against accusations of lack of transparency in the EU/Russia energy dialogue.

Finally, Greece gave a report on the Ministerial Conference on the South-East European energy market in Athens on 8 December. An MoU had been agreed covering gas and electricity, to which the EU was a signatory.

The Common Position of the Council of Ministers at the end of the first reading adopted a proposal to separate the provisions of the cascade for food producing animals from those for companion animals so that a less restrictive regime would apply to medicines for companion animals as there are no consumer health considerations. The UK supported these amendments.

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what representations he has received on the risk of dependency resulting from recent increases in funding to developing countries to tackle the HIV/AIDS epidemic.  [145436]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40106w07.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Gareth Thomas: </B> 
 I have received no representations on this matter. However, all DFID programmes, including those aimed at helping to combat the scourge of HIV/AIDS, seek to achieve long term sustainability rather than build dependency. The UK's Call for Action on HIV/AIDS, launched on 1 December last year, has at its core an objective for each country to have one national HIV/AIDS Strategy, one national AIDS Commission and one way to monitor and report progress &#151;rather than having parallel, and less sustainable, systems and structures driven by the needs of donors.

 The UK Government are committed to intensifying the response to HIV/AIDS, including responding to the growing number of orphans and children made vulnerable by AIDS (OVCs).

<a name="40106w07.html_para1">Meeting the needs of orphans is a complex issue requiring a comprehensive response. DFID is gaining experience in the most effective ways of developing integrated, cross-sectoral programmes of support for orphans and their carers. For example, in Malawi social protection measures for families affected by HIV/AIDS are integrated into Malawi's Poverty Reduction Strategy. These measures include targeted nutrition and 



<P>
<P><I>6 Jan 2004 : Column 237W</I><P>
welfare transfers, legislation on inheritance and the introduction of less intensive crops to affected households.
<P>

<a name="40106w07.html_para2">In addition, in several countries in Southern Africa where there has been drought DFID is supporting a school-feeding programme (implemented by the World Food Programme). The programme is deliberately designed to keep children, including OVCs, at school and learning for the future. In South Africa DFID works closely with the Department of Social Development to ensure that children (and parents) can access the grants they are entitled to. We are also starting work with the Church of the Province of Southern Africa to reduce stigma, improve home-based care and care for OVCs. In Zimbabwe, DFID is providing support for OVCs and child-headed households through its NGO feeding programme.

[145615]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40106w07.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Gareth Thomas: </B> 
 DFID will continue to support the Indigenous Peoples' Demonstration Project in Brazil until at least early 2006. Expenditure over the next two years will, however, have to be reduced in view of the reduction in funds available for the region. This is consistent with the approach being taken with all other DFID projects in Latin American Middle Income Countries scheduled to continue into 2005/06 and beyond, which are either being ended prematurely or reduced in scale. A decision on whether to extend into 2006/07 will be taken in the second half of 2005 in the light of the project's progress and DFID's regional priorities. We expect that the project will have had a significant impact by early 2006 with over half of the originally envisaged training and institutional strengthening support provided by that date.

<a name="40106w09.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Mycobacterium bovis may be present within a variety of media on open pasture, each influencing the survival of the bacilli. In cow manure M. bovis may survive for up to four months in autumn, five months in winter and two months in spring, dependent on concentration. Greater concentrations promote survival.
<P>

<a name="40106w09.html_para9">When exposed to sunlight at 24&#150;34 degrees celsius M. bovis has survived for 5&#150;11 months in manure at pasture. Survival in samples buried in 1cm deep pits has been up to one year and at 5cm deep up to two years.
<P>

<a name="40106w09.html_para10">M. bovis can be highly concentrated in badger urine and can survive for over a week on open pasture during the winter but very few bacilli survive after four weeks. During the summer survival can reduce to less than three days in badger urine.
<P>

<a name="40106w09.html_para11">M. bovis in badger bronchial pus and sputum can survive for up to 10 weeks on open pasture in winter but less than one week in summer. Survival in badger faeces can be for up to one month during the winter but less than two weeks in summer.
<P>

<a name="40106w09.html_para12">Survival may also be influenced by the presence of other microorganisms in the environment. Fungi, algae, protozoans and many other bacteria compete with M. bovis for nutrients, may have greater growth rates, and may produce natural antibiotics.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what plans she has for post movement testing of cattle for exposure to M.bovis; and what assessment she has made of the implications of such testing <i>(a)</i> within four months of movement and <i>(b)</i> by the date of the next due test of the herd from which the animal came.  [144436]<P>

 All farmers have been sent a leaflet "Golden rules for a healthy herd", which advises purchasers to check the disease status of cattle prior to purchase and to consider arranging a private TB test for their herd.
<P>

<a name="40106w09.html_para16">In February 2003, the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs announced a review of our bovine tuberculosis strategy. Early in the new year we will be publishing a consultation document which will represent the outcome of the first stage of that review. The consultation document will include proposals for short term measures for reducing the risk of geographic spread of bovine TB from high to low incidence areas, including consideration of proposals for the pre and/or post movement testing of cattle.
<P>

<a name="40106w09.html_para17">When considering post-movement testing of cattle sold from farm to farm, we have envisaged that, as a general rule, such tests would be administered between 60 and 120 days after movement (i.e. 2&#150;4 months post movement). This is to ensure that a minimum of 60 days have elapsed since the last test and since any potential exposure to M.bovis on the premises of origin, to avoid problems of de-sensitisation caused by recent testing and to allow for the normal delay in the development of a response to the skin test. Knowledge of whether a pre-movement test had taken place and when, would allow the post movement test to be better targeted.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40106w09.html_spnew16"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The immune response elicited by Mycobacterium bovis in cattle takes several weeks to develop to a stage where it is detectable. For the single intradermal comparative test used in the UK and Ireland, this period of "unresponsiveness" or latency varies between 30 and 50 days.
<P>

<a name="40106w09.html_para19">To allow for random and natural variation in the latency period of individual animals, the legislation requires repeat testing to be carried out at intervals of at least 60 days from the date of the removal (or isolation) of all the reactors identified at the previous skin test.

 Many factors influence the progression of Mycobacterium bovis, infection into detectable disease, including the strain of the bacterium, size of bacterial challenge and route of infection.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40106w09.html_spnew18"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 M.bovis isolates are routinely typed using a DNA fingerprinting technique called spoligotyping. In Great Britain 30 different spoligotypes have been identified in cattle and in 16 badgers. Of those in cattle, 12 of those account for 99 per cent. of the isolates.

<a name="40106w09.html_para20"><i>(a)</i> The average duration of TB incidents ending in 2002 was skewed by those herds already restricted when TB testing was suspended during the foot and mouth disease outbreak of 2001.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment has been made of whether badgers infected by TB may excrete urine from which viable m. bovis bacilli may be isolated; what the typical quantities per millilitre are; and whether such levels are capable of causing infection in cattle through <i>(a)</i> contamination of feed and <i>(b)</i> other mechanisms.  [144445]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40106w10.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Some badgers develop TB infection in the kidneys 37 per cent. of infected badgers sampled post mortem between 1971 and 1978 m. bovis was isolated from the kidneys and may excrete m. bovis bacilli in urine. Urine is typically left in trails up to a metre or

more in length and may be focussed at a latrine or distributed more randomly as the badger forages. Concentrations of up to 300,000 bacilli per ml of badger urine have been reported and experimental nasal inoculation of cattle suggests that, at this concentration of viable microbes, less than 0.03 ml would need to be inhaled by cattle in order to promote slow infection.
<P>

<a name="40106w10.html_para0">Investigations into infection of cattle from feed and other sources contaminated with infected badger urine are lacking. However, risk of infection to cattle by infected badger urine on cattle feed would be a function of the survival of the microbe in the feed (which is dependent on, for example, duration since excretion, moisture content of the environment, exposure to UV rays) the number of microbes consumed by the cattle and the method of consumption (i.e. ingestion or inhalation). I am unaware of measurements of m. bovis survival in cattle feed but the environment inside farm buildings is generally considered to be conducive to longer periods of survival than at pasture, where m. bovis in badger urine has survived for three days in summer and 28 days in winter.
<P>

<a name="40106w10.html_para1">Cattle appear less able to detect badger urine than faeces at pasture away from latrines. In addition, patches contaminated with urine detected by cattle appear to be sniffed more than those contaminated with faeces. Furthermore, some cattle do not select against latrines and freely graze over them. Therefore, potential sources of risk of cattle contact with infected badger urine include the ingestion of contaminated feed from feed stores or in troughs; investigation/grazing at and around latrines; and the investigation/grazing of contaminated pasture.

<P>
<a name="40106w10.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Badgers are a protected species and it is an offence to take (or attempt to take) a badger from the wild, including for the purpose of relocation elsewhere (Protection of Badgers Act 1992, s.1(1)). A person guilty of this offence is liable on summary conviction to imprisonment for up to six months and/or a fine of up to &#163;5,000.
<P>

<a name="40106w10.html_para2">There are certain exceptions to this offence, two of which are specifically relevant to the issue of relocating badgers. These are the treatment of injured or sick badgers, and relocations licensed by the appropriate statutory conservation agency or agricultural department (English Nature and Defra, respectively, in England).

be released into the wild, the badger will be returned to the location where it was originally found. This approach is recommended on welfare grounds due to their territorial nature, and also to avoid any risk of transmitting disease. However, there are situations in which this course of action may not be feasible (particularly in the case of orphaned cubs).
<P>

<a name="40106w10.html_para5">There is a voluntary code of practice covering the rehabilitation and release of badgers, and this has a precautionary approach aimed at minimising the risk of transmitting bovine tuberculosis (TB). All badgers to be relocated are tested for TB three times. Only animals testing negative to all three tests are released and any animal testing positive is euthanased. The code also requires that all released badgers are permanently marked (by a tattoo or microchip) and registered. The code is available via the internet at: http://www. badger.org.uk/action/badger-rehabilitation-protocol-contents.html
<P>

<a name="40106w10.html_para6">Under section 10 of the Act, licences may be issued to permit badgers to be taken from the wild (and relocated if necessary) for a limited range of specified purposes, including scientific investigation, preventing the spread of disease, and preventing serious damage to property.
<P>

<a name="40106w10.html_para7">Relocating badgers is only permitted where there is considered to be a very low risk of transmitting TB, and before any badgers are released at a new location all animals are tested three times for the disease. All badgers testing positive to any of the three tests, or in contact with a badger testing positive, are euthanased.
<P>

<a name="40106w10.html_para8">Badgers are not relocated as part of the Randomised Badger Culling Trial (the so-called Kreb's trial), and the Independent Scientific Group on Cattle TB have advised that are no special arrangements relating to the relocation of badgers in trial areas.

 No specific assessment has been undertaken of the impact of the CAP reform proposals on tenant farmers. However, we have assessed the impacts of the proposals on farming and other businesses generally in England, including an analysis by farm activity, and a summary of these is included in the Regulatory Impact Assessments which have been lodged in the House Libraries. An additional analysis looking at the impact on distribution of payments of various options for operating the Single Payment Scheme has also been carried out and a copy has been placed in the Library of the House. Our economists are continuing to analyse the potential impact of different methods of making the Single Payment.

As with the previous system, subsidy would be paid to the farmer, whether owner or tenant, will continue to hold the subsidy entitlement. Tenant farmers, along with other farmers, will therefore be free to produce what they judge the market wants and so be better able to cut costs and increase profits.

 The consumer cost of the CAP can be estimated by examining the difference between UK and world prices for agricultural food products. Our latest provisional estimates for 2002 show a cost of the CAP to consumers of around &#163;3.3 billion.
<P>

<a name="40106w10.html_para12">The notional taxpayer contribution to CAP expenditure can also be estimated though, in practice, UK taxpayers contribute to the whole EU budget rather than to specific components. We estimate that, in 2002, this notional cost to UK taxpayers of expenditure under the CAP was around &#163;3.5 billion.
<P>

<a name="40106w10.html_para13">The following table shows an approximate breakdown of consumer support between agricultural commodities. These estimates have, in the main, been compiled using the methodology utilised by the OECD to produce their estimates of the Consumer Support Estimate. It should be noted that the aggregate estimates will be more robust than estimates for the individual commodities. It is particularly difficult to determine the appropriate gap between UK and world prices for products whose specification varies, such as fruit and vegetables, or pigs, eggs and poultry.

 The cause of the error in the estimation of this year's crop areas has already been identified.

<a name="40106w11.html_wqn5"><B> Mrs. Spelman: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will list services offered by Envirowise that are not available from the private sector; what steps she has taken to invite the private sector to undertake services offered by Envirowise; and when they were taken.  [144577]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40106w11.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Envirowise provides a range of services to business to promote best practice in preventing and minimising waste in all its forms, reducing pollution and making the most effective use of resources. The programme provides the Environment and Energy Helpline; a dedicated website; best practice publications; and on-site visits. All of these services are provided free of charge to UK businesses.
<P>

<a name="40106w11.html_para2">The programme helps companies to recognise the need to improve their efficiency, and gives them sufficient information to start taking action. Companies may then either build on this activity themselves, or engage private sector service providers.
<P>

<a name="40106w11.html_para3">Envirowise services are delivered jointly by two private sector companies through a contract won in open tender, following an invitation to tender published in the <i>Official Journal</i> in August 1999. The contract requires more than 50 per cent. of the Programme to be sub-contracted, and the managing contractors use over 



<P>
<P><I>6 Jan 2004 : Column 257W</I><P>
200 other contractors each year. This includes over 80 specialist consultants on its Helpline panel, who are appointed through open tender every two years.

<a name="40106w11.html_wqn6"><B> Miss McIntosh: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs pursuant to her answer of 9 December, <i>Official Report</i>, column 378W, on flood protection, what the relationship of flood defence committees to internal drainage boards is.  [145038]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40106w11.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Environment Agency (EA) is the principal flood defence operating authority in England and Wales. Generally speaking, the EA is empowered under the Water Resources Act 1991 for managing flood risk arising from designated "main" rivers and the sea. The EA is also responsible for flood forecasting and flood warning dissemination, and for exercising a general supervision over matters relating to flood defence.
<P>

<a name="40106w11.html_para4">Regional Flood Defence Committees in England and Wales are made up of Defra, EA and Local Authority appointed members, and they are responsible for undertaking flood defence activities on behalf of the Environment Agency.
<P>

<a name="40106w11.html_para5">Internal drainage boards (IDBs) are statutory bodies, empowered under the Land Drainage Act 1991 to undertake flood defence works for watercourses which have not been designated as "main", in specified districts with special drainage needs.
<P>

<a name="40106w11.html_para6">Although there are no formal relationships or guidance for membership between the RFDCs and IDBs, there is nothing to stop an individual member occupying a position on the committee of both an RFDC and an IDB in their area, and in some instances this is the case.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what studies 



<P>
<P><I>6 Jan 2004 : Column 258W</I><P>
her Department has funded since 1997 into food miles; and what the conclusions and recommendations were.  [144558]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40106w11.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Defra has commissioned a group of researchers, led by AEA Technology, to examine the validity of food miles as a quantitative measure of progress in the sustainable development of the farming and food industries. This research is expected to be completed in spring 2004.
<P>

<a name="40106w11.html_para7">Defra has also contributed a small amount of funding, along with other stakeholders, to a Transport 2000 study to model various transport distribution scenarios for a 'basket' of three food products. The study examined whether a shift to sourcing these products more locally would lead to greater or fewer CO <sup>2</sup>  emissions in the supply chain overall. Transport 2000 has recently published the results of this work in "Wise Moves&#151;exploring the relationship between food, transport and CO2".

<P>
<a name="40106w11.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Bradshaw  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 15 December 2003]:</i> The farm gate and retail prices of conventionally grown foodstuffs for 2000 to 2002, where available, are shown in the table. Prices are not collected for English wine or brandy. Small quantities of cream and yoghurt are sold to the consumer at retail prices. The amount of processing taking place between farm gate and retail varies from commodity to commodity; an indication is given in the table. Farm gate prices include produce destined for highly processed food, which is normally lower quality and sells at a lower price.

<P>
<a name="40106w12.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Bradshaw  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 5 January 2004]:</i> To date, and from information held centrally, the Department has spent &#163;19.81 million on professional services investigating the validity of payment claims submitted by businesses for the &#163;1.3 billion expenditure on goods, services and works arising out of the 2001 foot and mouth disease outbreak.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40106w12.html_wqn1"><B> Brian Cotter: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs how many invoices have been settled after the due date by her Department in relation to work undertaken by businesses in connection with the foot and mouth crisis; what the combined value was of the original invoices submitted; and how much interest has been paid on these settlements in accordance with the Late Payment of Debt Act 1998.  [145320]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40106w12.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Bradshaw </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 5 January 2004]:</i> The Department believes that, on the basis of the professional advice it has received, in almost all cases, no due date has arisen because Defra has legitimate grounds for withholding payments. This includes instances where the due date has not yet arisen because the businesses have not provided sufficient and necessary evidence to enable their charges to be verified.
<P>

<a name="40106w12.html_para0">The Department's payment terms are the payment of valid invoices within 30 days of receipt and agreement of valid invoices for goods, services and works requested by the Department. The Department is disputing payment in those cases where it believes on the basis of the quantum, accounting, legal and technical advice it has received that it was overcharged for goods, services and works during the foot and mouth disease outbreak. In all other cases bar the one identified as follows, the Department believes it has paid businesses in 



<P>
<P><I>6 Jan 2004 : Column 260W</I><P>
accordance with contractually agreed terms for the goods, services and works provided in connection with the outbreak.
<P>

<a name="40106w12.html_para1">The Department believes that the direct cost to the public sector of the expenditure on goods, services and works during the outbreak was &#163;1.3 billion. The Department is still receiving invoices from contractors some 24 to 29 months after the outbreak in 2001. These are the subject of forensic examination and investigation.
<P>

<a name="40106w12.html_para2">To date, the Department has received 11 claims for interest allegedly due on the late payment of commercial debts. These total &#163;132,879.23. Applying the terms of the Late Payment of Commercial Debts (Interest) Act 1998 to these claims has resulted in the agreement and payment of &#163;4,057.90 of the claimed sum. All claims are considered on the facts of that claim.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs how many invoices submitted by businesses to her Department for work undertaken in connection with the foot and mouth crisis have not yet been paid; what the total value is of these unpaid invoices; and how many invoices have been outstanding for a period of more than <i>(a)</i> 30 days, <i>(b)</i> six months, <i>(c)</i> one year and <i>(d)</i> two years.  [145321]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40106w12.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Bradshaw </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 5 January 2004]:</i> Information as to how many invoices submitted to businesses for work undertaken in connection with the foot and mouth disease outbreak have not yet been paid can be provided only at disproportionate cost for the following reasons: the facts of each case are not necessarily similar; some contractors issued few large value invoices; some contractors issued significant numbers of lower value invoices; other contractors submitted statements of account or applications for interim payment; some invoices are rejected in their entirety; other invoices are rejected in part; forensic examination of contractor accounts focuses on the valuation of the entire account.
<P>

<a name="40106w12.html_para3">A large number of businesses received significant payments on account pending final verification of their charges. Other businesses were paid in full or partially 



<P>
<P><I>6 Jan 2004 : Column 261W</I><P>
paid in the honest belief at the time that their charges were valid only for subsequent examination and investigation to reveal that legitimate grounds existed and continue to exist for Defra seeking to recover these payments by way of restitutionary proceedings.
<P>

<a name="40106w12.html_para4">Currently, the Department is withholding &#163;55.698 million from businesses in connection with charges arising from the provision of goods services and works during the outbreak. This figure will increase as the Department is continuing to receive invoices from some contractors which the Department on the basis of forensic examination and investigation will not be accepting as valid.
<P>

<a name="40106w12.html_para5">As the Department has paid businesses on the basis of the contractual terms agreed it does not believe there are any valid unpaid and outstanding invoices, submitted by businesses to the Department, for work undertaken in connection with the foot and mouth outbreak.
<P>

<a name="40106w12.html_para6">The Department is disputing payment in those cases where it believes on the basis of the quantum, accounting, technical and legal advice it has received that it was overcharged for goods, services and works during the outbreak. In all other cases, the Department has paid businesses for the goods, services and works provided in connection with the outbreak in 2001.
<P>

<a name="40106w12.html_para7">The Department understands from the Forum of Private Business that the All Party Parliamentary Small Business Group has, or is collecting, evidence that 20 or so contractors are still owed in excess of &#163;10 million for goods, services and works claimed to have been provided during the outbreak in 2001. The Group has pledged it will write to the Department on these cases and Defra will respond once the evidence is to hand.

 Prophylactic vaccination remains prohibited under the new EU Directive 2003/85 on the control of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD). However, the Directive does give greater prominence to the potential use of emergency vaccination in the event of an outbreak.
<P>

<a name="40106w12.html_para11">The Government's response to the independent inquiries into the 2001 FMD outbreak acknowledged that emergency vaccination would be considered as part of the control strategy from the start of any future outbreak of FMD, where measures additional to culling of susceptible animals on infected premises and dangerous contacts were needed. The latest version of Defra's FMD Contingency Plan includes details on the arrangements that are in place to allow for emergency vaccination in a future outbreak.

 My right hon. Friend sees the Secretary of State for Transport frequently during which a range of topics is discussed. From July 2004, hazardous waste going to landfill will have to be treated to reduce its volume and/or its hazardous nature, facilitate its handling or enhance recovery.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40106w13.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Morley  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 9 December 2003]</i>: The decision to delay the implementation of the Landfill Allowance Trading Scheme until 2005 which was announced by the Minister of State for Local and Regional Government on 19 November 2003, was made to help reduce spending pressures on local government in 2004&#150;05. It does, however, reflect the views of local authorities which we have received through our consultation on the implementation of the Scheme, that they needed more time to prepare for this new Scheme which is a significant departure from their normal operations. The delay in starting the scheme will mean that waste disposal authorities will have to make steeper annual reductions in the amount of biodegradable waste they landfill in order to meet the first target year of 2010 but they will have more time to plan how to do this.

<P>

<P>
<a name="40106w13.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 No. The Government does not consider it appropriate to set a maximum price for allowances as this may lead to market distortion. However, the financial penalty for holding fewer allowances than the amount of biodegradable waste landfilled will act as a de-facto ceiling because local authorities are unlikely to purchase allowances if they cost more than the price of paying the penalty.

 It is still the intention that the National Fallen Stock Scheme should begin early in the new year. It is too early to judge the likely interest in participation, but the scheme has the full backing of the farming organisations and it should save money for farmers who would otherwise have to make their own disposal arrangements.

 Data on use of veterinary medicines is not normally collected, although the Veterinary Laboratories Agency (VLA) were involved in a survey on liver flukes and the use of flukicides in August 2002. The VLA have also conducted a number of related investigations over the past 20 years as part of MAFF and Defra funded research into resistance to anthelmintics. These have found that in the UK resistance is most commonly seen in sheep and goat nemotodes. Defra is currently funding a research project entitled "The development of computerised models for use in integrated parasite control strategies designed to optimise anthelmintic usage".
<P>

<a name="40106w14.html_para1">In addition, the sheep industry has been involved in producing some short-term strategies to slow the development of anthelmintic resistance in internal parasites of sheep in the UK and a leaflet on the subject is on the Defra website www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/diseases/control/parasite control.htm
<P>

<a name="40106w14.html_para2">In the sheep industry, anthelmintics are widely used because diseases such as parasitic gastroenteritis are economically important and avoidance of anthelmintic resistance is a high priority. The strategies aim to reduce use by means of more targeted applications, which at the same time may limit the development of resistance.
<P>

<a name="40106w14.html_para3">Before a marketing authorisation for a veterinary medicinal product is granted, applicants must submit data which among other requirements must demonstrate that the product is efficacious under the proposed dose regime. This is scientifically assessed and potential future resistance is considered as part of this assessment. There are currently some 300 medicinal products authorised as anthelmintics and an additional 11 which also are authorised as flukicides. Less than 60 per cent. of these are supplied under the Pharmacy and Merchants List. There is no evidence that the route of supply of individual products has any effect on resistance.

The visit has been the subject of misleading reports in the press. Boskoop, the main venue for sale of nursery stock in the Netherlands, was found to be fully compliant. At Aalsmeer, which is primarily a flower market, some consignments of plants were losing their plant passports when they were split up and sold on; a shortcoming which the Dutch plant heath authorities have agreed to address. Our surveillance of plants moving in trade, including those from the Netherlands, is being stepped up and plants found not to comply will continue to be destroyed.

<i>[holding answer 11 December 2003]:</i> Measures are already in place to help prevent garden centres and growers from importing plant material susceptible to the pathogen <i>Phytophthora ramorum</i>. These included, banning the import of host plants from affected areas of the USA and extending current controls on imported oak wood to include wood that comes from host trees in affected areas in the USA. All other susceptible plant material imported into the UK from third countries must be accompanied by a

<P>

<a name="40106w14.html_para8">The European Community's Standing Committee on Plant Health recently reviewed these measures and agreed that they should continue. Commission officials are now working on a draft to strengthen the current Decision. In addition, the UK will be stepping up its inspection of plant material entering the UK to ensure it complies with import arrangements. Any consignment entering the UK that is found not to possess the required documentation is destroyed.

 The protection of over one million hectares of England's finest wildlife and geological heritage in over 4,000 Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs) is an essential component of the Government's approach to conserving biodiversity, as set out in "Working with the Grain of Nature"&#151;the England biodiversity strategy.

 Dialogue on "Phytophthora ramorum" takes place between officials on a regular basis and particularly during discussion in the European Community's Standing Committee on Plant Health. It was as the result of collaboration between UK, Dutch and German plant health services that the risks were identified and emergency measures against the introduction and spread of "Phytophthora ramorum" introduced throughout the EU in November 2002. These measures were reviewed by the Standing Committee on 11 December. Following the findings of the disease in tree species the UK made very clear its concerns about the spread of this disease and agreement was reached for the control measures to continue.

 The plant health group at Defra's Central Science Laboratory is an important part of the UK's plant health service. The Laboratory confirmed the first finding of "Phytophthora ramorum" in the UK in April 2002. Their scientific assessment of risk and input into discussions on exclusion, eradication and containment is a continuous process and has proved invaluable in formulating our views on this particular disease since the risk was first identified in 2001. They are also involved in or leading many of the research projects which will help the development of plant health policy, risk management, and decisions on action taken. In many aspects of this work they collaborate closely with the Forest Research Agency.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40106w15.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Phytophthora ramorum was first described as a new species in October 2001 and first found in the UK in April 2002. Surveys are being conducted to establish how widespread the disease is and this may give an indication of how many years it may have been present. There have been over 300 outbreaks of Phytophthora ramorum found in England and Wales, mostly on rhododendrons and viburnums. In 70 per cent. of these cases the plants were of UK origin. In most of the other cases plants had been imported from other EC member states. In each of the cases on trees, there had already been findings of the disease nearby on plants of the rhododendron family.
<P>

<a name="40106w15.html_para6">The current scientific view is that the pathogen was probably introduced separately to California and to Europe from its place of origin, possibly the Far East.

<a name="40106w15.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Fortunately, there are only a few indigenous tree diseases which can affect oak trees to any significant extent. The main one is known as oak dieback, a complex disease in which a number of damaging agents interact to bring about a deterioration in tree condition. The Forestry Commission's Forest Research Agency is participating in a wide ranging European research programme which aims to gain new insights into the disease. The principal effort is being directed towards understanding the importance of the killing of fine roots by fungi in the genus Phytophthora. Further details are given in the commission's information note 'Dieback of Pendunculate Oak' which can be seen on the commission's website, www.forestry.gov.uk.

If infected plants are found in nurseries or garden centres during these inspections or surveys the legislation allows Inspectors to serve notice requiring the material to be destroyed along with any plants of susceptible species within 2 metres. Susceptible plants within 10 metres are placed on hold for a period to ascertain whether the disease is present before they can be moved.

<P>

<a name="40106w16.html_para3">Attributing reductions in global warming (reductions in greenhouse gas emissions) to increases in recycling rate is an extremely complex area of research due to the number of variables to be taken into account.

This initial assessment also suggests

<P><I>6 Jan 2004 : Column 275W</I><P>
that if 30 per cent. of municipal solid waste is recycled in 2010 a reduction of approximately 10&#150;15 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent gas could be achieved in the world.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what provisions have been made to include education programmes in strategies designed to cope with anti-social behaviour.  [144093]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40106w17.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 Education-related programmes play a crucial part in our drive to tackle anti-social behaviour in three ways.
<P>

<a name="40106w17.html_para4">The first is through the school curriculum, where pupils learn about socially responsible behaviour as part of Citizenship education. This is a statutory subject in secondary schools. Schools receive guidance on helping pupils to understand the impact of anti-social behaviour and deal with it assertively.
<P>

<a name="40106w17.html_para5">The second is through a range of measures to reduce truancy, improve pupil behaviour in schools and reinforce parental responsibility for their children's behaviour in schools. They include national truancy sweeps, fast track to prosecution for truancy, in-school Learning Support Units, multi-agency Behaviour and Education Support Teams, key workers for children at risk of crime, police in schools and positive activity programmes in the school holidays. In addition the Anti-Social Behaviour Act, which comes into force at the end of February, will introduce penalty notices for truancy, parenting contracts for truancy and parenting contracts and orders for bad behaviour in schools.
<P>

<a name="40106w17.html_para6">The third is through services for young people beyond the school. The Connexions service provides access to personal development opportunities to broaden horizons and develop talents. The Youth service develops young people's ability to make responsible choices and engage constructively with their community. Both services help young people to develop their ability to cope with the issues which affect them and to avoid falling into anti-social behaviour.

 The Department has had discussions with a range of companies about supporting schools to improve numeracy and financial literacy, but none specifically in relation to the child trust fund. Personal finance education is covered in the curriculum as part of the Personal, Social and Health Education (PSHE) and Citizenship framework, and through subjects such as mathematics. Guidance issued in July 2000 encourages schools to involve local banks and building societies who may be able to provide resources or advice.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. The figures shown in the table have previously been published as part of the Department's Comparative Tables and reflect the methods of calculation underlying the comparative tables for each year. This means that they incorporate various adjustments which were made in some or all of these years. For the years 1999&#150;2000, 2000&#150;01, 2001&#150;02 and 2002&#150;03, the published comparative tables included information on the level of financial delegation direct to schools by LEAs. The measurement of these levels of delegation were associated with the achievement of delegation targets by LEAs. For each of those years, the average level of delegation stood at 82.4 per cent., 84 per cent., 86.3 per cent. and 87.2 per cent. respectively. The corresponding percentage for 1997&#150;98 was about 79 per cent.<P>

2. The Department does not hold any comparable data for 2003&#150;04. With the Education Act 2002 came the introduction of separate LEA and schools budgets, the establishment of schools forums and the introduction of a reserve power which enables the Secretary of State, in exceptional cases, to set a minimum level for an LEA's local schools budget. As a result, Ministers decided not to set delegation targets of the kind which had operated since 1999.<P>

3. Only about one-tenth of the funding retained centrally by LEAs relates to "central administration". Most of it relates to such items as school transport (about one-fifth of the total retained centrally); special educational needs (SEN); out-of-school education and behaviour support; and school improvement.<P>

 The Department does not fund schools directly. Local education authorities receive funding through revenue support grant through the calculation of Education Formula Spending Shares for early years provision. The under-five sub-block in the Education Formula Spending Share calculation for 2003&#150;04 was &#163;2.6 billion. However, this funding is unhypothecated and it is for LEAs to decide how much to spend on early

 The Government encourages the use of family mediation as an alternative to court proceedings in appropriate cases. Mediation can be particularly beneficial in resolving disputes over child contact. Public funding for family mediation was introduced under the provisions of Part III of the Family Law Act 1996. The Legal Services Commission began contracting with mediation services for the provision of publicly funded family mediation in March 1997. Contracts were completed in all areas in March 2000 and publicly funded family mediation is now available throughout England and Wales.

<P>
<a name="40106w19.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Stephen Twigg: </B> 
 Food in Schools is a joint Department for Education and Skills (DfES)/Department of Health (DH) programme. Funding for the DfES strand of Food in Schools (April 2001&#151;March 2004) is &#163;545,000, while the DH strand has been allocated &#163;2 million (April 2001&#151;February 2005). Food in Schools aims to bring together all food related activities in schools, including training for teachers, and to help them work towards the National Healthy Schools Standard.

 I am aware of no such representations. We maintain regular contact with the Design and Technology Association (DATA), the professional association for food technology teachers.

 Through the Choice Protects Programme and the consultation on the 'Supporting foster carers' section of the Green Paper, 'Every Child Matters' we are consulting widely with a range of stakeholders about support for foster carers. Choice Protects is also investing &#163;113 million over three years to expand and strengthen fostering services.

<P>
<a name="40106w19.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 My Department actively supports and encourages payroll giving. Along with volunteering and charitable donations, staff can choose up to eight charities to make regular donations through the payroll system. There are currently 266 (5.7 per cent.) of my staff participating in the Payroll Giving Scheme raising a total of &#163;27,023 per annum.
<P>

<a name="40106w19.html_para7">We are working with the Giving Campaign to increase the number of contributing employees to around 10 per cent.

<a name="40106w20.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 For 2003 and previous years there has been no readily available means of identifying pupils who took individual subjects or all three Key Stage 3 tests early. However, from 2004 onwards it will be

<P>

<a name="40106w20.html_para1">Data from lessons observed by Ofsted shows that there has been overall increase in setting at Key Stage 3 from 32 per cent. in 1998/99 to 36 per cent. in 2001/02. Setting has also increased within subjects at Key Stage 3 over the same period, although the extent of the increases varies from subject to subject.
<P>

<a name="40106w20.html_para2">It is not possible for the Department to determine readily whether schools' decisions to enter their pupils for the Key Stage 3 tests early, or increases in the use of setting, have been influenced by national or local initiatives or which of those may have been contributing factors. It is for schools to make decisions about early test entry and whether and how to use pupil grouping to best meet the learning needs of their pupils, although through the Primary and Key Stage 3 Strategies and in our Gifted and Talented programme we will continue to offer guidance and support on classroom practice. We are also exploring through a small project different models for a shorter Key Stage 3, designed to promote pupil motivation, engagement and progression, and to open up curricular flexibilities pre and post-14 through completion of the Key Stage 3 programme of study in two years.

 The Children Act Sub-Committee published their report, "Making Contact Work", in February 2002. The then Lord Chancellor's Department published its interim response in August 2002. Following the Machinery of Government changes last year, I now have lead responsibility for child contact issues. We continue to view children's interests as being paramount and we want to encourage contact between children and non-resident parents where it is in the best interest of the child and safe for all family members.

Friends in the Department for Constitutional Affairs, we are considering carefully how the family justice system and related children's services can better meet the needs of all children and their parents following relationship breakdown. We want to ensure that better outcomes are achieved for children by, where possible, helping parents agree contact arrangements without the intervention of the courts. We expect to conclude these considerations early in the New Year and that the Government's response to "Making Contact Work" will then be published.

<i>[holding answer 5 January 2004]:</i> The Government do not determine how much each school or LEA spends on musical instruments, nor do we collect information on how many children have access to a musical instrument.
<P>

<a name="40106w20.html_para4">Since 1999, every local education authority has received Music Standards Fund (MSF) which can be spent in any way that enhances opportunities for pupils to access musical education of high quality. In the vast majority of authorities, this will include specialist instrumental tuition outside of the National Curriculum. According to a recent Survey of LEA Music Services <sup>1</sup>  commissioned by DfES, at any moment in time, on average 8 per cent. of pupils will be receiving regular instrumental lessons through their LEA, although many more will be learning music in the classroom or in their own time.
<P>

<a name="40106w20.html_para5">The introduction of MSF in 1999 to protect and expand LEA Music Services has caused a major upturn in music provision. Between 1999 and 2004, some &#163;270 million will have gone to LEA Music Services.
<P>

<a name="40106w20.html_para6">In addition, we have pledged that, over time, all primary school pupils who want to should have an opportunity to learn a musical instrument. Ofsted are currently evaluating 12 pilots which aim to model how specialist instrumental tuition can be integrated with classroom music teaching. The results of the evaluation will be published later this year.

 The 2002 Key Stage 2 targets for 80 per cent. of 11 year olds to reach level 4+ in English and 75 per cent. of 11 year olds to reach level 4+ in mathematics were set in 1997.

The total funding available (including matched funding) to local education authorities in England through the Standards Fund to support the implementation of the strategies in each financial year since 1998&#150;99 was as follows:

<P>
<P>
<a name="40106w21.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Woodward: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what measures the Government will put in place to tackle arson attacks on school premises in the next three years.  [146111]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40106w21.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 The Department takes the problem of arson in schools very seriously and in 2000 issued the guide Fire Safety, which includes advice on how to reduce the risks of arson attacks. This complements our guidance on reducing crime in schools, such as the booklet "Improving Security in Schools" and the video "Can You See What They See?" We also have a school security website that is regularly updated&#151;www.dfes. gov.uk/schoolsecurity. We now have consultants working on a new, and more comprehensive fire safety guidance document for schools. It covers risk assessments and will include advice on security and the prevention of arson. We anticipate that the document will be subject to public consultation early in 2004.
<P>

<a name="40106w21.html_para2">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM) has general responsibility for fire safety and arson and we have been looking at how the two departments can work more closely on the issue of fire safety in schools. ODPM officials now attend the Department's Working Group on School Security, while we have recently accepted an invitation to send a representative to meetings of the Arson Control Forum, which remains the national strategic body for addressing the wider arson problem. This should help us to consider how best to promote school arson prevention initiatives among schools and local education authorities.
<P>

<a name="40106w21.html_para3">Officials from my Department also sit on the Arson in Schools Working Group, a group of experts representing the insurance industry, the fire and police services, local authorities and government departments. One of its outputs has been the publication of the guide "How to Combat Arson in Schools", which is available free and has been well received by schools.
<P>

<a name="40106w21.html_para4">Of course if a fire should happen in a school, the Department's primary concern is for the safety of pupils, teachers and other users. Regulation 17 of the Education (School Premises) Regulations 1999 requires that every part of a school building, and of the land provided for a school, shall be such that the safe escape of the occupants in case of fire is reasonably assured. Schools are also covered by the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 and by subsequent related regulations. These include aspects of fire safety.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills when the draft bill on school transport will be published; what its principal provisions will be; what assessment has been made of the impact it will have on policies relating to transport to denominational schools of pupils of that denomination; what assessment has been made of the financial implications of the bill for <i>(a)</i> parents, <i>(b)</i> schools and <i>(c)</i> local education authorities; what assessment has been made of the effect it will have on the current providers of school transport; whether any of the 



<P>
<P><I>6 Jan 2004 : Column 300W</I><P>
proposed changes will take place on a pilot basis; and what consultations have been undertaken by the Department.  [142786]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40106w21.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 8 December 2003]:</i> In September 2003 the Secretary of State for Transport and I published 'Travelling to School: an action plan'. It consulted on measures to cut congestion and pollution and promote healthier travel alternatives for pupils travelling to and from school, including plans for piloting new arrangements for school transport in a small number of exemplar authorities.
<P>

<a name="40106w21.html_para5">The draft school transport bill will invite local education authorities to run up to 12 pilot schemes providing flexible, safe, transport choices for pupils and parents. Pilot areas will be required to look at the needs of all pupils, not just those entitled to free transport, and pilots should reduce car use on the school run. We would particularly welcome bids that seek to support pupils travelling to denominational schools.
<P>

<a name="40106w21.html_para6">We will publish a draft regulatory impact assessment alongside the draft bill: it will consider the financial implications for parents, schools, local education authorities and current providers of home to school transport. Whilst precise financial assessments can not be made until we know what proposals are put forward the financial implications will be considered as part of the selection and subsequent evaluation of pilot areas.
<P>

<a name="40106w21.html_para7">We consulted on outline proposals in "Travelling to School: an action plan" and will consult on the draft bill and proposals for implementation in early 2004.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40106w21.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Stephen Twigg: </B> 
 We have no plans to change the school transport legislation to require local education authorities (LEAs) to provide free school transport for pupils whose families wish to exercise a choice not to attend a faith school and who have to travel outside their catchment area. LEAs may choose to provide free or subsidised transport for pupils attending faith schools, or for pupils whose parents wish them not to attend a faith school, using their discretion to operate policies that meet the needs of their local communities.

is the national campaign which targets young people, and improved availability of sexual health services and access to them.
<P>

<a name="40106w21.html_para8">Teaching about sexual health and safer sex are key elements of the Government's sexual health strategy and are covered by our Sex and Relationship Education (SRE) Guidance which was sent to all schools in July 2000. Through SRE pupils learn about sexual health, contraception and the range of advice and support services which are available. Young people should be made aware of the risks of contracting a STI and know about prevention, diagnosis and treatment.

Some Connexions Partnerships in the region are funding joint events with youth councils and one has dedicated &#163;5,000 for the development of youth councils in three Districts.

 The dosing instructions for Levonelle (levonorgestrel 0.75mg) were revised recently to recommend that two tablets should be taken at the same time; previously one tablet was taken with the second tablet 12 hours later. There has been no increase in the dosage as the quantity of levonorgestrel ingested remains the same. This followed advice from the Committee on Safety of Medicines who were satisfied as to the safety and efficacy of this revised regimen and the likely improved compliance. The pivotal evidence in support of the change is a World Health Organisation sponsored study evaluating 4,136 women aged between 14 and 52 years (mean age 27 years) who attended family planning clinics requesting emergency contraception. In excess of 2,700 women were given levonorgestrel, and of these, 439 were teenage girls. Side-effects were minor and no significant difference in the proportion of women developing side-effects was noted between the women taking two levonorgestrel tablets at the same time and those who took them 12 hours apart.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40106w24.html_spnew8"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 The control of medicines advertising is based on a long established system of self regulation underpinned by the statutory role of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). There are two main industry self regulatory bodies, the Prescription Medicines Code of Practice Authority (PMCPA) and Proprietary Association of Great Britain (PAGB). Both operate codes of practice for advertising of medicines and systems for investigating complaints against their codes. Advertising by PAGB member companies aimed at the public is pre-vetted by the PAGB prior to publication. There are also general controls on non-broadcast and broadcast advertising operated by the Advertising Standards Authority and the Office of Communications.
<P>

<a name="40106w24.html_para2">Investigation of complaints and routine scrutiny of published advertising for medicines, concentrating on newly licensed products, provide an ongoing check on the effectiveness of the self-regulatory systems for medicines advertising. The MHRA meets regularly with the regulatory and self regulatory bodies to discuss current issues in medicines advertising.
<P>

<a name="40106w24.html_para3">The MHRA investigates all complaints received about advertising against the requirements set out in the Medicines (Advertising) Regulations 1994. In 2002&#150;03, 157 complaints about medicines advertising were investigated including 93 from health professionals, 16 from pharmaceutical companies and 48 from members of the public. The number of advertisements found to be in breach of the Regulations following investigation by the MHRA were 104 in 2001, 85 in 2002 and 108 in 2003. One quarter concerned advertisements aimed at health professionals and the remainder at the public. Information is not collected by the Agency on the length of time the advertisements had been running before being withdrawn.
<P>

<a name="40106w24.html_para4">The primary sanction employed where advertising is considered to breach the Regulations is to require immediate withdrawal and amendment of the material. Additionally, in three cases in 2001, one in 2002 and five in 2003, all subsequent material was required to be submitted for pre-vetting. In 13 cases the company was required to issue a corrective statement, one in 2001, one in 2002 and 11 in 2003. One case was referred for enforcement action in 2001 and two in 2003. A public statement was also recently made on the outcome of three investigations into inducements to pharmacists.
<P>

<a name="40106w24.html_para5">The MHRA has published criteria in Guidance Note 23&#151;Advertising and Promotion of medicines in the UK (a copy of which is available in the Library) based on which it will consider requiring advertising material to be submitted for pre-vetting, including:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(i) where a newly licensed product, subject to intensive monitoring, is placed on the market;
<P>

<a name="40106w24.html_para6">A recent internal MHRA review considered the procedures of the advertising unit in the regulation of advertising for medicines in the UK. It identified measures to increase and improve the targeting of pre-vetting, increase the use of corrective statements for misleading advertising, take rapid action on complaints prioritising those from health professionals and increase transparency by the publication of reports on completed actions on complaints. The outcome of the review was endorsed by the Medicines Commission and has been submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal. A copy of the report has also been placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="40106w24.html_para7">The MHRA employs four staff whose primary role is to regulate advertising for medicines, including investigation of breaches of the Medicines (Advertising) Regulations 1994. These staff draw on the wider resources of the MHRA to provide additional specialist advice on advertising casework as required. The MHRA anticipates that it will be able to manage any increase in the requirement for pre-vetting due to increases in reclassification from prescription only to over-the-counter status from within its existing resources.
<P>

<a name="40106w24.html_para8">The National Audit Office and the Public Accounts Committee recently scrutinised the work of the MHRA, including its role in reviewing medicines advertising and promotion but did not make any recommendations in this area nor suggest any further review was necessary. The recent initiative to publish on the MHRA website the outcome of complaints investigations will increase the transparency of the MHRA's role in enforcing the regulations on advertising and promotion of medicines.

 The national breast and cervical screening programmes operate in each strategic health authority area. A number of other national screening programmes are currently being developed. These include screening for Down's syndrome where presently 75 per cent. of maternity units have a screening programme in place. 210,000 babies have been screened under the newborn hearing screening programme since it started. Newborn screening for sickle cell disease is in place in London and West Midlands. Raising public and professional awareness is a key aspect in the development of all screening programmes. Funding to implement screening programmes is mostly included in baseline financial allocations to primary care trusts. In keeping with the decision to enable local PCTs to decide their priorities in the light of their own needs, PCTs decide the allocation of resources locally.

 The Home Office and the Government Office in the North East Region (GONE), are working with Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships (CDRPs) and Drug Action Teams (DATs) to ensure the further integration of their work. Guidance on integration was issued to CDRPs and DATs in November 2003. The aim is to simplify local working relationships, give greater recognition to common interests and provide the right framework to enable the effective delivery of the crime reduction and drugs agendas. The crime and drugs teams have been fully integrated within GONE since June 2002.

 Effective data exchange and analysis is a prerequisite of productive partnership working and crime reduction. Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships (CDRP) are encouraged to share information to tackle crime and criminality more effectively within their partnership.

<a name="40106w25.html_para25">Improved information sharing in Middlesbrough, South and Cleveland, East and across the north-east has allowed the effective targeting of a number of known criminals. This has contributed to significant reductions in burglary and vehicle crime in the area, especially in Middlesbrough, where burglary fell 22.9 per cent., thefts of motor vehicles fell 15.9 per cent. and thefts from motor vehicles fell 5.6 per cent. between 2001&#150;02 and 2002&#150;03.

 In November 2000, after carefully considering the arguments for an independent judicial inquiry into the matters raised in "Diaries of Despair", the Uncaged Campaigns report on the Imutran xenotransplantation research carried out at Huntingdon Life Sciences, the then Home Secretary (Jack Straw) asked the Chief Inspector of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Inspectorate to examine the available evidence relating to compliance with the authorities granted to Imutran Limited under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. This compliance review was undertaken as part of the Inspectorate's routine statutory inspection and reporting function. The Chief Inspector's report was published on 13 July 2001 and is available on the Home Office website. Copies were also placed in the House Library.The Chief Inspector's review covered five years of work, involving many thousands of scientific procedures. The review took around 300 man-hours to complete and included scrutiny of all study documents, including material not available during the normal inspection process. The Chief Inspector's findings confirmed that the general level of compliance was good. He also identified five instances of non-compliance by the surgical team. Three 



<P>
<P><I>6 Jan 2004 : Column 323W</I><P>
of these were already known to the Home Office and were dealt with in 1997. Neither of the two new infringements merited prosecution and both were dealt with by issuing letters of admonition to those responsible.

However, all subsequent representations and evidence received by the Home Office regarding the Imutran research have been thoroughly and carefully considered and full answers have been provided to them. This includes additional papers published in 2003 by Uncaged Campaigns on its website. All of these papers, and more, were available when the chief inspector carried out his compliance review. They provide no new insights into these matters, nor do we accept that they call into question Home Office conduct or regulation of the Imutran research in any way.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what plans he has to ensure that there is a new timetable for an improvement in the quality of police files in Gloucestershire by means of Crown Prosecution Service participation in police training.  [144015]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40106w27.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 Senior crown prosecutors, including the Chief Crown Prosecutor, have participated in 20 police training exercises in Gloucestershire between August and December 2003. This training has covered a number of issues including: the new charging arrangements; evidential requirements in racially aggravated offences; police file preparation and management; disclosure issues; and identification evidence.
<P>

<a name="40106w27.html_para4">The result of those training exercises is being evaluated and there are plans for a limited number of further training exercises in January and February next year and it is likely the police Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) training programme will be reviewed again at that point with a view to further joint CPS/police training during next year.
<P>

<a name="40106w27.html_para5">There have also been selective police/CPS training exercises designed to improve the quality of files in particularly troublesome cases and these have included rape offences and racially aggravated offences.

 <i>[holding answer 5 December 2003]:</i> Sections of the M20 and M26 motorways were closed to traffic at 10.30pm on 15 December and reopened at 7am on 16 December.
<P>

<a name="40106w27.html_para6">The closure was necessary to enable the police to undertake a full investigation into the three deaths which unfortunately occurred as a result of an accident there.
<P>

<a name="40106w27.html_para7">The length of such investigations is affected, for example, by the need to ensure that small items of evidence are not overlooked, or where artificial light may not be adequate for the proper identification and interpretation of tyre marks, or other vehicles need to be prevented from destroying or obliterating evidence by passing over it.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what requirements need to be satisfied in order to issue a Risk of Sexual Harm Order.  [143479]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40106w27.html_spnew7"><B> Paul Goggins: </B> 
 The Risk of Sexual Harm Order (RSHO) is a new civil preventative order which is being introduced in the Sexual Offences Act 2003. RSHOs will be available in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. The RSHO is designed to protect children aged under 16 (17 in Northern Ireland) from sexual harm by adults. We know that some abusers try to prepare children for sexual activity by exposing them to sexually explicit language or images. The RSHO is intended to help the police to prevent such behaviour.
<P>

<a name="40106w27.html_para8">A Chief Officer of police will be able to apply for, and a court will be able to make, a RSHO in respect of a person aged 18 or over where it appears they have, on at least two occasions either:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) engaged in sexual activity involving a child or in the presence of a child;
<P>
<BR>
(b) caused or incited a child to watch a person engage in sexual activity or to look at a moving or still image that is sexual;
<P>
<BR>
(c) given a child anything that relates to sexual activity or contains a reference to such activity;
<P>
<BR>
(d) communicated with a child, where any part of the communication is sexual;
<P>
<BR>
And a RSHO is necessary to protect a child (or children) from sexual harm from the defendant.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="40106w27.html_para9">An application for an order will be by complaint to a magistrates court. The behaviour on which the application for a RSHO is based need not amount, in itself, to a criminal offence and the defendant does not need to have a previous conviction for a sexual (or any other) offence.
<P>

<a name="40106w27.html_para10">A RSHO may prohibit the defendant from doing anything which is necessary to protect a particular child, a group of children or children in general from sexual harm. The order will last for a fixed period of at least two years, or until further notice.




<P>
<P><I>6 Jan 2004 : Column 327W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="40106w27.html_para11">Interim RSHOs will be available to allow prohibitions to be put in place prior to the main application for a RSHO being determined. RSHOs, and interim RSHOs, can be varied, renewed or discharged on further application to the magistrates court by either a chief officer of police or defendant.
<P>

<a name="40106w27.html_para12">The defendant may appeal to the Crown court against the making of a RSHO or interim RSHO or any order made by a court to vary, renew or discharge a RSHO or interim RSHO.
<P>

<a name="40106w27.html_para13">A breach, without reasonable excuse, of any prohibition contained in a RSHO or interim RSHO will be a criminal offence punishable by up to five years imprisonment.

 Since 1990, employers in Northern Ireland, including the Northern Ireland Civil Service (NICS), have had a legal duty under fair employment legislation to monitor the community background of their workforces and of those applying to fill vacancies.
<P>

<a name="40106w28.html_para7">The legislation requires the NICS to ask applicants, in writing, whether they belong to the Protestant or the Roman Catholic community or to neither community.

 From August 2004, doctors in training will become subject to the working restrictions applicable under the European Working Time Directive. A substantial programme of work is under way, in partnership with the HPSS Boards and Trusts here, to ensure compliance with this Directive across all employing organisations, and all specialties within each organisation.
<P>

<a name="40106w28.html_para9">Trusts have been asked to provide action plans showing how they will achieve compliance with the EWTD by August 2004.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40106w29.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B>

[145314]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40106w29.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The information is not available in the format requested as works required to be carried out in a Disabled Facilities Grant (DFG) application are not recorded separately. DFG covers a wide range of works for access to and around a house as well as facilities within a house. Where a heating upgrade is required this is likely to form only a small part of the works required.
<P>

<a name="40106w29.html_para1">In DFG cases generally, the average time taken from date of receipt of preliminary inquiry to the issue of schedule of works for DFGs in the year up to the end of October 2003 was 278 days. This figure includes the time for the occupational therapist's assessment, which took an average of 192 days.
<P>

<a name="40106w29.html_para2">Once the applicant has decided to proceed with the grant application, the average time from the receipt of completed documentation to the issue of formal approval, including the test of resources, was 131 days.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40106w29.html_spnew2"><B> Angela Smith: </B> 
 Having carefully considered all the objections to the proposed ban, I have decided to proceed with making a Special Protection Order, under the Game Preservation Act (NI) 1928, which will impose a ban on the killing, taking, sale or purchase of Irish Hares with effect from 19 January 2004 for a period of one year.
<P>

<a name="40106w29.html_para4">This temporary ban is a precautionary measure which will allow the Department of the Environment the opportunity to conduct further detailed research on the Irish Hare in early 2004. The results of this research work will inform the Department's conclusions on the level of protection required for the Irish Hare, as part of a current overall review of the Wildlife (NI) Order 1985. This review will consider the status of several species of animals, birds and plants, with a view to providing adequate protection for a wide range of Northern Ireland's varied wildlife.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40106w29.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The Northern Ireland Housing Executive has 209 properties in the Portstewart area and has identified a requirement for an additional 22 houses that will be built by Housing Associations. Some sites for these properties have already been acquired and four houses have been built while eight are programmed to start in 2004&#150;05.

<a name="40106w29.html_para5">Progress is monitored and reported annually.

<P>

<a name="40106w29.html_para6">In terms of social housing, the Net Stock Model&#151;the basis for calculating the number of social houses to be built has identified a need for some 1,500 annually.

As Jobcentre Plus is an Executive Agency, the Secretary of State has asked me to reply direct to your question on the number of physical and non-physical assaults there have been on staff in the Employment Service, Benefits Agency and Jobcentre Plus in each year since 2001 and how many prosecutions and penalties resulted. This is something that falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of the Agency.

Physical contact is when a customer directly touches a member of staff with or without an object. It includes striking, pushing, spitting and throwing of objects&#151;large or small. Non-physical contact mainly involves verbal abuse but can include throwing of objects that miss or hit screens.
<BR>
Historically there has been under-reporting of incidents. Increased awareness of Health and Safety and encouragement by management and trade unions to report incidents have contributed to the increased number of incidents being notified.
<BR>
Information on prosecutions and penalties since Jobcentre Plus came into existence is shown in the table below. We do not have information available for 2001. Data on penalties indicates the number of banning orders imposed on customers who have a history of behaving in an unacceptable manner. Banning orders prevent these customers from entering any Jobcentre Plus premises.

<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Jobcentre Plus Implementation Programme for Hampshire commenced in June 2002.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>It was clear throughout this process that the site, though suitable for the delivery of the new Jobcentre Plus services, would not be big enough to house all of the staff currently working in Fareham. Therefore, the premises at 187&#150;199 West Street, formerly the Jobcentre, was retained as an "overspill" site. Further acquisitions, together with other new Jobcentre Plus sites that open during the coming months, may influence space requirements across Hampshire and the Isle of Wight.

In accordance with the requirements of Resource Accounting and Budgeting the Department now accounts for its administration and benefit expenditure by Strategic Objective, as set out in its Public Service Agreements (PSA), and by individual requests for Resources (RfRs) as set out in the Departmental Estimates and Accounts. This means that the Department is unable to identify the administrative costs of individual activities within the delivery of specific benefits.

 Under the Draft Mental Incapacity Bill, an individual will be able to create a Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA).

<a name="40106w31.html_para1">In making an LPA, individuals will have choice on who they appoint as an attorney&#151;there is no limitation to a parent, sibling or peer. The important factor is that the individual chooses someone that they know and trust.

 Under the Draft Mental Incapacity Bill, the Court of Protection will be available to deal with cases of dispute which cannot be resolved in any other way.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister in relation to the Fire Service College, Moreton-in-Marsh, what the total Government grant was in the last financial year; for what purposes it was given; for what reason the college made a loss in the last financial year; and why the annual accounts for the year ended March 2003 state that the college is unlikely to do better than break-even in the year to 31 March 2004.

 Grant totalling &#163;625,000 was paid to the Fire Service College in 2002&#150;03, for the Brigade Command Course. The College's ability to trade in both the latter part of 2002&#150;03 and the first quarter of 2003&#150;04 was adversely affected by the fire dispute, which resulted in the cancellation of courses. Overseas trading by the College was also constrained by the international situation. The introduction of the Integrated Personal Development System (IPDS) in the UK Fire and Rescue Service from November 2003 is requiring the development of a new suite of IPDS-compliant training courses by the College to replace traditional courses. This has caused some disruption in business as fire and rescue services adapted to the new requirements and delayed the take-up of some College training capacity this year.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister how many new or additional homes he expects to be provided in <i>(a)</i> the South East and <i>(b)</i> the South West by the end of 2006; and how many of these homes he expects to be available at affordable prices for households on average income.  [145752]<P>

<P>
<a name="40106w32.html_spnew6"><B> Keith Hill: </B> 
 Regional Planning Guidance 9 for the South East and 10 for the South West each require, over the six year period to the end of 2006 for approximately 234,000 and 121,000 additional dwellings to be provided in the wider South East (including Bedfordshire, Essex and Hertfordshire) and the South West respectively. Of these the indicative targets in the two RPGs indicate that at least 108,000 and 36,000 additional dwellings should be provided over this period at affordable prices for households on or below average income.

<a name="40106w32.html_spnew7"><B> Keith Hill: </B> 
 There is no specified minimum distance that has to be maintained between a nuclear power station and another industrial structure that is not a part of the power station plant. The decision on whether any proposed development should be permitted to take place within the vicinity of a nuclear power station is a matter for the local planning authority, taking advice from the Health and Safety Executive on the suitability of the development with regard to the potential off-site risk.

<P>

 The Regional Housing Boards were asked to identify each region's priorities in line with their Regional Housing Strategies. These were drawn up by those organisations represented on the Board, in full consultation with key regional stakeholders. The priorities reflect not only regionally identified issues, but also national policies. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has allocated nearly &#163;5 billion for next year and the year after to address the priorities set out in the Regional Housing Strategies.
