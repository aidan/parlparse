<a name="20122w01.html_para1">I regret that the information is not available in the form requested, but the following is readily available.
<P>

<a name="20122w01.html_para2">The first Members moved into the building in September 2000 and it was fully occupied at the beginning of January before the official opening in February 2001.
<P>

<a name="20122w01.html_para3">Maintenance costs in the current financial year, including VAT, total &#163;650,000 to the end of December, which is in budget.
<P>

<a name="20122w01.html_para4">It has been necessary to enhance the capacity of the fan in the extract system from the cooking ranges, to replace three broken panels in the courtyard roof and to alter the interface with the window blinds. There is continuing work on the borehole to prevent silt entering the cooling system; to the lifts that run between the kitchens; and to the water feature. In each instance questions of liability for the costs are the subject of discussions with the contractor and/or the designer.

<a name="20122w01.html_para5">The majority of the changes requested by hon. Members and their staff have been for furniture additional to or different from the standard range available for the building. In the main these have been met from the furniture bought as part of the project but a further &#163;3,800 has been spent. In some cases there have also been consequent minor changes to the power sockets. The only other change has been the conversion of cupboards to book/display cases in a limited number of rooms where none was provided and the removal of intrusive lightshelves from the fifth floor corner offices. The cost is some &#163;20,000.

 We are willing to consider funding any well designed programmes which are likely to deliver tangible benefits to ordinary Sudanese people. We shall continue to give priority to those programmes that address the most urgent needs.
<P>

<a name="20122w01.html_para6">We are convinced that real sustained improvements in these sectors will only be possible when there is a settlement to the civil war. We are committed to doing what we can to bring this about.

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what assessment she has made of the prospects for progress in promoting peace and good governance in Sudan; if she will make a statement on international efforts to resolve the conflict in that country; and what proposals she has for work to stimulate peace and reconciliation and the strengthening of civil society in Sudan.  [28712]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20122w01.html_spnew7"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 There is an opportunity to achieve a political settlement to the war in Sudan. During my recent visit all sides emphasised that they recognised the urgent need for peace, that it was their responsibility to engage in serious negotiation, and that there was a window of opportunity.
<P>

<a name="20122w01.html_para7">The Inter-Governmental Authority on Development (IGAD) is the mechanism by which the international community is assisting in the peace process. We, and others, are actively seeking new ways to invigorate this process.

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development if she has responded to the World Food Programme appeal for assistance to Somalia; and if she will make a statement about the level of funding of that appeal.  [28713]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20122w01.html_spnew8"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 We have not responded to the World Food Programme (WFP) element of the United Nations 2002 Consolidated Appeal for Somalia; we have, however, funded emergency health and nutrition programmes in the worst affected areas, and this complements the WFP's efforts.
<P>

<a name="20122w01.html_para8">The WFP part of the UN Appeal is the continuation of a three year project "Food aid for relief and recovery in Somalia", which began in July 1999. To date the UN report that just under 60 per cent. of the project's estimated requirements have been met.
<P>
<P>
<a name="20122w01.html_wqn9"><B> Tony Worthington: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what assessment she has made of the impact of 11 September on poverty in Somalia following the disruption of overseas remittance income.  [28714]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20122w01.html_spnew9"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 There has been some adverse impact on poverty as a consequence of the curtailment of the activities of Al Barakat&#151;a Somali remittance company 



<P>
<P><I>22 Jan 2002 : Column 692W</I><P>
linked to terrorist groups. Other companies, offering similar services across Somalia, have not been affected. Indeed, there is evidence that they have expanded their client base, offsetting some of the effect of the Al Barakat closure.

<P>

<a name="20122w01.html_wqn10"><B> Dr. Cable: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for International Development how many regulatory impact assessments have been produced by her Department since August 2001; and if she will list those produced <i>(a)</i> following initial consultation with affected parties about the most appropriate methodology for assessing costs and other impacts and <i>(b)</i> which set out full commercial impacts, including profitability, employment, consumer prices and competitiveness, as recommended in "Good Policy Making".  [28409]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20122w01.html_spnew10"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 DFID does not itself undertake 'regulatory impact assessments': these are the responsibility of our partner Governments and authorities. DFID does provide technical assistance to help Governments strengthen their capacity to undertake reviews of the regulatory environment and to regulate better. Many of the precepts underlying "Good Policy Making: A Guide to Regulatory Impact Assessment" are relevant to developing countries and we endorse them.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20122w01.html_spnew11"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 We have set aside &#163;20 million in this financial year to support the Interim Administration and the United Nations-led transitional recovery and rehabilitation process, while continuing to respond to humanitarian needs. This includes a contribution of &#163;2 million already provided to the UN Afghan Interim Authority Fund to provide salaries of key public servants, equipment and supplies. As well as financial assistance, we are providing technical personnel and logistical, material and other practical support.
<P>

<a name="20122w01.html_para9">At the international conference on the reconstruction of Afghanistan held in Tokyo from 21&#150;22 January 2002, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State announced a significant contribution to be used for the long-term rehabilitation of Afghanistan. The UK has committed &#163;200 million over the next five financial years for both reconstruction and humanitarian activities. The majority of this pledge will be channelled through UN agencies and non-governmental organisations.
<P>

<a name="20122w01.html_para10">This pledge is in addition to the significant sums that the UK has contributed to the World bank, European Union and Asian Development bank, which will also direct further funds into Afghanistan in the coming years. The UK share of the European Union pledge alone will be 20 per cent.

<a name="20122w02.html_spnew0"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 Pakistan has been shouldering the burden of some two million refugees from Afghanistan for many years; this is in addition to over 100,000 refugees who have moved into Pakistan from Afghanistan since September 2001. We will continue to do all we can to ensure that all refugees are properly cared for and to give neighbouring countries support to cope with the burden of refugees, for whom they have generously provided for so long.
<P>

<a name="20122w02.html_para0">DFID has provided &#163;3 million to UNHCR's operations, in response to the current crisis, to support its operations for refugees in the region, including in Quetta city and Balochistan province. This has included technical personnel, material and financial support. At the request of UNHCR, we have provided three relief flights to Iran and Pakistan transporting tents, shelter material and communications equipment. We have also provided a specialist site planner to UNHCR in Pakistan to assist with the setting up of new refugee camp sites. In addition we have provided &#163;6 million to NGOs, much of which has been directed towards Afghans in neighbouring countries, including Pakistan, and &#163;11 million to support communities in Pakistan most affected by the influx of refugees.
<P>

<a name="20122w02.html_para1">As the situation stabilises inside Afghanistan, we hope that Afghan refuges will be able to return home voluntarily and, indeed, many have returned already.

<P>
<a name="20122w02.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Andrew Smith </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 21 January 2002]:</i> No. Public spending on infrastructure projects is divided between local, regional and national bodies. It is not possible to identify without disproportionate cost what proportion of central Government infrastructure funding is spent in a particular local authority area or parliamentary constituency. However, the Treasury seeks to ensure value for money in all public spending and works with other Government Departments to ensure that a rigorous evaluation framework is in place to assess the costs and benefits of particular projects. While the Treasury delegates authority to Departments to spend regular budgets, it nevertheless scrutinises particularly large, novel or contentious proposals individually to ensure they offer good value.

 There is no position of 'senior fraud inspector' in the Department for Work and Pensions. Nor is it possible to separate the total amount of overpaid benefit recovered into overpayments due to fraud and those due to other reasons. It is therefore not possible to say what is the average amount of money recovered annually by a Department for Work and Pensions senior fraud inspector.
<P>

<a name="20122w03.html_para3">The term 'senior investigation officer' does not refer to any specific group of Inland Revenue staff. However, the Inland Revenue annual report, available in the House of Commons Library, details the additional liability identified as a result of work to tackle non-compliance undertaken by specialist offices such as the Large Business Office and the Special Compliance Office.

 All ships have the right to enter ports in the UK subject only to the payment of ship, passenger and goods dues. Statutory harbour authorities, including the port of Tyne, have the right to set such dues at whatever level they consider appropriate and may waive any of them at their own discretion. Harbour undertakings are paid for by their users&#151;if dues are waived in any case, the cost is borne by others. Users have a right of objection to the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions if they consider the dues to be unreasonable.

 This is an operational matter for London Underground Ltd., who have provided the following information. The information is not available in the precise form requested.
<P>

<a name="20122w05.html_para0">London Underground Ltd. was reorganised in September 1999, in preparation for the introduction of modernisation plans. Under 'shadow running' arrangements, information is collected from each infrastructure company and the operations company, rather than on the 'line by line' basis that reflected London Underground's previous structure. The table therefore records operational staff and engineering staff overtime costs by line until 18 September 1999, and subsequently overtime costs for staff in each of London Underground's reorganised components. Overall totals cover the same groups of staff and so are comparable.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions for what reason the SRA plan makes no reference to automatic train protection in its list of priorities.  [28543]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20122w06.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 Automatic train protection (ATP) is not mentioned in the SRA's Plan because it is being superseded by a combination of Train Protection Warning System (TPWS) and European Railway Traffic Management System (ERTMS). TPWS is designed to reduce the risks from Signals Passed at Danger by slower-running trains, and is being installed at about 11,000 signals with legislation requiring completion by the end of 2003. The Uff-Cullen inquiry recommended that such a system as ERTMS should be installed throughout the high-speed network by 2010. The omission of ATP from the plan does not involve any compromise of safety standards.

 This is a matter for the Scottish Executive, but I understand from them that, essentially, the Scottish Ambulance Service Non-Emergency Service transports people to and from hospitals, clinics and day centres, and bases its provision on the medical need of the patient. In some of the more remote areas of Scotland, patient transport services are provided by community run schemes. The ambulance service's aim is to provide a seamless journey for patients with mobility problems and those who experience significant discomfort because of the nature of their medical condition, or the type of treatment they receive at hospital. To ensure that it continues to understand and meet the needs of its patients, it is currently reviewing and developing the way in which it provides and delivers non-emergency services to make them even more flexible and patient friendly.

 <i>[holding answer 21 January 2002]:</i> On 22 August 2001 we introduced changes that significantly improved the planning procedures and guidance for telecommunications mast development. The changes, which included amendments to Part 24 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995 (GPDO):
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>strengthened public consultation requirements on mast proposals of 15 m and below so that they are the same as for planning applications;
<P>
<BR>
increased the time for a local planning authority to deal with prior approval applications to 56 days;
<P>
<BR>
underlined that school governors must be consulted on all proposals for new masts on or near a school or college; and
<P>
<BR>
increased fees to enable authorities to carry out full public consultation.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="20122w09.html_para0">Part 24 of the GPDO does not distinguish between different generations of telecommunications equipment and therefore applies to third generation base stations.
<P>
<P>
<a name="20122w09.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Wyatt: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions if he will publish guidelines for 3G mobile telephony companies to share the use of 3G mobile telephony base stations.  [28948]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20122w09.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Keeble </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 21 January 2002]:</i> The Government's policy is firmly to encourage mast and site sharing where that is the optimum solution in the individual circumstances. Indeed, conditions attached to individual operating licences granted by the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry include a requirement to investigate mast sharing before seeking to put up any new mast.
<P>

<a name="20122w09.html_para1">Planning Policy Guidance Note 8, "Telecommunications" (PPG8), makes clear our expectation that developers should provide evidence to local planning authorities that they have carefully considered the use of existing masts, buildings and other structures before seeking to erect any new mast, regardless of size. The authority may be justified in refusing prior approval or planning permissions if it considers the evidence regarding the consideration of such alternative sites is not satisfactory. PPG8 is publicly available and applies to all telecommunications development, including 3G base stations.
<P>
<P>
<a name="20122w09.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Wyatt: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions what estimate he has made of the number of new 3G mobile telephony base station sites that will be needed in the United Kingdom.  [28947]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20122w09.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Keeble </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 21 January 2002]:</i> This is a matter for the individual telecommunications operators. However, the operators are fully aware of the importance we attach to keeping the number of masts to the minimum practicable, for example through mast sharing, and to ensuring that those which are needed are designed and sited with sensitivity and care.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20122w10.html_spnew0"><B> Dr. Howells </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 14 January 2002]:</i> Buildings will continue to be considered for listing against strict criteria of special architectural or historic interest. The Government's guidance to local authorities in Planning Policy Guidance Note 15&#151;Planning and the Historic Environment stresses a general presumption in favour of retaining unlisted buildings in conservation areas which make a positive contribution to the character or appearance of a conservation area. The Government's recent policy statement, "The Historic Environment: A Force for Our Future" (December 2001) stresses the importance of planning authorities taking account of the value a community places on a particular aspect of its immediate environment.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport if she will take steps to ensure that listed buildings cannot be de-listed following an appeal from the owner without public notification and an opportunity for objections to be made.  [27898]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20122w10.html_spnew1"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 Decisions on listing and de-listing are based on expert advice received about a building's architectural and historic interest. There is no formal process for appeals against decisions on listing and de-listing, but we will consider fresh evidence at any time. Given this, we see no benefit in the introduction of a formal appeals procedure.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20122w10.html_spnew5"><B> Dr. Howells </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 21 January 2002]:</i> Under the Accommodation for Residential Care (ARC) concessionary scheme, television licences are available at a fee of &#163;5 for each unit of qualifying accommodation. The requirement that sheltered housing must be provided for disabled people, mentally disordered people or retired people aged 60 or over is one of a number of qualifying criteria for entitlement to the concession. The ARC scheme as a whole was examined by the independent review panel on the future funding of the BBC in 1999, 



<P>
<P><I>22 Jan 2002 : Column 723W</I><P>
but the panel recommended that the existing scheme should be retained, since it was unable to identify a superior alternative funded from the licence fee.
<P>

<a name="20122w10.html_para1">As announced last year, the Government propose to introduce measures to preserve the rights of ARC beneficiaries who remain in accommodation provided or managed by a local authority, a housing association or a development corporation, when the social mix or the level of warden cover change. Consultations between officials and the BBC about the necessary amendments to the television licence fee regulations are currently under way. We intend to bring forward these amendments as soon as we can but it is important that in doing so we do not create any new anomalies or unnecessary administrative burdens.

<a name="20122w11.html_para3">Based on the known Ministry of Defence Police complement alterations, the overall staffing levels for the next three years are expected to be between 3,000 and 3,300.
<P>

<a name="20122w11.html_para4">The RAF Police are in the process of a major structural reorganisation with a view to reducing the requirement. The trained strength will be reduced over the next six to eight years to align with the reduced requirement. It is likely that the Military Provost Guard Service will increase to offset part of the reduction in the RAF Police but will be aligned to the strength reductions.

<a name="20122w11.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Swayne: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will estimate the cost to the Armed Forces Pension Scheme of providing widowed spouses of post-retirement marriages with a pension based on all the pensionable service of the service men and women.  [27199]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20122w11.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Post-retirement widow and widower pensions (PRWP) were introduced as a requirement of the Social Security Pensions Act 1975. Provision was made in the Armed Forces Pension Scheme (AFPS) for the payment of pensions to widow(er)s of service pensioners who married (or remarried) after retirement, but this change benefited only the widows of those giving service on or after 6 April 1978, and the widowers of those giving service on or after 6 April 1989. Only service on or after those dates was taken into account when calculating the level of pension. Against this background, it would cost in the order of &#163;50 million to extend PRWP's to all current and deferred AFPS pensioners. This would be a one-off cost based on a broad actuarial estimate.
<P>

<a name="20122w11.html_para5">There is no distinction between service men and public sector employees with regard to the fact that the PRWP only applies to those with service on or after 6 April 1978, or 6 April 1989. It has been the long-standing policy of successive Governments that discretionary changes to improve the benefits from public service pensions schemes should be implemented from a current date for future service only. To extend the post-retirement marriage concession to survivors of members of all public service occupational schemes would cost between &#163;300 million and &#163;500 million.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what formula is used for the annual uprating of armed forces pensions.  [28868]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20122w11.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 21 January 2002:]</i> Pensions which are already in payment are increased annually in line with the retail prices index under the terms of the Armed Forces Pension Scheme (Pensions Increase) Order.
<P>

<a name="20122w11.html_para6">The increase in rate of pension payable to those who retire each year is broadly in line with annual pay increases. Armed forces pensions are not based on individual earnings but on a representative rate of pension for each rank. This 'band of brothers' approach ensures that all those who leave in the same year in the same rank and with the same number of years' service, receive the same pension. The representative rates of pension are 



<P>
<P><I>22 Jan 2002 : Column 727W</I><P>
linked to 'spot' rates of pay for each of the ranks. Annual increases in the spot rates of pay automatically increase the representative rates of pension based on them.

The figures relate to a combination of suspected and proven frauds and thefts with estimated values refined from time to time as investigations, sometime lasting a year or more, reach a conclusion. A significant element of estimated cost or value can relate to 'at risk' estimates applied to suspected procurement fraud cases, the majority of which are usually resolved as 'no crime' or have a proven value lower than original estimates.

 Flight Lieutenant Adams voluntarily withdrew from fast-jet flying training in October 1999, and was subsequently restreamed to rotary wing training rather than his preference of multi-engine training. He initiated the process of redress in March 2000. His complaint was rejected by the Commander-in-Chief, Royal Air Force Personnel and Training Command in December 2000. Flight Lieutenant Adams subsequently asked for the matter to be considered by the Air Force Board. Under the procedures followed during the consideration of a redress of complaint, all appropriate documents are disclosed to the complainant, who is invited to comment, before they are submitted to the decision-maker. This inevitably prolongs the process, and Flight Lieutenant Adams has commented, as is his right, on four separate occasions since the relevant synopsis was first disclosed to him in March 2001. It was necessary to postpone a scheduled meeting of the Air Force Board in September in order to take account of his latest comments. The case is now under consideration by the Air Force Board, who have asked for further information on which Flight Lieutenant Adams has been invited to comment before his case can be considered further.

<P>
<a name="20122w13.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 We share the UK industry's very real concerns about Korean unfair competition, which we take very seriously. We believe the best means of tackling Korean unfair competition is to launch action in the World Trade Organisation (WTO), on which all member states are agreed, and to help yards improve their competitiveness. However, we are strongly opposed to the Commission proposal to reintroduce, in parallel, temporary operating subsidies.
<P>

<a name="20122w13.html_para3">We do not believe that subsidy is an appropriate response to this complex and longstanding problem. Operating subsidies have not been effective in countering Korean unfair competition or in improving the competitiveness of EU yards in the past and we believe the Commission's new proposal will be even less effective at countering Korea. The Commission proposal is likely to be difficult to operate in practice and is open to abuse. Furthermore, it will distort competition within the EU as only some member states stand to gain. The proposal will not benefit UK yards as they do not build the relevant types of ships, namely containerships and product/chemical tankers, and could well be damaged by the subsidies that competing yards stand to receive.
<P>

<a name="20122w13.html_para4">At the December 2001 meeting of the Industry Council, the Commission tried for the third time to secure agreement on its dual approach of subsidies and WTO action but again failed to secure sufficient support from member states. Member states remained firmly split on the subsidies proposal. The UK vigorously pressed the Commission to launch the WTO action but to no avail. The deadlock on the Commission approach therefore continues, with no action against Korea. The Commission will now review the market situation and present its findings in March as a basis for further discussion.

 China became a member of the WTO on 11 December 2001, and is bound by the agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights ("TRIPS"). This requires all WTO members to provide certain minimum standards for the protection and enforcement of copyright and other intellectual property rights. The agreement is the first broadly-subscribed multilateral intellectual property agreement that is enforceable between Governments.

<a name="20122w14.html_para4">An EU requirement to apply origin markings to ceramic imports from China would be incompatible with WTO rules.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20122w15.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Hewitt </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 21 January 2002]:</i> A list of power stations in the United Kingdom (operational at 31 May 2001 and of more than 1 MW capacity) is given in Table 5.13 of the Digest of United Kingdom Energy Statistics, 2001, a copy of which is available in the Libraries of the House and on the DTI website. The list shows the fuel used by each station and its generating capacity. In total 165 separate stations appear on the list.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if she will make a statement on the extent to which <i>(a)</i> geothermal, <i>(b)</i> hydroelectric, <i>(c)</i> wind and <i>(d)</i> wave sources of energy are used in the United Kingdom.  [28015]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20122w15.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Hewitt </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 21 January 2002]:</i> We are aware of only one operating geothermal aquifer scheme in the UK, in Southampton, where a geothermal aquifer contributes 2 MW of heat to a 12 MW district heating scheme. The UK is unlikely to see extensive developments based upon aquifers due to a limited resource and limited scope for its exploitation. In the 1980s, the UK conducted major research into geothermal hot dry rock technology, involving the extraction of heat through the artificial injection of water into otherwise dry rock formations, but no prospect was seen at the time of making this technology economically viable in the short or medium term.
<P>

<a name="20122w15.html_para0">The UK has extensive hydroelectric schemes, most of them long-established. Declared net capacity of UK hydro plants in 2000 was 1,479 MW. Scope for expansion is limited by the availability of suitable new sites and environmental considerations.
<P>

<a name="20122w15.html_para1">Wind energy is already well established in the UK, and unit production costs have been falling for some years. The British Wind Energy Association calculates that, at the end of 2001, total UK wind energy generating capacity stood at 473.6 MW installed capacity, and that nearly 200 MW more is confirmed for construction in 2002. We are taking vigorous steps to encourage the development of the wind energy industry, with its enormous potential, both

<P><I>22 Jan 2002 : Column 740W</I><P>
onshore and offshore. The UK's first offshore wind energy installation, off Blyth in Northumberland, opened in 2000. The Government are encouraging more ambitious developments offshore by a substantial capital grants programme.
<P>

<a name="20122w15.html_para2">Wave energy is at an early stage of development in the UK. A 500 kilowatt wave energy device, supported through an SRO contract, is operating on Islay. The Government have recently announced support for further innovative wave energy projects. The UK's potential wave energy resource is enormous.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what plans she has to introduce legislation to control the use of chemicals in household products; and if she will make a statement.  [29509]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20122w15.html_spnew2"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 The safety of chemical products, such as household products, is governed by the Chemicals (Hazard Information and Packaging for Supply) Regulations 1994. These regulations require that manufacturers must assess a chemical product for its health effects (toxicity, irritancy etc.). If dangerous the product must then be labelled with a warning symbol and phrases indicating the dangers. The particular chemical(s) which cause the product to be classified must be named on the label.
<P>

<a name="20122w15.html_para3">The regulations also require that all potentially dangerous chemicals supplied to the public must be in packaging which is properly labelled and contains warnings about the potential hazards and giving brief advice on suitable precautions. Manufacturers or suppliers of household products are also required to give details of how to use the product safely.

<a name="20122w15.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Alexander: </B> 
 Many millions of traffic minutes per day are routed through the UK, which is an important transit hub for international telecoms traffic.

 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="20122w15.html_para4">The EU banana regime has recently been amended to implement Phase II of the Understanding with the US and Ecuador in response to World Trade Organisation concerns and to end the long-running trade dispute. The main effects of this are to transfer 100,000 tonnes of

 I have been asked to reply.

<a name="20122w15.html_para6">Two European Commission proposals received favourable opinions. The first was to establish the maximum quantity of bananas which may be imported into the Community during the first quarter of 2002 by each registered operator. The second was to amend Commission Regulation 896/2001 to correct certain errors in the text as well as to clarify the rules for determining the reference quantities applicable to traditional operators in the A/B Quota.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what estimates she has made of the value of the reduction in banana imports under C licences as a result of changes to the EU banana regime in the next five years.  [25956]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20122w15.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="20122w15.html_para8">Under the previous arrangements (Phase I of the Understanding with the US and Ecuador), 850,000 tonnes of banana imports under C Quota licences were permitted per year. Under Phase II, the effect on banana traders registered as operators in the C Quota arise both from the transfer of 100,000 tonnes of bananas from the C Quota to the A/B Quota, and from making the C Quota exclusive to ACP countries.
<P>

<a name="20122w15.html_para9">Total imports from ACP countries in 1999 (the last year for which full data are available) amounted to 676,638 tonnes, with similar quantities in the previous two years. This implies that the changes made in Phase II, taken together, should enable the ACP to continue to achieve a market share comparable with that they have had in the recent past. The value of this to ACP suppliers and individual importers will depend on price developments and, in the case of importers, their licence allocations.

The NHS is expected to continue to reduce the waiting list in order to make achievement of the maximum waiting times more manageable.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20122w16.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The National Audit Office report "Inappropriate adjustments to national health service waiting lists" listed nine trusts where inappropriate adjustments had taken place. In two of these trusts, Salford and Stoke Mandeville, the investigations have reached the disciplinary stage. There have been no trust managers dismissed on grounds of gross misconduct in the other seven cases.
<P>

<a name="20122w16.html_para7">The Department accepts that some of the earlier cases covered in the report were not always handled properly and it accepts in full the recommendations set out the NAO report. In future, any manager found to have deliberately distorted waiting figures will face dismissal on grounds of gross misconduct. This will be supported by a new code of conduct for national health service managers. Anyone who breaches that code of conduct will not be re-employed as a manager&#151;anywhere in the national health service.

 New dangerous and severe personality disorder (DSPD) units at Rampton and Broadmoor will deliver 140 places for dangerous and severe personality disorder persons by 2004. These are complex schemes, involving major innovations both in design, and in the approach to service delivery.

<a name="20122w17.html_para0">Work has concentrated initially on the Rampton site. To date, there has been capital expenditure of &#163;412,000 at Rampton with a projected spend of &#163;500,000 by year end. This is being committed to meet the costs of early design work, design team fees, and to refurbish accommodation for the DSPD team in Rampton. Work will commence on site in March 2002, with completion due in June 2003, and the expenditure of capital has been profiled to achieve this output. The unit is planned to open in the autumn of 2003. Work on the unit at Broadmoor is at an earlier stage of development, and no capital has been committed. However, it is on target to open in 2004.

<P>
<a name="20122w20.html_spnew6"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 A central register is maintained for each area covered by a social services department. The register lists all the children resident in the area (including those who have been placed there by another local authority or agency) who are considered to be at continuing risk of significant harm, and for whom there is a child protection plan.
<P>

<a name="20122w20.html_para3">"Working Together to Safeguard Children" implemented better ways of making sure these registers link up together more effectively when a child moves from place to place. Since the publication of "Working Together" in December 1999, it has been the case that if a child and family have moved permanently to another local authority area, the receiving local authority should convene a child protection conference within 15 working days of being notified of the move. Only once this has taken place may de-registration take place in respect of the original local authority's child protection register.
<P>

<a name="20122w20.html_para4">We have no plans at present to introduce a national risk register.

<P>
<a name="20122w20.html_spnew9"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 The term "mixed sex ward" can be used to describe a variety of arrangements. The use of partitioning as a means of dividing wards into bays, which are then used to accommodate either male or female patients, is an acceptable means of protecting patients' privacy and dignity.
<P>

<a name="20122w20.html_para6">However, the use of moveable privacy screens alone is not acceptable, as these provide poor physical separation of facilities. Their use as an adjunct to permanent solutions, such as partitioning, can be helpful in further enhancing a sense of privacy and dignity.
<P>

<a name="20122w20.html_para7">Guidance on maintaining privacy and dignity was first issued to the national health service in 1997. This guidance clearly states that any screening in use must be adequate to ensure privacy is maintained, e.g., which will prevent patients being overhead or overseen by others, where this is not desirable.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="20122w25.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The blood testing necessary to classify each county in Great Britain as free of foot and mouth disease (FMD) is now complete. Pre-movement blood testing of sheep flocks is also no longer required. Blood testing is still required where a farmer re-stocks with sheep, goats, or camelids following an outbreak. It is expected that most blood testing for re-stocking purposes will be complete by early summer.
<P>

<a name="20122w25.html_para1">Blood samples are sent from the local Animal Health Office by courier to the laboratory to arrive within 24 hours of the sample being taken. The laboratories have a target turn-round time for FMD blood tests of seven days and currently the mean turn-round time is three days. Results from the laboratories are then made available by computer to the local Animal Health Office.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20122w25.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Tests for the detection of foot and mouth disease virus and antibody are performed according to the protocols described in the chapter on foot and mouth disease (FMD) in the OIE Manual of Standards for Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines (2000) which was written by staff at the Institute for Animal Health (IAH), Pirbright. These tests were performed at IAH, Pirbright and five other laboratories on behalf of DEFRA. In addition, one of the antibody detection ELISA tests was improved. This test was validated and the data have been submitted to OIE for their approval as a prescribed test.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20122w25.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 DEFRA supports a programme of applied research and test development at IAH, Pirbright. A priority is the development of more rapid and reliable diagnostic tests for use in the laboratory and in the field. Another priority is to develop better methods for identifying infection among vaccinated animals so that vaccinated animals could be safely kept alive. All such tests must be properly validated to ensure international acceptance.

 This Department allocated support of &#163;29 million to solid biomass crops through the Energy Crops Scheme, part of the England Rural Development Programme. We are also working with other Departments to put in place schemes with funding of &#163;70 million which will develop markets for biomass in heat, combined heat and power and electricity generation. Following the Green Fuel Challenge my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced that a new duty rate for biodiesel, set at 20p per litre below the rate for Ultra Low Sulphur Diesel, is to be introduced in Budget 2002. Any additional measures to develop biofuels from crops must be based on sound evidence and this Department has recently commissioned a six-month study, on behalf of the Government-Industry Forum on non-food uses of crops, to provide an independent, comprehensive and rigorous evaluation of the comparative energy, environmental and socio-economic costs and benefits of biodiesel production in the UK. The study will compare results with those for other relevant green fuels and relevant energy saving measures.

 Income data are available only for farms with an economic size of at least eight European Size Units (ESUs), the minimum considered necessary to occupy a full time farmer. Although nearly half the farms in England fall below this 'full-time' size threshold, they account for only 2 per cent. of agricultural output.

There are a number of conditions that land and crops being claimed must meet, the main ones being as follows. Eligibility of land for AAPS is as a general rule effectively restricted to land that was in arable rotation on 31 December 1991. In order to qualify for full payment, all producers claiming more than 15.62 ha must set-aside a certain percentage of their claimed eligible land. All crops claimed under this scheme must be shown and maintained in line with local standards and must be maintained until specified dates. Details of the scheme requirements are published annually in literature available to claimants.

 Industrial action, which has been delaying the processing of arable aid (AAPS) claims, was suspended by the trade unions with effect from 11 January. This allowed the Rural Payments Agency (RPA) to step up the amount of overtime being worked beginning in the weekend of 12&#150;13 January. Overtime working will now continue, as long as the suspension remains in place, until the backlog of claim processing is cleared. The RPA expects to be able to pay the vast majority of AAPS claims within the regulatory timeframe which ends on 31 January. However, because of the

<P>
<P>
<a name="20122w27.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 It is not possible or meaningful to answer the question in the terms asked. Stock levels in future years will depend, in part, on the abundance of future broods of young fish not yet spawned. Also, the stocks are subject to a range of management measures aimed at restoring them, although the outcome of these measures cannot be precisely predicted at present, the assumption underlying the question that these measures will have no effect is not a reasonable hypothesis.
<P>

<a name="20122w27.html_para1">Rather than the rate of depletion of stocks, the indicators used for the state of fish stocks are, for each stock, the spawning stock biomass and the level of 



<P>
<P><I>22 Jan 2002 : Column 783W</I><P>
fishing mortality. Where these indicators fall below the precautionary benchmarks established by scientists, the scientific advice is that action should be taken to raise them to within safe biological limits. The recovery plans already in place for northern hake and for cod in the North sea, Irish sea and west of Scotland and now proposed by the commission for further stocks, together with the decisions taken by the Council of Ministers to set TACs and quotas for 2002 in line with scientific advice, are aimed at reversing decline in fish stocks where it is occurring and is of concern, rather than allowing it to continue.

If BSE were to be found in the sheep flock, the implications for goats would need to be determined in the light of circumstances at the time, taking into account in particular the views of the Food Standards Agency and the scientific advice offered by the EU's Scientific Steering Committee and by the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what reasons lie behind the recent changes to the regulations for the transportation of goats for mating.  [26765]<P>

<P>
<a name="20122w27.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The movement of animals has been restricted as part of the measures to control the spread of foot and mouth disease. The most recent change to the animal movements licensing scheme affecting goats was introduced on 18 December 2001. From this date, goats were allowed to move freely between At Risk Counties provided an inspection by a Local Veterinary Inspector

proved satisfactory. As of 15 January 2002, there are no At Risk Counties in Great Britain. There have been no recent changes to the rules regarding the movement of billy goats for breeding purposes.

<a name="20122w27.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Breed: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs in which areas the culling of badgers as part of the Krebs trial has restarted; how many badgers have been culled; and what the estimated cost of the trial is.  [26754]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20122w27.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The badger field trial was suspended in February last year because of the foot and mouth disease (FMD) outbreak. Badger culling has not yet recommenced but surveying operations have restarted in all trial areas. Up to the time that the trial was suspended, 2,913 badgers had been culled. The overall cost of the trial has been estimated to be approximately &#163;35 million.

<a name="20122w27.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Breed: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs how many cattle have been culled since 1995 due to being infected with bovine TB, broken down by year and county.  [26751]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20122w27.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The table shows the number of animals slaughtered because they reacted to the tuberculin test broken down by county for England, Scotland and Wales for the years 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999,2000 and 2001. A figure by county is not available for Northern Ireland and the relevant figures for each year are shown.
<P>

<a name="20122w27.html_para2">All figures are produced from the State Veterinary Service IT support system. The figure for 1995 is unvalidated raw data. The use of the system for management reporting only began late in 1995 and it is not now possible to validate this data. For the years 1996, 1997 and 1998 the table shows validated agreed data. Statistics meeting 'national statistics' criteria have been used for 1999 and 2000 but the data are yet to be validated and these are therefore provisional. For 2001 the data are provisional and unvalidated as laboratory results are awaited.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs how many cases of bovine TB there have been in the United Kingdom since 1995, broken down by year and county.  [26752]<P>

<P>
<a name="20122w27.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The table shows the number of herds affected by new confirmed incidents of bovine TB broken down by country for England, Scotland and Wales for the years 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000 and 2001. A figure by county is not available for Northern Ireland and the relevant figures for each year are shown.
<P>

<a name="20122w27.html_para3">A new herd incident occurs when a herd which was previously TB free either had cattle that reacted to a tuberculin test or had a tuberculous animal disclosed by routine inspection at slaughter. This becomes a confirmed incident where at least one animal is subsequently

confirmed as having bovine TB either through laboratory result and/or evidence at slaughter.
<P>

<a name="20122w27.html_para4">The figures for Northern Ireland relate to new herd incidents only.
<P>

<a name="20122w27.html_para5">All figures are produced from the state veterinary service IT support system. The figure for 1995 is unvalidated raw data. The use of the system for management reporting only began late in 1995 and it is not now possible to validate this data. For the years 1996, 1997 and 1998 the table shows validated agreed data. Statistics meeting 'national statistics' criteria have been used for 1999 and 2000 but the data are yet to be validated and these are therefore provisional. For 2001 the date are provisional and unvalidated as laboratory results are awaited.

 Since April last year we have taken a range of initiatives aimed at improving our ability to prevent and detect illegal imports of animal products. These initiatives have been co-ordinated by officials in the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, but involve other Departments such as HM Customs and Excise and the Food Standards Agency, and the local authorities who are responsible for controls at ports and airports.
<P>

<a name="20122w28.html_para2">Checks on imports of animal products at Heathrow airport are primarily the responsibility of Hillingdon borough council. We have regular discussions with council officers about import controls. In addition customs officers and immigration officers are alert to the need to be vigilant to illegal imports of animal products carried in passenger baggage. Local authority officers, customs officers and state veterinary service officers at the airport liaise in organising checks of passenger baggage for illegal animal products.
<P>

<a name="20122w28.html_para3">Posters have been placed at Heathrow and other airports alerting individuals to what products they may bring in. These are now being improved in the light of experience and discussion has taken place with the airport authority to ensure that posters are sited as effectively as possible.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (1) for what reasons the Fur Farming (Compensation Scheme) (England) Order 2001 (SI 2001, No 3853) does not make provision for <i>(a)</i> the value of male animals and <i>(b)</i> the differential value of different breed of mink;  [27755]
<P>
<UL>(2) for what reasons the Fur Farming (Compensation Scheme) (England) Order 2001 (SI 2001, No 3853) reduces the compensation payable for the value of breeding stock where <i>(a)</i> the farmer elected to cease keeping mink after 1 October 2001 and <i>(b)</i> the farmer elected to cease keeping mink nine months before the Fur Farming (Prohibition) Act 2000 comes into force.  [27757]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20122w28.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Under section 5(1) of the Fur Farming (Prohibition) Act 2000, fur farmers are able to close down at any time between enactment on 23 November 2000 and the coming into force of the ban on 1 January 2003, without affecting their eligibility for compensation. This winding-down period of more than two years allows each fur farmer to choose the best time when to close in order to mitigate any losses, including on breeding and young stock.
<P>

<a name="20122w28.html_para5">Those fur farmers who choose to close at a later date will derive greater returns for each breeding animal from the market, thus reducing the residual breeding value, and hence the level of compensation. Any differential in the

value of different breeds of mink will be reflected in the profitability of the enterprise for which compensation is being provided.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs for what reasons the Fur Farming (Compensation Scheme) (England) Order 2001 (SI 2001, No. 3853) specifies <i>(a)</i> a fixed sum for the value of breeding stock, and <i>(b)</i> a fixed multiplier to determine qualifying income losses; and for what reason there is no appeal under the terms of the order to <i>(a)</i> arbitration and <i>(b)</i> to the Lands Tribunal.  [27751]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20122w28.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Under Section 5(1) of the Fur Farming (Prohibition) Act 2000, the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food is required to make a compensation scheme. Due consideration was given to all relevant factors in producing such a scheme. It was not considered appropriate for the Government to leave the determination of the value of breeding stock and the income multiplier to an arbitrator or the Lands Tribunal, if they were to meet their obligation to make a scheme that is fair and reasonable. The calculation of average net trading profits could, however, be referred to an arbitrator or the Lands Tribunal.

 <i>[holding answer 17 January 2002]:</i> Pesticide products containing chlorfenvinphos and carbofuran have been reviewed as part of the general review in the UK of all organophosphate pesticides. The review was undertaken because of public concerns about the potential toxicity of this group of chemicals. Only for chlorfenvinphos has there been strong lobbying to retain its use on swedes and turnips. The approval was due to expire on 31 December 2001 but in the light of strong representations from growers at the end of last year my noble Friend Lord Whitty agreed to extend the approval until 25 July 2003, the date when the approval will expire throughout Europe.

 <i>[holding answer 18 January 2002]:</i> The proposed EU Animal By-Products Regulation would ban the feeding of catering waste to livestock. This ban was introduced at a late stage in negotiations and, after political agreement to a common position had been reached, the European commission made it clear that it considered that the ban also applied to used cooking oils. The Government consider that used cooking oils can be safely used in livestock feed if they are protected from contamination by the application of HACCP (Hazard Analysis of Critical Control Points) principles and appropriate quality control. If suitable alternative outlets are not in place, a ban could lead to environmental problems. The UK is therefore opposing the ban on used cooking oils which are subject to suitable controls and has been lobbying Members of the European Parliament to make suitable changes at Second Reading. The UK has also made it clear that, in the event of the ban not being reversed, an extended transitional period would be needed to allow time for alternative, sustainable outlets to be developed.

<a name="20122w29.html_para2">Regulatory impact assessments were placed in the Library of the House on 27 November 2000 and 26 February 2001, along with explanatory memoranda on the regulation (reference 12646/00 and 12648/00). However, as the ban on catering waste had not then been proposed, they did not take account of the costs of such a ban. A revised regulatory impact assessment and a further supplementary explanatory memorandum are in preparation. We expect the Animal By-Products Regulation to come into force in member states towards the end of 2002. Relevant industries and other interests will be fully consulted on its implementation.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what was the sum imposed as fines by magistrates courts in the latest 12-month period for which figures are available; how much of that total was collected; and if he will make a statement.  [28595]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20122w31.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Wills: </B> 
 Magistrates courts committees are responsible for the collection of a range of debts imposed through the courts, including fines, fees, compensation, confiscation orders, legal aid contributions and some maintenance orders. It is not possible to separate out just the fines from the total.
<P>

<a name="20122w31.html_para0">The total amount imposed by magistrates in the period October 2000 to September 2001 was &#163;358,702,837. Further amounts were imposed by other agencies, including the Crown court, making a total of new impositions which the magistrates courts had responsibility for collecting of &#163;374,440,914.
<P>

<a name="20122w31.html_para1">The total amount of money collected by the courts in the same period was &#163;232,220,021. Most fines etc are paid by instalment, by agreement with the court. Some of the instalments on impositions made in 2000&#150;01 are therefore not yet due for payment. The gap between the amount imposed and the amount collected is due in part to defendants' inability to pay as well as their attempts to avoid payment. Severe sanctions are available to the courts for non-payment, including the seizure of goods and imprisonment. Nevertheless the present situation leaves much room for improvement. The Access to Justice Act 1999 strengthened the powers of the magistrates courts committees to take effective action against defaulters and we have introduced an information sharing arrangement with the Department of Work and Pensions, which enables magistrates courts committees to trace a significantly increased proportion of defaulters.

 Child benefit is a universal, non- means tested payment made to families regardless of the level of income. The latest estimates for child benefit are that the total administrative cost is <sup>1</sup>  &#163;125 million, or an average cost per family of &#163;0.34 per week.
<P>

<a name="20122w32.html_para0">WFTC is an individually assessed, income-related payment made to families with children where at least one partner works for at least 16 hours a week. The amount of the payment is dependent upon a range of factors including the hours worked, the size of the family and the age of the children. It may also take account of expenditure the family incurs in respect of child care. It is administered by the Inland Revenue; and they estimate that the total administrative cost is &#163;133.8 million (&#163;1.92 per family per week).

 As set out in our 1998 Green Paper "Partnership in Pensions" the Government's long-term pension reforms are designed to ensure that all pensioners have a decent income in retirement, building on the foundation of the basic state pension available to all. This means everyone recognising their responsibilities; with those who are able, saving for their retirement, the Government supporting those who cannot save, and the private sector providing affordable and secure second pensions.




<P>
<P><I>22 Jan 2002 : Column 808W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="20122w33.html_para0">Before April 2001, many of those who could put money aside to provide for themselves in retirement had no straightforward, good value way to enter a pension scheme. Stakeholder pensions, which were introduced from that date, offered such people a good value, flexible product. Annual charges are capped at 1 per cent. of the fund's value, meaning more of what people pay in goes towards their pension. There are no additional charges for stopping and starting payments or transferring between stakeholder schemes. They are widely available but are particularly aimed at moderate to higher earners who do not already have access to an occupational pension or a good personal pension with an employer contribution. Stakeholder pensions are an important part of the framework this Government have now put in place to give everyone access to a good value pension arrangement and a decent income in retirement.
<P>

<a name="20122w33.html_para1">The added value of a stakeholder pension will vary according to the charging structure of the particular scheme, the investment returns achieved and the individual's pattern of payments.

 Poverty and social exclusion are complex multi-dimensional issues, affecting many aspects of people's lives&#151;including their living standards, health, housing, the quality of the environment and not just low income.

 Income drawdown plans may be taken out by personal pension fund holders, but most drawdown providers generally only recommend this option for people with significant funds. Personal pension savings may be split in parts and annuitised separately.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. The estimates are based on sample counts that have been adjusted for non-response using multi-purpose grossing factors that control for tenure, Council Tax Band and a number of demographic variables. Estimates are subject to sampling error and to variability in non-response.<P>

2. Questions on assets are a sensitive part of the FRS questionnaire and have relatively low level of response, and hence higher levels of imputation, compared to other parts of the survey. Responses are imputed in around 1 in 10 cases. Evidence also suggests some under reporting of capital by respondents.<P>

3. The final two columns of the table refer to adults reporting one of more of the categories: stocks and shares, unit trusts, PEPs and ISAs.<P>

4. The results are for Financial Year 2000&#150;01 and the number of adults figures are rounded to the nearest 10,000.<P>

 As with other social security benefits, the operation of disability living allowance is kept under review. We have recently made significant improvements to the DLA claim form, we are currently piloting revised arrangements for obtaining relevant information from claimants' general practitioners, and in consultation with organisations representing disabled people, are testing an alternative system for extra-costs disability benefits based on activities for managing life.

<i>Note:</i><P>

As the number of specialist schools increases year on year, the column for 'specialist schools' refers to schools which were designated as specialist for both the appropriate academic years, hence two figures are given for each year. For example, throughout the academic years 1995&#150;96 and 1996&#150;97 there were 102 specialists. Throughout 1996&#150;97 and 1997&#150;98 there were 174 specialists. In the table above the 39.9 figure in the first row refers to the average point score of the 102 schools in 1997. The 40.1 figure in the second row refers to the average point score of the 174 specialists in 1997. <P>

<a name="20122w35.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 Crossing the threshold entitles a teacher to be paid on point 1 of the upper pay scale. That entitlement continues to apply when a teacher changes schools. Further progress on the upper pay scale will be on the basis of discretionary performance points awarded by individual governing bodies. The School Teachers' Review Body is considering whether such points should be portable, as we have proposed. Portability would be consistent with expecting all schools to take account of the same general criteria in awarding such points. It would also facilitate movement between schools.

This said that points should reward substantial and sustained performance and contribution to the school that showed greater breadth and depth than the threshold standards. The guidance also made it clear that schools would have to interpret and develop these general criteria in the light of local circumstances and priorities.

 &#163;10 million of standards fund money was made available in each of 2000&#150;01 and 2001&#150;02 to support an early retirement scheme for head teachers. This was a two-year scheme aimed at raising the standard of leadership in schools. Although the financial support that this scheme provided will not continue beyond the end of this financial year, it will still be open to employers to grant early retirement to head teachers where they believe that doing so would be beneficial.

<P>
<a name="20122w35.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 In 2002&#150;03 Shropshire's Education SSA will increase by &#163;6.88 million or 6.16 per cent. Shropshire will also benefit from an overall increase in Standards Fund grant of almost &#163;160 million; and an increase of 2.75 per cent. in the direct grant for schools. We believe that this is a good settlement sufficient to cover all the cost pressures on Shropshire next year, including the additional transport costs incurred by a rural county.
<P>

<a name="20122w35.html_para3">However, we are currently working up a new funding system for introduction in 2003&#150;04. As part of that work we are taking account of the costs associated with rural areas such as home to school transport.

<a name="20122w35.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 The Department's guidance to local education authorities is that ideally many permanently excluded pupils should rejoin a mainstream or special school within days or weeks of exclusion. Those permanently excluded pupils who are not re-integrated into a new school should be offered opportunities in Pupil Referral Units (PRU), FE colleges and or on work experience. Rapid re-integration is particularly important for excluded primary pupils and I expect that most of them would be re-integrated within one term. Conversely, for pupils approaching the end of compulsory schooling, a return to school may be unrealistic and in those cases alternative provision like a PRU or FE college is more appropriate.
<P>

<a name="20122w35.html_para4">The guidance does not direct that alternative provision must be found immediately for a permanently excluded child. The Discipline Committee must meet to review the decision no later than 15 school days after notification of the exclusion. During this time the guidance states that the head teacher should plan for the child's continued education. This can be by setting and marking work for the child to do at home. Where a parent lodges an appeal, I expect the school and LEA to work together to secure the pupil's on-going education. Following an unsuccessful appeal, reintegration into a school or PRU may take some time.
<P>

<a name="20122w35.html_para5">Reintegration Panels are responsible for co-ordinating services for excluded pupils. They must draw up an individual re-integration plan for each excluded child. This plan should be in place within a month of the governors upholding the exclusion and it is reviewed on a monthly basis. It should include a target date for return to school, once the school to which the child will return has been identified.
<P>

<a name="20122w35.html_para6">Pupils who continue to be disruptive may be excluded from their new school or, as a last resort, from a Pupil Referral Unit. However, we now have a network of Learning Support Units in schools and Pupil Referral Units to support our drive to tackle poor behaviour and continue to raise standards in schools.

 In the period 31 December 2000 to 31 December 2001, the Department for Education and Skills spent &#163;11,513 on advertising on Somerset local radio. There was no expenditure on advertising in Somerset local press.

<P>
<a name="20122w36.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 The responsibility for determining a school policy on sex and relationship education rests with governing bodies and head teachers. Our Sex and Relationship Education guidance, published in July 2000, clearly states that governing bodies and head teachers should consult parents in developing their sex and relationship education policy to ensure that the views of parents and the community are reflected. All schools must have a policy, which is made available for inspection and to parents.
<P>

<a name="20122w36.html_para1">The Department recommends that sex and relationship education should be supported by a school's wider curriculum for Personal Social and Health Education (PSHE) and Citizenship. In this way, schools can ensure that pupils receive their sex education in the wider context of relationships and are prepared for the responsibilities and experiences of adult life.

 <i>[holding answer 21 January 2002]:</i> The Department for Education and Skills has procedures in place to ensure that environmental appraisals take place when necessary. Examples of policy decisions which included appraisal of environmental impacts are: guidance to schools in England on energy and water management which Ministers aim to issue in spring 2002; obtaining accreditation in 2001 for environmental management of one of our headquarters sites to an international standard; and, in the school curriculum, the Growing Schools programme. This last initiative, launched in 2001, encourages teachers to use farming and growing to help pupils explore different aspects of sustainable development such as the effects of climate change, the life cycle of plants and animals, the values and traditions of rural communities, and the place of agriculture in today's economy.

 Foreign language broadcasts which have been carefully scripted with content, structure and language level appropriate to the target learners can be a valuable resource for teaching school pupils and older students. They can provide access to a range of authentic native speakers, up to date and topical materials, and opportunities for introducing cultural elements to language learning.
<P>

<a name="20122w37.html_para1">Broadcasts aimed at the native-speaker audience which are accessed from abroad, normally require selection and mediation by a teacher to ensure suitable content, accessible language and effective use for learning purposes.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what recent assessment she has made of the extent to which the possibility of having incurred a debt upon graduation affects the numbers of people who attend university; and what plans she has to change the relative contributions of <i>(a)</i> students and <i>(b)</i> Government to higher education funding.  [29108]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20122w37.html_spnew11"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 Some research, such as that published by the Department in 2001 on "Issues Affecting Decisions on Participation by Lower Socio-Economic Groups" (SEGs), indicates that finance and concern about debt are factors which can deter people from going on to higher education. However, assessing the deterrent effect is difficult in the light of welcome increases in entry numbers. Final UCAS figures for autumn 2001 show that acceptances of English domiciled full-time higher education students are up by 5.9 per cent. compared to the same time last year, building on the rising trend of previous years. But as yet there is no evidence that the proportion of lower SEGs entering HE has increased significantly. Our review of student finance is considering both the student debt issue, particularly in relation to the lower socio-economic groups, and the relative contributions of students, parents and the Government to student support. We expect to make an announcement on the outcome later this year.

I am assured that the authority recognises the weaknesses identified by Ofsted, and will be addressing the recommendations in the year ahead. I await the authority's post-Ofsted action plan, which will set out the action proposed.

 Information on the number of teacher vacancies in local education authorities is collected once a year in January as part of the annual census of teachers and vacancies. In January 2001, the vacancy rate for Gloucestershire was 0.3 per cent. compared with 1.4 per cent. nationally. This amounts to a total of 14 vacancies across the maintained sector. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State set out our longer term proposals for teachers and teaching in a pamphlet, "Professionalism and Trust", published in November 2001.

<a name="20122w38.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 In order to make sense of what they read children need a clear awareness of grammar for both literal and inferential understanding, both of which are assessed in the reading tests at each key stage. At Key Stage 1 and 2 spelling is assessed by a separate test. At Key Stage 1 the outcome of the test is reported separately, while at Key Stage 2 it contributes to an overall level for writing. At Key Stage 3 spelling is an integral part of the judgment leading to an overall level for writing. Grammar is assessed within the context of pupils' writing at all key stages. Criteria for grammar that allow teachers and markers to make judgments about pupils' performance are integral to the mark schemes.

<a name="20122w38.html_para0">These figures reflect decisions taken by individual local authorities on the nature and scale of adult and community learning (ACL) in their area. Since 1999&#150;2000 all areas including Worcestershire have benefited from significant increases in funding. In 2002&#150;03 we will be providing a record &#163;167 million for ACL in England, a 9 per cent. increase in recurrent funding for adult education on 2001&#150;02. Since April 2001 responsibility for adult and community learning has rested with the Learning and Skills Council. One of the objectives behind this change in responsibilities is over time to reduce inequalities in opportunities between areas.

 The role of the Government Technical Assistance Centre, now known as the National Technical Assistance Centre (NTAC), is to provide assistance to the investigations of United Kingdom intelligence and law enforcement agencies.
<P>

<a name="20122w39.html_para1">It will do so by providing techniques for lawful interception of modern multimedia communications and by processing those lawfully intercepted communications in order to provide intelligible material to the intercepting agencies.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what plans he has to produce guidelines for the protection of women seeking asylum based on the Immigration Appellate Authority's adopted comprehensive gender guidelines.  [28073]<P>

<P>
<a name="20122w40.html_spnew1"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 We have not identified a need to issue separate guidance on dealing with women asylum seekers. However, in 2000 we reviewed our instructions to asylum caseworkers and incorporated some of the suggestions and principles contained in the guidelines produced by the Refugee Women's Legal Group.

 The number of applications lodged in the United Kingdom between January 2000 and September 2001, both in total and by nationals of the requested countries, is shown in Table 1. Information on the decision outcomes and removals relating to these applications is not readily available.
<P>

However, these initial decisions do not all relate to applications made in the same period. A proportion of applications which received an initial refusal result in an appeal being lodged.
<P>

<a name="20122w40.html_para1">Between January 2000 and September 2001, 15,810 principal asylum applicants (to the nearest five) were removed from the United Kingdom, including persons departing 'voluntarily' after enforcement action had been initiated against them and persons leaving under assisted voluntary returns programmes. This figure excludes 570 dependants of asylum seekers who departed during the period April to September 2001. Comparable information on the numbers of Zimbabwean, Afghan, Macedonian, Yugoslavian and Pakistani asylum seekers removed over the same period is not available.
<P>

<a name="20122w40.html_para2">The number of applicants who have applied for asylum since 1 January 2000 and are currently awaiting an initial decision on their asylum application, and the number awaiting the outcome of appeal determinations, is not available, and would be available only at disproportionate cost by examination of individual case files.

<a name="20122w40.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Denham </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 12 November 2001]:</i> While recruitment is a matter for individual chief officers, we are committed to encouraging broader use of support staff to handle the paperwork involved in case preparation. The recently published "Diary of a Police Officer" found that police officers were spending almost as much time in the police station as they were on the street. A large part of this problem results from paperwork and changes are needed to enable officers to focus on delivering policing. The requirement for additional powers to enable support staff to deal with more of this work is being considered as part of the police reform programme.
<P>

<a name="20122w40.html_para5">In the White Paper "Policing a New Century", published on 5 December 2001, my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary announced that he was setting up a task force, chaired by Sir David O'Dowd, to consider how to take forward the recommendations in "Diary of a Police Officer", and other relevant reports, in order to reduce unnecessary administrative burdens on the police.

In perhaps the great majority of cases the service will need to rely on the section 28 exemption to avoid damage to national security. That will include use of the long established "neither confirm nor deny" approach&#151;an approach acknowledged by the national security panel of the Information Tribunal. In response to a subject access application, the service will, consistent with section 28, consider whether the neither confirm nor deny approach needs to be followed and, if not, to what extent the withholding of all or some information is still necessary to safeguard national security.

 I understand that neither the Scottish Executive nor the Northern Ireland Office produce attrition rates for rape offences. My officials have contacted officials in the Scottish Executive and in the Northern Ireland Office and our understanding is that were they to produce attrition rates, they would be compiled on much the same basis as those produced for England and Wales.

<a name="20122w42.html_para1">The number of offences recorded and detected by the police together with the number of offenders convicted or cautioned (although in Scotland a caution is a sanction following a charge being proved in court) would be directly comparable, to the extent that each country uses its own principal offence rule for statistical purposes where offenders are convicted of more than one type of offence at the same time.

 Recorded crime figures include statistics on drugs offences, such as possession, but do not record whether other offences are related to offenders' drug habits. Furthermore, the information that is collected on the number of drug offences is only available for the Metropolitan police force area as a whole and would therefore not be a useful guide to the number of drug offences in Uxbridge.
<P>

<a name="20122w43.html_para4">The NEW-ADAM research programme of interviewing and drug testing those arrested by the police sheds some light on the links between drugs and crime, although again the conclusions do not relate specifically to Uxbridge. Research so far, based on eight locations in 1999&#150;2000, indicates that more than three-fifths (by value) of acquisitive crime is committed by users of both heroin and cocaine/crack.

It sets out proposals for common minimum, maximum sentence tariffs as well as common aggravating circumstances for drug trafficking offences. The proposal is currently being discussed at

 The Government have developed close co-operation with Turkey at an operational level because it is a key country on the supply route of heroin to the United Kingdom. In addition between 1994 and 1999 we provided over &#163;1 million for anti-drugs assistance, mainly in the form of training, and we expect to provide up to &#163;300,000 for training and equipment in 2001&#150;02.

 The civil service will be introducing new pension arrangements with effect from 1 October 2002. New entrants will be given a choice between a new final salary pension scheme and a stakeholder pension with an employer contribution. We are giving active members of the current pension scheme an option to move into the new final salary scheme on 1 October if they wish. The new scheme, which has a higher employee contribution rate than the current scheme, will allow widows and widowers to retain their pension if they remarry. We have no plans to change the arrangements in the current scheme whereby widows and widowers will normally lose their pension entitlement should they remarry.
