<P>
<a name="80210w01.html_wqn2"><B> Sir Patrick Cormack: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport how many projects allocated funds by the National Heritage Memorial Fund have not claimed their full grants; what is the total sum involved; and what percentage this represents of the money allocated.  [28512]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80210w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Tom Clarke: </B> 
 The National Heritage Memorial Fund encompasses two separate funds: the Heritage Lottery Fund, which distributes the heritage tranche of the proceeds from the National Lottery, and the Heritage Memorial Fund, which serves as a fund of last resort for the support of heritage projects throughout the United Kingdom. The number of completed projects which have been awarded grants by the Heritage Lottery Fund, but where the full value of the grant has not been claimed, is 93. The total value of grants awarded was &#163;46.7 million. The total amount unclaimed was &#163;1.3 million, or 2.7 per cent. of the total.
<P>

<a name="80210w01.html_para3">The Heritage Memorial Fund does not keep information on unclaimed grants in a readily accessible format.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80210w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Tom Clarke: </B> 
 The Government expect each of the good causes to receive &#163;1.8 billion over the period of the current licence. The Heritage Lottery Fund, which distributes the heritage tranche of the Lottery proceeds, has so far made grants to a value of &#163;892.6 million for 1,558 projects. Several of the other distributing bodies have also made grants to heritage projects but do not keep separate records.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what steps his Department is taking to implement the recommendations of the Nolan Committee on appointments; and what impact these measures have had on the time taken for appointments to be made. [28851]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80210w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Chris Smith: </B> 
 My Department has acted on the guidance issued by the Commissioner for Public Appointments, whose appointment was recommended by the Nolan Committee on Standards in Public Life.
<P>

<a name="80210w01.html_para4">We have established an appointments unit charged with overseeing the implementation of the Commissioner's recommendations. The unit also maintains a register of people who have expressed an interest in public appointment, acts as the secretariat for the advisory panels which provide independent scrutiny of shortlisted candidates, and co-ordinates advertising and executive search to fill posts where necessary, in accordance with the Commissioner's principle of proportionality.
<P>

<a name="80210w01.html_para5">These measures have inevitably lengthened the appointments process.

 The Police (Property) Act 1897 provides that any person claiming ownership of property seized and retained by the police may make an application to a magistrates' court for ownership to be determined and for delivery of that property to the person appearing to the court to be the owner. The Act maintains the right of any person to seek an order for recovery of property within six months after the date of the legal proceedings but any such right will cease at the expiry of that period of time.

 All available scientific and medical data were evaluated by experts from the Home Office Police Scientific Development Branch, the Department of Health and the Chemical and Biological Defence Establishment before operational trials of CS spray were undertaken between 1 March and 31 August 1996. It was found during the trials that the risk of injury from the use of CS spray was much lower than that from police batons. Of the 99 injuries believed to have been caused by CS, six resulted in subjects being taken to hospital, although none was detained there more than briefly. There has been no subsequent centrally co-ordinated assessment of injuries sustained as a result of exposure to CS spray.

<a name="80210w02.html_para8">My right hon. Friend studied all of the pathologists' reports and other medical and toxicological evidence submitted to the inquest which was held last year into the death of Mr. Ibrahima Sey. In the light of reading that material, my right hon. Friend confirmed his full support for the operational use of CS spray by the police. The use of CS spray and other equipment is kept under review by the Self Defence and Restraint Committee of the Association of Chief Police Officers.

 Where a European Economic Area (EEA) national has been granted indefinite leave to remain, the third country national spouse may apply either for leave to remain under the Immigration Rules on the basis of marriage to a person present and settled in the United Kingdom or for a residence document in accordance with European Community law. In the former case the applicant, if successful, would be granted 12 months' leave to remain in the first instance: in the latter case, the third country national spouse may apply for a residence document which, if issued, would have the same validity as any extant residence permit issued to the EEA spouse. If the EEA spouse no longer holds a valid residence permit, one would be issued with five years' validity as the basis for the issue of a residence document of the same validity to the third country national.

 The White Paper <i>Your Right to Know</i> contains the Government's collectively agreed proposals for a Freedom of Information Act and is the result of detailed discussion within Government. The current period of consultation on the White Paper is therefore designed to enable the public, not Government Departments, to submit their views on the Government's proposals. Except in those cases--so far only two out of 107--where confidentiality is requested, these submissions will be published on the "Informing Government" website (http://foi.democracy.org.uk).

 My Department is aware that code system operators licensed under the Telecommunications Act 1984 are required to develop a telecommunications network under the terms of their licence. The potential impact on the environment of the different forms of development involved is a key factor in forming Government policy on telecommunications planning.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will take steps to make the Index of Local Conditions more sensitive to rural poverty.  [28373]

<a name="80210w06.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 My Department is currently consulting with a wide range of external organisations, including local authorities, on proposals put forward by Professor Brian Robson of the University of Manchester to update the Index of Local Conditions to a 1996 base and to incorporate methodological improvements. Professor Robson's recommendations include a number of changes to the Index which will make it more sensitive to the identification of deprivation in rural areas and which have been proposed by groups and individuals concerned with rural regeneration. These proposed changes include removing indicators on car ownership and children in flats, adding a new indicator on the receipt of housing benefit and council tax benefit and changing the way that the overall index value is calculated so that high levels of deprivation on certain indicators are not cancelled out by low levels on other indicators. It is hoped to publish the new Index of Local Deprivation in the Spring.

 My Department has today issued a consultation paper on the housing fitness standard to seek the views of the local government associations and other relevant bodies on a range of proposals and options for change. The proposals have been drawn up taking into account responses received to an earlier initiating discussion paper; the results of research undertaken by Warwick University and the Building Research Establishment; and discussions with practitioner bodies and housing professionals.
<P>

<a name="80210w08.html_para3">It should be the aim of any housing fitness standard to provide a means for identifying, and thereby enabling action to be targeted on, those sections of the housing stock where the health and safety risks are the greatest. The main proposal, outlined in more detail in the consultation paper, is for a fitness rating approach to be developed and tested as a successor to the current standard. This would given an overall rating to a property based on an assessment of a range of housing characteristics, rather than the current pass/fail on one or more requirements. A fitness rating approach would surpass the existing standard by encompassing all the important health and safety risks in the home but also by distinguishing the varying severity of those risks. As a result it would have the potential for providing a more effective mechanism for the evaluation of the housing stock, both nationally and locally, and for the targeting of resources as well as for determining where intervention and public resources are needed most.

 <i>[holding answer 6 February 1998]:</i> The Local Government Boundary Commission for Scotland (LGBC) are currently reviewing local authority electoral boundaries, as required by legislation. So far, the LGBC have sent the Secretary of State reports for Angus and East Lothian and we are expecting them to send in reports for all other authorities within the next few months. We will consider all these reports and decide whether to implement them as they stand or with modifications.

 The New Health Authorities Programme was created to re-align health authorities' primary care systems, and the data held within them, with their new boundaries created in April 1996. The resultant changes will be implemented between July 1998 and July 1999.
<P>

<a name="80210w13.html_para0">The total cost of this work programme is &#163;3.85 million, spread across 1996-97, 1997-98 and 1998-99.

<P>
<a name="80210w13.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Milburn: </B> 
 National Health Service Administrative Register functions will be offered to NHS organisations through the NHS Strategic Tracing Service.

<P>

<a name="80210w13.html_para3">The tracing service is currently the subject of a public and private partnership procurement, with the expectation that a contract will be awarded early in the next financial year.

 Although there are similarities between the priority areas covered in "Our Healthier Nation" and the old key areas in "The Health of the Nation", the targets differ because they cover different time periods, different combinations of diseases, different age groups (for cancers) and, in the case of accidents, a morbidity measure rather than one for mortality. "Our Healthier Nation" focuses on health outcome measures, while "The Health of the Nation" targets contained a mixture of outcomes and determinants.

 At 30 June 1997, there were approximately 16,900 whole-time equivalent qualified nurses, midwives and health visitors directly employed by NHS Trusts in Wales. The latest detailed information provided by private health establishments indicated that there were about 2,700 whole-time equivalent qualified nurses at 31 March 1995, although it is believed that this may be an under-estimate.

<P>

<P>
<a name="80210w14.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Win Griffiths: </B> 
 I hope that nurses will have been heartened by the steps the Government have taken to cut back on unnecessary bureaucracy, by the ending of divisive local pay for staff on national contracts, by our search for a better, more robust approach to NHS pay in the longer term, and by the publication of our White Paper "Putting Patients First". This sets out plans for replacing the wasteful internal market, and includes commitments to involve community nurses more in organising health services for their patients and to develop a Strategic Framework for Nursing and a new Human Resources Strategy.
<P>

<a name="80210w14.html_para2">I am glad that we have been able to accept the recommendations of the independent Nurses' Pay Review Body for a rise of 3.8 per cent., the highest for six years. Nurses stand to receive 2 per cent. from 1 April, rising to 3.8 per cent. from 1 December.
<P>

<a name="80210w14.html_para3">By staging the increase, we can meet pay costs within the resources available to the NHS without prejudicing the planned level of service delivery.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80210w14.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Win Griffiths: </B> 
 Together with the proposed reconfiguration of NHS trusts in Wales, the abolition of the NHS internal market will create estimated savings of up to &#163;50 million over the lifetime of the current Parliament. These savings will be reinvested in frontline patient care, including services in community hospitals where appropriate. Individual capital projects are judged on their own merits and against the framework of commissioning authorities; strategic plans. Generally, capital schemes will be developed through the Private Finance Initiative.

 A health survey of adults was carried out in Wales during 1995 and one of the questions asked was 'Are you being treated for diabetes?'. The results showed that diabetes was reported by 3.2 per cent. of the adult population. Respondents were also asked if any children, under the age of 18 years, in their household were being treated for diabetes and the responses suggested that this was the case for approximately 0.3 per cent. of children.

 The Welsh Office's 1994 Based Household Projections for Wales are essentially trend based and do not make allowances for the effects of local or central government policies. They should be used as a base for policy projections.
<P>

<a name="80210w15.html_para6">Where a local planning authority's policy based provisions differ from these projections the differences should be fully justified in the development plan. The Secretary of State will consider intervening where the justification for the development plan figures is either unsound or unacceptable.

 The application was received by the Department on 11 September 1996. Following preparation of the draft Order and map and consultation with interested parties, including other public bodies, my officials wrote to Calshot Oyster Fishermen Ltd. on 6 June 1997 requesting that it should be advertised.

 The Department of Transport and the Deputy Harbour Master, Associated British Ports in Southampton, advised that the Calshot Oyster Fishery should not be extended into the Thorn Channel, a narrow navigation channel for large vessels entering the port of Southampton, because of the risk of small fishing boats interfering with safe navigation.

[27388]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80210w17.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The objections to the proposed Calshot Oyster Fishery (Variation) Order are primarily concerned with the potential loss of earnings, although there were also objections on the grounds that it would make enforcement more difficult and also to the principle of such fishery Orders.
<P>

<a name="80210w17.html_para0">My officials wrote to the 7 objectors requesting further information. Three replies were received, one of which was considered irrelevant. The two other letters contained a more exact figure of the potential loss of earnings as a result of the extension of the fishery. The author of one of these letters expressed the wish for it to be kept confidential whilst the other letter will be made available to Calshot Oyster Fishermen Ltd.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, pursuant to his answer of 22 December 1997, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>493</i>, in what areas he judged it necessary to invoke the Hague Preference on stocks at the last Fisheries Council; in which areas it could have been invoked and was not held to be necessary; and if he will press for an extension of the Hague Preference to other areas of the United Kingdom.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80210w18.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 5 February 1998]:</i> At the December 1997 Fisheries Council, the UK invoked Hague Preference in respect of stocks of West of Scotland saithe and whiting, North Sea whiting and Irish Sea cod and whiting. This was the first occasion that Hague Preference had been invoked for North Sea whiting.
<P>

<a name="80210w18.html_para6">In view of the Council's decision to maintain national quotas for West of Scotland herring at levels agreed in previous years, the UK did not invoke Hague Preference for this stock and, in line with longstanding practice, the UK did not invoke it for North Sea mackerel; nor did we invoke Hague Preference in respect of North Sea sprat or Norway pout for which the Council allocated the full total allowable catches to Member States for the first time.
<P>

<a name="80210w18.html_para7">Hague Preference may be invoked only for certain stocks of importance to fisheries dependent communities in Ireland and the northern parts of the UK. Its use is opposed by some other Member States and I do not see any prospect of Member States with fisheries dependent areas which do not benefit from Hague Preference agreeing to its being made available for other stocks and other areas of the United Kingdom.

Work covered by the Department's Research and Development programme includes breeding for improved quality; pest and disease resistance; crop production, including improving crop uniformity and scheduling; crop protection, with work covering the epidemiology of pests and diseases as well as biological and integrated pest management; the improvement of storage and shelf life. The Department's funded work provides a strong underpinning base from which the levy-funded bodies, such as the Apple and Pear Research Council and the Horticultural Development Council, pick up and the results and develop them through to industry application.

 The Standards and Effectiveness Unit was set up in May 1997 to be the focus for the Department's work on raising standards in schools. It covers a wide range of functions including literacy and numeracy, performance measurement and target-setting, inspection of schools and LEAs, Education Action Zones, Education Development Plans, the Standards Task Force and the National Year of Reading. Its current complement of 95 staff are drawn very largely from existing staff together with some ten experienced practitioners with recent experience as headteachers, inspectors, researchers and advisers. The costs of the Unit for 1998-99 have yet to be finalised but will be met within the running costs of the Department's Schools Directorate.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Secretary of State for Social Security has asked me to respond to recent Parliamentary Questions regarding the Benefit Integrity Project (BIP).
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>As announced by the Secretary of State today, it is important that decisions about benefit entitlement are made fairly and are seen to be fair. In future, no decision made by the project resulting in reduction or removal of entitlement to Disability Living Allowance (DLA) will be made solely on the evidence provided by the claimant--there will always be additional evidence to support the decision.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We have been liaising closely with organisations of and for disabled people from the early stages of the Project. This new initiative underlines our determination to act properly to get the benefit right and to listen and act upon any concerns. We will continue to involve these groups in the evaluation of the Project as it develops.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>This project continues to operate under the normal assessment and adjudication rules that are applied to all DLA cases. Adjudication Officers (AOs) who are responsible for assessing cases referred to them under the BIP follow exactly the same guidelines as those applying to all other DLA cases. No special guidance has been issued to AOs involved in the BIP. A copy of the AOs Guide, which provides general information about legislation affecting DLA, is held in the Library.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>To minimise unnecessary distress to individuals receiving DLA and to avoid nugatory enquiries people with certain conditions will not be contacted directly by the BIP. This includes recipients of DLA who are terminally ill, defined in DLA legislation as having a life expectancy of less than six months.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The BIP visiting officers are required to explain to customers, at the time of the visit, that the purpose of gathering the information contained in the questionnaire, is to ensure that the correct amount of benefit is in payment. They also explain the length of time it is likely to take for a decision to be made on their case. When the decision is notified, the customer is given information about how to request a review or appeal against the decision should they wish to do so. The customer should request a review within three months of the decision.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>All cases are sent to Blackpool for adjudication where the cases are dealt with on an alphabetical basis in chronological order, by approximately 80 AOs. The information is not available broken down into regions or parliamentary constituencies. At present, there are 139 visiting officers employed nationally on the BIP of which 14 are based in Scotland.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The criteria used to determine entitlement to DLA relate to the mobility and care needs arising from a person's disability; their ability to, or suitability for work is not relevant. People in receipt of DLA can work without it having an effect on their entitlement.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>A special exercise was conducted to identify customers suffering from multiple sclerosis whose awards were looked at under the BIP. Of the 1,706 cases examined, 22 awards have been set aside, 114 reduced, 59 increased and 1,511 remain unchanged.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The information is not available for the number of medical practitioners who have written to assessment and appeals officers. It may help if I explain. AOs decide on entitlement to benefit taking 



<P>
</UL></FONT><P><I>10 Feb 1998 : Column: 188</I><P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>into account the information before them. They can request information from any source if they think it necessary to enable them to make the correct decision. The AOs may ask for information from qualified medical practitioners which they will take into account when making their decision but the medical practitioners do not give advice about whether or not benefit should be awarded.

 Employers currently pay secondary Class 1 National Insurance contributions at the rate of 3 per cent. in respect of employees who have gross earnings between &#163;62 and &#163;109.99 a week. If this band were abolished, so that no employers' contributions were paid on earnings of less than &#163;110 a week, the estimated loss of contribution revenue would be around &#163;260 million in a full year.

 Type 23 frigates achieved approximately 85-89 per cent. average availability for operational service in each of the last five years with the exception of 1996 when the figure dropped to just over 80 per cent. due to a number of ships experiencing a particular defect. This discounts time spent in planned maintenance.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80210w25.html_spnew0"><B> Mrs. Roche </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 26 January 1998]:</i> The National Audit office undertook an audit at the Radio Communications Agency during 1997. The assignment, which involved auditing the Agency's annual accounts for 1996-97, was completed prior to the issue of the Certificate and Report of the Comptroller and Auditor General to the House of Commons on 7 November 1997 (prepared in accordance with the Agency's Accounts Direction of 21 July 1993). The Agency Annual Report and Accounts for 1996-97 containing these audited accounts is available in the Libraries of the House.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80210w25.html_spnew1"><B> Mrs. Roche </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 26 January 1998]:</i> The following figures are the latest available for a full financial year. This information covers only properties for which the Agency was then required to disclose asset details in its audited balance sheet. At that time, the Agency did not include in its balance sheet capital values for freehold, long leasehold or rented properties or related land which it occupied, except where it had incurred capital costs itself in acquiring or improving those properties. At 31 March 1997, the carrying value of such costs was &#163;2,420,000, relating almost exclusively to fitting out its leased temporary headquarters at London Blackfriars.
<P>

<a name="80210w25.html_para0">The position will change with effect from 31 March 1998 when PRS rents are abolished. Property values will subsequently be included in the balance sheet where the Agency is the sole or major occupier. The fixed asset carrying values of such properties that would have applied at 31 March 1997, if PRS rents had already been abolished, was &#163;819,000.

To ask the President of the Board of Trade what assessment is made of the likely incidence of sham recovery, as defined by the Radioactive Waste Management Advisory Committee, in its October 1997 report on the import and export of radioactive waste, when considering application from nuclear reprocessors to import spent nuclear fuel.

<a name="80210w26.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 The UK has no facilities for the direct disposal of spent nuclear fuel and therefore "sham recovery", as defined by the Radioactive Waste Management Advisory Committee, is not a practical option.
