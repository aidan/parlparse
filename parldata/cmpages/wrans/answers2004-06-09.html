Notes:<br>

1. The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 14 (seven prior to 2002&#150;03) diagnosis fields in the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data set and provides the main reason why the patient was in hospital.<br>

2. A finished admission episode is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. Please note that admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>

3. Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).<br>

<p><a name="40609w05.html_spnew6"><b> Miss Melanie Johnson </b> 
<i>[holding answer 27 May 2004]:</i> The Government are taking steps to reduce the impact of smoking on young people. The glamourising of tobacco products through advertising, promotion and sponsorship as well as through their depiction in the media is linked to smoking rates.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40609w05.html_para2">
That is why the Tobacco Advertising and Promotion Act 2002 provides for a comprehensive ban on advertising of tobacco products. There is also an Office of Communications code covering the portrayal of smoking in television programmes. This code specifically requires that the portrayal of smoking should be avoided in children&#039;s programmes, and included only when there is a strong editorial case for inclusion. In other programmes likely to be widely seen by young people, smoking should be included only where context or dramatic veracity requires it. In such programmes smoking should not be prominently featured as a normal and attractive activity.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40609w05.html_para3">
The independent British Board of Film Classification is currently undertaking a consultation exercise to update its guidelines on granting classifications for films which can be seen by children.

The Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) continually assesses its performance against its published service levels across all sectors and employment categories. I am unable to provide my hon.

However, since June 2003 the CRB has been issuing on average 93 per cent. of all Standard and Enhanced Disclosures within two and four weeks respectively, against published service standards of 90 per cent. The bureau is processing over 50,000 Disclosures per week. On 12 May, the CRB issued its four millionth Disclosure.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40609w05.html_para6">
The CRB has received a number of representations from individuals and organisations across all groups about the effects of delays in completing Disclosures. Again, the bureau does not currently record centrally the number of representations received from or concerning social care workers. The bureau aims to resolve any issues in the shortest time possible in order to minimise disruption to people who require the clearance to occupy an employment position.

the combined electorate of the four all-postal regions for the purpose of the European Parliamentary election on 10 June is; how many ballot papers in those elections reached the Post Office <i>(a)</i> on or before 1 June and <i>(b)</i> on each day subsequently; and how many ballot papers were delivered other than by the Post Office (i) on or before 1 June and (ii) on each subsequent day. [177744]</p>









<p><a name="40609w06.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Leslie: </b> 
 As at December 2003, the combined electorate of the North East, East Midlands, Yorkshire and the Number and North West regions was 14,083,004. Elections are not run by central Government. However, from discussions with returning officers, the relevant printing firms and the Royal Mail, we understand that 99.24 per cent. of ballot papers were with the Royal Mail or had been hand delivered by local authorities by midnight on 1 June. Those few batches which were not collected by midnight on 1 June were picked up by the Royal Mail at around 5.10am on 2 June. Small-scale problems which have necessitated the reprinting or issuing of new ballot papers after this date have been dealt with on a local level and figures are not held centrally. New ballot papers issued due to an elector reporting the original paper lost or spoilt are again administered at a local level and no figures are kept centrally.

<p><a name="40609w08.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Timms: </b> 
 The Department of Trade and Industry maintains close contact with the Chinese authorities with regard to energy matters, and including renewable energy. This contact is managed day-to-day through the commercial sections of the British diplomatic posts in China, and export and trade promoters of UK Trade and Investment and of the DTI&#039;s New and Renewable Energy Programme.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40609w08.html_para0">
We are currently working with the Chinese to assist with their design and drafting of regulations to increase their use of renewable energy over the coming years. In close co-operation with the Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Partnership (REEEP), we received a delegation of Chinese law makers in March, for a programme of meetings when they were able to discuss the issues involved with UK Government Departments and with UK industry. In May we sent a specialist who works with our Distributed Generation Working Group, and a Trade Promoter of the DTI&#039;s New and Renewable Energy Programme, to Beijing to join a working group developing the drafting of these regulations, which are expected to come into force next year.
</p>


<p>

We will continue to support this initiative, and also to promote contact between companies and industry bodies of our two countries. We have commissioned the development of a website designed specifically to make available information on renewable energy capabilities and opportunities in each country. This website is nearing completion, and can now be viewed on www.ukchinarenewables.co.uk. We understand that a UK specialist wind energy company is once again going to engage in training Chinese companies in the development of wind energy, in June; at least partially as a result of our trade promotional activities. And we are preparing to sponsor a presence by UK industry at a wind energy conference and exhibition in Beijing at the end of October.

We work with the services of UK Trade and Industry, which makes available to firms a range of market information and market research, and provides assistance with participation in trade missions, exhibitions, and conferences. In addition, we make focused market information available to UK firms that are active in the supply of goods and services for renewable energy, and we lead participation in some further trade events within China, brief a number of Chinese trade delegations visiting this country, and accompany some to meet and to visit UK companies. The website mentioned above is an example of making 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>9 Jun 2004 : Column 412W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
market information more readily available to UK companies. The last trade delegation that we led to China was to exhibit at an environmental exhibition in Beijing in December. That initiative was organised in conjunction also with a JEMU environmental trade mission to three provinces, and with the UK themed workshop &quot;Think UK&quot;, arranged by the British embassy and UK industrial sponsors. Several UK renewable energy firms participated in that workshop, and achieved prominence at a senior level as a result. The next Renewable Energy trade mission that we are planning is the Wind Energy exhibition and conference in Beijing at the end of October. Meanwhile we continue to work with individual UK companies that are developing business opportunities.

<sup>(7)</sup> Following a review of the Department&#039;s business support, Grant for Research and Development was introduced on 1 June 2003 to replace and enhance the Smart scheme. Smart remained open to applications up until 31 August 2003 to allow applicants the opportunity to adjust to the new product. Grant for Research and Development has proved just as popular as its predecessor so 



regional competitions for the grants have been introduced to ensure that expenditure on the product remains under control and to ensure that those research and development projects which best meet the grant selection criteria are supported.<br>

<p><a name="40609w08.html_spnew2"><b> Nigel Griffiths: </b> 
 Where contracts are governed by UK law, businesses may use the Late Payment of Commercial Debts legislation (as amended) to claim interest and compensation on late paid debts.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40609w08.html_para7">
This Government have always recognised that late payment of debts can have serious effects on the cash flow of smaller companies, which is why we had a manifesto commitment to introduce a Late Payment Act to allow small businesses to:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">claim interest on late payment from other business or public sector bodies;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">allow creditors to claim a fixed sum of compensation to cover debt recovery costs should late payment happen.</p>
</ul>
<p>

</p>


<p>
<a name="40609w08.html_para8">
The Government also established the Better Payment Practice Group whose website lists the payment record of companies.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40609w08.html_para9">
The package of measures has had a positive effect on payment times. The Grant Thornton European Business Survey showed that the average time taken in the UK to settle accounts in 1997 was 49 days. By 2002 this had fallen to 41 days. By comparison, the average settlement time in our European neighbours was 50 days. A recent survey by the REL Consultancy Group looked at average days payable outstanding (DPO) and concluded that UK companies&#039; payment performance is 33.6 days against 42.4 days for Europe as a whole.

 The seeds of the cannabis plant are not subject to control under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971. The possession, sale and the use of the seeds for culinary and similar purposes are therefore not subject to restriction. This follows the provisions of international law&#151;UN Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, 1961&#151;on which our law is based.

It is not considered practicable or desirable to bring the seeds or their users under control.

In common with certain other substances controlled under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971, cannabis is subject to designation under Section 7.

Cultivation is subject to security conditions assessed on the basis of the individual circumstances and to record keeping requirements. The research has to be recognised as serious by the medical or scientific communities.

The only other special purpose of any significance where licensing has been permitted is the cultivation of cannabis for the production of industrial hemp (used in animal bedding, specialised building products and other materials).

It is possible that Autistic Spectrum Disorders among the prison population may be under-diagnosed. The Prison Service, Prison Health and the Youth Justice Board have jointly appointed a Programme Manager for Juvenile Health. This appointment is expected to lead, among other things, to a greater understanding of the nature and prevalence of all conditions&#151;including autism&#151;in the juvenile population. This in turn should lead to better diagnosis and assessment in individual cases and improved commissioning of appropriate services.

 The draft EU Constitutional Treaty will not change the way in which competition rules apply to NHS bodies.

<p>
<a name="40609w19.html_para5">
The former Police Authority for Northern Ireland who handled the allocation of funding for most of the town centre schemes in Northern Ireland required each individual scheme to arrange an evaluation of their performance in the two years after the CCTV system became operational. All evaluations received to date, indicate that in the areas where CCTV was in operation, crime was reduced or, the rate of increase was slower than other areas and the level of detection of crime increased. In some areas the level of reported crime increased as the cameras witnessed crimes not normally reported, though this was usually combined with an increase in detection.

The network of CCTV cameras at interface locations in North and East Belfast has proved very effective not only in terms of effecting non-confrontational arrests but also in allowing police to deploy resources in a better informed manner.

<p><a name="40609w22.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </b> 
 Bullying is a serious problem which puts the emotional well-being and educational achievement of pupils at risk. Schools should treat bullying seriously and take steps to combat it promptly and firmly whenever and wherever it occurs. From September 1999, head teachers of maintained schools have been under a duty to draw up measures to prevent all forms of bullying among pupils.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40609w22.html_para1">
In December 2000 we launched a guidance pack for schools with an accompanying video aimed at pupils. The pack is entitled &#039;Bullying: don&#039;t suffer in silence&#039;. In September 2002 an updated version of this document was issued.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40609w22.html_para2">
There is also a new public information film, &#039;Tell Someone&#039;, to raise awareness and encourage children to tell someone if they are being bullied, and an anti-bullying website at www.dfes.gov.uk/bullying, which contains the text of the updated pack. The Department has also funded an expansion of the Parentline Plus free helpline for the parents of bullying victims (0808 800 2222). The key message of the strategy is that pupils should be able to report bullying to someone they trust and not suffer in silence.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40609w22.html_para3">
We have launched an anti-bullying &#039;Charter for Action&#039; which all schools are encouraged to sign and which offers a series of practical suggestions for tackling bullying. The anti-bullying Charter went into every maintained school in England on 19 January 2004. Like all the rest of our anti-bullying guidance, this is published and in the public domain. For further information on the Department&#039;s work to counter bullying in schools can be found on our website at www.dfes.gov.uk/bullying.

 Parking controls are determined by local traffic authorities taking into account local circumstances, including the need to ensure safety, relieve congestion and manage the space available for parking.

Local schemes may provide for dispensations for those whose duties necessarily take them into areas where parking controls are in force.

Local authorities outside London have their own arrangements for dispensations.

Notes:<br>

1. The Households Below Average Income (HBAI) presents statistics on the proportion of children in low income households on both the McClements and modified OECD equalisation scales.<br>





2. The modified OECD equivalence scale focuses on income before housing costs. We are adopting this income equalisation scale for the new long-term child poverty measure from 2004&#150;05 so we can credibly benchmark our performance internationally.<br>

3. The existing PSA to reduce by a quarter the number of children living in low income by 2004&#150;05 uses the McClements Equivalence scale, and reports both before and after housing costs.<br>

4. The Government recognises the continuing interest in results for income after housing costs. HBAI, a National Statistics publication, will continue to publish results both for income before housing costs, and for income after housing costs. These will also continue to be published in &quot;Opportunity for all&quot;. Copies of both documents are available in the Library.<br>

 In the light of the recommendations of the Committee of Public Accounts, the Occupational Pensions Regulatory Authority (Opra) has been seeking, within the framework of its statutory powers and obligations, to refocus its resources on issues that present a real risk to members&#039; benefits. In October 2003, Opra published revised guidance to scheme professionals on the reporting of breaches: statutory whistleblowers (scheme auditors and actuaries) are now expected to consider the nature and impact of any breach they identify before deciding whether or not to make a report to the authority. In May 2004, Opra also issued revised guidance to non-statutory whistleblowers.

 Estimates of compliance levels since the introduction of stakeholder pensions have been based on cumulative quarterly data from the Association of British Insurers (ABI) that have now become out of date. More recent data from the 2003 Employers Pension Provision Survey and from the DTI Small Business Service has enabled us to update our estimate of the level of compliance with the requirement for employers with five or more staff to offer their workers access to a stakeholder pension scheme. On the basis of these we estimate the level of compliance as just over 80 per cent.
