<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions has asked me to reply to your Question about the vessel "Pride of Bilbao".
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The MSA's findings on this matter were not in the form of an official report but a Note has been prepared summarising the sequence of events, the actions taken and our conclusions. A copy of this Note is enclosed; in view of the public interest a copy has also been sent to the Editor of the Portsmouth News.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Passenger Ferry Pride of Bilbao: Voyage in rough weather: Portsmouth-Bilbao 3-6 January 1998
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>1. The Marine Safety Agency has followed up complaints received about the voyage of the Pride of Bilbao from Portsmouth to Bilbao, departing from Portsmouth on 3 January 1998. Inquiries have included a visit by a Marine Safety Agency surveyor to the ship, an interview with the Master and telephone discussions with a number of passengers. This note summarises the main findings.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>Pride of Bilbao</i>
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>2. The Pride of Balbao is a UK registered ro-ro passenger ferry, managed and operated by P & O European Ferries. It has a passenger certificate issued by the Marine Safety Agency entitling it to carry up to a maximum of 2,335 passengers and up to 220 crew. It operates principally on the route from Portsmouth to Bilbao, and is also used on the Portsmouth to Cherbourg crossing. The usual crossing time from Portsmouth to Bilbao is about 36 hours.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>3. In terms of weather and sea state, there are no operating restrictions placed on the vessel. It is fully capable of withstanding the most severe weather conditions. During the winter months, gale force winds and rough seas are a common occurrence on the Portsmouth to Bilbao crossing; the Bay of Biscay in particular is renowned for storms. The ship is fitted with stabilisers and normal precautions including lashing lorries and freight to ensure that they do not shift in heavy seas.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>Voyage on 3 January</i>
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>4. In advance of the sailing at 2000h on 3 January, the Master of the Pride of Bilbao, took account of the weather forecast information, in line with the usual practice. The forecast weather was for gale force winds for the proposed route; consequently, the crew were advised to take normal heavy weather precautions, including double lashing of lorries. At the beginning of the voyage the usual passenger sailing announcements were made; passengers were warned that the crossing would be rough and that they should proceed with care when moving around the vessel. There were some 800 passengers on board, together with cars, caravans and freight.




<P>
</UL></FONT><P><I>9 Feb 1998 : Column: 2</I><P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>5. The Pride of Bilbao was due for drydocking immediately on its return from Spain. Since it was apparent that the voyage was likely to take longer than usual, the Master did discuss with P & O shore staff the question of whether the vessel should sail and agreed that it should continue as planned. However, this discussion related to scheduling the advice to passengers on the forecast conditions. No questions were raised as to whether it was safe to sail; that decision was left, as is proper, to the Master.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>6. At mid-day on 4 January the weather became more severe and the Master informed the passengers that he would be slowing down and slightly altering course to ease sailing conditions. Passengers were also informed that the outside upper deck doors would be secured to avoid them causing injury or being damaged by the strong winds. At its peak the storm reached force 11 to 12, with waves of 30 metres.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>7. At 0130 on 5 January passengers were informed that the ship would be resuming its usual course for Bilbao. It subsequently reached port at 0030 on 6 January; this was some 16.5 hours later than timetabled.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>8. Accident reports concerning injuries to people sustained during the voyage were submitted, the most serious being a broken arm. These are being considered by the Marine Accident Investigation Branch. 2 or 3 damage reports were filed for minor damage to cars. A foc's'le ladder came adrift; the piano was damaged and a plate glass window was crazed. Overall, damage to fittings was minor and no damage to the structure of the ship was sustained.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>Conclusions</i>
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>9. It is clear that the crossing on 3-6 January was very stormy and that many passengers found the rough seas exceptionally unpleasant. However, the Marine Safety Agency has concluded that the safety of the ship, its passengers and crew was not compromised by the decision to sail, which was taken in the knowledge that bad weather was forecast. Having interviewed the Master, the Agency is satisfied that he acted in a fully competent manner, in preparing for the voyage and during it, in accordance with the principles of good seamanship. There is no evidence that he was placed under any commercial pressure to sail against his judgment.</FONT></UL>

<a name="80209w01.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The decision whether or not to provide Secondary Surveillance Radar (SSR) facilities at Belfast International Airport is a matter for the airport authority, Belfast International Airport Limited. I understand that the present plan is for an SSR system to be introduced in the summer of 1999, after the radar display system has been up-dated to handle SSR data.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80209w01.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 In conjunction with IBM, National Air Traffic Services Ltd. (NATS) has carried out extensive test and assessment programme on its IBM machines and has established that, within the context of their use in NATS, these machines represent a minimal risk with respect to the millennium.
<P>

<a name="80209w01.html_para3">Remedial work on CAA and NATS systems to deal with the millennium bug problem should be completed by July 1998. The systems will then be subjected to validation tests. The testing of all operational systems, and non-operational systems with significant impact, is scheduled for completion by the end of 1998.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what Government financial help is available to local authorities in England and Wales to encourage tree-planting schemes within their areas.  [27635]

<P>
<a name="80209w02.html_spnew0"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 Local authorities may plant trees themselves or support planting schemes carried out by others. Any financial help is given at the discretion of each local authority from resources available to them through the local government finance system. Authorities may also be eligible to apply for the Forestry Commission's Woodland Grant Scheme, which offers grant aid for the establishment and management of woodlands.
<P>

<a name="80209w02.html_para0">In addition, local authorities may be partners in Government sponsored programmes which involve tree planting as part of a wider strategy to improve the local environment, such as the Community Forest Programme and the Single Regeneration Budget. They may also work with voluntary organisations supported financially by the Government to encourage tree planting (such as the Tree Council) or who are engaged in planting trees (such as Groundwork and the British Trust for Conservation Volunteers).

<P>
<a name="80209w02.html_spnew1"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 I am considering whether some form of Government intervention in relation to such hedges and trees is justified, but there are no powers to limit their height under building regulations, which apply only to the design and construction of buildings.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80209w02.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The Highways Agency owns 13 of the 15 properties which should have to be demolished to build the road. The rest of the land, about 40 hectares, would be acquired under compulsory purchase powers, following the completion of the statutory procedures, if the scheme goes ahead. The scheme is included in the strategic review of Trunk Roads, the results of which we aim to announce later this year.

 Railtrack publishes its levels of investment for the maintenance, renewal and enhancement of the network in an annual Network Management Statement. The next statement is expected in March. No organisation is currently responsible for monitoring the total investment levels planned by all train operators, though the Franchising Director monitors contractually committed investment. Our proposed Rail Authority will help to meet the need for proper strategic planning in the industry.

<a name="80209w02.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 Owners are first and foremost responsible for maintaining their properties in a reasonable and safe state of repair. Statutory provisions exist for local authorities to take enforcement action against owners whose properties are unfit for human habitation or in a state of disrepair. In the private rented sector we are committed to introducing a licensing scheme for houses in multiple occupation where poor fire and safety and other health and safety standards often apply. Primary legislation will be needed to introduce a licensing scheme.

 Article 35 of the Euratom Treaty requires Member States to establish facilities for the continuous monitoring of the levels of radioactivity in the environment. The European Commission periodically arranges for groups of experts to visit Member States to verify the operation and efficiency of these facilities.
<P>

<a name="80209w03.html_para2">The most recent verification visits to the UK took place in May and December 1993 and evaluated monitoring facilities in the vicinities of Dounreay and Sellafield respectively. The Commission concluded that the monitoring facilities met the required standard on both occasions.

 <i>[holding answer 5 February 1998]:</i> The Consultation document which we propose to publish will address many complex issues and it is necessary to have the input of a number of Government Departments beforehand to ensure that it is as comprehensive as possible and correctly addresses all the relevant issues.

 The Department invites English Nature to comment on all applications for research trials or marketing of genetically modified organisms.

In commenting on the specific genetically modified herbicide tolerant crops which have gone forward for marketing approval in the European Union, English Nature raised various concerns, but did not at that stage call for a three year ban.

 The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) consulted interested parties last year on a proposal for an exemption certificate which would allow disposal of untreated liquid waste containing GMOs when, on the basis of a thorough risk assessment, they are judged not to pose a risk to human health and the environment. The sort of GMOs concerned are those which are capable of only limited survival in the environment. Non-reproduction would be one of the factors considered in the risk assessment. The consultation also included detailed related guidance on risk assessment.
<P>

<a name="80209w04.html_para7">The Advisory Committee on Genetic Modification have evaluated the outcome of the consultation exercise. They advised that while no new issues about risk assessment had been raised in the consultation an independent review of the scientific literature should be commissioned, given the continual advances in knowledge in this area, to ensure that the very latest scientific information is taken into account. HSE has accepted this advice. Further consideration of the proposed certificate and guidance, by HSE and the Government Departments with an interest, has therefore been deferred pending completion of that review.

(2) The term 'public housing' is taken to mean housing owned by local authorities, Scottish Homes (formerly the Scottish Special Housing Association), and the New Town Development Corporations. This does not therefore include investment by the Housing Corporation (pre-1989) and by Scottish Homes (since 1989) in housing association stock, in the private rented sector and in housing for sale. All amounts are in &#163; million at 1996-97 prices. <P>

 Since 1 November 1995, 26 prisoners have been repatriated from England and Wales to the Republic of Ireland. Each case took the following number of days respectively to complete: 379, 764, 203, 779, 379, 379, 412, 764, 807, 757, 794, 196, 185, 178, 179, 178, 178, 555, 612, 644, 425, 618, 331, 463, 79, 316.
<P>

<a name="80209w07.html_para2">Because each case is considered on its individual merits, and circumstances vary from case to case, it is not considered appropriate to set targets for the completion of individual stages in the repatriation process. As a second jurisdiction is also involved in the consideration of repatriation applications, it is similarly inappropriate to set a target for final completion.
<P>

<a name="80209w07.html_para3">The United Kingdom authorities are initially responsible under the terms of the Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons for obtaining and collating relevant documentation required in support of each repatriation application, and where a particular request appears to meet the requirements of the Convention, for referring it to the receiving jurisdiction.
<P>

<a name="80209w07.html_para4">If the other jurisdiction agrees to receive the prisoner, the United Kingdom is responsible for ensuring that the prisoner's sentence will continue to be enforced in the receiving jurisdiction, and for deciding whether to agree to the transfer. The United Kingdom is then responsible for providing the prisoner in writing with the details of the basis on which repatriation will take place, for obtaining the prisoner's written consent to repatriation, and for forwarding this to the receiving jurisdiction.

The reconviction rates for Colchester and Thorn Cross will not be available for some time. Home Office statistics indicate that 73 per cent. of male young offenders (ages 17-20) who were discharged in 1993 were reconvicted within two years. The cost per place is based on dividing the running costs by the certified normal accommodation (CNA) for the establishment.

 I am satisfied that our proposals for establishing Anti-Social Behaviour Orders are compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights. The question of the compatibility of the provisions in the Crime and Disorder Bill for Anti-Social Behaviour Orders with the European Convention on Human Rights has been carefully considered by Government lawyers but it is not normal practice to publish legal advice and we see no reason to breach this principle in this case.

 We consider that the legal procedure for the Anti-Social Behaviour Orders in the Crime and Disorder Bill complies with Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights. Application for an order is a civil procedure. An order has prohibitory force only and involves no criminal record. Breach of an order is a criminal offence and carries with it the full safeguards of the criminal law.

<P>
<a name="80209w08.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 We are very concerned about the existence of child prostitution and the tragedy of the involvement of any child in prostitution. The principal aim of the law in this area is to protect the children concerned and to ensure that all those who seek to exploit children in this way, whether it is those who have unlawful sexual intercourse with a child or those who 



<P>
<P><I>9 Feb 1998 : Column: 26</I><P>
encourage, control or exploit the prostitution of children, are liable in the criminal law. It is, of course an operational matter for the police to investigate any allegations of a crime.
<P>

<a name="80209w08.html_para1">We are satisfied that the law is adequate to deal with the evil of child prostitution. We will, however, consider any particular proposals to tighten the law further in this area if deficiencies are identified.

<P>
<a name="80209w08.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 I have had no specific discussions with chief constables on this particular aspect of child prostitution.
<P>

<a name="80209w08.html_para2">Under section 46(1) of the Children Act 1989, police have powers to take into protective custody any child at risk of significant harm. The child can then be referred to appropriate agencies. The Association of Chief Police Officers has now issued best practice guidelines for the police that emphasise that children caught up in prostitution should normally be treated as victims and in need of help rather than criminals. These guidelines were drawn up in discussion with the Children's Society and other agencies, and the Home Office.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80209w08.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 The provisions of the Crime and Disorder Bill will place a statutory duty on local authorities and the police service to develop local crime and disorder reduction partnerships with other agencies. These will assess local crime problems, develop a strategy for tackling them and publish crime reduction targets. In areas where the local crime audits identify domestic violence as a problem, the local crime and disorder reduction strategy should address it.

 The British Crime Survey (BCS), which the Home Office conducts, is a survey of people living in domestic households in England and Wales. In its present format and structure, it would be inappropriate for the BCS to include offences committed against people who live in residential care homes. This would require a specialist survey. A feasibility study into a possible survey of communal establishments is being undertaken by Social Survey Division of the Office for National Statistics. As yet, no decision has been taken on the types of communal establishment that this would cover, whether victimisation will be covered or the funding arrangements for the survey.

The Option C elements of the claim and application will be considered at a later date under the published arrangements for processing compensation claims. There has been no "delay" in this case. I have explained to the House on many occasions why firearms compensation claims take time to process.

<a name="80209w09.html_wqn2"><B> Sir Brian Mawhinney: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, pursuant to the oral answer of 2 February 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, column 709, if he will specify those areas of local government activity which will show resource savings as a result of the implementation of statutory duties on local authorities as contained in the Crime and Disorder Bill [<i>Lords</i>], and estimate the amount of savings in each case.  [27945]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80209w09.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Michael </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 5 February 1998]:</i> The nature and precise extent of such savings will vary from one local authority to the next, depending on the kind of crime and disorder problems in each area identified by the audit which the Crime and Disorder Bill will require, and the priorities of the crime and disorder strategies as agreed with key partners locally. It is not possible to put any meaningful figures on this yet, but we expect there to be potential for considerable savings. This point was broadly acknowledged by many of the local authorities which responded to our invitation to comment on these proposals before the Bill was published.
<P>

<a name="80209w09.html_para0">Examples of local government activity which might benefit from these proposals include:
<P>

<a name="80209w09.html_para1">
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>Housing</i>--reduced capital expenditure on repairs to property damaged by vandalism. Reduced time in pursuing complaints for which the remedies are adequate.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>Social Services</i>--reductions in the costs associated with dealing with the incidence of youth crime and its aftermath.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>Education</i>--reduced bills for repairs to school buildings, and savings arising from improved attendance rates and less disruption in the classroom.</FONT></UL>
<P>

<a name="80209w09.html_para2">Just as importantly, the Crime and Disorder Bill will put local authorities where they should always have been--in the forefront of the fight against crime. Local surveys have shown time and again that this is seen as a core activity for local government by the people which it exists to serve. We are determined to give local authorities the powers they need, and want, to meet this wholly legitimate demand by local communities.

<a name="80209w10.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Lilley: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what estimate he has made of the effect on tax revenues of setting the cap on tax exempt savings held in individual savings accounts at <i>(a)</i> &#163;30,000, <i>(b)</i> &#163;50,000, <i>(c)</i> &#163;100,000, <i>(d)</i> &#163;150,000 and <i>(e)</i> &#163;250,000.  [19704]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80209w10.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Geoffrey Robinson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 8 December 1997]:</i> TESSAs and PEPs will cost about &#163;1&#189; billion a year by April 1999. Under the proposals set out in the consultation document, funds currently held in TESSAs and PEPs will be able to transfer into individual savings accounts, subject to the overall &#163;50,000 limit. People with PEPs and TESSAs whose value exceeds &#163;50,000 will be unable to transfer the excess to ISAs.
<P>

<a name="80209w10.html_para0">The estimated cost to the Exchequer of these proposals is broadly similar to the combined cost of TESSAs and PEPs, but estimates are sensitive to assumptions made eg on the level of take up. The effect on cost of varying the level of the cap will depend on the way in which people decide to invest the balance of their investments.

<a name="80209w10.html_spnew1"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 The draft legislation, which will implement this change, will be published today. Copies have been placed in the Libraries of the House. This will give agencies as much time as possible to alter their systems and procedures in advance of the change which comes into effect on 6 April 1998. The change will help to align the tax and national insurance treatment of these workers and is part of the Government's commitment to streamline and modernise the tax and benefits system.

 <i>[holding answer 29 January 1998]:</i> As set out in the answer given by the Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office, my hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Central (Mr. Lloyd) on 29 January 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>385</i>, our guidelines are that we generally expect British officials to co-operate with local judicial authorities. In this particular instance, no request has been made by the local courts. Under Article 44(3) of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, members of a consular post are not obliged to give evidence on matters encountered in the exercise of their functions. We have concluded that it would be inappropriate for the British Vice Consul (Information) to give evidence because of the need for him to retain the status of impartial observer in attending subsequent court cases in his consular capacity.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80209w10.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Fatchett: </B> 
 The failure of a computer system would not directly affect the safety of any nuclear reactor power plants in the former eastern bloc. The control of these plants is carried out by analogue or electro-mechanical means. However, computers are used for data recording and plant management purposes, and the European Union has a programme to up-grade a number of these. The Health and Safety Executive publication "Safety and the year 2000" has been sent to the senior nuclear regulators in the former eastern bloc and it will form the basis of discussion at a meeting of these regulators with their EU counterparts in June 1998.

[28204]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80209w10.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson: </B> 
 Video conferencing is being used extensively during the UK's Presidency of the European Union, particularly between London and Brussels.

 When I met the Cambodian Deputy Prime Minister on 21 January, our discussions covered the internal political situation, the forthcoming Cambodian elections, human rights and other issues. These talks were part of a continuing dialogue between the UK and Cambodia. The EU also takes a keen interest in events in Cambodia and is providing 9.5 mecu in election assistance, subject to political conditionality.

 <i>[holding answer 4 February 1998]:</i> I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="80209w12.html_para2">The Single Market Action Plan produced last year by the Commission sets out the key priorities to ensure an effective Single Market. All Member States have committed themselves to a timetable to catching up with delays in implementing Single Market law by the end of this year. As chairman of the Internal Market Council during the UK Presidency, the Minister for Trade and Competitions in Europe will be leading the efforts to achieve this timetable. There has also been close co-ordination with Austria to ensure that momentum is kept up in the second half of the year. However, there will still be a need for work to ensure the Single Market is working effectively and responsive to new markets: also that the rules are being properly enforced and are not over-complicated. There will also be a need for legislation for new technologies as they emerge. Progress in these areas will be a top priority for the UK Presidency.

 The number of voluntary notifications of babies born with congenital anomalies, by usual residence of mother, is shown in the following tables for the years 1977, 1987 and 1996, which is the latest year for which information is available. Data for 1996 are not comparable with the previous years as prior to 1990 all malformations were notifiable, but from 1990 onwards specified minor anomalies were excluded from notifications to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Additionally, prior to 1995 only those anomalies detected at or within ten days of birth were notified. Data for 1996 include anomalies detected after 10 days.

 Since 1 January 1979, some 62 NHS hospitals have been closed and remain closed to date according to records held by the Welsh Office. Over the same period 15 NHS hospitals have been opened. No NHS hospitals have been closed, or opened, since 1 May 1997.

 The system used to classify directly employed non-medical NHS staff changed from groups which were based on payscales to groups which are based on new occupation codes. The staff group previously described as 'ancillary staff' are now mostly in a group called 'support staff'. At 30 June 1997, there were approximately 5,800 whole-time equivalent support staff directly employed by the NHS in Wales.

 At January 1997, 50,392 children in maintained primary schools were in classes in which Welsh was the sole or main medium of instruction and a further 7,649 were in classes in which Welsh was used as a medium of teaching for part of the curriculum. 49 maintained secondary schools were "Welsh speaking" schools (as defined by the Education Act 1996) but not all pupils in these schools would have been taught through Welsh. Of the 28,831 pupils in Years 7 to 11 in these schools, 21,372 were taught the subject of Welsh as a first language. This may give an indication of the number studying other subjects through the medium of Welsh.

 Government planning policy on retailing and town centres is set out in "Planning Guidance (Wales) Planning Policy" published in May 1996. This includes a commitment to sustain and enhance town centres and established tests for new retail development which favour town centres sites. A revised version of "Planning Guidance (Wales) Planning Policy" is now being prepared following consultation and it is intended that this will emphasise the need to safeguard and promote town centre shopping.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland if she will carry out an assessment of the impact of her Department's current policies on the <i>(a)</i> income, <i>(b)</i> employment opportunities and <i>(c)</i> living standards, of the poorest 30 per cent. of the population.  [23344]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80209w14.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Paul Murphy: </B> 
 Government policies are continually evaluated using a variety of methods. We have a range of surveys and policy evaluation methodologies in place, some of which are targeted specifically at certain low income groups. In addition, various research studies on low income and deprivation have been commissioned from leading academics.
<P>

<a name="80209w14.html_para1">The best way of improving the living standards of most people at the bottom of the income distribution is to help them into work and we are implementing a range of policies under the New Deal to achieve this aim. Our objective is to raise the living standards of the many, not just the few, and to offer educational and employment opportunities for all.
<P>

<a name="80209w14.html_para2">We carry out a range of policies to stimulate growth in employment and to improve the opportunities for those seeking employment--including specific Action Plans for targeting measures on areas and people objectively defined as being in greatest need. The impact of these policies is regularly assessed by their degree of success in meeting specific objectives.
<P>

<a name="80209w14.html_para3">The Standing Advisory Commission on Human Right's Report on Employment Equality published in June 1997 makes over 160 recommendations, a number of which relate to employment opportunities and social deprivation. Consideration of all the recommendations is well advanced and the Government's response will be published in the coming months.

<P>
<a name="80209w14.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Worthington: </B> 
 I announced on 29 January that the subsidy paid towards the teaching costs of pupils attending preparatory departments of grammar schools would be reduced from 40% to 30% with effect from September 1998. This is expected to save around &#163;250,000 to help improve standards elsewhere in the education sector.
<P>

<a name="80209w14.html_para6">It is estimated that this change will mean on average an increase of about 8% on the existing level of parental contributions if a school decides to pass on to parents the full effect of the reduced subsidy.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80209w14.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Paul Murphy: </B> 
 The Ulster Democratic Party was declared by the two Governments on 26 January to be no longer entitled to participate in the talks process, in view of the activities of a paramilitary organisation with which it is associated. Its members do not now have access to Castle Buildings. We have involved our legal advisers as necessary in considering the position of the party.

<P>

<a name="80209w15.html_para1">
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your three recent parliamentary questions about private supply pipes. You asked if there are plans to amend the Water and Sewerage Services (Northern Ireland) Order 1973 ("the 1973 Order") to empower the Water Service to enter third party land for the purposes of laying a private supply pipe and if the Department's officials will meet the Ulster Farmers Union to discuss the ability of the Water Service to lay private water supply pipes across a third party's land without the third party's consent. You also asked me how many occasions in the last two years a landowner has notified the Department that he is unable to obtain water due to the refusal of a third party to allow the Water Service to enter for the purposes of laying a private supply pipe.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>While the Department has a duty under the 1973 Order to supply and distribute water, its powers of entry to private land are limited to the laying of watermains, which are vested in the Department and are for the purpose of giving a general supply of water. This is district from private supply pipes which belong to the owner of the land in which they are laid and which supply individual consumers or which, by agreement, cross a third party's land to supply an individual consumer. The Department's position reflects that under which the water supply undertakers in the rest of the United Kingdom operate.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>It is, therefore, the responsibility of individuals seeking a water supply from the Department's watermains to arrange for the laying of any necessary length of private supply pipe to the watermain. This includes making any access arrangements with the owners of any private lands which may need to be crossed in order to make a connection to a watermain. The Department's current powers are sufficient to enable it to exercise its functions under the 1973 Order and it would not be appropriate for it to seek a power to enter private land to carry out work solely on behalf of a private individual. There are, therefore, no plans to seek an amendment to the 1973 Order.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>As regards a meeting with the Ulster Farmers Union, the Water Service's Director of Operations would be happy to meet the Union to discuss any difficulties its members may have because they are unable to lay a private supply pipe across third party land. Perhaps the Union would contact my office to make the arrangements.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>It is an important consideration that we must be mindful of the rights and interests of those farmers whose lands may be traversed by any proposed private supply pipes. They are affected in significant degree as well as those individuals seeking the laying of such a connection across third party lands to a watermain.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Water Service does not maintain records of representations made to it by individuals who have been denied access to third party lands to lay private supply pipes. As I have explained, the Water Service would not seek entry to third party lands to lay private supply pipes as this is a matter for all the private property holders involved to resolve by negotiation and agreement. I am, however, aware of difficulty being experienced by one of your constituents in laying a service pipe across third party land and I wrote to you about this on 15 August and 22 September 1997.</FONT></UL>

 As my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State informed the House on 15 December 1997, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 100-04, I intend to issue a consultation paper before the start of the Committee Stage of the Police (Northern Ireland) Bill, outlining some options for changes to strengthen the Police Authority, and the Community Police Liaison Committees so developing further the partnership between the police and the community, which is essential to combating crime of all kinds. Copies of that paper, "Your Voice--Your Choice", which is published today, have now been placed in the Library of the House. I have no set views on which, if any, of these options should be implemented, and I am keen to hear views on these important issues. Decisions must await the outcome of the consultation process; and developments in the talks.

 On average it takes 13 days for my Department to answer letters from hon. Members.
<P>

<a name="80209w17.html_para3">The Cabinet Office (Office of Public Service) sets a target of fifteen working days from receipt to reply to all letters.
<P>

<a name="80209w17.html_para4">From 1 May to 31 December 1997, 90 per cent. of letters from MPs received a full reply within the target date. A further 7 per cent. received interim holding replies within the target date.
<P>

<a name="80209w17.html_para5">Once letters have been signed, they are dispatched without delay for delivery to the Palace of Westminster (or, when requested, the Member's constituency office). It is usual for letters to be delivered to the House within one working day of being signed by the appropriate Minister, and in many cases they will arrive on the same day.

 Since the end of the Cold War, the defence industries of the USA and Western Europe have seen major changes in structure and organisation. These changes have proceeded further and faster in the USA, and a similar process needs to take place urgently within Europe. This was reflected in the 9 December trilateral statement on restructuring which calls on industry to submit clear plans and a detailed timetable for restructuring and integration by 31 March 1998. In preparation for this, discussions are continuing between European companies, and between industry and Government officials.

In December 1997, the UK, France and Germany signed a Memorandum of Understanding envisaging a collaborative programme, TRIMILSATCOM, for the procurement of a common solution for all three nations' operational requirements. Proposals from industry for a Project Definition phase have been invited and are due to be submitted shortly. Currently, TRIMILSATCOM is the preferred approach for meeting the UK's SKYNET 5 requirement, although a national programme remains an option. It is expected that a decision on the way ahead will be taken later this year.

<P>
<a name="80209w20.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Spellar </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 3 February 1998]:</i> The risks of disease, including cancer, as a result of exposure to ionising radiation are well documented. Risk estimates for the UK population are published by the National Radiological Protection Board whose evidence is used to formulate national legislation. The exposure of MOD radiation workers at both Rosyth and Faslane has always been monitored and controlled in accordance with this legislation, the purpose of which is to limit the risk to workers to tolerable levels. As required by legislation, my Department's policy is to reduce risks to the lowest reasonably practicable level.




<P>
<P><I>9 Feb 1998 : Column: 71</I><P>

<P>

<a name="80209w20.html_para0">My Department's policy on compensation for radiation workers is to be a member of the nuclear industry's Compensation Scheme for Radiation Linked Diseases. This is a no fault scheme where there is no requirement for claimants to prove negligence on the part of the Department in order to receive compensation. The Scheme was set up and is run jointly by the participating employers and Trade Unions and does not affect the claimant's right to seek legal redress. It provides for the assessment of a case, on an agreed technical basis, in order to determine the probability that a cancer contracted by a radiation worker could have been caused by occupational radiation exposure. The amount of compensation payable in a successful case is determined by negotiation between the solicitors representing the parties, using as a basis the same guidelines as would apply if the case had proceeded to Court. However, the Scheme provides for payments to be made at lower levels of causation probability than would be allowed by the Courts. It does this by making a "full" payment at 50 per cent. causation probability similar to the Courts, and in addition making lesser payments down to a 20 per cent. causation probability. In this way the assessment of a case recognises that even below the balance of probability there is a chance that occupational exposure to ionising radiation played a role in causing the disease.
<P>

<a name="80209w20.html_para1">Within my Department, medical checks are undertaken at the discretion of the Appointed Doctor when considered necessary as part of the annual health review of classified radiation workers.

 From my regular visits to Service units and those of my Ministerial colleagues, and discussions within the Ministry of Defence, I assess morale in the Armed Forces at present to be satisfactory. I greatly admire the achievements and sense of purpose of our Servicemen and women. In my experience, they are keen to get on with their jobs, are aware that they are highly valued by the nation and are committed to the operational challenges they face. There are undoubtedly some feelings of uncertainty, and problems in some areas caused, in large part, by longstanding overstretch and undermanning inherited by this administration. One of the main aims of the Strategic Defence Review is to balance our operational commitments and the needs of Service personnel and their families. The openness of the review process will have reassured our forces that it is different from other reviews.

 The Benefit Integrity Project helps ensure the correctness of awards of Disability Living Allowance (DLA). Up-to-date information is being gathered from beneficiaries about their care and mobility needs, so that we can check that they are receiving the correct amount of DLA.
<P>

<a name="80209w21.html_para1">It is important that decisions about benefit entitlement are made fairly and are seen to be fair. I am taking action to improve the quality of decisions made by the Project which involve a reduction or removal of benefit. In future, no decision resulting in reduction or removal of entitlement to DLA will be made solely on the evidence provided by the claimant--there will always be additional evidence to support the decision.
<P>

<a name="80209w21.html_para2">We have been liaising closely with organisations of and for disabled people from the early stages of the Project. This new initiative underlines our determination to act properly to get the benefit right and to listen and act upon any concerns. We will continue to involve these groups in the evaluation of the Project as it develops.
<P>

<a name="80209w21.html_para3">This Project is operating under the normal assessment and adjudication rules that are applied to all DLA cases. Anyone dissatisfied with a decision made in their case may ask for a review of that decision, on any grounds, within three months of the decision having been made. If they remain unhappy following review, they have the opportunity to appeal to an independent tribunal within three months of the review decision being made. Of course, a claimant may ask for a review of their entitlement at any time if they believe that there has been a change in their circumstances that may affect their entitlement to DLA.

 <i>[holding answer 4 February 1998]:</i> The Government view is that poverty is no excuse for failure. It is for individual schools, in discussion with their LEAs, to set appropriately challenging achievement targets, which reflect national targets such as those for literacy and numeracy. All schools, regardless of the socio-economic characteristics of their pupils, are capable of improvement.

Capital and related expenditure has been excluded from GSB figures to ensure consistency with the education budget figures, which represent revenue expenditure only.

 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="80209w23.html_para7">The Government intend that all relevant dossiers being negotiated in the Social Affairs and Education Councils of Ministers during the UK Presidency should reinforce progress towards its objectives of employability, flexible and adaptable labour markets, fair minimum standards and job generation.
<P>

<a name="80209w23.html_para8">In the field of health and safety, proposals for a Chemical Agents Directive, a Carcinogens Worker Protection Directive, a Scaffolding Directive and proposals to amend the Asbestos Worker Protection Directive either are or will be subject to proper assessment to ensure that they are well targeted or scientifically justified. While they are not considered to have a major impact upon current practice in the UK, they should have the effect of raising standards elsewhere and in particular help to reduce the toll of 6,000 fatal accidents and thousands of cases of fatal disease each year in the EU.
<P>

<a name="80209w23.html_para9">The directive on part-time work, which is likely to be extended to the UK during our Presidency, will require employers to treat part-time workers no less favourably than equivalent full-time workers. By promoting part-time work and raising its status, the directive should increase flexibility in European labour markets. The Government are also consulting publicly about whether to seek amendments to the Acquired Rights Directive to make it more flexible, e.g. by allowing derogations agreed by the social partners in certain circumstances.
<P>

<a name="80209w23.html_para10">The proposal for a Supplementary Pensions Directive, the co-ordination of social security regulations for migrant workers who are EU citizens and the proposal to extend those regulations to all insured persons would neither impose nor remove restrictions on the labour market but may allow more labour market mobility within the EU, which is a positive step forward.
<P>

<a name="80209w23.html_para11">The Burden of Proof Directive would make very little difference to the way in which sex discrimination cases are <i>in practice</i> decided in the UK, or to the outcome of industrial tribunal cases.

 <i>[holding answer 2 February 1998]:</i> I refer the hon. Member to my previous answer on 5 February 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>787</i>. British Nuclear Fuels plc have, since 1990, imported 1,700 tonnes of spent nuclear fuel of reprocessing. The fuel is stored in ponds at the Sellafield site on receipt. The majority of the fuel imported since 1990 will be reprocessed during the coming years. Reprocessing involves using a number of chemical processes to separate the reusable uranium (96%) and plutonium (1%) from the 3% waste products contained in spent fuel. Reprocessing separates out the constituent parts of spent fuel, and material for export is not regarded as reprocessed spent nuclear fuel.
<P>

<a name="80209w24.html_para2">The UKAE have, since 1990, imported almost 4 tonnes of spent nuclear fuel for reprocessing. The nuclear material which will be separated as a result of reprocessing of this fuel (namely uranium and plutonium) may be returned to the country of origin. The total amount of nuclear material exported since 1990 is 1 tonne and countries of destination include Germany, Netherlands and France.
<P>

<a name="80209w24.html_para3">Since 1976, all new contracts for reprocessing of overseas spent fuel have contained option for the return of wastes. The Government intend that such options should be exercised and that such wastes should be returned to the countries of origin.

To ask the President of the Board of Trade what attempts are made by Her Majesty's Government to assess the adequacy of disposal facilities and plans for radioactive waste management in countries using United Kingdom reprocessing facilities in advance of approving applications for the import of spent nuclear fuel for reprocessing under contracts which include a return-to-sender commitment covering radioactive waste arising from reprocessing.  [27989]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80209w24.html_spnew15"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 It has been the practice of successive Governments to obtain, before a contract for the reprocessing of foreign spent nuclear fuel is signed, assurances from the relevant government that it will take no legislative or regulatory steps to prevent the return of arising wastes under the contract. The adequacy of the facilities for managing those wastes is a matter for their owners and the regulatory authorities of the country concerned in accordance with the relevant legislation of that country.

 <i>[holding answer 30 January 1998]:</i> The Council's Common Position on the proposed Directive on the legal protection of designs as agreed last year already includes a provision allowing Member States to provide for competition in the supply of motorcycle parts. The Common Position gives Member States the option of maintaining in force or introducing any provision to allow anyone to copy the design of a part of, for example, a motorcycle, when that design is dependent on the appearance of the motorcycle and the copy part is used to restore the motorcycle's original appearance. This proposed Directive is to be the subject of conciliation which is likely to start during the United Kingdom's current Presidency.

 Licences to export strategic goods are issued by the President of the Board of Trade and the Export Control Organisation of the Department of Trade and Industry is the Licensing authority. Relevant individual licence applications are circulated by the DTI to other government departments with an interest, as determined by them in line with their policy responsibilities. These include the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the Ministry of Defence and the Department for International Development.

Friend the Foreign Secretary made clear that the criteria would not be applied mechanistically and that individual applications would be considered case by case. In the months following the announcement, this led to an increase in the time taken to assess some applications. The Government appreciate the inconvenience and uncertainty that results from any delay in the processing of individual applications and my department together with the other departments involved, is continuing to work to reduce processing timescales generally.

<a name="80209w27.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Nigel Griffiths: </B> 
 Nomura International and Texas Utilities have separately announced publicly that each is in talks with The Energy Group which may lead to a bid for the Energy Group. Should either company make a bid, it will be necessary to establish which competition authorities have jurisdiction. If and to the extent that any bid falls to be considered under the Fair Trading Act 1973, my right hon. Friend the President of the Board of Trade will decide, in the light of the advice of the Director General of Fair Trading and the views of the Director General of Electricity Supply, whether or not to refer the bid to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission (MMC) for investigation. She has said that her general policy continues to be to refer mergers primarily on competition grounds, but that where, as part of a wider public interest scrutiny, important regulatory issues are raised, she may decide that a reference is warranted. Each case is considered on its merits.
