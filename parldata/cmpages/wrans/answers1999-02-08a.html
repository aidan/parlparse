To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will list <i>(a)</i> the road schemes which are proceeding following the outcome of the national Roads Review and <i>(b)</i> those roads which are to be considered by regional planning conferences which could have an effect on areas of outstanding natural beauty or National Parks, detailing for each the designation affected.

<a name="90208w01.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 26 January 1999]:</i> Environmental concerns were a major consideration of the assessment of schemes during the Roads Review. The Road Programme inherited from the previous Government contained 21 schemes which would affect National Parks or Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The following lists show the schemes which are to proceed as part of the Targeted Programme of Improvements following the national Roads Review which will impact on specific National Parks or Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty.

<a name="90208w01.html_para5">In addition, a number of schemes are to considered by Regional Planning Conferences in the context of the programme of wider multi-modal studies announced recently. These studies cover in some cases very wide areas of the country. Solutions to these studies will by no means necessarily be road based and will rarely be solely road schemes. We therefore cannot list AONBs or National Parks within these areas in the same definitive way as for identified road proposals. Environmental impact is an important consideration in our new approach to appraisals and its assessment will be integral to the

<P>
<P>
<a name="90208w01.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 Significant developments are taking place in Europe on the promotion of environmentally friendly vehicles by European vehicle producers. A number of directives were agreed in 1998, setting future emission standards for cars, vans and vehicles with heavy-duty diesel engines. Last year a voluntary agreement was concluded between the EC and European motor manufacturers, to reduce by 25 per cent. the CO <sub>2</sub>  emissions from new cars by 2008. When the UK's Cleaner Vehicles Task Force publishes its first report in the coming months, we will wish to discuss its contents with colleagues in Europe.
<P>

<a name="90208w01.html_para9">I and my Ministerial colleagues keep in close contact with our European counterparts on these matters. During January my right hon.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (1) what discussions he has had with the German Government on the United Kingdom's rules relating to the import and export of spent nuclear fuel; and if he will make a statement;  [69157]
<P>
<UL>(2) if he will make a statement on his policy relating to the import and export of spent nuclear fuel; and if he will make a statement;  [69156]
<P>
(3) if imports of spent nuclear fuel from Germany primarily to alleviate the shortage of on-site waste storage capacity at German nuclear facilities contravene Government policy; and if he will seek advice on this matter from the Radioactive Waste Management Advisory Committee.  [69159]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90208w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Meale: </B> 
 The Government's policy is that spent nuclear fuel may be imported into the UK provided that the prime purpose is the recovery of reusable material.
<P>

<a name="90208w01.html_para10">BNFL provides nuclear fuel reprocessing services on a fully commercial basis. Since 1976 all reprocessing contracts have contained the option for the return of waste arising from reprocessing to the customer country. The Government have made it clear that this option should be exercised, and all wastes returned.
<P>

<a name="90208w01.html_para11">It has also been made clear to the German Government that the UK would not be willing to offer long-term storage in the UK for spent nuclear fuel that will not be 



<P>
<P><I>8 Feb 1999 : Column: 4</I><P>
reprocessed. It follows that, should existing reprocessing contracts be cancelled at any time, German material held in the UK at that time would have to be returned.

<P>

(5) how many breaches of his departmental regulations covering the issue of temporary airside passes at British airports were confirmed during <i>(a)</i> 1997 and <i>(b)</i> 1998.  [69058]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90208w02.html_spnew0"><B> Dr. Reid: </B> 
 References are required only for the issue of a permanent pass. Temporary passes are issued on the basis of proof of identity, but such passholders must be escorted at all times. They are normally issued for up to three days, although a limited number of "special" passes are issued for temporary access up to 31 days when this is justified. Temporary pass holders are required to undergo the same screening process as all permanent staff and passengers before entry to the Restricted Zone of an airport. There are no Departmental Regulations restricting 



<P>
<P><I>8 Feb 1999 : Column: 5</I><P>
holders of temporary airside passes from taking cameras and mobile telephones airside. However, all items taken airside are searched and particular attention is given to electrical and electronic equipment, such as cameras and mobile telephones.
<P>

<a name="90208w02.html_para0">There have been no breaches of the Department's Regulations on the issuing of airside passes at British airports in 1997 or 1998.
<P>

<a name="90208w02.html_para1">Following an article in a newspaper on 20 January, Ministers ordered an immediate inquiry into how a journalist had obtained a temporary pass to Heathrow airport by posing as a cleaner; also that an urgent reappraisal of the regulations governing the issue of passes at UK airports be carried out.
<P>

<a name="90208w02.html_para2">At the same time, all the temporary passes issued to the company concerned were withdrawn, with no new ones to be issued until the Department's inspectors were satisfied that the necessary procedures were being carried out. These actions are currently being pursued, but it is too early to comment further.

 The trade in endangered species is regulated by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), which is implemented within the European Union by Council Regulation (EC) No. 338/97. Commercial trade in wild taken specimens of species listed in Annex A of the Regulation is strictly prohibited, although exceptions may be made for research, breeding or educational purposes. The sale of these species is also controlled, including captive bred specimens.

 The disposal of property assets owned by Railtrack is a commercial matter for the company. However, its powers of disposal are limited. Closure of railway lines (as well as passenger services, stations and light maintenance depots) which have been used in connection with railway passenger services at any time within the last five years are subject to consideration by the Franchising Director, the Rail Regulator and the Secretary of State, and wide consultation.

 Having considered the responses to a consultation exercise on options for national action on bull bars, we are currently in the process of identifying how best to take matters forward. As we have always made clear, any action on aggressive bull bars must deal effectively with the complexities involved. It is also clearly sensible for us to take the opportunity to consider bull bars in the context of the wider issue of making all new cars more pedestrian friendly.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90208w03.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 For young people to be without a suitable home can blight their lives and future development and lead to the social exclusion that this Government are determined to tackle. The problems of youth homelessness go beyond the simple provision of accommodation; many other factors are involved and all sectors, statutory, voluntary and business have a contribution to make.
<P>

<a name="90208w03.html_para0">That is why we have established the Youth Homelessness Action Partnership to bring together senior representatives of central governmental, local government and the voluntary sector. The Partnership is currently working on producing an agreed definition of youth homelessness and estimating the numbers involved. It will also identify what works in tackling and preventing youth homelessness, including the role of local strategies, and disseminate good practice to all the key players. The Partnership will also contribute towards the evaluation of the impact of Government policies on youth homelessness. The work of the Partnership will be underpinned by research to be commissioned later this year.
<P>

<a name="90208w03.html_para1">We have refocused our DETR section 180 grant programme, which provides grants to voluntary sector organisations concerned with homelessness, to give priority to projects that prevent and tackle youth homelessness. &#163;8.1 million is available in 1998/99 and over 200 projects around England are benefiting from these grants.
<P>

<a name="90208w03.html_para2">The Government are committed to reducing the most extreme example of homelessness--rough sleeping--to as near to zero as possible in our towns and cities. The Prime Minister asked the Social Exclusion Unit to address the issue of rough sleeping as one of its first priorities. Their report sets a tough initial target of reducing the number of people sleeping rough throughout England, to a third of its current level by 2002.
<P>

<a name="90208w03.html_para3">A new Ministerial Committee, chaired by my hon. Friend the Minister for Local Government and Housing, has been established to ensure effective co-ordination of Government policy in preventing and tackling rough sleeping. The DETR will be responsible for co-ordination of the overall strategy for England on rough sleeping; including housing, health access to employment and training and benefits.
<P>

<a name="90208w03.html_para4">We will establish a new body for London which will be responsible for reducing the numbers of people sleeping rough in the Capital. The new body will have an

<P><I>8 Feb 1999 : Column: 10</I><P>
integrated budget of &#163;143 million over the three years until 2002 to combat rough sleeping and the causes of rough sleeping.
<P>

<a name="90208w03.html_para5">Outside London, the SEU confirmed that local authorities are in the best position to take the lead on tackling rough sleeping and single, including youth, homelessness. To support local authorities in achieving the target reduction in rough sleeping in their area we have launched a new Homelessness Action Programme which will provide &#163;34 million over the next three years to help voluntary organisations outside London to tackle and prevent rough sleeping. We announced details of over 250 voluntary sector projects which will benefit from this programme on 5 February.
<P>

<a name="90208w03.html_para6">We have also strengthened the safety net for families and vulnerable individuals who are homeless unintentionally. The revised Code of Guidance on Allocations and Homelessness which will be issued later this year will provide more advice to help local housing authorities develop effective strategies to assist single homeless people including young people.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what powers are available to local authorities to require owners of listed buildings to maintain them; how he monitors the performance of local authorities in discharging their duties in respect of listed buildings; and what powers he has in respect of listed buildings which a local authority fails to protect.

<P>
<P>

 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="90208w04.html_para0">Owners of listed buildings are under no specific duty to maintain their properties, though it will normally be in their interest to do so. However, local authorities have statutory powers to take action where a building has deteriorated to the extent that its preservation may be at risk. An authority can serve a repairs notice on the owner of a listed building specifying works it considers necessary for the building's preservation. If no action is taken in response to the notice, the authority can begin compulsory purchase proceedings. In the case of an unoccupied listed building, an authority can--having served notice on the owner--carry out works it considers urgently necessary for the building's preservation and recover its costs.
<P>

<a name="90208w04.html_para1">My right hon. Friend has powers which are broadly similar to those of local authorities and which he can exercise where he considers that an authority has itself failed to take action. However, his policy is to treat them as reserve powers for use only in exceptional circumstances.
<P>

<a name="90208w04.html_para2">My Department does not specifically monitor the performance of individual local authorities, but we would normally expect to look into cases where important buildings are reported to be at risk. Planning Policy Guidance Note 15: Planning and the Historic Environment urges all authorities to maintain and strengthen their commitment to stewardship of the historic environment, to reflect that commitment in their allocation of resources and to consider the use of their statutory powers wherever appropriate.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if HQ 101 Battalion REME was listed for closure in the first round of recommendations for the future of the Territorial Army proposed by HQ Land Command.  [69346]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90208w04.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson: </B> 
 I refer my hon. Friend to the answer I gave him on 17 December 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>657</i>.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90208w04.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Hoyle: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how many REME regulars were recruited in the North West; how many REME recruits came from North Wales during each of the last five years; and how many of these were recruited via the cadets.  [69329]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90208w04.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson: </B> 
 The information shown in the table reflects the numbers of REME soldiers recruited through Army and Armed Forces Careers Offices in the areas shown. It does not necessarily reflect individuals' areas of origin. The numbers shown as Ex-Cadet reflect those who are known to be former cadets and are included in the main total.

<a name="90208w04.html_wqn10"><B> Mr. Hoyle: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will estimate the cost to his Department of empty houses vacated by <i>(a)</i> officers and <i>(b)</i> other ranks moving from Chorley 101 REME to Queensferry.  [69332]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90208w04.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson: </B> 
 Vacancies created by the departure of families moving with 101 Bn REME from the Preston area to North Wales are expected to be filled by families attached to other Army units in the Preston area. While there may, therefore, be some short term vacancies associated with this changeover, no costs in terms of long term voids are anticipated at this time.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90208w04.html_wqn11"><B> Mr. Hoyle: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence on what date TAVRA North West was consulted about the decision to transfer HQ 101 Battalion REME to Queensferry.  [69317]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90208w04.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson: </B> 
 The North West Territorial and Auxiliary Volunteer Reserve Association were consulted on this proposal on 12 October, at a meeting held at Headquarters Land.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will make a statement on <i>(a)</i> the Territorial Army's and <i>(b)</i> the cadets' role in recruiting regulars for the army; and if he will list the recruitment figures for regulars by region in each of the last three years.  [69327]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90208w05.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson: </B> 
 Neither the Territorial Army nor the cadet forces have a specific role in recruiting to the regular Army. However, a number of members of both organisations go on to join the regular Army. The numbers of recruits to the regular Army, by region, in each of the last three years are as follows.

 <i>[holding answer 4 February 1999]:</i> The ECOFIN Council agreed at the meeting held on 1 December 1998 to mandate officials to continue work on a framework of energy taxation based on the draft Energy Products Directive. The meeting held on 26 January was a technical working group discussion on the draft Directive. Member States were not asked to say whether they were in favour or against ecological tax reform. The working group is expected to report back to ECOFIN in due course.
<P>

<a name="90208w08.html_para0">The Government's position on the Energy Products Directive is that we favour some aspects of the proposal, such as higher minimum rates of tax on road fuels. 



<P>
<P><I>8 Feb 1999 : Column: 29</I><P>
However, we could not accept, for social policy reasons, any obligation to impose new taxes on domestic fuel and power. Our attitude to new taxes on business use of energy will depend on the decisions we take in the light of Lord Marshall's report on 'Economic Instruments and the Business Use of Energy' which was published on 3 November 1998.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90208w08.html_spnew7"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 The European Court of Justice ruled (C172/96) on 14 July 1998 that foreign exchange (forex) transactions are supplies for VAT purposes. This ruling will effect the extent to which financial institutions will be able to recover VAT on purchases relating to these transactions. In some cases, it will reduce the amount of VAT recoverable, but for those UK financial institutions with a wide range of non-EU, international customers it should increase the amount of recoverable tax. This is because these institutions will now be able to recover the VAT on forex transactions supplied to persons outside the EU where they were not previously able to do so. Some of these same institutions may also benefit if they apply the ruling to forex transactions which were made before 14 July 1998. The ECJ ruling will have no significant effect on the costs of HM Customs and Excise.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer, pursuant to the oral answer to the hon.

[66592]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90208w08.html_spnew9"><B> Mrs. Roche </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 19 January 1999]:</i> I warmly endorse the answers given by my right hon. Friend the Minister for Employment, Welfare to Work and Equal Opportunities to the hon. Member for Buckingham (Mr. Bercow) on the New Deal for Young People on 14 January 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 431-31. Expenditure on the New Deal is, as he said, money well spent. Early evidence suggests that the New Deal has speeded up the rate of exit from unemployment and the rate of entry into jobs amongst 18-24 year olds.




<P>
<P><I>8 Feb 1999 : Column: 31</I><P>

<P>

<a name="90208w08.html_para1">The Government's estimate of the average cost of jobs secured so far through the New Deal does not rely on assumptions in respect of savings in benefits and increased tax revenue. However, it does take general account of these factors when assessing the effectiveness of employment or other analogous programmes. As the New Deal increases sustainable employment and reduces structural unemployment, revenue would be gained and benefit outlay reduced as a result. This would contribute to the Government's Welfare to Work agenda, reducing dependency, maximising self-determination and contributing to the development of communities.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90208w09.html_spmin0"><B>The Prime Minister:</B> 
 The Government are committed to working with the Commission and other Member States to ensure that EC legislation does not impose unwarranted burdens on business.
<P>

<a name="90208w09.html_para19">We are actively engaged in the SLIM initiative (Simpler Legislation for the Internal Market) which revisits specific EC rules to find ways of making them more effective and less burdensome on individuals and business. Under our Presidency of the EU, we secured agreement to reviews of EC legislation covering electromagnetic compatibility, insurance and social security. We are now participating in further reviews of dangerous substances, pre-packaging and company law legislation.
<P>

<a name="90208w09.html_para20">The Government are also working to ensure that the impact of new EC legislation is properly assessed. For example, our Presidency of the EU saw the launch of a pilot European Business Test Panel, which consults business on specific proposals at an early stage in the legislative process. We are also seeking early implementation of the Business Environment Simplification Taskforce recommendations to reduce the administrative burdens on small firms. And the commission has now made a commitment to improve its business impact assessment system, known as the fiche d'impact.

Friends the Minister with responsibility for housing, transport and European affairs for Scotland, the Minister with responsibility for the environment and agriculture for Northern Ireland and the Minister responsible for housing in Wales. The problems of rough sleeping are particularly intense in London, where there is borough and district fragmentation and a large number of rough sleepers. We are creating a new single unit for the capital with a unified budget for tackling these issues including housing, health, employment and resettlement to link the work of central Government departments and agencies, local authority services, the voluntary sector and business, as recommended by the Social Exclusion Unit. My hon. Friend the Minister for Local Government and Housing expects to announce the appointment of the new head of the London Unit shortly.

<a name="90208w10.html_wqn3"><B> Kali Mountford: </B> 
To ask the Prime Minister when he intends to publish the Government's National Strategy for Carers.  [69764]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90208w10.html_spmin3"><B>The Prime Minister:</B> 
 The Government's National Strategy for Carers, "Caring about Carers", is being published today. It describes what we have done so far to support people who provide care for their relatives or friends who are sick, disabled, vulnerable or frail. The Government intend to ensure that all of our policies take account of the needs of carers the majority of who are women. We are also introducing some major new initiatives.
<P>

<a name="90208w10.html_para0">I announced plans for a National Strategy for Carers, which I asked my hon. Friend the Member for Brent, South (Mr. Boateng), now the Minister of State, Home Office to lead, on 10 June 1998.
<P>

<a name="90208w10.html_para1">The report of the National Strategy for Carers is the result of a consultative process, involving a large number of Government departments, carers' organisations, representatives of the National Health Service and of local authorities, other voluntary organisations which help to support carers and the people for whom they care, and a number of individual carers.
<P>

<a name="90208w10.html_para2">Two-thirds of carers of working age are in paid employment, and the Government's family-friendly employment strategy will help them to combine paid work with their caring responsibilities. We propose to give carers, like all employees, the right to time off to deal with a family emergency. For those carers who cannot combine paid work with caring, perhaps because they need to care for a large part of each day, our policies are focused on proper support whilst caring and on enabling them to return to work when their caring responsibilities cease.
<P>

<a name="90208w10.html_para3">The National Health Service and local authorities need to provide carers with information about services and to involve them in the planning of those services, so that carers' main needs are met better than they have been in the past. The Government's National Priorities Guidance 



<P>
<P><I>8 Feb 1999 : Column: 37</I><P>
to health and local authorities will require those authorities to help carers to maintain their physical health and emotional wellbeing.
<P>

<a name="90208w10.html_para4">We have already announced an extra &#163;750 million over the next three years to promote independence through prevention of illness and disease and through rehabilitation. Carers and the people they care for will benefit from this.
<P>

<a name="90208w10.html_para5">In addition, we are providing funding from within the Comprehensive Spending Review Plans, totalling &#163;140 million over the next three years in England, to local authorities to enhance the provision of services which allow carers to take a break from their caring responsibilities. The new ring fenced special grant will total &#163;20 million in 1999-2000, &#163;50 million in 2000-01, and &#163;70 million in 2001-02.
<P>

<a name="90208w10.html_para6">The Government also intend, when Parliamentary time allows, to introduce new legislation to extend local authorities' powers to address carers' needs directly, which is frequently not possible at present.
<P>

<a name="90208w10.html_para7">The Government wish to ensure that all carers have access to a support service in the area in which they live. Health and local authorities, acting together, will be asked to involve carers and their organisations in drawing up jointly agreed plans (for inclusion in their Joint Investment Plans) for provision for carers in their areas, including for carers' support services.
<P>

<a name="90208w10.html_para8">We intend to trial a new question on carers for the 2001 Census. This should provide better information about the distribution of carers between local authority areas and on the numbers of young carers and those from minority ethnic groups.
<P>

<a name="90208w10.html_para9">The Government are also announcing today that the scheme for reductions in council tax for disabled people will be changed from 1 April 2000, so that those who live in accommodation which is valued at band A and which has an extra room which they need because of their disability, or enough floor space to allow wheelchair circulation, should receive a reduction in council tax similar to that currently given for the other bands.
<P>

<a name="90208w10.html_para10">The National Carers' Strategy also contains the Government's proposals to support young carers, including the provision of help for them in schools.
<P>

<a name="90208w10.html_para11">It is the Government's intention to continue work to support carers and to monitor implementation of these new initiatives.

<P>
<a name="90208w10.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. McFall: </B> 
 Information on autistic children in Northern Ireland is not held centrally. However, the Education and Training Inspectorate estimate that some 265 children with autistic spectrum disorder are currently enrolled at those special schools which cater for children with severe learning difficulties. The training provided for the teaching staff in these schools includes training to assist them in teaching children with autism. Education and Library Boards may arrange for particular levels of teaching support to be provided for individual children in accordance with their special educational needs and I have no plans to specify the minimum provision to be made for children with autism at this time.

 There are two power stations currently fitted with FGD abatement: Drax, owned by National Power plc with current registered capacity of 3,945 MW, and Ratcliffe, owned by PowerGen plc with a current registered capacity of 2034 MW.




<P>
<P><I>8 Feb 1999 : Column: 48</I><P>

In the February 1995 prospectus for the sale of the Government's remaining shares in the two companies, National Power estimated the capital cost of installing FGD at Drax at about &#163;650 million and PowerGen estimated the capital cost of installing FGD at Ratcliffe at about &#163;250 million. These estimates were made at the time the FGD plant was being installed.
<P>

<a name="90208w13.html_para0">In recent years, the cost of FGD plant has fallen. On 27 January 1999, Eastern Generation Ltd. applied for consent under Section 36 of the Electricity Act 1989 to retrofit FGD abatement to its 2012 MW plant at West Burton.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90208w13.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Ian McCartney: </B> 
 The responsibility for making a statutory redundancy payment lies in the first instance with the redundant employee's former employer. It passes to the National Insurance Fund, however, in cases where the former employer is insolvent or otherwise unable to meet it, for example by reason of severe financial difficulty. We keep this aspect of the employment rights legislation under review, but have no plans to change it at present. The Department's Redundancy Payments Service processes applications for payment, working to performance targets published in its Service Charter and reviewed annually.

 Negotiations on the Multilateral Agreement on Investment (MAI) are no longer taking place. The Government are now pursuing a long-held objective, shared by their EU partners, of placing the international investment issue on the agenda of the World Trade Organisation. However, any investment negotiation in the WTO would be a new negotiation, based on a new set of objectives to be established by consensus. The Government will continue to work within the WTO to achieve the maximum degree of openness on this and on other issues, and will keep the British public fully informed of their own actions.

The agreement announced in the High Court in Manchester on 22 January means an end to uncertainty for the some 31,000 ex-miners who have made claims to date. They can now look forward to receiving fair compensation which will be based upon a claimant's British Coal working history, age and the medical assessment of the level of damage caused by the use of vibrating tools.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90208w13.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 A precise figure for the number of man-days expended by Euratom inspectors at Dounreay is not available because such information is not recorded routinely by the Safeguards Office. However, Euratom safeguards inspector presence at the site is essentially continual.

<a name="90208w13.html_para3">There are currently eight material balance areas at Dounreay. The particular safeguards provisions for the site are contained in a single document. In the early 1980s, the Prototype Fast Reactor (PFR) fuel cycle at Dounreay was designated for inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) under the terms of the UK/ Euratom/IAEA safeguards agreement, at which time three facility attachments were agreed.

 Civilian support staff in each police force are under the direction and control of the chief constable, who is responsible for the functions they perform. Guidance issued to chief constables in Police Circular No. 9/1996 distinguishes between tasks which do not require police powers and should normally be done only by support staff, and tasks which can be done mainly by support staff but require some contribution from police officers. I have arranged for a copy of this Circular to be placed in the Library of the House.

 All prisons face the risk of prisoners visitors seeking to bring illegal drugs into establishments, and take a variety of measures to prevent it. Appropriate action is taken where there are reasonable grounds for suspicion, and any visitor who is caught is referred to the police. Records are not, however, maintained by the Scottish Prison Service of the number of arrests which arise from such action.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90208w16.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Russell Brown: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland what progress has been made with the Government's National Strategy for Carers.  [70302]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90208w16.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Dewar: </B> 
 The Government's National Strategy for Carers is being published today. It describes what the Government have done so far to support carers and how we can improve the quality of life for the many carers in our society by ensuring that the needs are identified and met. It focuses on how carers can be informed, involved and empowered, and how employers can help carers combine paid work with their caring responsibilities. It sets out what carers should be entitled to expect from service providers and how they can be helped by services in the neighbourhood in which they live. The strategy details proposals to support young carers.
<P>

<a name="90208w16.html_para1">The report is the result of a consultative process, involving a large number of Government departments, carers organisations, individual carers, representatives of the National Health Service and local authorities, other voluntary organisations which help to support carers and the business sector.
<P>

<a name="90208w16.html_para2">The National Health Service and local authorities need to provide carers with information about services which can support them in their caring role. They also need to involve carers in the planning and provision of services so that carers' needs are met better than they have been in the past.
<P>

<a name="90208w16.html_para3">Local authorities in Scotland have been allocated over &#163;1 billion for social work this year, of which &#163;5.1 million is specifically to provide respite and assist carers. Authorities will have an additional &#163;51.3 million in 1999-2000 to meet their social work responsibilities and are expected to use some of these resources to improve services to carers; &#163;5 million will be available to local authorities implementing the recommendations of the Action Plan to modernise community care, a key element of which is supporting carers.
<P>

<a name="90208w16.html_para4">The Government will also be consulting on proposals that time spent caring will entitles carers to a second pension (by 2050, up to an extra &#163;50 per week in today's terms).




<P>
<P><I>8 Feb 1999 : Column: 61</I><P>

<P>

<a name="90208w16.html_para5">We intend to trial a new question on carers for the 2001 Census. This should provide better information about the distribution of carers between local authority ares and on the numbers of young carers and those from minority ethnic groups.

<P>

<a name="90208w16.html_para7">Legislation reducing council tax for disabled people will be introduced. The Government also intend to introduce legislation in England to allow local authorities to address carers' needs more directly than is possible at present, as the Minister of State, Home Office, my hon.

To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland if he will assist salmon farmers in the Highlands and Islands to meet the costs of eradicating Infectious Salmon Anaemia; and if he will make a statement.  [70303]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90208w16.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Dewar: </B> 
 Infectious Salmon Anaemia is potentially a very serious disease and the Government remain determined to eradicate this present outbreak in Scotland. That is the best outcome we can achieve, both for the salmon farmers and for wild salmon stocks. The salmon farming industry must recognise its responsibilities to deal effectively with this outbreak.
<P>

<a name="90208w16.html_para10">The Government have put in place various measures to eradicate ISA, and further measures will be announced shortly when an interim report by a joint Scottish Office/Industry Working Group is completed. I welcome the co-operation of the industry.
<P>

<a name="90208w16.html_para11">I recognise that this eradication programme is imposing significant costs on the industry, particularly for farms where ISA is confirmed. The Government continue to take the view that, in principle, it is for the fish farming industry to meet costs arising from measures taken to control the spread of serious fish diseases. Salmon farming, however, provides very valuable employment in the Highlands and Islands, and the continuing uncertainty, which is undermining confidence in the industry and among investors, presents a serious threat to the economic well-being of the region. In these circumstances I have agreed to enable financial aid to be provided through Highlands and Islands Enterprise to the industry. Up to &#163;9 million will be available over 3 years, on a pound for pound matching basis for contributions from industry funds, to help individual farmers meet costs arising under the ISA eradication programme from new outbreaks of ISA. The detailed terms for such assistance will need to be settled. That offer of assistance is subject to approval by the European Commission under the usual state aid rules. No aid will be paid without the Commission's approval.




<P>
<P><I>8 Feb 1999 : Column: 62</I><P>

<P>

<a name="90208w16.html_para12">The assistance will be limited to a period of 3 years, and within that time salmon farmers will need to put in place alternative financial arrangements. We shall keep the eradication programme under regular review.

 Significant progress has been made within the Active Modern Service Programme. In recent weeks we have selected a private sector partner; Affinity, who will work with us to develop new IT systems. These new systems will enable us to deliver improved Social Security services and deliver our welfare reform programme. Working in partnership with the Department of Education and Employment and Employment Services, we have begun development of a single gateway to the welfare system to help people back to work. Finally, we have started to evaluate the modern service prototypes, piloted in Camden and Lewisham. Both these pilots successfully tested the provision of an integrated service to customers and we are using the lessons learnt to feed into our plans.

 The Government's objectives are to provide security for those who cannot provide for themselves and to make it easier for people who can save, to do so. We have announced, in the Pensions Green Paper, that we will be replacing SERPS with a new State second pension for those on low incomes, or those who are unable to work because of caring responsibilities or disability. We also propose new stakeholder pension schemes, designed to help those on middle and higher incomes make provision for their retirement.
<P>

<a name="90208w17.html_para3">From April, we will introduce a new minimum income guarantee for pensioners of at least &#163;75 a week for single people, and &#163;116.60 for couples. We have announced that, as resources allow, over the long term, our aim is that it should rise in line with earnings so that pensioners can share in the growing prosperity of the nation.

 From next April the largest ever increase in Child Benefit of &#163;2.95 for the first or eldest child will be payable to all families, a similar increase in the family premium will ensure the poorest families see the benefit of the increase.

<a name="90208w18.html_para0">A Green Paper published last year set out our proposals for a new, simpler and more transparent system of child support to ensure that more lone parents receive the maintenance which their children are due.

<P>
<a name="90208w19.html_spnew0"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 This Department supports organisations which provide temporary accommodation and an active resettlement programme for single homeless people under Section 30 of the Jobseekers Act 1995. All of the projects receiving Section 30 funding cater for young people aged 18-25, and 35 per cent. cater for 16-17 year olds.
<P>

<a name="90208w19.html_para0">In the current financial year, over &#163;13.2 million is available in revenue funding to enable projects to operate on a break-even basis and over &#163;5 million in capital to build new hostels or to refurbish existing buildings. This supports over 4,200 bed spaces, with nearly 300 more being developed. Provision has increased in recent years, particularly for women, people under the age of 25 and those with specific problems, such as drugs and alcohol.
<P>

<a name="90208w19.html_para1">The Social Exclusion Unit's report on Rough Sleeping recommended that the Department's resettlement provision for London be combined with provision from other Departments within a new London body, from April this year. It is proposed that the remainder of the Department's resettlement programme be transferred to the programmes of the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions (principally the Housing Corporation) in England and to the Scottish and Welsh Offices. This better co-ordinated approach is intended to reduce the number of rough sleepers, including young people sleeping rough, by two thirds by 2002.

<P>
<a name="90208w19.html_spnew4"><B> Janet Anderson: </B> 
 There are no full term independent local radio stations catering specifically for the interests of the Muslim faith. However, some independent radio stations which provide services for Asian communities, such as Sunrise Radio in Bradford and Asian Sound Radio in East Lancashire, operate in areas with a high Muslim population, and their service is expected to reflect this. In addition, the Radio Authority issues short term Restricted Service Licences which enable stations to broadcast during special events such as religious festivals. I understand the Authority licensed thirteen such short- term services for the most recent Ramadan festival.

 From time to time, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State receives representations about various aspects of the operation of individual radio stations.

Under the provisions of the Broadcasting Acts 1990 and 1996, the Radio Authority is responsible for the award and regulation of all independent radio licences in the UK.

 The New Millennium Experience Company (NMEC) adopted a competitive tendering process for procuring a range of catering services. The NMEC had previously sought general advice from Treasury Solicitors about public procurement rules and regulations to satisfy itself that the processes it was implementing to procure goods, works and services across the project reflected the competitive principles of public sector procurement. The interviewing panel comprised three voting and one independent members. The aim of the panel was to bring the bidders to a position where they were all on an equal footing given that the nature and the content of each bid varied. Consequently, therefore, the questions put to each bidder were framed differently depending on the written material provided by them. Of the three voting members, all were present at all interviews. The independent non-voting members varied and included the NMEC's Deputy Operations Director and the Chair of the NMEC Catering Review Group.

sectors of the economy have been free to approach NMEC with proposals. Very many have done so including those in the confectionary/ice cream sector. Where NMEC consider that such approaches hold a serious prospect of achieving commercial support which will not adversely impact on the integrity of the Millennium Experience, discussions are entered into. This was the case with approaches received from confectionary/ice cream suppliers where NMEC considered that their Official Supplier category of sponsorship support might be achievable. Official Supplier sponsorship is a well-established practice across major events and visitor attractions where there is a requirement or opportunities for enhancing commercial income.

<P>
<a name="90208w21.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Alan Howarth: </B> 
 When the Lottery was launched in 1994, the good causes were expected to receive around &#163;9 billion in total over the first licence period, that is 



<P>
<P><I>8 Feb 1999 : Column: 78</I><P>
&#163;1.8 billion for each of the five good causes, including heritage. When we raised that forecast to &#163;10 billion, we were able to provide &#163;1 billion for the New Opportunities Fund without affecting the expectations of the original good causes. We now expect the Lottery to raise &#163;10.6 billion for the good causes over the licence period, which ends in September 2001. &#163;200 million of the extra &#163;600 million will be shared equally between the heritage, the arts, sport and charities, with the balance of &#163;400 million going to the New Opportunities Fund. The Heritage Lottery Fund can therefore now count on receiving at least &#163;1.85 billion in total during the present licence.
<P>

<a name="90208w21.html_para0">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State announced on 3 February that, following the reduction in the percentage income shares to the heritage, the arts, sport and charities from 16 2/3  per cent. to 5 per cent. for thirteen weeks from 15 February in order to provide the extra revenue for the New Opportunities Fund, each is guaranteed to receive 16 2/3  per cent. for the remainder of the licence period. This is in addition to the undertaking we have already given that these good causes are each gauranteed 16 2/3  per cent. of Lottery proceeds after the current licence expires. These guarantees give the Heritage Lottery Fund a clear financial framework within which to plan its future spending and operate the new strategic approach to Lottery distribution we have introduced.

Short holiday trips, of 1-3 nights, accounted for fractionally over 50 per cent. of all holidays. The latest figures currently available from this annual survey are for 1997. They show an estimated 70.8 million holidays in the UK, 13 per cent. more than in 1994. Short holiday trips accounted for 53 per cent. of all UK holidays in 1997.

 The available information is given in the table. It should be noted, however, that comparisons between penal statistics from different countries may be misleading due to differences in criminal justice systems, the types of sanctions available to the judicial authorities and the length of prison sentences imposed by the courts and served by offenders.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will introduce legislation amending the Animals Act 1911 to make it an offence to keep an animal in a situation where it was likely to be caused suffering.  [69387]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90208w23.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 The law places the responsibility for taking care of animals on their owners or keepers, who may not cause them harm, intentionally or through neglect. Under the Protection of Animals Act 1911, it is an offence to cause any unnecessary suffering to any domestic or captive animal.
<P>

<a name="90208w23.html_para0">Since the mistreatment of animals can take many forms, the 1911 Act has been widely drawn to apply to any situation of unnecessary suffering. There are no plans at present to amend the 1911 Act to make it an offence of being likely to cause unnecessary suffering.

<a name="90208w23.html_para6">The Crime and Disorder Act 1998 introduced new statutory offences for racial crime which came into force on 30 September 1998. These correspond to the existing main offences which deal with violence against the person (except those which carry a maximum sentence of life imprisonment), criminal damage and offences of harassment. They include a test that there was either racial motivation or any aggravating evidence or racial hostility in connection with the offence and provide the courts with higher maximum penalties to reflect the racial aspect to the crime.

<a name="90208w23.html_para7">The introduction of specific racial offences will send out a strong message to society that such crime is unacceptable and will be dealt with very seriously by the courts.

Where it is decided to initiate deportation action in those cases, the Governor is asked to serve the notice informing the prisoner that the Secretary of State intends to deport him.

<a name="90208w24.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 As of 7 February, 392 prisoners have been made subject to Home Detention Curfew. Four of these prisoners have had their licences revoked and been recalled to prison. Two of these recalls were as a result of a failure to comply with the curfew conditions. One recall was due to an inability to monitor the prisoner's whereabouts and one was in order to protect the public from serious harm. One of the two prisoners recalled for failing to comply with the curfew condition has been charged with a further offence.

 The long term future of the beef sector will depend to a large degree on the outcome of the negotiations on the Agenda 2000 proposals. If the current proposals are agreed, they will provide for a significant reduction in beef prices together with an increase in direct payments to producers to compensate for the reduction in prices. This will provide the sector with the opportunity to become more market orientated and may boost consumption. It is clear that reform of the regime is essential in the light of the structural surplus that currently exists in the beef sector. In the continuing negotiations on the Agenda 2000 proposals we will be seeking to ensure that all member states play their part in bringing beef production into line with consumption. I believe that, with planning and re-valuation of their costs structure, Welsh beef producers, where they can utilise their natural advantages such as an abundance of grass, good breeding stock and a wealth of technical expertise at their disposal, should be in a position to succeed.

<a name="90208w26.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 In most areas of the country farmers are able to arrange for their OTMS animals to be slaughtered within a fortnight of booking with an abattoir or market. Abattoir slaughterings are currently averaging 17,000 animals a week in the UK, which would imply that there are only around 34,000 animals waiting to be slaughtered. An emergency service exists for the expeditious slaughter on-farm of animals which, in the opinion of a veterinary practitioner, require immediate slaughter.

<a name="90208w26.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The requirement to pay the proposed levy would depend on whether the premises concerned was required to register with the local authority under the Food Premises (Registration) Regulations 1991. These regulations make an exemption for premises which are concerned with the supply of beverages, or of biscuits, potato crisps, confectionery or other similar products and which are ancillary to a business (which may include a school) whose principal activity is not the sale of food.

 The &#163;120 million aid package announced by my right hon.

<P>

<a name="90208w27.html_para1">New entrants to farming will be eligible for HLCA and CPAS payments, as long as they comply with the scheme rules, but not for agrimonetary compensation, since this was the second tranche of compensation for exchange rate revaluations affecting the beef sector during 1997 and had, under EU rules, to be paid on the basis of production in the 12 months prior to the revaluations.

In a county where over 40 per cent. of agricultural land is permanent grassland, so reflecting the importance of livestock, and where some two thirds of the land comprises the Sussex Downs and the High Weald, areas of outstanding national beauty which rely on current farming practices, this fall in market prices is understandably of concern.

 The table sets out the information requested for the education SSAs for 1999-2000, which were finalised on 1 February. Some 85 per cent. of the total is allocated on the basis of pupil numbers with the remainder allocated on the basis of population and resident pupil numbers. This has two main effects in creating local variations around the national increases. First, the percentage increase for a given local authority will generally be higher than the national increase if its pupil numbers have risen more quickly than the national trend. Second, authorities with above average increases in pupil numbers will tend to see their overall education SSA per pupil rise by less than the national average rate because the 15 per cent. of the SSA which is not based on pupil numbers will not rise in line with the pupil numbers, and this has a consequential effect on the year-on-year change in the overall level of education SSA per pupil.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. The cash and percentage change figures take account of local authority changes of function and new arrangements for funding music and student support services.<P>

2. The education SSA per pupil figures have been derived by dividing the 1999-2000 SSA and the adjusted 1998-99 SSA by the total number of pupils aged 4 and over included in the relevant SSA calculations for that financial year.<P>

3. The answer spells out the main reason why variations in the percentage increase in the SSA are negatively correlated with variations in the percentage increase per pupil figures. But an LEA would also receive an above average increase in overall SSA per pupil if:<P>

<i>(a)</i> other data on population used in the calculations are increasing, relative to the national trend, while pupil numbers are static; or<P>

<i>(b)</i> the growth in pupil numbers is concentrated in the post-16/secondary sectors which attract more SSA credit than younger children because they are more expensive to educate. <P>

 For 1998-99 the Standards Fund budget and expenditure committed is &#163;625.5m. For 1999-2000 Local Education Authorities have been offered allocations from a Standards Fund budget totalling &#163;843m. The expenditure committed for 1999-2000 will be known once Authorities have responded to those offers and to allocations yet to be made. These figures include grant contributed by the Department and contributions from Local Education Authorities. The Standards Fund programme is reviewed annually and decisions about the budget for 2000-2001 will be made in due course.

 <i>[holding answer 28 January 1999]:</i> The information that my hon. Friend has requested is listed in the table. The three figures are not comparable because of differences in responsibilities between TECs, the HEFCE and the FEFC. Accordingly, as with HEFCE and FEFC, TEC percentages have been calculated on total administrative costs and budgets. The percentage figure for TECs is much higher than either of the others because TECs are themselves directly involved in local business support and economic development.

<a name="90208w28.html_para10">The Department is currently working with the higher education funding bodies in the UK to develop a method of calculating drop-out rates which can be applied to all UK higher education institutions and which takes into account the non-traditional routes that some students follow. These routes may include changing courses or institutions, repeating years or leaving higher education for a year or more before continuing their studies.

I am told that two of the factories are in poor structural condition, and the third does not provide the necessary scope to expand operations. An important aim from any merger would be to provide a more modern facilities with a better working environment for the disabled employees.

<a name="90208w29.html_para2">I understand that there would be full consultation with the workers and trade union representatives on each site if the project looked feasible.

 The Government have set a target to double the participation of three-year-olds in free early education places to 66 per cent. by 2002. In 1999-2000, the Government are making available &#163;40 million to the 50 Local Education Authority areas with greater social need to bring forward the first 47,000 places, which will be found in all sectors and described in each Authority's Early Years Development and Childcare Plan.

 The information is not available in the form requested. A number of definitions, disease descriptions or diagnostic criteria have been proposed to describe chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis. However, there is no general agreement as to which should be used. This makes the results from studies on the prevalence of CFS/ME difficult to interpret and there is no agreement on the incidence of the illness.
<P>

<a name="90208w30.html_para0">There is no information available on outpatient appointments. However, figures for CFS/ME for ordinary admissions and daycases in NHS trusts in England, for financial years 1995-96 to 1997-98 are shown in the table.
<P>

<a name="90208w30.html_para1">The National Health Service provides a considerable number of services to which sufferers from CFS/ME have access, because of the wide range of symptoms people with CFS/ME can experience they are seen within a wide range of hospital specialties. Under the present system it is for health authorities and general practitioners to plan and arrange the services available to people in their care, following an assessment of their needs.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90208w30.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 National terms and conditions for nursing staff include a range of leads and allowances paid under certain circumstances. Details of all such allowances were set out in Annex 1 of our 1998 evidence to the Review Body for Nursing Staff, Midwives, Health Visitors and Professions Allied to Medicine, copies of which are available in the Library. This included information on the current national rate of payment and a brief description of conditions for payment. Further information on conditions for payment is in the Nursing and Midwifery Staffs Negotiating Council Handbook. The value of leads and allowances each year from 1970 can be found in the Advance Letters issued to the National Health Service, copies of which have been placed in the Library. All NHS bodies which employ nurses on national contracts pay these leads and allowances, if qualifying conditions are met. Since 1994 employers have had the flexibility to increase leads and allowances locally which some NHS trusts have done. In their sixteenth report for 1999, laid before Parliament by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Health, the Review Body recommended that London allowance and on-call and stand-by allowance should be increased and urged NHS trusts to increase relevant leads and allowances. The national rate of London allowance will increase by 15.4 per cent. from 1 April 1999 and on-call and stand-by allowance will also be increased by 19 per cent. from 1 April 1999.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90208w30.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 In 1997-98 health authorities in England were allocated &#163;199.3 million for the treatment and care of HIV/AIDS patients. This amount was not ring-fenced to allow health authorities flexibility to spend more or less in the light of local circumstances. The Department does not routinely collect information on the amount actually spent on HIV/AIDS services.
<P>

<a name="90208w30.html_para5">In 1997-98, local authorities were provided with &#163;13.7 million as a contribution towards the cost of community care services for people with severe HIV and AIDS. The AIDS support grant scheme operates on a 70:30 basis with local authorities providing at least 30 per cent. of the total spent. The Department also made available &#163;1.5 million to the voluntary sector through the Section 64 general scheme to provide care, support services and information to people affected by HIV and AIDS.
<P>

<a name="90208w30.html_para6">In 1997-98 health authorities in England were allocated &#163;52.3 million which was ring-fenced for HIV Prevention activities and in the same year &#163;4.6 million was spent on national health promotion campaigns and initiatives.

<P>

<a name="90208w30.html_para7">Departmental expenditure on HIV/AIDS research in 1997-98 was &#163;117,000 for wholly funded work and around &#163;1.275 million on partly funded research. The National Health Service research and development levy is also used to support research and development in health care settings.

 I refer the hon. Member to the reply given to my hon. Friend the Member for Bolton, South-East (Dr. Iddon) on 1 February 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, columns <i>524-25</i>. It gave the Government's response to these two pay review body recommendations to allocate an extra &#163;50 million a year from 2000-01 to reward individual consultants for increases in workload and intensity of work.
<P>

<a name="90208w31.html_para3">Our negotiations with the profession on a new consultant contract are covering these issues. We will consider the recommendation very carefully in the context of the negotiations, and are willing to make an investment in rewards and incentives if the negotiations deliver a better service for patients. We will, therefore, decide on the level of any extra funding for future years, and how such funding might be allocated, when the negotiations are complete.

 The National Health Service Executive ran a one-off survey in January 1998 to follow-up the 1995 Office of Population Censuses and Surveys report "Qualified Nurses, Midwives and Health Visitors", which identified ways in which qualified nurses who had left nursing could be attracted back into the profession. The results from this survey, which include the impact of working practices, will be released shortly.

<a name="90208w32.html_para0">There are about 175,000 retail food premises and about 340,000 catering premises in the United Kingdom, but data on the number of people they employ are not collected centrally. However, data on premises in which food represents the majority activity of business indicate that around 80 per cent. of premises employ fewer than 10 people, and around 99 per cent. employ fewer than 100 people. The Government will be seeking updated information on the number of premises liable for the levy from local authorities as part of the consultation process.

<a name="90208w32.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Chope: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health for what reason the Government concluded that it would be more complex and costly to operate a levy to fund the Food Standards Agency which was confined to large food retailers.  [68977]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90208w32.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Rooker </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 2 February 1999]:</i> I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="90208w32.html_para2">The entire food industry stands to benefit from greater consumer confidence, and therefore the Government propose to collect the levy from registered food premises at the final point of sale to the consumer. We believe that a flat rate fee, at the modest level proposed, represents a simple and transparent way of collecting the levy.

<a name="90208w32.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Chope: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health what estimate he has made of the proportion of the total yield of the proposed levy for the Food Standards Agency which will come from small businesses.  [68979]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90208w32.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Rooker </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 2 February 1999]:</i> I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="90208w32.html_para3">This depends on the definition of 'small business' used. Under most standard definitions, a significant majority of food premises would fall within this category.

<a name="90208w32.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Chope: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health what efforts have been made to quantify in financial terms the benefits which the proposed Food Standards Agency will bring to its stakeholders.  [68980]<P>

<P>
<a name="90208w32.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Rooker </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 2 February 1999]:</i> I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="90208w32.html_para4">The principal benefits of the Food Standards Agency will be the protection of public health and greater consumer confidence. These benefits cannot be quantified in purely financial terms.

<P>

<a name="90208w32.html_para5">The Government believe that the entire food industry stands to benefit from the Food Standards Agency and therefore proposes that all retail and catering premises required to register under the Food Premises (Registration) Regulations 1991, as amended (and equivalent Northern Ireland regulations), should make a contribution to the additional costs of the Agency. The only exception proposed is for premises whose only food sales are wrapped confectionery, soft drinks, crisps and similar wrapped products.

<P>
<a name="90208w32.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Chope: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health whether the proposals for a levy on businesses to pay for the proposed Food Standards Agency has been considered by the Better Regulation Task Force; and if he will make a statement.  [68982]<P>

<a name="90208w32.html_wqn10"><B> Mr. Chope: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health for what reason the consultation draft of the Food Standards Bill provides that the levy on food premises may be different in different areas.  [68976]<P>

<a name="90208w32.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Rooker </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 2 February 1999]:</i> I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="90208w32.html_para8">The provisions in the draft Bill are enabling provisions, which have been drafted so as to allow flexibility to modify the details of the levy and the level at which it is set in secondary legislation, as necessary, subject to the approval of Parliament.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90208w32.html_wqn11"><B> Mr. Chope: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health if the level of the proposed Food Standards Agency levy upon business will be the same in all parts of the United Kingdom.  [68970]<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="90208w32.html_wqn12"><B> Mr. Chope: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health what is his estimate of the number of businesses for which a flat rate levy of &#163;90 for the Food Standards Agency would create significant problems.  [68971]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90208w32.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Rooker </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 2 February 1999]:</i> I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="90208w32.html_para10">A &#163;90 annual levy equates to a levy of &#163;1.73 a week. I do not anticipate that businesses will find that sum difficult to afford, but we hope to get more information on this through the consultation process currently underway.
