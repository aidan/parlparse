<a name="30702w01.html_sbhd0"><H3 align=center>Aggregate</H3>


<P>
<P>
<a name="30702w01.html_wqn0"><B> Sue Doughty: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport (1) if he will estimate how many tonnes of aggregate would be required for the <i>(a)</i> motorway widening, <i>(b)</i> major trunk road schemes, <i>(c)</i> bypasses and <i>(d)</i> other major local road improvement schemes implied by the Ten Year Transport Plan;  [122000]
<P>
<UL>(2) if he will estimate how many tonnes of aggregate will be required to build the current targeted programme of improvements.  [122001]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30702w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The Government do not have any such estimates. Precise solutions for delivering many of the projects in the Ten Year Plan including the Targeted Programme of Improvements are not yet defined.

<a name="30702w01.html_sbhd1"><H3 align=center>Aircraft Noise</H3>


<P>
<P>
<a name="30702w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Colman: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what breaches of night flight noise limits under the quota count system there have been on the Heathrow flight paths since the current night flights restrictions began.  [123030]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30702w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 None. I wrote to my hon. Friend about this on 20 June 2003 and I have now placed a copy of that letter in the Libraries of the House.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30702w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Colman: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what discussions his Department has had with international experts on International Civil Aviation Organisation noise certification; and what reasons these experts have given for the difference between locally monitored night flight noise levels and certificated noise levels in the Heathrow area.  [123031]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30702w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 Certification testing is carried out under strictly controlled meteorological and acoustical conditions and using defined flight path procedures. It follows that when local conditions differ so too will the noise. The extent to which currently certificated noise levels correlate with operational noise levels is one of the items being examined by a Working Group of the Committee on Aviation Environmental Protection (CAEP) of the International Civil Aviation Organisation. The Working Group will take account of data for a large range of aircraft types that operate at night at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted (recently published in "Quota Count Validation Study: Noise Measurements and Analysis", ERCD Report 0205), as well as data from some airports in the USA and France. The UK is represented on the CAEP Steering Group and the relevant Working Group by officials from the Department for Transport and the Civil Aviation Authority respectively.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30702w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Damian Green: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport when he will announce his decisions on the introduction of domestic services on the Channel Tunnel Rail Link; and if he will make a statement.  [122525]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30702w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 The Strategic Rail Authority (SRA) consulted earlier this year on options for domestic services on the Channel Tunnel Rail Link. We await the SRA's recommendations to Ministers in the light of the responses to that consultation.

<a name="30702w01.html_sbhd3"><H3 align=center>European Council (Plutonium MOX Fuel)</H3>


<P>
<P>
<a name="30702w01.html_wqn4"><B> Llew Smith: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what additional measures are being taken to protect plutonium MOX fuel in transit from Sellafield in pursuit of the fulfilment of the commitment made by EU member states on page 39, paragraph 5 of the presidency conclusions of the Thessaloniki European Council.  [122279]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30702w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 The Presidency Conclusions of the Council of 19 and 20 June 2003 include a declaration on tackling the threat of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The Government are satisfied that the risks of nuclear weapons proliferation arising from the manufacture of MOX fuel in the UK and its export to Europe and Japan is negligible. The Government's independent civil nuclear security regulator, the DfT's Office for Civil Nuclear Security (OCNS), is responsible for approving arrangements for ensuring the security of MOX fuel during transport. OCNS is satisfied that the arrangements in place for the transport of MOX fuel are amply robust to deal with any potential threats. It is not Government policy to disclose details of security measures taken in respect of civil nuclear materials beyond those already published in the Director of Civil Nuclear Security's annual reports made available in the Libraries of the House.

<a name="30702w01.html_sbhd4"><H3 align=center>Performance Targets</H3>


<P>
<P>
<a name="30702w01.html_wqn5"><B> Gregory Barker: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport if he will list the performance targets that <i>(a)</i> his Department, <i>(b)</i> its agencies and <i>(c)</i> non-departmental public bodies are required to meet; and if he will specify for each target (i) who sets it and (ii) who monitors achievement against it.  [120905]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30702w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 Key performance targets for the Department for Transport were agreed as part of the Spending Review and the latest set were published in "Spending Review 2002: Public Service Agreements 2003&#150;06" (Cm 5571). The Department monitors progress towards the targets along with the Prime Minister's Delivery Unit and HM Treasury, and with Defra in the case of the target it shares with that Department, and progress is reported regularly.
<P>

<a name="30702w01.html_para0">Performance targets for the Department's Agencies (the Highways Agency, Maritime and Coastguard Agency, Driving Standards Agency, Driver Vehicle and Licensing Agency, the Vehicle Certification Agency, and the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency) are set by the Secretary of State for Transport, with the assistance of the relevant Agency and its Advisory Board. The targets are monitored through liaison meetings between each Agency and the Department for 



<P>
<P><I>2 Jul 2003 : Column 269W</I><P>
Transport, and by reports to the Advisory Board of the Agency in question. In each case, progress towards targets is audited and end-year performance is reported in each Agency's published Annual Report and Accounts, which are laid before Parliament.
<P>

<a name="30702w01.html_para1">The Highways Agency's targets are published in its annual Business Plan, which is laid before Parliament and also published on the Agency's website. This year's targets are at: http://www.highways.gov.uk/aboutus/corpdocs/bus plan/2003 2004/05.htm
<P>

<a name="30702w01.html_para2">These were published in a written statement on 29 April 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 5WS.
<P>

<a name="30702w01.html_para3">The key targets for the Maritime and Coastguard Agency were set by the Secretary of State and published in a written statement on 10 April 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 32WS. They are also contained in the Agency's published business plan, which was published on 8 April 2003.
<P>

<a name="30702w01.html_para4">The targets for the Driving Standards Agency, the Driver, Vehicle and Licensing Agency, the Vehicle Certification Agency, and the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency were published in a written statement on 29 April 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 5&#150;8WS.
<P>

<a name="30702w01.html_para5">The Secretary of State for Transport sets out the Government's goals for the Strategic Rail Authority (SRA) in Directions and Guidance that he issues to the Authority from time to time. The SRA's goals are set out in its Strategic Plan 2002 and progress on the goals is reported on in its Strategic Plan 2003. Both documents are available in the Library of the House. DfT Ministers and officials monitor the SRA's progress in delivering these goals.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30702w01.html_wqn6"><B> Lynne Jones: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what assessment he has made of the need for <i>(a)</i> new and <i>(b)</i> reconditioned rolling stock for the UK railway system; and whether he estimates train companies are making the level of investment required to meet these needs.  [122347]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30702w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 Decisions on the purchase of new railway vehicles and the refurbishment of existing ones are primarily matters for train operators. There is nevertheless a requirement for the Strategic Rail Authority (SRA) to produce a strategy for passenger rolling stock against which individual decisions can be taken. A consultation draft of its rolling stock strategy was published by the SRA on 30 June 2003.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30702w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 The Authority's final West Coast Strategy, published on 16 June 2003 with the support of the Secretary of State, envisages an hourly train service between London and Warrington. Copies have been sent to all MPs.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what steps he is taking to improve public transport links to Warrington.  [122829]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30702w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 Warrington received a total of &#163;6.7 million for integrated transport measures as part of the 2003&#150;04 transport settlement. Warrington's Local Transport Plan contains a public transport strategy. This sets out short, medium and long term action plans which cover developing accessibility and best value criteria for supporting bus services which cannot be provided commercially; introducing bus quality partnerships, including bus quality corridors, real time passenger information, bus priority and variable message sign strategy; implementing park and ride strategies, and working with the private sector to achieve the construction of a new bus interchange adjacent to the main shopping centre. This year's annual progress report is due with the Department in July 2003.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what instructions London Underground has given drivers on wearing protective masks; for what reasons; and if he will make a statement.  [121888]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30702w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 London Underground tell me that they have asked train drivers not to wear dust masks because all research to date has shown that there are no known health risks arising from tunnel dust. The same situation is found on all other underground systems around the world.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer how many Inland Revenue Business Support Teams there are; what areas the teams serve; and if he will make a statement.  [122823]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30702w02.html_spnew1"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 There are 66 Business Support Teams covering the whole of the United Kingdom. Each team is made up of a number of Business Advisers who are located in one or more sites across each Area Management Unit. The Teams provide education mainly around payroll administration, but also cover aspects of self-employment, self-assessment and the construction industry.

<a name="30702w02.html_para2">The Chancellor is asking that the work be completed in time to announce initial conclusions and any next steps in this year's Pre-Budget Report.
<P>

<a name="30702w02.html_para3">The remit for the review will be to examine the best organisational arrangements for delivering the Government's tax objectives, both now and into the future. The review will also consider the case for changes

<P><I>2 Jul 2003 : Column 271W</I><P>
in the law, where necessary, to allow the full benefits of particular arrangements to be realised and pay particular attention to the need to ensure the continued effectiveness of the core business of revenue collection and administration.
<P>

<a name="30702w02.html_para4">Specific points the review will cover will include:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>ways to enhance service delivery to taxpayers and how these are most effectively ensured. Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise together deliver some of the most important functions for the Government, for the public, and for the business community. They have a very large number of customers in common. The review will have a particular remit to examine whether, through closer working between the revenue departments or through organisational change, costs to honest taxpayers and compliance costs to businesses can be reduced;
<P>
<BR>
the coherence of administrative systems, including information and efficient use of resources across the broad area of tax administration, taking into account future technological developments which will open new avenues for enhanced services;
<P>
<BR>
how best to ensure consistent and effective enforcement of the law against those who do not pay their fair share, particularly those who make a business out of cheating the tax system. As part of this review we will examine work being done separately by the Government on the links between tax organisations and the law enforcement agencies;
<P>
<BR>
the most appropriate structure for delivering policy advice to Ministers. Currently officials working on strategic tax policy questions are spread across three departments. A more co-ordinated approach to fiscal policy advice is desirable, and the review will look at how we can best create a focus for tax policy work; and
<P>
<BR>
a new framework for accountability for those working on tax, to set out more clearly the roles and responsibilities of all those involved. Greater clarity will provide better certainty both for officials and Ministers. The review currently being conducted by Gus O'Donnell, which was announced in the Government's response to the Fourth Report 2003 of the Treasury Select Committee, will form part of this work.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="30702w02.html_para5">The primary focus of the review will be making public service delivery more effective and efficient. The review will be conducted in discussion with unions and other stakeholders.
<P>

<a name="30702w02.html_para6">Since 1997, Inland Revenue and HM Customs and Excise have worked effectively with the Treasury to play a key role in support of this Government's reforming agenda. Their record is one of success and a tribute to the staff of the revenue departments and to their Chairmen, Sir Nicholas and Sir Richard. The revenue departments do a first-rate job and this review is intended to build on their success to ensure we make the best of the resources that we have.

<a name="30702w02.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 Information on all Government Departments and Agencies retentions practices is not held centrally and could be only obtained at disproportionate cost.

 On 26 June 2003 the Agriculture Council reached agreement on reform of the CAP, which sets a new course for agriculture in Europe. It will reduce agricultural trade barriers, and puts the EU in a strong position to negotiate a successful outcome at the next round of WTO talks in Cancun in September 2003.
<P>

<a name="30702w04.html_para0">The reform proposals enable decoupling of farm subsidies from production, removing the perverse incentives to over-produce. The deal enables the EU to exceed the domestic support targets that have been proposed in the WTO negotiations, reducing the distortions in world markets which the CAP has caused, and paving the way for a successful conclusion to the Doha trade round.

<i>[holding answer 30 June 2003]:</i> UK emission estimates are contained in the National Atmospheric Emissions Inventory and are published annually. Full NAEI data is available at the NAEI website www.naei.org.uk. UK dioxin emissions were estimated at 1,184 grammes (international toxic equivalent, I-TEQ) in 1990, and to have reduced from 424 grammes in 1998 to 357 grammes in 2001, the latest date for which data are available. The NAEI does not contain data at the level of detail requested. As regards on-farm drum incinerators, the total emissions from all small-scale waste burning are estimated at 50g per year I-TEQ, but this figure includes both agricultural and non-agricultural waste burning and is subject to considerable uncertainty. The total emissions from all small animal carcase incinerators are estimated at 0.25g per year I-TEQ. These figures have all remained constant between 1998 and 2001. There are no data on emissions from waste oil burners.

 I take it my hon.

The ICES response was included in the report of the May meeting of the Advisory Committee on Fishery Management (ACFM), and was in part based on an earlier meeting of an EU Expert Group, which met in Brussels a few weeks previously. ACFM comprises a scientist from each member country of ICES (the current UK member is from Fisheries Research Services, Aberdeen, but a CEFAS observer was also present in another capacity).

ICES was unable to cover in its evaluation the effects of effort restrictions and of decommissioning in 2003 at the level of individual fleets, due to lack of appropriate data. However, it noted that the effort limitations are expected to benefit the stock by reducing discards and by helping to reduce the amount of illegal, unreported or undeclared landings.

the UK under the new Common Fisheries Policy Framework Regulation, (EC) No. 2371/02 are not a practicable means of protection for the Darwin Mounds as the threat to the area would not meet the necessary criteria of being both serious and unforeseen. In addition, such measures could be imposed only for three months. Emergency powers are available to the Commission where the threat is serious, can be put in place for six months, renewable for a further six months and would allow time for more permanent protection to be developed and put in place.

 A number of assessments of the attainability of the EU limit values for nitrogen dioxide have been carried out. Defra commissioned the independent scientific Air Quality Expert Group in July 2002 to undertake an overall assessment of the concentrations of nitrogen dioxide in the UK in both 2005 and 2010. The Group considered all the available studies. A draft report for comment was published on 19 May 2003 (www.defra.gov.uk/environment/airquality/aqeg/). Copies of the draft report on "Nitrogen Dioxide in the United Kingdom" have been placed in the House of Commons Library. The report concluded that, on the basis of the best current projections, in 2010 between 3 and 13 per cent. of the area of London are likely not to conform to the EU annual average limit value of 40 micrograms per metre cubed at background locations. The range reflects the span in outputs between the different models used. The report concludes that the rest of England is likely to conform to the EU limit values for nitrogen dioxide at background concentrations. The report further concludes that around 23 per cent. of the major built-up road length in London and 5 per cent. in the rest of England are likely to be above the EU annual average limit value of 40 micrograms per metre cubed in 2010.

The list does not include consultancies on internal ICT projects, consultancies in support of specific services, or those used by non-departmental public bodies, as gathering this information would incur disproportionate cost.

<P>
<a name="30702w07.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Miliband  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 26 June 2003]:</i> Most local authorities, including Gloucestershire, are party to the national agreement on pay and conditions of local government staff (commonly known as the Single Status Agreement), which was negotiated by the National Joint Council for Local Government Services in 1997. The agreement commits authorities to carrying out grading reviews in accordance with equal pay legislation. This is consistent with broader government policy, which is to encourage employers to carry out pay reviews to help ensure that they meet their obligations under the legislation.
<P>

<a name="30702w07.html_para0">The pay of school support staff is determined at local level: the Government believe that this is the best way of ensuring a flexible system that can respond to local needs and circumstances.

<P>
<a name="30702w07.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 Through our Green Paper '14&#150;19: extending opportunities, raising standards' we consulted extensively on our proposals to create more choice and flexibility at Key Stage 4. Through our Language Learning pamphlet we also consulted on our aspirations for the future of language learning in this country. The overall response to the consultations endorsed our view that schools should no longer be required to teach modern foreign languages to all pupils but that schools should be required to ensure that any pupil wishing to study a modern foreign language should be able to do so.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30702w07.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Stephen Twigg: </B> 
 While we have made no formal assessment on this issue, we consider that the acquisition of a modern foreign language can be both a generic and a specialist skill, depending on a number of factors, including the age of the student, the reasons for learning a language and the level of competence required.
<P>

 The Government welcome Ofsted's report on phases one and two of the School Sport Co-ordinator partnerships. The report shows 



<P>
<P><I>2 Jul 2003 : Column 290W</I><P>
good progress in the early years of the programme: the profile of physical education (PE) and school sport has been raised; the majority of partnerships have made substantial progress; and out of hours sports activities have been widened and increased. The report will help us ensure that the expansion of the network of partnerships, to include 75 per cent. of schools in England by 2006, builds on best practice and delivers lasting benefits for children.
<P>

<a name="30702w07.html_para7">An additional &#163;459 million is being invested over three years (from April 2003) to deliver a national PE, School Sport and Club Links strategy.

<P>

<a name="30702w07.html_para8">The School Sport Co-ordinator programme is just one element of our strategy and focuses on enhancing links between schools and their local communities and increasing the quality and quantity of out of school hours sports opportunities and competitive school sport. We will raise the quality of PE teaching by delivering a professional development programme for teachers and others. This will be piloted later this year and then rolled out to all schools from April 2004.

 My Department has received a number of representations concerning rural and countryside education.

The Department has not collected information on a regional basis.

<a name="30702w07.html_para9">Partners selected to be involved in 'the outdoor classroom' will vary, depending on the local area, whether urban or rural.

 It is not possible to define non-selective, non-specialist, non-mainstream schools (i.e. special schools) as either primary or secondary as many special schools provide for children of all ages.

[121779]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30702w08.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 The October 2001 Ofsted survey of the programme ('Specialist Schools: An evaluation of progress') looked at the Language specialism alongside the three other specialisms which were part of the programme in 2000 (Sports, Arts and Technology). The survey found that four out of five of the well-established specialist schools covered by the survey were in large measure achieving the aims of the programme and making good use of the advantages it brings. The survey said that for these schools specialist status had often been a catalyst for innovation and helped to sustain or accelerate the momentum of school improvement.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30702w08.html_spnew7"><B> Alan Johnson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 24 June 2003]:</i> The Department does not classify the interest subsidy as a contingent liability as the liability occurs as part of normal departmental business. We do however recognise the liability by providing for the future costs in a provision.
<P>

<a name="30702w08.html_para2">The interest subsidy provision was set up to meet the costs resulting from the difference between the interest paid by students and the cost of capital on loans. The provision provides for the discounted cost of the interest over the life of the loans issued in the financial year. Each year the annual interest subsidy charge is released to the Operating Cost Statement. Listed in the table are the amounts provided in year for 2001&#150;02, a provisional outturn figure for 2002&#150;03 and the forecast figures for remainder of the current spending review period.

 The available information shows that, in 2002, the proportion of 18-year-olds resident in Havering who obtained two or more A-levels and who were accepted onto a full-time or sandwich undergraduate course in the UK via the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS) was 38 per cent., compared to the national average of 61 per cent.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what plans he has to improve the recruitment and retention of talented and well-qualified teachers.  [120159]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30702w08.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 In the current academic year, recruitment is over 20 per cent. higher than in 1999/2000 and more graduates have begun initial teacher training than in any year on record. In September 2000, the Government introduced 6,000 training bursaries and 4,000 Golden Hellos for priority subjects in order to encourage more graduates to train as teachers and enter the teaching profession. From September 2002, these incentives are being reinforced by the Repayment of Teachers' Loans scheme, which will also assist recruitment and retention in the subjects where they present the greatest challenge. As a result of the steps that the Government have taken, we have seen three successive years of rising recruitment to teacher training. Applications from graduates to train as teachers in 2003/04 are currently running 16 per cent. above their level at this time last year.
<P>

<a name="30702w08.html_para6">As well as bringing more graduates into the profession, the Government are also seeking to encourage the most talented and well-qualified individuals to enter teaching, stay in teaching and contribute to the maximum of their potential as quickly as possible. The Government's Fast Track scheme is having a positive impact. This is the first year that Fast Track teachers have been working in schools, and one in six has already gained promotion to middle leadership. By September 2003, there will be over 500 Fast Track teachers and trainees, more than twice the number who were on the programme last year. The Government are also supporting the Teach First scheme, which will place around 200 high-achieving graduates as teachers in London schools from this September.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills if he will make a statement on his decision to end support for teacher induction under Standards Funds.  [119931]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30702w08.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 The Government have ended some Standards Fund grants in 2003&#150;04 in order to allow other priorities to be supported from the fund, without increasing the overall proportion of ring-fenced funding for local authorities and schools. From April 2003 funding for the induction of newly qualified teachers is no longer channelled through a separate Standards Fund grant.
<P>

<a name="30702w08.html_para7">It is for schools and local education authorities to determine how to support induction for newly qualified teachers within the overall resources available. LEAs are free to allocate funds to schools on the basis of the number of newly qualified teachers they have in their schools.

 <i>[holding answer 30 June 2003]:</i> The skills tests are one of the standards which every trainee teacher has to meet. They were introduced after evidence from Ofsted indicated concern at that time about the standards of literacy, numeracy and ICT amongst newly qualified teachers. We have no present plans to discontinue the tests. Headteachers, parents and pupils rightly have high expectations of teachers, and discontinuing the tests could compromise the high standards now being attained.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills if he will make a statement on the support he offers for the recruitment and retention of teachers in London, with special reference to the cost of living.  [122744]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30702w08.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 We are taking a number of measures to make London a world class centre for education. On 12 May 2003, the Prime Minister launched the London Challenge, which aims to transform standards of achievement in secondary schools in London. We appointed Tim Brighouse as the first Commissioner for London Schools with effect from 1 January. We have also funded the establishment of a London recruitment and retention unit based in the Government Office for London.
<P>

<a name="30702w08.html_para10">Importantly, we have acknowledged and endorsed the STRB's recommendations that teachers in Inner London receive an increase in pay which reflects the additional cost of living in the centre of London. An experienced teacher on the maximum in 1997 in Inner London will have seen their basic pay increase by 16.5 per cent. in real terms. If they passed the performance threshold it will have increased in real terms by 32 per cent.
<P>

<a name="30702w08.html_para11">We are developing a new Chartered London Teacher status to recognise the particular skills that are needed to teach effectively in London schools. The new status 



<P>
<P><I>2 Jul 2003 : Column 299W</I><P>
will recognise and reward effective practice, promote professional development and provide incentives for good teachers to stay teaching in London. This will be a core element in our work to re-establish the view that London is a sought after career posting for teachers. We intend to ask the Schools Teachers' Review Body to consider this as part of the forthcoming pay round.
<P>

<a name="30702w08.html_para12">We are also continuing to work closely alongside colleagues from the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister to explore how best to minimise the impact of relatively higher housing costs for teachers in London. The &#163;250 million Starter Homes Initiative aims to help 10,000 key workers into home ownership in areas of high cost housing. In 2001&#150;02 the initiative offered support to 2,800 teachers in London and the South and the second phase in 2002&#150;03 will fund &#163;10,000 equity loans, benefiting around 2,000 key workers, of whom 700 will be teachers based in the Southern Counties.
<P>

<a name="30702w08.html_para13">We are also working with the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister to explore whether and how a targeted scheme could help teachers identified as potential future leaders of London's education service to afford to buy a family home. We will announce the outcome of this work in the late summer.
<P>

<a name="30702w08.html_para14">In addition, we have just announced the launch of a Well-Being Programme pilot for London which will see 15 LEAs with some 400 schools involved, helping to address some of the work-related health issues causing concern for teaching and non-teaching staff and looking to improve the work-life balance of teachers in London.
<P>

<a name="30702w08.html_para15">Finally, the wide range of national reforms which the Government have introduced to assist recruitment and retention, and to raise standards, apply equally to teachers in London. In particular our radical school workforce reforms, supported by our partners on the Workforce Agreement Monitoring Group, directly address the primary reason that teachers have given for leaving the profession: workload.

<a name="30702w09.html_para13">Accurate data are vital to measure progress in reducing poverty, including progress towards the Millennium Development Goals. In most poor countries, collecting reliable data for indicators such as primary school enrolment or births and deaths is a major challenge. Often data are simply not available, or they may be of a variable quality due to information gaps as a result of inefficient data collection practices. There may also be a long delay in the production of country data which can hamper developing countries' government's ability to plan and implement effective policies. In countries affected by conflict, systems for collecting data may have ceased to function at all.

DFID's Country Assistance Plans contain a statistical annex which is revised every year. We are committed to using locally available country data whenever possible, supplemented by data from international sources such as the World Bank and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to monitor progress against the country plans.

I raised our concerns on the situation faced by all vulnerable groups in Colombian society directly with the Colombian President and his Ministers. I made clear that we were following the situation very closely and our continued support for the Government was dependent on complete respect for human rights and international humanitarian law.

 None of the cost increases in the Nimrod and Astute programmes, announced by my noble Friend the Minister for Defence Procurement on 19 February, was due to changes in specifications. The cost increase in the Astute programme derives directly from the Department taking responsibility for a share of the cost increases resulting from decisions taken jointly by the Ministry of Defence and the company on the use of Computer Aided Design technology. For Nimrod MRA4, the cost increase is the MOD's contribution towards the costs required to restructure the programme, as well as including a separate amount for the conduct of an Assessment Phase study to explore the potential for capability enhancement as an "adaptable aircraft" to meet future defence requirements building upon the results of recent operational experience and the general need for more surveillance, reconnaissance and land attack capability identified in the SDR New Chapter.

 In operating the work permit arrangements, Work Permits (UK) is concerned to ensure that UK employers are able to recruit those workers with the skills that they need while protecting the interests of resident workers and that decisions to issue work permits are therefore based on a full understanding of current labour market conditions. The Information Technology, Communications and Electronics Sector Advisory Panel meets regularly to advise Work Permits (UK) on labour market conditions in the IT sector, and the information on which any assessment is based is kept under continuous review. In the light of the panel's advice, IT occupations were removed from Work Permit (UK's) Shortage Occupation List in September 2002.

All application forms sent out by INEB also contain an information sheet, which gives the latest timescales. Agents in the Bureau do have some information about backlogs in various locations and the Bureau is presently trying to refine that information so that callers can be given clearer likely timescales for their individual applications.

 The National Probation Service is developing two programmes for domestic violence offenders. One of them will be submitted for accreditation to the Correctional Services Accreditation Panel in October. If it gains accredited status it will be made available nationally, though the timing of implementation is still under consideration. The Panel will also be asked to comment on the other programme but this will require further work before it is ready to be formally submitted for accreditation.

<a name="30702w16.html_para0">Once the domestic violence programmes have been accredited and implemented areas will be able to count them towards the Probation Service Delivery Agreement for programme completion which attracts funding from the National Probation Directorate.

 It is not possible to give a numerical breakdown based on the data received on remands. A number of police forces either do not supply remand data or provide remand data that are incomplete. In particular, the number remanded into custody is believed to be under-recorded. However, the data received can be used to derive estimates of the proportions of male and female remand prisoners who were subsequently either acquitted or sentenced to a non-custodial penalty. The attached table shows figures on this basis for 2001.

 Home Office grant to local victim support schemes and witness services in England and Wales is channelled through the Victim Support National Office. The National Office currently retains some 12&#189; per cent. of the grant for central support and member services, and allocates the rest to local schemes and witness services. From October 2003, Victim Support will allocate the grant progressively according to a new funding formula, based on potential workload. This will ensure a more equitable distribution of the available grant to local schemes and witness services.

 Crime in Belfast city centre, including Fountain Lane, has reduced over the last year. Incidents such as till snatches, and street thefts involving handbag and mobile phone snatches have been reduced by over 60 per cent. in the first three months of 2003 when compared with the same period in 2002.

Since June 2002 a team of officers have been tasked with focusing on street gangs operating in the city centre. To date these officers have made 201 arrests for a variety of offences.

<a name="30702w17.html_para8">CCTV is of considerable assistance to police in the city centre in preventing and detecting crime and CCTV operators have been instrumental in initiating some 149 arrests this year to date for offences ranging from attempted murder to robbery, theft and disorder.

Police officers have met with traders, including those from Fountain Lane, and discussed their concerns with them. Traders in the city centre provided funding for two pedal cycles which are used regularly by officers in the city centre.

 In 1998 the LVF carried out an act of decommissioning and the items were listed. In 2001 PIRA put a quantity of arms, ammunition and explosives, which was regarded as significant, completely beyond use. In 2002 PIRA put a varied and substantial quantity of ammunition, arms and explosive material beyond use and the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning has undertaken to provide an inventory of the arms to the two Governments when its task is completed. Each act has been verified by the IICD in accordance with the

<P>
<a name="30702w18.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Paul Murphy: </B> 
 The table sets out the number of convictions and resulting court disposals in 2000 for the offences of dangerous driving and drink driving. The statistics are based on a principal offence rule, that is, where proceedings involve more than one offence dealt with at the same time, the offence recorded is that for which the greatest penalty is imposed. Where more than one disposal is given for the principal offence, only that disposal which is considered the most severe, is recorded. Thus, while both dangerous driving and drink driving are both punishable by mandatory disqualification under the Road Traffic (NI) Order 1995, the figures reflect that this is often in conjunction with a more severe penalty.

The degree of relief available is in direct proportion to the use of the facility for charitable and broad community purposes. There is no upper limit on the amount of relief available if the relevant criteria are satisfied.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>These systems successfully identified signs decreasing performance in Incapacity Benefit claims processing at Chatham Social Security Office. This was believed to be due to high staff turnover in the last two years resulting in a shortage of experienced staff in the office. Some work was temporarily transferred to Broadstairs office in June 2002 and to Ashford office from November 2002 to enable new staff at Chatham to receive further training.

<P>
<a name="30702w20.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Pond: </B> 
 People are not entitled to jobseeker's allowance if they are engaged in remunerative work of 16 hours or more per week. If a person's hours of work fluctuate then they are averaged over a complete cycle of work. In the case of an offshore worker, any period on shore in the cycle of work is therefore included in the averaging process, whether or not they receive remuneration for that period.
<P>

<a name="30702w20.html_para4">If an offshore worker has no recognisable cycle of work, then a decision maker will establish whether there is a continuing relationship between the worker and their employer. If there is, and the work averages 16 hours or more per week, then the worker continues to be classed as in remunerative work during periods when they are on shore and not physically working or being paid. We have no plans to change this.

 Regional and national advertising including television, radio and press as well as direct mailing will support a systematic take-on approach.

Friend the Member for Salford (Ms Blears), responded, explaining that the Government recognised those concerns, that they were doing everything they could to facilitate submission of dossiers supporting additions to the lists of permitted vitamins and minerals in the Directive and that they continued strongly to make the case for a safety-based approach to be taken in proposals on maximum limits.

<P>
<a name="30702w22.html_spnew11"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 The Government are firmly committed to the view that, in the interests of consumer choice, the law should allow food supplements that are safe and properly labelled to be freely marketed.
<P>

<a name="30702w22.html_para9">The lists of permitted nutrients and nutrient sources in the Food Supplements (England) Regulations 2003 can be extended if additions are made to the permitted lists in the annexes to the Food Supplements Directive 2002/46/EC on which the Regulations are based. These annexes remain open pending safety assessment of additional substances. Industry is currently working to compile safety dossiers for some of the substances currently omitted from the Annexes.
<P>

<a name="30702w22.html_para10">The Food Standards Agency, in recognition of the difficulties associated with dossier production, and the timescale for dossier submission, is pressing the European Food Safety Authority for an urgent, substantive meeting with relevant parties to discuss dossier requirements. This has the support of the European Commission.
<P>

<a name="30702w22.html_para11">Further, the Government's view is that maximum limits for nutrients in food supplements should be based on thorough risk assessments and set at levels which 



<P>
<P><I>2 Jul 2003 : Column 353W</I><P>
protect public health, but which neither unnecessarily limit consumer choice nor unduly restrict trade. The Government continue to take every opportunity to press this view strongly in Brussels and bilaterally with representatives of other European Union member states.
<P>

<a name="30702w22.html_para12">The Government recognise concerns expressed in various quarters over the impact of the Directive on consumer choice and the United Kingdom food supplements industry. However, the UK is obliged to fulfil its obligations, under the EC treaty, to implement the Directive. Not to do so would be a serious breach of those obligations and would result in infraction

 The information requested is available in the Library of the House.
<P>

<a name="30702w24.html_para0">Properties eligible for the 50 per cent. council tax discount, including second homes, benefit from the discount because their liability for council tax is less than it would otherwise be. There is therefore no reason for providing them with financial assistance as a result being eligible for the discount.
<P>

<a name="30702w24.html_para1">The council tax income forgone by a local authority as a result of properties in its area being entitled to the 50 per cent. council tax discount is, however, taken into account when calculating the authority's entitlement to revenue support grant.
<P>

<a name="30702w24.html_para2">The information available in the Library of the House includes estimates of the amounts of council tax income forgone by each billing authority in the current financial year as a result of the 50 per cent. discount. It is not possible to identify how much of these amounts are attributable to second homes. The precise extent to which the income forgone as a result of the 50 per cent. discount is compensated for through revenue support grant could be calculated only at disproportionate cost.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30702w24.html_spnew9"><B> Phil Hope: </B> 
 Under both the standard spending assessment and formula spending share systems, each local authority is compensated for student exemptions from council tax in the calculation of its entitlement to revenue support grant. The calculation does not, however, involve a separate mathematical formula for student exemptions. Student exemptions are, instead, one of several factors affecting the size of a local authority's taxbase, and it is the overall taxbase for the authority that is taken into account in the calculation of revenue support grant.
<P>

<a name="30702w24.html_para9">More specifically, revenue support grant is calculated as the difference between a local authority's standard spending assessment (or formula spending share) and the sum of its share of redistributed business rates and its assumed council tax income, with the reduction in the taxbase due to student exemptions being taken into account in the calculation of the assumed council tax income. The resulting revenue support grant allocations are then constrained so that the like-for-like increase in formula grant over the previous year is neither below the floor nor above the ceiling.
<P>

<a name="30702w24.html_para10">The following table shows how much council tax per head of resident population was foregone by each local authority in Hertfordshire in 2002&#150;03 as a result of student council tax exemptions.

Comparable figures for 2003&#150;04 are not available because the relevant return for 2003&#150;04 did not request information on the distribution across council tax bands of exempt properties. Assuming a similar distribution across bands as 2002&#150;03 gives an average of about &#163;1.70 revenue foregone per head for 2003&#150;04.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30702w25.html_spnew1"><B> Phil Hope </B> 
: It is not possible, at this stage, to make an estimate of the likely costs of re-organisation. This will depend on the number of regions which move to having elected regional assemblies, the precise details of the changes proposed by the Boundary Committee and the preferred option of local electors. At the level of individual authorities, costs and savings will depend partly on decisions taken by the new authorities about the structures they put in place to deliver services and discharge their functions.
