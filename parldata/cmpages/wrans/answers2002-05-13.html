<P>
<P>
<a name="20513w01.html_spnew0"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 English Heritage's statutory duty is to secure the preservation of buildings of historical importance. They advise the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport about historic buildings meriting statutory protection and advise Government and planning authorities about requests for permission to demolish or alter protected buildings. They also give grant aid for the repair of listed buildings.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20513w01.html_spnew1"><B> Tessa Jowell: </B> 
 As I explained to the House in my statement on 7 May I have agreed to the Football Association's request to delay the Government's final decision on support for the national stadium until the current commercial negotiations between the FA and their bankers are concluded. Those discussions continue to make good progress.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what recent discussions she has had with the Department for Education and Skills and the Department for Transport, Local Government and the Regions about conducting a national audit of sport and leisure facilities; and if she will make a statement.  [53974]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20513w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 I discussed the proposed database of sports facilities in England with a number of my ministerial colleagues, including those from the DfES and the DTLR, at the last meeting of the Inter-departmental Group on Sport in February.
<P>

<a name="20513w01.html_para0">I have also written to my ministerial colleagues at the DfES and the DTLR, along with those from the Department of Health, Home Office and the Ministry of Defence, seeking their views on the scope and content of the proposed database of sports facilities in England.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20513w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 Tackling social deprivation is at the heart of the Department's activity. Our work is focusing on four strategic priorities: promoting lifelong learning and social cohesion by opening up institutions to the wider community; enhancing access to a fuller cultural and sporting life for children and young people; maximising the contribution which creative and leisure industries can make to the economy; and modernising delivery, ensuring that our sponsored bodies put the needs of the customer first.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport if she will make a statement on the efforts being made at the grassroots level to increase ethnic minority participation and representation in sport.  [53977]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20513w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 The Government are anxious to ensure that sport is accessible to all members of society, irrespective of age, ability, gender, race, ethnicity, sexuality or socioeconomic status, and remain committed to improving opportunities for those groups which are under-represented in sport, whether as participants, competitors, coaches or administrators.
<P>

<a name="20513w01.html_para1">There are a number of schemes and programmes aimed at those traditionally under-represented in sport; these include Sport England's Active Communities Programme, which targets ethnic minorities as one of its priority groups, and the Sporting Equals Programme, which receives &#163;180,000 a year from the Government and the Commission for Racial Equality towards promoting sporting opportunities for ethnic minorities.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport if she will make a statement on the impact of the Budget on the film industry.  [53978]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20513w01.html_spnew5"><B> Tessa Jowell: </B> 
 It was announced in the Budget that the film tax relief will be restricted to films intended for the commercial cinema only, and that television production will no longer be able to access the relief. The relief was originally intended to help build a sustainable film industry and there has been a general acceptance that this is a necessary refocussing of the relief.

18. <a name="20513w01.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Simon Thomas: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what steps she is taking to ensure choice of access for digital broadcasting services.  [53979]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20513w01.html_spnew6"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The draft Communications Bill and associated documents (Cm 5508, published on 7 May), set out a proposed framework for the regulation of communications, which is intended to broaden choice of and access to modern communications technologies, and to make markets work better.
<P>
<P>
<a name="20513w01.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Levitt: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what definitions of <i>(a)</i> access, <i>(b)</i> availability and <i>(c)</i> affordability the Government will use to determine when analogue switch-off will take place; and if she will make a statement.  [54620]

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20513w01.html_spnew7"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 One of the key tasks of the Digital Television Action Plan is for Government to conduct a comprehensive review of progress towards digital switchover with particular reference to the accessibility, availability and affordability tests announced in September 1999. The Review will refine the tests and report on how progress towards meeting them is to be measured.
<P>
21. <a name="20513w01.html_wqn8"><B> Richard Ottaway: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport how many digital television sets were sold in the last financial year; and if she will make a statement.  [53982]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20513w01.html_spnew8"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 Industry figures indicate that 120,000 integrated digital television sets were sold in the 12 months until the end of March. As part of the Digital Action Plan, the Government will be comprehensively investigating with industry and the European Union the issues surrounding the transition to exclusive sales of integrated digital television sets. Because of our international agreements, the UK alone could not mandate the sale of integrated digital television sets.
<P>
26. <a name="20513w01.html_wqn9"><B>  Mr. Robathan: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what assessment she has made of the impact of digital switchover on the BBC licence fee.  [53987]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20513w01.html_spnew9"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The Government increased the BBC licence fee in 2000 in recognition of the BBC's role in the development of digital broadcasting services. The annual increase is set until 2006 when the charter is due for renewal. The effect of changing media markets on the licence fee will be one of the issues we consider as part of the charter review process.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20513w01.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 We published a safe bet for success on 26 March. This sets out the Government's decisions on the recommendations for reform of the law on gambling which were made by the Gambling Review Body last summer. We took careful account of all the points made in public consultation on the report before reaching our conclusions.

<a name="20513w01.html_spnew11"><B> Tessa Jowell: </B> 
 My Department directly provides support to the Tyne and Wear Museums to the sum of &#163;1 million per year. Resource, the Council for Museums, Libraries and Archives will provide funding to the North East Museum, Libraries and Archives Council to the tune of &#163;745,000 in 2002&#150;03.
<P>

<a name="20513w01.html_para2">Resource has now received bids from each English region, including the North East, to be considered for selection as regional hubs in accordance with the recommendations of the Regional Museums task force as set out in the report Renaissance in the Regions: a new vision for England's museums which was published last

23. <a name="20513w01.html_wqn12"><B> Ross Cranston: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what measures she is taking to promote tourism in the west midlands region.  [53984]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20513w01.html_spnew12"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 My Department is currently considering options on how to provide stronger co-ordination of the promotion and marketing of England, including a strong regional dimension and we hope to announce our plans shortly.
<P>

<a name="20513w01.html_para4">Tourism in the west midlands region has recently benefited from &#163;2 million funding from Advantage West Midlands (AWM) regional development agency (RDA). &#163;1.1 million was spent on a recent national marketing campaign "Head to the Heart", promoted by the Heart of England Tourist Board (HETB), which principle aim is to attract more visitors to the region.

30. <a name="20513w01.html_wqn13"><B> Tony Baldry: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport when she last met representatives from the English Tourism Council to discuss tourism in the south-east.  [53991]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20513w01.html_spnew13"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 I have been in close contact with the chairman of the English Tourism Council about the proposed merger between the south east and southern tourist boards. They also hold regular meetings to discuss issues of national and regional significance, the most recent being on 29 April. The Minister also met Joan Patten, chair of the south east tourist board, on 11 April.
<P>
<P>
<a name="20513w01.html_wqn14"><B> Brian Cotter: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what proportion of Government funding provided to each region is for tourism marketing.  [56023]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20513w01.html_spnew14"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 Over half of the &#163;3.8 million obtained last year from the reserve to assist the domestic recovery of tourism from foot and mouth disease was passed via the English Tourism Council (ETC) to the 10 regional tourist boards (RTBs). Much of that money was used for promotional and PR activities.
<P>

<a name="20513w01.html_para5">Other central Government funding provided to the RTBs via the ETC is for the delivery of the national tourism strategy at regional level&#151;that does not include money for domestic marketing. The RTBs are mainly private companies and use some of their membership fee and commercial income for regional marketing initiatives. In some regions, the Regional Development Agencies have also supported tourism marketing with Government funds and a substantial part of over &#163;90 million spent by local authorities on tourism is also used for promotional activities.

 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and I have remained in close touch with the Nationwide League and the Football Association since it was announced that ITV Digital was to go into administration, and met the league's management on 17 April. The Government will now work with the working group appointed by the FA's chief executive to consider how affected football clubs might be helped to secure their futures.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20513w02.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 Funding from public sources for football is channelled through the Football Foundation. The Foundation's grass roots, community and education, and stadium safety funding programmes are not geographically targeted. They are designed to address lack of provision in England wherever it exists. However, the Foundation has indicated that it considers local levels of economic deprivation, among other issues, in assessing applications for funding.

 This is a matter for the Arts Council of England and the Regional Arts Boards. From 1 April this year the Arts Council is investing an additional &#163;12 million in theatre increasing to &#163;25 million a year from 2003&#150;04, as a result of its extensive review of the needs of regional theatre. Funding for the New Wolsey in Ipswich will increase from &#163;322,750 last year to &#163;492,750 in 2003&#150;04, an increase over two years of 53 per cent.

 A Sport Action Zone manager was appointed in September 2000 and a Needs Assessment and Action Plan was compiled in the first year of the Zone's operation, covering the period 2001&#150;2006. This plan was approved at the Sport Lottery panel in October 2001. Approximately &#163;230,000 per annum was ring- fencing over the five year period across the Allerdale, Barrow and Copeland districts.

 The marketing of hotels is a matter for the industry itself but the announcement today will have a beneficial impacts on all sectors of the industry in England. The English Tourism Council has made considerable progress in extending its quality assurance schemes to all types of accommodation. Hotels and others that commit to the national quality standards benefit since the quality assurance fee entitles them to a free entry in the ETC's 'Where to Stay' guidebooks and entry on the BTA's VisitBritain website.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20513w02.html_spnew8"><B> Dr. Howells </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 9 May 2002]:</i> The provision for the Government Indemnity Scheme is made by the National Heritage Act 1980. The scheme facilitates public access to loans of works of art and other objects for public display made to museums, galleries and other such institutions by private owners and non-national institutions. It does this by indemnifying lenders against loss or damage to their loan. Loans covered by the scheme must be for public benefit. The scheme also covers loans of such objects for study purposes within borrowing institutions where this would contribute materially to the public's understanding or appreciation of the loan. Examples of this are enhancing interpretation or explanation to the public of objects or bringing into the public domain, the conclusions of any study.
<P>

<a name="20513w02.html_para3">In the six-month period ended 31 March, the following undertakings to indemnify were given under section 16 by the relevant Departments for objects on loan to national and non-national institutions:

 The total area to be grown with GM crops in the farm scale evaluations in England to date is approximately 400 hectares. In autumn 2001, 30 oilseed rape sites were sown. This year, there are 22 spring oilseed rape sites, 33 maize sites, six fodder beet sites and 12 sugar beet sites.

Businesses have an opportunity to plan on the basis of the proposals and analysis in the consultation exercise carried out in the previous year.

 We have no plans to allow local authorities to count domestic composting towards their recycling targets.
<P>

<a name="20513w04.html_para2">Local authorities benefit in two main ways from home composting. First, they save on the costs associated with collecting, transporting and composting this waste. Secondly, it increases their recycling rate because the home composted waste is not included in the calculation for the total amount of waste collected. This has the effect of increasing the percentage of household waste sent for recycling.
<P>

<a name="20513w04.html_para3">There are also real difficulties with the measurement of home composting. Accurate reporting against the statutory performance standards is essential if we are to ensure real efforts are made by local authorities to increase recycling and composting.

 The UK is on course to meet, and go beyond, its target under the Kyoto Protocol to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 12.5 per cent. below 1990 levels by 2008&#150;12. This target covers a basket of six greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulphur hexafluoride); the UK does not have targets under the Kyoto Protocol for the individual gases.

<a name="20513w04.html_para4">UK emissions of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) in 1995&#151;the base year chosen for measuring emissions of these gases for the Kyoto Protocol&#151;were equivalent to 4.1 MtC, contributing about 2 per cent. of the total greenhouse gas emissions in that year.

<a name="20513w04.html_para5">Action to reduce fugitive emissions of HFC-23 from HCFC-22 manufacturing plants have meant that total emissions of HFCs have fallen significantly since then. This will be partly offset by an increase in emissions from end use markets such as aerosols, refrigeration and foam blowing as consumption of HFCs increases in response to the phase out of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) under the Montreal Protocol. However, reduced levels of leakage and increased use of alternative fluids are expected to limit the increase in emissions.
<P>

<a name="20513w04.html_para6">Overall, annual emissions of HFCs are projected to be equivalent to 2.9 MtC in 2010, a fall of 29 per cent. from 1995 levels. The expected reductions in emissions of the other five greenhouse gases covered by the Kyoto Protocol mean that the relative contribution of HFCs emissions in 2010 is projected to be the same as in 1995, at about 2 per cent. of the total UK greenhouse gas emissions.

The oldest commissioned ship which is still afloat is HMS Fearless which was brought into service in November 1965 and is due to be de-commissioned on 31 October 2002.

 The Defence Logistics Organisation (DLO) was formed on 3 April 2000. The first year of operation (2000&#150;01) was managed under a cash regime. 2001&#150;02 was managed under the new resource accounting system for the first time but the final outturn will not be available until the end of October 2002 which is when the National Audit Office is expected to have completed the audit of the departmental accounts. Operating costs have therefore been provided on a cash basis for consistency as follows:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Financial year 2000&#150;01 final outturn: &#163;5.798 billion

Financial year 2001&#150;02 AP 12: &#163;6.371 billion.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="20513w06.html_para0">Under a cash accounting regime, operating costs include expenditure on capital projects and running costs. The outturn for 2000&#150;01 included a transfer of some &#163;600 million from the Defence Procurement Agency to the DLO following the transfer of responsibility for the management of in-service support costs. Financial year 



<P>
<P><I>13 May 2002 : Column 429W</I><P>
2001&#150;02 included a transfer of an additional &#163;400 million for in-service support, taking the annual total transfer of in-service support costs into the DLO to around &#163;1 billion.
<P>

<a name="20513w06.html_para1">Financial year 2002&#150;03 has only just started and under the new resource accounting regime the DLO has not been given a cash control total equivalent target.

<a name="20513w06.html_para2">No abatement is made for subsequent recoveries. The figures, which relate entirely to the resource estimates formerly ascribed as Vote 1 attribution, are a combination of suspected and proven frauds and theft with estimated values refined from time to time as investigations, sometimes lasting a year or more, reach a conclusion. A significant element of estimated cost or value can relate to 'at risk' estimates applied to suspected procurement cases, the majority of which have a proven value lower than original estimates with a significant number of cases resolved as 'no crime'.

 <i>[holding answer 7 May 2002]:</i> We consider that a satisfactory standard of treatment is provided to Service personnel by the NHS and private healthcare providers. The majority of Service patients treated in NHS hospitals are admitted to Ministry of Defence Hospital Units whose host NHS trusts are set targets by the Defence Secondary Care Agency, reflecting its own Key Targets for both in-patient and out-patient waiting times. Overall performance against the key targets is published in the Agency's Annual Report, which is laid before Parliament. The contracts with the NHS trusts are monitored for cost effectiveness. Some Service personnel receive treatment at other NHS hospital trusts with whom 



<P>
<P><I>13 May 2002 : Column 430W</I><P>
we have no contractual agreements, where this is more appropriate for them. As entitled patients, they receive such treatment free of charge. Limited use is made of private healthcare providers to enable Service personnel to be treated and returned to deployability more quickly, where this is considered cost effective.

However, estimates of the contribution from 'Tourism' have been supplied by the Department of Culture, Media and Sport, defined from the activities of tourists rather than by the conventional industry classification.

No sub-UK breakdowns of subsidies or compensation payments consistent with these data are currently available.
<BR>
Data on subsidies for the whole of the UK are available by industrial sector up to 1999, as outlined in the release 'United Kingdom Input-Output Analysis 2001', but National Accounting conventions limit these to include subsidies on production only, excluding subsidies on product. Using these National Accounts definitions, the 'Agriculture, hunting, forestry and fishing' industry received &#163;370m subsidies on production in 1999 across the UK, while the 'Manufacturing' industry received none (and, as before 'Tourism' is not classed as an industry under the Standard Industrial Classification).
<BR>
Separately, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs publication 'Agriculture in the United Kingdom 2001' shows that subsidies on product for that industry for the UK totalled &#163;2,405m in 1999 and &#163;1,943m in 2001. No estimates on subsidies on product are available for the Manufacturing industry. No estimates on Tourism as an industry are available from any source, though the Department for Culture, Media and Sport made a statement recently about Government support for tourism, which I enclose.
<BR>
The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs publication also shows a breakdown by country for these data on agricultural subsidies. The latest report was published on 3rd May 2002, and is available through their web site at http:// www.defra.gov.uk or through the House of Commons library.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20513w08.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 London Underground is responsible for development of the PPP plans for the modernisation of the underground's infrastructure. I understand that when London Underground was restructured into an operating company and three infrastructure companies in April 2000, that restructuring was effected by an asset transfer scheme. It is correct to say that the requirement of "minimum ambiguity" as to the responsibility for asset maintenance within the underground has been a guiding principle for the development of the PPP Service Contracts with the infrastructure companies following the asset transfer scheme. During the period of shadow running since April 2000 there has been considerable work carried out to develop detailed asset information, with clear allocation principles to be incorporated in the contract documents, the application of which will enable responsibility for maintenance and renewal of underground assets to be determined.

<P>
<a name="20513w12.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 My right hon. the Foreign Secretary is in constant contact with his US and European counterparts about the middle east peace process. He also has regular contact with the UN Secretary General and the parties. These discussions cover the full range of issues including the role of the international community in helping Israel and the Palestinian Authority achieve a ceasefire and the resumption of negotiations.
<P>

<a name="20513w12.html_para5">There is broad international consensus that an international peacekeeping operation cannot work without the agreement of both parties; a ceasefire to maintain; and a parallel political process. These do not now exist, so the immediate priority must be to help rebuild confidence and create such conditions for progress.

We view any report of actual or proposed transfers of weapons or weapons-related materials to Iraq&#151;by any country&#151;with serious concern. We have no doubt about Iraq's desire to acquire sophisticated weapons systems. We have expressed our concern about the October 2001 reports to the Belarusian Government and raised our concerns at the United Nations Iraq Sanctions Committee. We made clear in both instances our expectation that the Belarusian Government will continue to take all possible steps to ensure that arms sales and other transactions that violate UN Security Council resolutions will not take place.

<P>
<a name="20513w14.html_spnew3"><B> Peter Hain: </B> 
 To answer this question would incur disproportionate cost. It would be necessary to identify and review every case in the European Court of Justice between the European Commission and Spain, since Spain's accession to the EU in 1986, to ascertain whether a breach of EU law was found, and consider whether the judgment had any affect on Gibraltar's law. The judgments of the European Court of Justice are published in Reports of Cases before the Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance, which can be found in the House of Commons Library.
<P>

<a name="20513w14.html_para0">Any judgment of the ECJ against a member state potentially has implications for the law of another member state. The UK Government look to the Commission to ensure that all EU member states, including Spain, abide by their EU obligations.

<a name="20513w14.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Chaytor: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry for each of the last five years, how much financial support and what percentage of the whole allocation her Department allocated for research and development as sources of energy of <i>(a)</i> wind, <i>(b)</i> wave, <i>(c)</i> biomass, <i>(d)</i> solar, <i>(e)</i> hydrogen, <i>(f)</i> nuclear, <i>(g)</i> coal and <i>(h)</i> gas; and in each case what percentage this represented of the whole sum spent on such matters by her.  [53825]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20513w14.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 Over the last five years, the Department of Trade and Industry has spent the following amounts on energy research and development, covering renewables 



<P>
<P><I>13 May 2002 : Column 460W</I><P>
(including wind, wave, biomass, solar and hydrogen); nuclear (where DTI spending has been confined to research on fusion); coal; and oil and gas. The table gives the percentages spent in each of these categories.
<P>

<a name="20513w14.html_para1">The DTI supports research and development on sustainable energy technologies both through its Sustainable Energy Programme and through the Research Councils. Over the last five years, expenditure through the programme on wind energy has been in the range &#163;1.2 million to &#163;1.7 million per year; on wave energy, in the range &#163;0 to &#163;0.9 million per year; on biomass, in the range &#163;1.8 million to &#163;2.2 million per year; on solar, in the range &#163;1.4 to &#163;2 million per year; and on fuel cells (including some expenditure on hydrogen), in the range &#163;1.2 million to &#163;1.8 million per year. Relevant work supported through the Research Councils would be additional to these figures. The Sustainable Energy Programme also supports cross-technology work in the areas of technology transfer, export promotion and policy support.
<P>

<a name="20513w14.html_para2">Provision for research and development through the Sustainable Energy Programme increases to &#163;19 million for 2002&#150;03 and through the Research Councils to &#163;5.6 million. Additionally, the DTI has been assigned a further &#163;5 million over three years for wave and tidal demonstration projects and a further &#163;4 million for net metering, storage and control demonstration projects.
<P>

<a name="20513w14.html_para3">The Government have also set up capital grants programmes in the following areas to bring forward new renewable energy technologies:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>&#163;74 million for offshore wind (including &#163;10 million from the New Opportunities Fund);
<P>
<BR>
&#163;69 million for bioenergy (including &#163;36 million from the New Opportunities Fund and &#163;3 million for biomass heating);
<P>
<BR>
&#163;20 million for photovoltaics (PV).
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="20513w14.html_para4">The R and D and capital grants programmes supplement the substantial boost for renewable energy being provided by the Renewables Obligation. Estimated maximum payments available under the Renewables Obligation for England and Wales and the corresponding Renewables Obligation (Scotland) for 2002&#150;03 are &#163;282 million. The level of the Obligation is set to rise each year to 2010&#150;11, when maximum payments for the year are estimated to reach &#163;1 billion.

 The proposed Electricity Safety, Quality and Continuity Regulations will replace the existing Electricity Supply Regulations 1988 (as amended). The main objective of the proposed Regulations is to improve safety standards in the new electricity market while preserving important public safety, power quality and supply continuity requirements in the existing Regulations. The draft Regulations will be finalised shortly following the public consultation exercise carried out last year and further discussions with interested parties since then. Allowing time for the approval process and publication of detailed Guidance Notes 12 weeks in advance of the introduction of regulations in accordance with Government guidelines, it is anticipated the new regulations will commence in November 2002.
<P>

<a name="20513w16.html_para4">In addition to the Guidance Notes, the Government's response to the comments received during the public consultation exercise will be published in due course.

 I have requested a study into the resilience of the electricity supply networks in an emergency, in order to obtain reassurance that we have the best possible systems in place to avoid or minimise supply failure, together with examples of good practice in emergency preparedness. Our consultants, British Power International (BPI), visited all the electricity transmission and distribution licence-holding companies in mainland Britain during March, and will be reporting shortly.
<P>

<a name="20513w16.html_para5">DTI's Engineering Inspectorate has been dealing with a small number of cases in which consumers in rural areas are complaining about frequent interruptions to their electricity supply, and Ofgem has taken important steps to strengthen the incentives on distribution companies to provide a good quality of service to consumers. From 1 April 2002 a new Guaranteed Standard of Performance was introduced which will mean that consumers that suffer more than three interruptions of more than three hours duration over the course of the year will receive a compensation payment of &#163;50. This protection is directly aimed at 'worst-served' consumers. Ofgem has also introduced an incentive scheme for distribution companies that focuses on key areas quality of service&#151;the number of interruptions to supply, the duration of interruptions to supply and the quality of telephone response provided by distribution companies. Taken together these mechanisms provide significant additional protection to consumers in respect of the quality of service they receive from distribution companies.
<P>

<a name="20513w16.html_para6">The introduction of widespread distributed generation in electricity networks will certainly raise some technical issues not previously faced by electricity distributors. Close monitoring of developments in embedded generation is necessary by all those involved to ensure the emerging security of supply issues are identified and managed. Following on from the report of the joint DTI-Ofgem Embedded Generation Working Group (EGWG) in June 2001 www.dti.gov.uk/energy/egwg/ index.htm, the Government has recently established a Co-ordinating Group, jointly led by the DTI and Ofgem, to monitor the implementation of the EGWG recommendations and to advise Ministers of potential problems.

When fully commissioned, the new centre will replace the phase 1 facility. Planning the phase 2 project is at a very early stage. It is estimated to take about four to five years to complete the project. It is not possible to give an accurate estimated cost, but based on similar facilities, it is anticipated that the cost should be in the region of &#163;12 million to &#163;15 million. In keeping with Government policy, we will be examining various procurement methods including PFI/PPP.

 Mr. Brown has been offered a range of offending behaviour work and non offence-related courses, including for example, anger management, reasoning and rehabilitation and a pre-release course. He has declined most of these but this should not inhibit him from progressing towards his release. In addition, he has been offered the opportunity for escorted town visits to aid his reintegration into the community but has declined to participate. He has also been encouraged to engage in the sentence planning process and has been assisted to address his use of drugs in prison successfully. His suitability for transfer to a resettlement regime in an open prison will shortly be considered by the parole board.

 The National Asylum Support Service (NASS) does not keep central statistics in respect of the number and total value of single additional payments it makes to supported asylum seekers.
<P>

<a name="20513w18.html_para8">Payment of a single additional payment (SAP) is achieved by increasing one of the regular weekly subsistence payments by the required &#163;50. The value of all regular weekly payments is stored within each individual's computer record, together with associated explanation. NASS can, therefore, confirm the payment of a SAP to an individual and could ultimately obtain the requested statistics, but the cost in doing so would be disproportionate.

 From 2 July 2001 we replaced the exceptional hardship and exceptional circumstances schemes with improved arrangements that are broader in scope than the old regulatory provisions. Subject to certain conditions, local authorities are now able to give additional payments to any person whose housing benefit or council tax benefit is restricted where they are satisfied the person is in need of further financial assistance with housing costs or council tax liability. Unlike the old scheme there are no prescribed definitions of either "exceptional hardship" or "exceptional circumstances". The new measures give local authorities and incentive to direct funds to helping those people most in need.

 The Government has sought to improve the efficiency of further education since 1997 and colleges have delivered real improvements in value for money. Since 1996&#150;97 the participation funding for each full-time equivalent (FTE) student has remained constant in real terms, while total funding for each FTE student has increased by 12 per cent. in real terms (reflecting the additional funds targeted on much needed capital developments, standards and teachers pay). Over the same period colleges have widened participation among learners, broadened programmes of study for 16&#150;19- year-olds and increased basic skills provision. Qualification success rates for long (24 weeks or over) qualifications have increased from 51 per cent. in 1996&#150;97 to 56 per cent. in 1999&#150;2000 (the latest year available). When shorter courses are also taken into account, qualification success rates have increased from 56 per cent. in 1996&#150;97 to 60 per cent. in 1999&#150;2000. The Government recognises that investment is important for raising standards further and will set out future funding plans for colleges as part of the Spending Review outcome.

 <i>[holding answer 29 April 2002]:</i> The investments we are making via the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) to support both school sixth forms and further education colleges should ensure that staff receive appropriate salary increases this year. The real terms guarantee (RTG) for schools with sixth forms means that their funding will be protected at least at 2000&#150;01 levels, providing pupil numbers are maintained. Indeed in 2002&#150;03 around two thirds of sixth forms will benefit with higher funding from the LSC's formula funding and the remaining third will be funded at their RTG level.

 Teachers in maintained schools are subject to national school teachers' pay and conditions. Further education sector colleges are run by independent corporations established under the Further Education and Higher Education Act 1992 and there is no national pay structure in place. Colleges are free to establish pay scales that meet their needs and can be agreed with their staff. This Government have acknowledged the historic funding gap between schools and FE and we have pledged to bring up levels of funding and ensure upward convergence over time. The Teaching Pay Initiative (TPI) budget is &#163;311 million over the period 2001&#150;04. This is to reward excellent teaching and is over and above any general pay rise. The additional investment we are making in the FE sector should help support the pay aspirations of their staff.

 In 1999&#150;2000 the Government made available &#163;35 million in England for higher education capital funding. In the succeeding years, the amounts made available were &#163;50 million, &#163;100 million, &#163;145 million, and in 2003&#150;04 &#163;194 million, to support the teaching infrastructure, modernise and improve the estates and build new medical schools. Of this, &#163;56 million over two years to 2003&#150;04 is to help institutions meet the cost of the statutory changes relating to the access parts of the Special Educational Needs and Disability Act 2001.
<P>

<a name="20513w22.html_para0">To this, the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) adds funding which it finds from its own resources to promote capital investment, often with contributions from others.

Publicly planned funding for higher education in England in 2001&#150;02 is &#163;396 million more than in 2000&#150;01, so that for the first time in over a decade funding per student will rise in real terms, and further expansion of student places will be fully funded in the following two years.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what recent representations she has received in respect of new vocational qualifications in engineering; if she will make it her policy to extend funding approval for existing qualifications pending further consultation on the curriculum design of the new qualifications; and if she will make a statement.  [53827]<P>

<P>
<a name="20513w22.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 I have received representations from the National Forum for Engineering in Colleges. I am aware of the importance of existing qualifications to the continued running of Modern Apprenticeships and have consequently asked the Learning and Skills Council to identify which are essential until new accredited qualifications can replace them. The LSC is working closely with relevant sector bodies, including EMTA for engineering, to that end. Once the qualifications are identified and following consultation with the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority, I will take action to approve them. Outside the Modern Apprenticeship context, approvals will be limited to qualifications accredited by the QCA. Persons over 19 should have no problem in accessing existing courses, as LSC funding for them is not dependent on there being an approved qualification.

 The Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA) is monitoring all new AVCE qualifications, including engineering, as part of its remit to review the performance of the awarding bodies in delivering qualifications. AVCE courses give students suitable opportunities to achieve grades to enable them to follow their chosen career paths, including progression to employment, higher education or further training such as modern apprenticeships.
<P>

<a name="20513w22.html_para6">QCA's work in monitoring the work of awarding bodies includes ensuring that qualifications are suitable for purpose and that students have the opportunity to achieve grades which reflect their achievement.
<P>

<a name="20513w22.html_para7">The Secretary of State has not had discussions with the Chief Inspector on the subject in question. However, Ofsted Inspectors have programme of visits and inspections of schools and colleges to enable them to inspect standards. QCA held a two-day conference for awarding body chief examiners in November 2001.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills if she will make a statement on the recent Ofsted report on ICT in schools.  [54890]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20513w23.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 We welcome the report, it shows that National Grid for Learning (NGfL) and New Opportunities Fund (NOF) initiatives along with sustained standards fund spending is making a real impact on both standards of teaching and the willingness of teachers to embrace ICT. We particularly welcome the report's confirmation that Government funding of ICT resources through the NGfL continues to make an important contribution to the development of the ICT curriculum and the use of new technologies in schools, and the recognition that this is beginning to impact on teaching and learning.
<P>

<a name="20513w23.html_para2">The report acknowledges that the existence of the NOF programme has raised the profile of ICT training in many schools and it has helped teachers to improve their ICT skills significantly. However, we recognise that the report also raises concerns that this has not had as widespread an effect on classroom practice as intended, or as might reasonably be expected at this stage of the programme. We will be working with NOF and the Teacher Training Agency to ensure that the concerns are addressed and that we establish the most effective support for teachers who are crucial to the successful implementation of the overall programme. We also note, however, that the report recognises the excellent take up of this training and we look forward to increased evidence of impact as more schools complete their training.
<P>

<a name="20513w23.html_para3">The report highlights personal access as one of the strongest influences toward successful training and classroom usage. We have provided over 50,000 teachers with PCs through various Government initiatives over the past few years, of which around 32,000 have been supplied via the Computers for Teachers Scheme. The current &#163;100 million Laptops for Teachers scheme will supply a further 100,000 teachers with computers from September 2002. Our Curriculum Online project will enable online access to digital learning materials that are easily accessible to teachers and which they can use to support the teaching across the curriculum.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. Specialist schools receive a one-off grant of &#163;100,000 in their first year of designation for a capital project to support their specialist schools development plan. This matches the minimum &#163;50,000 sponsorship which they are required to raise from the private sector when they apply for specialist school designation.<P>

2. In addition, an annual grant is available for the four years of specialist school designation to support the costs of implementing the development plan. Assuming schools are successful in meeting the targets they set out in their initial application they can apply for re-designation for a further three years.<P>

3. The annual grant is currently calculated at a rate of &#163;123 per pupil up to 1,000 and over 1,200 pupils (special schools designated as specialist schools are funded at five times this rate). Funding in 1998&#150;99 was calculated at the rate of &#163;100 per pupil up to 1,000 pupils and this was increased to &#163;120 per pupil in September 1999 to allow schools to develop the community element of their development plans. A further rise of &#163;3 per pupil was implemented in September 2000.<P>

4. The 2002&#150;03 figures do not include schools that are currently being considered in the March 2002 competition. <P>

 It is the responsibility of primary care trusts and NHS trusts to identify their own need for locum doctors in the primary and secondary care sectors respectively. It is accepted that locum doctors are an essential part of the NHS workforce.
<P>

<a name="20513w25.html_para1">However, the focus of our plans to increase the size of the medical workforce is to increase the number of permanent doctors. Following the spending review settlement announced by the Chancellor in the Budget we have committed ourselves in "Delivering the NHS Plan" to increasing the medical workforce by at least 15,000 more consultants and GPs by 2008. This is on top of the 9,550 increase in doctors in the NHS since 1997.

<a name="20513w25.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The Dental Auxiliaries Regulations 1986 need to be amended by affirmative resolution to permit dental therapists to work in all fields of dentistry. We have now laid amending regulations before Parliament and they are to be debated during May. A much wider range of employment opportunities will become available to dental therapists once the restriction is removed which will make careers in dental therapy more attractive. In planning training commissions in the future we would expect workforce development confederations to take account of the contribution that dental therapists can make to dental services.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will make a statement on the reasons why some NHS trusts listed in the answer of 18 April 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, column 1185W, on speech therapists, are omitted from the list of NHS trusts deposited in the Library following the answer of 2 May 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, column 991W.

<a name="20513w25.html_para4">The vacancy rates for Royal Free Hampstead NHS trust and Tower Hamlets Healthcare NHS trust were not included because of doubts about data quality. Both trusts recently indicated that their vacancies as at 31 March 2001 were considerably lower than they had originally reported to the Department. Rates for a number of other trusts are not given where the sum of staff in post and vacancies is less than 10.

 Costs associated with regulatory proposals are considered at the policy development stage. A regulatory impact assessment (RIA) is completed for regulatory proposals unless there are no or negligible costs, and sets out the impact, in terms of costs, benefits and risks of the proposed regulation which could affect businesses, charities or the voluntary sector. RIAs are available from the Library.
