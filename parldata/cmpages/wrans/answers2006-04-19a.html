 Local authorities and approved inspectors have a general duty under the Building Act to check that persons carrying out building work comply with the Building Regulations. Building Control Performance Standards set out recommended standards and guidance for the performance of building control that all Building Control Bodies should adopt. Beyond this there are no plans to introduce an additional national quality control system under Part L of the Building Regulations.

 There are no general building targets. However, house building targets for each local authority are set out in regional spatial strategies (formerly Regional Planning Guidance).

<a name="60419w01.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_3">Erosion risk will vary around the coastline depending on local conditions and defences in place. Defra has encouraged the relevant authorities to produce Shoreline Management Plans (SMPs) which provide large-scale assessments of the risks associated with coastal processes and present long term policy frameworks to manage these risks in a sustainable manner. In 2001 Defra funded a national study of information on long term coastal processes and evolution over the next century (Futurecoast). This is designed to be used by coastal authorities to inform their current revisions of SMPs. The Office of Science and Technology&#039;s Foresight Future Flooding report, published in 2004, used Futurecoast and other information to consider possible rates of coastal erosion for the whole country under different scenarios over the next 80 years.

<p><a name="st_7"><a name="60419w01.html_spnew7"><b> Yvette Cooper: </b> 
 Individual estate agents, as with other advisers to the public on home buying and selling, should consider what action they need to take to remain competitive in the new market environment which will follow from the introduction of home information packs on 1 June 2007.

 I refer to my statement of 7 April 2006 which gives details of a dry-run prior to introducing home information packs on 1 June 2007. HIP providers are currently marketing the packs, and to date 45 organisations in England and Wales have provided 2,500 packs on a voluntary basis. This number will grow significantly during stage 2 of the dry-run from October 2006 when packs will be marketed with home condition reports produced by certified inspectors.

<a name="60419w01.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_5">Rent forms part of the HRA, along with various allowances for expenditure (management, maintenance, major repairs allowance, debt charges etc). Some authorities are in deficit and we are providing net subsidy of around &#163;200 million in 2005&#150;06, with similar amounts forecast for future years.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60419w01.html_para7">
<a name="stpa_6">Where an authority has an assumed surplus (negative subsidy) transfers are made to the ODPM according to calculations and assumptions made independently of the actual rents an authority charges. These transfers are recycled through the subsidy system and paid to authorities with an assumed deficit. None of the transfers are used for &#039;other purposes&#039;.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60419w01.html_para8">
<a name="stpa_7">Prior to 2004&#150;05, net subsidy entitlement was calculated differently. Housing element requirements were calculated similarly to the current HRA subsidy, but then added to the rent rebate element which was then accounted for in the HRA. Where the housing element was a negative amount, it was deducted from the rent rebate subsidy entitlement, and any net subsidy requirement was met by the Exchequer.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60419w01.html_para9">
<a name="stpa_8">In some cases, where surpluses remained after the two subsidy streams had been reconciled, the balance would be transferred to that authority&#039;s own general fund and lost to housing. No data were routinely collected to show the amounts transferred.

 The British Government supports peace building and reconciliation in Sri Lanka through a variety of programmes and activities. Its peace building and Reconciliation Strategy aims to describe the activities needed to establish the conditions necessary to sustain peace in Sri Lanka. It supports and complements the Norwegian facilitation between the Government of Sri Lanka and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). The Strategy is agreed across the three Government Departments involved in the Global Conflict Prevention Pool and informs decisions on dispersing funds from that pool in Sri Lanka.

<a name="stpa_30">Our programme includes support for UNICEF, OXFAM and Save the Children Fund, we are working to improve the access and quality of basic health and education services for communities in conflict affected districts. The goal is to ensure that these services are provided equitably across Sri Lanka, thus addressing one long held grievance, and to help return communities to normal peacetime conditions. Under these programmes 75,000 emergency education kits have been provided to schools in the North and East, student drop out rates have reduced by 50 per cent. and over 1,800 child soldiers have been returned to their families. Psychosocial care is provided to these and other children affected by the conflict. Measles, Polio and DPT (Diphtheria-polio-tetanus immunization) vaccination has been provided for all children in conflict affected areas and vitamin supplements to 90 per cent. of children. Some 88 per cent. of pregnant and lactating women now receive ante-natal care and nutrition supplements.

This has helped encourage some 500,000 conflict displaced people to return to their homes. Their return has been supported with grants of material and tools to rebuild homes and restart their livelihoods.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60419w05.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_32">We are also working with NGOs and civil society groups to reduce tensions within communities and to promote their resolution without resort to violence, including the implementation of an early warning mechanism to mitigate and prevent conflict in the east of Sri Lanka. To help these communities enjoy a more secure environment within which to pursue their livelihoods, we are working with the police and the security services to improve their awareness of human rights and adherence to international humanitarian law. Under the strategy, we also assist the Sri Lankan Human Rights Commission to provide increased access to justice for disadvantaged groups. Through the Asia Foundation, we are helping to strengthen legal institutions and processes at a local and national level by improving language skills for court staff, improving paralegal and advocacy skills for community based organisations and funding research into discrimination.

 It is not the policy of the Ministry of Defence to advise service personnel requiring medical treatment following active service in Iraq to attend NHS hospital A and E departments for treatment. The Defence Medical Services (DMS) manages the medical treatment pathways for all members of the UK armed forces, both regulars and mobilised reservists, who require medical treatment as a result of active service and makes all the necessary arrangements to ensure that it is delivered. There are of course other occasions where service personnel resident in the United Kingdom will present to A and E departments for emergency treatment of injuries and illnesses; service personnel are entitled to NHS care, including emergency care, and this is set out in the Department of Health&#039;s Establishing the Responsible Commissioner document.

<p>
<a name="60419w06.html_para0">

Service personnel with moderate/minor musculoskeletal injuries who have been assessed and have a working diagnosis and a planned care pathway are referred to one of our 12 Regional Rehabilitation Units, while those with more complex rehabilitation needs are referred to the Defence Medical Rehabilitation Centre (DMRC) at Headley Court.

The World Bank has made good progress on this work and will present proposals for its component of the framework to the Development Committee at the spring meetings in Washington D.C. this month.

Concessional financing from donors, including the UK, will play an important role in the framework.

The Electoral Administration Bill currently before Parliament includes a new duty on electoral registration officers to take all necessary steps to ensure comprehensive registers.

 I have received numerous representations in response to the Foyer Federation&#039;s &#039;Give us a chance&#039; campaign. I have also received other correspondence and parliamentary questions about the 16 hour rule. In addition, I have accepted an invitation from the joint chairs of the all parliamentary group on foyers and on youth affairs to attend a meeting to discuss the 16 hour housing benefit rule. This provides both an opportunity to listen and advise what work is already in progress to identify how DWP and Jobcentre Plus can positively support people to study in order to improve their current educational attainment, leading to enhanced employment and career prospects.

<a name="stpa_121">Work to review the interaction between study rules and benefits is ongoing. One of the outcomes of the recent Social Exclusion report &quot;Review of Financial Support, Supporting Young People to Achieve&quot; is that from April 2006, if someone is in non-advanced education when they turn 19 they can continue to receive certain benefits, including income support, and therefore housing benefit, and education maintenance allowance until they have completed their current course of study or reach age 20.

<a name="stpa_122">This is clearly an improvement on the previous situation, but it is likely that there will still be some young people who have had to abandon their attempts to catch up on learning because they reach 20 before they have finished their course. Because of this, the Government are committed to keeping this new age limit under review. Additionally, we recognise that for some a different approach may be needed.

 Individuals entering the UK from abroad who require a National Insurance Number, must attend Jobcentre Plus for an Evidence of Identity interview. The interviewing process is primarily designed to guard against Identity fraud. If Jobcentre Plus becomes aware of immigration or right to work irregularities, it advises the Home Office Immigration and Nationality Directorate of this so that appropriate action can be taken. The number of cases referred to the Immigration and Nationality Directorate as &#039;potential immigration offenders&#039; between 1 April 2005 and 28 February 2006 is 1,712.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health what average time it has taken for an application for <i>(a)</i> a new and <i>(b)</i> a variation of a medicine to be approved by the Medicines and Health Products Regulatory Agency.  [49842]</p>




<p><a name="st_216"><a name="60419w24.html_spnew4"><b> Jane Kennedy: </b> 
 The most recent full-year figures for new medicines approval times by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) are for 2004&#150;05. These show an average approval time, from receipt of the application to grant of the licence, of 288 calendar days. This period however includes the time taken by applicants to supply any necessary new or correcting information following the initial assessment of their application. When this is taken into account the actual number of net working days taken by the MHRA reduces to an average of 122 days.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60419w24.html_para11">
<a name="stpa_168">For the relatively small number of completely new medicines, for example those containing new drugs and with the potential for meeting unmet medical needs in major diseases, the MHRA, during the same period, has maintained its record of assessing these in under 40 days.
</p>

<a name="60419w24.html_para12">
<a name="stpa_169">For all types of variations to product licences, whether straightforward or complex, and again in the most recent full year for which figures are available, 2004&#150;05, the average time taken to approve, from receipt of the application to grant of the variation, was 67 calendar days. This includes time taken waiting for the company to provide any further information needed.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60419w24.html_para13">
<a name="stpa_170">More recent figures show a lengthening of assessment and approval times. For example, for the first seven months of 2005&#150;06 (April to October) the approval time for new product licences had increased to 153 net working days or 404 gross calendar days.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60419w24.html_para14">
<a name="stpa_171">These exceed the MHRA&#039;s assessment and approval target times and it is well aware of the impact this is having on pharmaceutical company business. This lengthening of assessment and approval times has been caused by a combination of adverse factors including increases in workload, difficulties in recruiting professional assessment staff, especially medically-qualified staff, and transitional implementation problems during the introduction of a new information management system.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60419w24.html_para15">
<a name="stpa_172">The MHRA is taking a number of steps to improve service levels. These include organisational restructuring, additional recruitment, re-training of staff, voluntary schemes for extended working hours, and information system performance enhancements.

 The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) approves new medicines for marketing in the United Kingdom and is required to follow procedures set out in European legislation.

 The teenage pregnancy strategy aims to help young people delay early sex through improved sex and relationships education and support for parents in discussing relationship and sexual health issues with their children.

Notes:<br>

1. Figures for 1997&#150;98 to 2001&#150;02 have been prepared using gross expenditure figures. Figures for 2002&#150;03 and 2003&#150;04 have been adjusted to eliminate expenditure which would be double counted where an authority acts as a lead in commissioning healthcare or other services.<br>

2. The significant decrease in expenditure in 2004&#150;05 is because student grants unit expenditure by the Cumbria and Lancashire SHA (&#163;369 million was included in the authority&#039;s accounts in 2003&#150;04) was transferred to the NHS Pensions Agency in 2004&#150;05.<br>

3. Data is shown from 1997&#150;98 to 2004&#150;05, which is the latest year for which information is available.<br>

4. Expenditure is taken as the total expenditure of the strategic health authority, predecessor health authorities and PCTs within the SHA area.<br>

5. Expenditure on general dental services and pharmaceutical services accounted for by the Dental Practice Board and Prescription Pricing Authority, respectively, are excluded. This expenditure cannot be included within the figures for the individual health bodies as they are not included in commissioner accounts.<br>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health which organisations in the field of reproductive health are funded by her Department; how much her Department plans to give to each organisation in the next two years; whether account is taken of an organisation&#039;s position on abortion when allocating public funds; and if she will make a statement.

 The Department funds the Family Planning Association and Brook. The Department will confirm their funding for the next two financial years shortly.
