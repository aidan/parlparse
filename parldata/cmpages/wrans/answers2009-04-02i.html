<i> [holding answer 31 March 2009]:</i> We have received reports that First Nation groups are concerned that contamination and water drainage associated with extracting oil from the oil sands could damage the Athabasca/Peace River area. First Nations also dispute, in some cases, the leasing of the land where oil sands are located, arguing the provincial government should consult with them before it grants leases to companies.</p>

By far the largest stakeholders in CRFP are the police who make up over 70 per cent. of the CRFP register, costing police forces about &#163;350,000 per annum.

 In July 2008, the military wing of Hezbollah, including the Jihad Council and all units reporting to it (including the Hezbollah External Security Organisation) was added to schedule 2 to the Terrorism Act 2000 (the proscribed list). Prior to that, only the External Security Organisation of Hezbollah was proscribed. The amendment to schedule 2 followed a thorough review of Hezbollah and the extent to which various parts of the organisation are concerned in terrorism. The review concluded that a distinction could be drawn between those parts of Hezbollah which are legitimately involved in Lebanese politics and those which are directly concerned in terrorism, and the new entry in schedule 2 to the Terrorism Act 2000 reflects that distinction.</p>

The Home Office will not be directly assessing the performance of forces against the pledge; however HMIC will validate the delivery of the pledge through their inspection process.

 It is vital that the police are able to deliver for the public in the most efficient way. This is why in the Policing Green Paper, published last year, the Home Office attached so much priority to cutting red tape and investing in technology. The Government's approach to bureaucracy is to reform processes to free up officer time, while also returning discretion to police officers and encouraging them to use their professional judgment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_296"><a name="90402w0007.htm_para10"><a name="09040255000970">Following a recommendation by Sir Ronnie Flanagan, the Home Office has supported a project to reduce the length of the crime recording form for use in the majority of incidents. A shortened crime recording process was piloted in four police forces areas in 2008, which allowed officers to exercise greater professional judgment in completing forms. PACE Code A has now been changed to remove the requirement of police officers to complete the stop and account form, while retaining the recording of the ethnicity of those stopped for monitoring reasons. The Government are also investing &#163;80 million to deliver 30,000 new mobile data devices in to the hands of front-line officers by March 2010 to help them work more efficiently and to carry out many of these processes out on the street and not in the station.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_297"><a name="90402w0007.htm_para11"><a name="09040255000971">The Home Office is also committed to reducing by up to 50 per cent. the amount of data it collects from police forces and has now removed the requirement for police officers to complete time-sheets for the purposes of activity based costing as well as removing or reducing the data it collected from police forces across a total of 36 data streams. Furthermore, the Home Office has taken steps to streamline its police performance management process, including the move to a single top-down target on public confidence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_298"><a name="90402w0007.htm_para12"><a name="09040255000972">Finally, the Home Office has appointed Jan Berry as the independent Reducing Bureaucracy Advocate to challenge Government and the police service to make further reductions to bureaucracy. Jan Berry has established a practitioner group comprising police officers and staff which is already scrutinising a number of police processes to identify where further reductions in bureaucracy can be achieved.</p>

 Almost all of HEFCE&#146;s recurrent funding for institutions are allocated by formula and informed by data that higher and further education institutions provide on their student numbers and measures of research activity. HEFCE&#146;s rules about only counting the activity that students complete in its funding allocations are clear. Where it is found, either through reconciliations with other data or any data audit, that erroneous data has resulted in institutions receiving incorrect funding allocations, then HEFCE adjust their funding accordingly (subject, where appropriate, to an appeals process).</p>

HEFCE carries out student data audits of the universities and colleges it funds over a five-year cycle. In 2008 it audited 26 HEIs relating to their 2007-08 HESES data. Where it finds that institutions have over-claimed funding, HEFCE has a duty to recover it. So far, these data audits have resulted in confirmed funding adjustments to funding for four institutions, as a result of incorrect reporting of non-completions.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change what increase in costs to the national grid would result from the connection to the grid of a new electricity generation unit of <i> (a)</i> 1600 MW and <i> (b)</i> 1800 MW. [266780]</p>

 National grid advise that connecting larger units of up to 1800 MW to the grid would create additional costs, principally, because national grid would need to carry more reserve capacity than currently in the event of loss of generation from one of those units.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_386"><a name="90402w0017.htm_para0"><a name="09040265001079">National grid has recently published a consultation on this issue and estimates that the additional costs of increasing the reserve to allow for a potential loss of power in-feed in excess of the current level of 1320 MW would be approximately &#163;95 million per annum for a generation unit of 1600 MW and &#163;160 million per annum for a generation unit of 1800 MW. Any changes to current arrangements are subject to Ofgem approval. Other costs of connecting individual power stations to the grid are determined by national grid on a case-by-case basis, and depend on a wide range of factors including location, system capacity, voltage and land availability.</p>

 The Energy Saving Trust and the Carbon Trust are both private companies limited by guarantee. They both receive funding from Government Departments and the devolved Administrations either in the form of contractual arrangements or as a grant offer. These grants and contracts are offered to the trusts to support their activities, which contribute to the Government&#146;s policy objectives on climate change, accelerating the move to a low carbon economy, resource efficiency and fuel poverty. The trusts&#146; activities form an important element of the Government&#146;s Climate Change Programme.

 To assist discussions of modernisation reforms to the pension schemes for the NHS, teachers and civil service in 2005, an indicative estimate of &#163;13 billion was calculated as the potential net saving in employer costs for these three schemes over a 50-year period from 2006.

This reflected savings in the value of benefits built up over the 50-year period, not cashflow savings on benefits paid out over that period.

 Senior Operational Commanders have confirmed that there remains a critical need for a light protected patrol vehicle such as the Snatch Land Rover, which can reach areas that are inaccessible to heavier vehicles. The introduction of Snatch Vixen and the procurement of the tactical support vehicles announced in October 2008, will enable us to continue reducing the scope of the Snatch 2A vehicle's role until it is used only within our camps. To comment further would, or would be likely to prejudice the capability, effectiveness or security of the armed forces.</p>

 The Highways Agency does not directly employ any personnel trained in animal welfare. To assist traffic officers in road incidents involving injured animals, the Highways Agency has national partnership agreements in place with the British Equine Veterinary Association through the &#145;emergency services protocol when dealing with incidents involving equines&#146; and with the RSPCA. These partnership arrangements provide trained personnel to the traffic officer service to ensure the welfare of injured animals.</p>

 The Highways Agency (HA) is responsible for the strategic road network in England which consists of motorways and trunk roads. Other roads are the responsibility of local authorities. The Highways Agency do not keep records and the managing agents are not required to record the number of animals killed on the roads they are managing. Any records that are kept are inconsistent making it difficult to collate the data to give an accurate figure. Some agent&#146;s contracts have terminated within the five-year period and these records are not available. From the data available, the following figures are for the minimum number killed.</p>

 The Air Transport White Paper is kept under regular review. The Department for Transport published a progress report on the White Paper in December 2006, and a further progress report is due to be published within the next two years. Forecasts of UK air passenger numbers and CO2 emissions are also reviewed regularly, the most recent edition being published in January 2009. The forecasting methods were independently peer-reviewed as part of the Adding Capacity at Heathrow Airport Impact Assessment. The Air Transport White Paper also contains a commitment to evaluate the policies set out in the White Paper; the first stages of this evaluation are now under way.</p>

We expect the future surveys to show increasing improvement as our policies have a chance to bed down and completed schemes reflect new HCA standards.</p>

<i> [holding answer 23 February 2009]:</i> The eligibility criteria are based primarily on the business type and/or loan purpose rather than the profession of the borrower. There are no EFG restrictions in relation to farmers. There are, however, eligibility criteria and restrictions in relation to agriculture and horticulture which are based on the relevant EU de minimis state aid rules (1535/2007 and 1998/2006).</p>

After making the commercial decision to lend according to their own criteria, all lenders use a common web portal to administer the eligibility criteria.

 ISO 27001 is the international standard for the security management of information systems and superseded the British Standard BS 7799. The Department chose to comply with BS 7799 rather than seek full certification against the standard for its information systems and has maintained this stance with ISO 27001. Internal Audit carried out reviews of compliance against the standard until 2007, when responsibility for this work moved to the Security and Assurance Team.</p>

1. A finished admission episode is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one health care provider. Finished admission episodes are counted against the year in which the admission episode finishes. Admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>
2. Diagnosis (Primary Diagnosis): The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 14 (seven prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) dataset and provides the main reason why the patient was in hospital. ICD10 Code used = F12 Mental and behavioural disorders due to use of cannabinoids (including cannabis).<br>
3. Consultant Main Specialty: This defines the specialty under which the consultant responsible for the care of the patient at that time is registered. Care is needed when analysing HES data by specialty, or by groups of specialties (such as &#145;acute&#146;). Trusts have different ways of managing specialties and attributing codes so it is better to analyse by specific diagnoses, operations or other patient or service information.<br>
4. Counts are restricted to the following consultant main specialties:<br>
710 = Mental illness<br>
711 = Child and adolescent psychiatry<br>
712 = Forensic psychiatry<br>
713 = Psychotherapy<br>
715 = Old age psychiatry (available from 1990-91)<br>

 Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis (ADEM) is an extremely rare neurological condition thought to be caused by a range of viral infections. Although ADEM has been reported in temporal association with several vaccines, there is a lack of good scientific evidence to show that routine vaccination is causally-associated with ADEM.</p>

Since 1968, the MHRA has received 10 Yellow Card reports of suspected ADEM in association with vaccinations given in the UK (see following table).

It is also not possible to ascertain the number of people who may have suffered an adverse event following vaccination using data from the Yellow Card Scheme. This is because reporting is voluntary and the level of under-reporting is unknown.

the review of the brownfield designation of garden land to be completed; and if she will make a statement. [267227]</p>

 During the progress of the Planning Act 2008, the Government committed to review the evidence on the extent and impact of housing development on garden land in order to establish whether there was a genuine problem. This commitment was undertaken in the absence of firm evidence that a problem existed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_690"><a name="90402w0048.htm_para1"><a name="0904032002277">We propose to establish the amount of housing development on garden land, which at present cannot be distinguished from other land classified as &#147;previously-residential&#148; in the Land Use Change Statistics, such as estate regeneration or conversions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_691"><a name="90402w0048.htm_para2"><a name="0904032002278">The review will take place in two stages. The first stage will involve obtaining data directly from local planning authorities and the Planning Inspectorate. My Department will write to local planning authorities in England requesting data on the number of planning permissions granted or refused (including the outcomes of any associated appeals), from 1 April 2003 to 31 March 2008, for housing development within the curtilage of an existing dwelling house&#151;but only where these permissions have, or will, result in a net increase in dwellings within the existing curtilage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_692"><a name="90402w0048.htm_para3"><a name="0904032002279">We have worked with the Planning Officers' Society and the Central Local Information Partnership in designing the process of data collection for the review to ensure it as straightforward for local authorities as possible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_693"><a name="90402w0048.htm_para4"><a name="0904032002280">We will exclude from the review details of regeneration or renewal schemes, as these could seriously distort the data. We will also exclude extensions to properties, as these do not lead to an increase in dwellings, and conversions, as these do not generally lead to a loss of land.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_694"><a name="90402w0048.htm_para5"><a name="0904032002281">Authorities will also be asked to provide a commentary on the development plan policies they rely on to determine these type of applications, and information on whether they have identified gardens (either individually or through the identification of a broad location), through the plan led system, for future development.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_695"><a name="90402w0048.htm_para6"><a name="0904032002282">Local authorities will also be given the opportunity to say whether garden development is or is not an issue for them in their area and why.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_696"><a name="90402w0048.htm_para7"><a name="0904032002283">As part of the first stage we will also ask the Planning Inspectorate to provide information on the appeal decisions highlighted by planning authorities, to help establish the principal reasons why the decisions were granted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_697"><a name="90402w0048.htm_para8"><a name="0904032002284">For the second stage of the review, we will seek external analysis of the data collected from the first stage to determine the impact of the development. This will probably focus on a subset of authorities which will need to include authorities from each region, and an even mix of large and small authorities in both urban and rural areas. We will publish further details of the second stage of the review at the time. Subject to the response rate we receive to stage one of the review, our aim is to conclude the second stage by the summer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_698"><a name="90402w0048.htm_para9"><a name="0904032002285">The purpose of the review is to ascertain if there is clear and genuine problem with the extent of development on gardens. We are committed to considering action if the evidence discloses a problem, provided that any changes should not have the effect of undermining our objectives on housing.</p>
