 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment she has made of the likely impact on the UK breeding population of cormorants of her Department&#039;s change of policy on cormorant control.  [217969]</p>




<p><a name="50303w03.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Bradshaw  </b> 
<i>[holding answer 24 February 2005]:</i> Modelling by Defra&#039;s Central Science Laboratory (CSL) has examined the likely consequences of the new policy on winter cormorant numbers. The focus on winter numbers is appropriate since this coincides with the period when licensed shooting occurs; wintering counts are also recorded annually, unlike counts of breeding birds which are only conducted infrequently at the national level. CSL have explored the limits within which the licensing system may operate without risking the conservation status of the cormorant population. The aim has been to identify prudent upper limits for shooting and not to recommend levels of population reduction. To further safeguard the conservation of cormorants Defra will monitor the national winter population and if necessary reduce or stop the granting of licences should the population not respond in the manner predicted.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment her Department has made of the effectiveness of fish refuges in reducing predation by cormorants; and how much her Department has spent on research into the effectiveness of fish refuges in the last two years. [217970]</p>




<p><a name="50303w03.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Bradshaw </b> 
<i>[holding answer 24 February 2005]:</i> Mr Bradshaw Defra&#039;s Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science is currently undertaking research into the use of fish refuges to reduce damage to inland fisheries by cormorants. Early results are encouraging and suggest that the technique has considerable potential for reducing fish losses at some sites, such as smaller stillwater coarse fisheries. Currently, fish refuges do not offer a solution for all fisheries. However, work is continuing to further evaluate the benefits of introducing refuges in a range of fisheries and to assess any effects of the refuge structures on anglers. Over the past two years this research has cost the Department &#163;260k.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs how many licences to control cormorants have been issued in each English county since 16 September 2004; and how many birds are permitted to be killed under each licence. [217971]</p>




<p><a name="50303w03.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Bradshaw </b> 
<i>[holding answer 24 February 2005]:</i> Up until 9 February 2005 the Department granted 274 licences. The minimum number of birds which have been licenced to be killed is 1800. This equates to an average of almost seven birds per licence. The analysis of licences per county involves a disproportionate cost and has not been supplied.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will make a statement on the application of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 to access to the countryside, with particular reference to the use of gates and stiles. [218382]</p>




<p><a name="50303w04.html_spnew1"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 The Disability Discrimination Act 1995 ensures that private or public landowners, who are &quot;service providers&quot;, will be subject to the provisions of the Act. Service providers are required to take reasonable steps to remove, alter or provide a reasonable means of avoiding physical features.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50303w04.html_para1">
As far as rights of way are concerned, we believe that this will apply to features such as stiles and gates&#151;which might act as barriers to disabled people accessing their services&#151;since the provision and maintenance of these is the landowner&#039;s responsibility. However, it is not clear at this stage what &quot;reasonable steps&quot; would mean in practice and this will probably only be established by case law.

<a name="50303w04.html_para2">
Section 69 of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 provides for the Secretary of State to issue guidance on how the powers to authorise works are to be exercised. We plan to issue this guidance later this year and will consider using this opportunity to issue guidance on the application of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50303w04.html_para3">
As regards access to open country under Part I of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000, we believe that landowners are unlikely to be service providers under the Disability Discrimination Act just because their land has been designated under this part of the Act. Landowners may become service providers if they voluntarily provide signs, gates, stiles or other infrastructure to support the right of access, but there is no case law in this area. If the courts decide that the Disability Discrimination Act does

apply in these circumstances, then we would expect &quot;reasonable steps&quot; to take account of factors like cost, land management, privacy and the level of demand from local disabled people

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what lessons 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>3 Mar 2005 : Column 1292W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
have been learned from the deadline for the implementation of phase I of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme in the UK for phase II.  [219339]</p>




<p><a name="50303w05.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Morley  </b> 
<i>[holding answer 2 March 2005]:</i> The directive specifies the dates by which National Allocation Plans in the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) should be submitted to the European Commission, final allocation decisions should be made and the date by which allowances should be issued. For phase I these deadlines have proved extremely challenging to meet for all member states.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50303w05.html_para0">
One of the key lessons learned from phase I is with regard to the volume of analysis, negotiation and decision making required to develop a robust and effective NAP within a demanding timeframe. In light of this we have already started work on phase II in particular focussing on analytical work to inform the decision making process.

<p><a name="50303w05.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Morley </b> 
<i>[holding answer 2 March 2005]:</i> The Commission has approved 21 National Allocation Plans (NAPs) (eight on 7 July 2004, eight on 20 October 2004 and five on 27 December 2004). The Commission has yet to announce decisions on NAPs from Poland, the Czech Republic, Italy and Greece.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50303w05.html_para1">
To date only Denmark has begun spot trading, although the Netherlands are expected to start shortly. A number of member states have announced installation level allocations (e.g. Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, Finland, Slovenia and Ireland) but are not yet in a position to issue allowances, either as a result of the registry not being approved or because a final allocation decision has not yet been made.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs when she expects the European Commission to make a decision on the UK&#039;s application for an opt out from Phase 1 of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme.  [219341]</p>




<p><a name="50303w05.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Morley </b> 
<i>[holding answer 2 March 2005]:</i> We aim to make an application to the Commission for temporary exclusion from the EU Emissions Trading Scheme for Climate Change Agreement participants before Easter, after operators have made their applications to Defra by 4 March. We do not know when the Commission will make a decision on the application, but there is no guarantee that they will approve it.

 In its business projections for the Scheme the National Fallen Stock Company estimated that it would need 40&#150;50,000 members to ensure the Scheme was viable in the longer term. However, no threshold has been set and the number which would ensure viability may differ from this depending on how closely actual Scheme costs and income match those that had been projected.

<p><a name="50303w06.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Bradshaw  </b> 
<i>[holding answer 1 March 2005]:</i> The Fisheries Department has received three representations regarding the withdrawal of designated port status for haddock landings from Warkworth Harbour, Amble, Northumberland.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50303w06.html_para1">
The purpose of designating ports is to assist Defra inspectors in the monitoring of landings of fish. Amble was designated in 2004 following the introduction of the haddock permit scheme which made it compulsory for vessels with haddock permits to land into designated ports. It was made clear at the time that designation would only remain while the haddock permit scheme remained. The scheme has now ended.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50303w06.html_para2">
Under current rules, landing into a designated port is not compulsory except for vessels with more than two tonnes of cod on board. Vessels landing into Amble do not normally catch such quantities and they are therefore free to continue landing there, subject to requirements for advance notification in certain circumstances. I therefore do not propose to reconsider the decision.

These include the immediate imposition of movement controls on all susceptible livestock, strict bio-security requirements and enhanced options for controlling the disease. Vaccination would be considered from the outset of an outbreak in addition to the culling of all susceptible animals on infected premises and those that have been exposed to infection, as required by EU law.

 The Department commissioned and published a risk assessment to consider the risks of importation of contaminated meat and meat products and the subsequent exposure of GB livestock. Several viral pathogens were included in this work, among them Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD).

Foot and mouth disease virus has been recovered from the plumage and feet of birds in contact with affected livestock, however, there is a lack of evidence that birds play a significant role in the spread of the disease.

They are not for profit organisations and generate reserves from their surpluses and all such reserves have to be employed in the business. Their boards of management are accountable for the stewardship of the reserves and are duty bound to use them effectively in the pursuit of the associations&#039; objectives. Reserves are used to:

 The Northern Ireland Housing Executive (NIHE) assists those who have become homeless as a result of sectarian intimidation by providing temporary accommodation and arranging for storage of possessions, as necessary. If the Police Service for Northern Ireland (PSNI) can confirm that intimidation has taken place, the Housing Executive will award the applicant the highest level of priority for re-housing. Owner-occupiers who have become homeless as a result of intimidation have the facility to sell their homes under the Housing Executive&#039;s Scheme for the Purchase of Evacuated Dwellings and tenants of rented property are entitled to an emergency grant of &#163;692 when they are re-housed.

While homelessness caused by sectarian intimidation is not a problem that can be tackled solely by the NIHE, the Housing Executive works, through its Community Cohesion Unit, to prevent such intimidation by promoting good relations between communities.

In the last two years we have funded a major programme to train truck drivers to drive in a more fuel-efficient way. Savings of up to 9 per cent. are possible on fuel bills, typically worth &#163;2,100 per year per driver. We have funded a similar programme to advise on fuel-efficient operating practices, for example advice on aerodynamic equipment and tyres that optimise fuel-consumption.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what plans there are for the role of the <i>(a)</i> Army, <i>(b)</i> Royal Air Force and <i>(c)</i> Royal Navy in Gibraltar; and what spending plans there are for each service&#039;s role in Gibraltar.  [218620]</p>




<p><a name="50303w18.html_spnew11"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 Plans for the role of the armed forces in Gibraltar are unchanged. Commander British Forces&#039; mission is to secure and maintain key sites and air and sea ports of disembarkation, which allow reinforcement, in order to ensure Gibraltar&#039;s security and territorial integrity, and provide staging and mounting facilities for UK and coalition operations elsewhere. Cascading from this, the Royal Navy&#039;s role, in conjunction with the Royal Gibraltar police, is to maintain the security and integrity of British Territorial Waters with a visible maritime presence.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50303w18.html_para3">
The Royal Gibraltar Regiment contributes to the protection of key facilities in Gibraltar and provides immediate military support to the governor. The RAF&#039;s role is to sustain the airfield and associated facilities as an operational airhead, and to facilitate the safe use of the airfield by civilian operators. Linked together, these components provide a collective capability that, together with other local agencies, is charged with providing for the defence and security of Gibraltar. This also provides the capacity for British armed forces to use Gibraltar in support of other operations outside of the territory.

<p>
<a name="50303w18.html_para4">
As a result of a recent review into its structure and tasks, the Royal Gibraltar Regiment will be reconfigured, resulting in a small increase in regular soldiers.

Two boats are currently subject to unscheduled operating restrictions, due to an emergent issue that was identified during routine reviews of their safety cases.

For the purposes of FLEET programming, no distinction is made between the Swiftsure and Trafalgar Class submarines.

 As a direct consequence of the 1992 Further and Higher Education Act and the removal of the incorporated FE sector funding systems from local authority control, there was a divergence from local authority systems which has resulted in funding level differences. These differences were made more apparent when all post 16 funding became the responsibility of the Learning and Skills Council in 2001.

 This Government are committed to the creation of at least one &#039;full service&#039; extended school in each local area by 2006. Over time, however, we want all schools to become extended schools. Our Five-year Strategy for Children and Learners outlines the core offer of extended services that we expect all schools to develop, in partnership with other children&#039;s services and the voluntary and community sectors. Our 10 year strategy for child care states that by 2010 all secondary schools will be open from 5am to 6pm all year round, offering a range of activities such as music, sport, and holiday activities. Many schools already offer some activities, recognising the benefits that extended services provide for children, their families, local communities and schools themselves. We are supporting the development of extended schools with both advice and funding including, from April this year, &#163;107 million through all local education authorities in England.

<p><a name="50303w22.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Stephen Twigg: </b> 
 On 30 November 2004, we announced capital funding allocations for all schools and authorities in England for the next three years. This followed the settlement of the 2004 spending review, in which schools capital increased to &#163;6.3 billion by 2007&#150;08, a six fold real-terms increase since 1996&#150;97. Our announcement included direct capital funding for schools, and a typical primary school of 250 pupils will receive &#163;25,500 of devolved formula capital in 2005&#150;06, &#163;32,250 in 2006&#150;07and &#163;34,250 in 2007&#150;08. A typical secondary school of 1,000 pupils will receive &#163;87,250, &#163;108,500 and &#163;113,000 in these years to use for its own priorities.

<a name="50303w22.html_para3">
Further, Sefton local education authority, which includes Corby and Formby, will receive a total of &#163;12.6 million of formulaic funding over the next three years, and a further &#163;3.5 million will be available for its voluntary aided schools. In all, over &#163;32.5 million has been allocated from 2005&#150;06 until 2007&#150;08 for Sefton and its schools.

Additionally, the authority can apply to the Targeted Capital Fund for exceptional needs which it cannot fund from its formulaic allocations.

Finally, because Sefton is not prioritised early in the Building Schools for the Future (BSF) programme, by 2011 we aim to provide it with funding to transform at least one of its secondary school with the greatest need.

A large number of children&#039;s centres especially those in the more disadvantaged areas will be based upon Sure Start Local Programmes and Neighbourhood Nurseries. However, children&#039;s centres can be, and already are being, based upon a much wider range of existing private and public provision including, day nurseries, schools (nursery, primary and secondary) and family centres as well as other early years settings.

Notes:<br>

1. A finished admission episode is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. Please note that admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year. Figures given are for all admission methods.<br>

2. The main operation is the first recorded operation in the hospital episodes statistics (HES) data set and is usually the most resource intensive procedure performed during the episode. It is appropriate to use main operation when looking at admission details, eg time waited, but the figures for &quot;all operations count of episodes&quot; give a more complete count of episodes with an operation. OPCS4 codes C71-C72 and C74-C75 have been used for cataract operations.<br>

3. Time waited statistics from HES are not the same as the published waiting list statistics. HES provides counts and time waited for all patients admitted to hospital within a given period whereas the published waiting list statistics count those waiting for treatment on a specific date and how long they have been on the waiting list. Also, HES calculates the time waited as the difference between the admission and decision to admit dates. Unlike published waiting list statistics, this is not adjusted for self-deferrals or periods of medical/social suspension. Average time waited figures given are for waiting list and booked admissions.<br>

4. Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (ie the data are ungrossed).<br>

The data do not take account of dentists who moved to other areas and continued to work in the general or personal dental services. The dentists could have ceased doing NHS work for a number of different reasons including retirement or leave to take a short-term absence.

<i>[holding answer 28 February 2005]:</i> The decision to allow primary care trusts and dentists more time to prepare for the full implementation of the national health service dental reforms does not affect the resources available to support NHS dentistry. While primary dental services remain predominantly demand led, the distribution of resources is not susceptible to detailed central control. However, the additional resources underpin not only the higher income levels for existing dental practices recommended by the doctors and dentists review body but also the recruitment of 1,000 NHS dentists in little over a year and the expansion of personal dental service (PDS) schemes to provide new ways of working to the benefit of dentists and patients. We now have over 4,000 dentists in over 1,400 dental practices working under PDS arrangements. By April, we expect 25 per cent. of dental practices to be operating within the PDS.

 The Department recently completed a public consultation exercise on draft regulations to govern the operation of the expanded national health service injury costs recovery (ISR) scheme. Although the full analysis of the responses to the consultation is still under way, one of the key messages to come out of our initial scrutiny was that high levels of concern remain about the insurance market&#039;s ability to cope with the new changes. After further discussions, I have decided that now is not the right time to introduce the expanded scheme. However, we remain committed to the principle of &quot;polluter pays&quot; that underpins the ICR Scheme, and the expanded scheme will be introduced by October 2006.

 The most recent review of the research evidence about the health effects of UV radiation was published in 2002 by the National Radiological Protection Board&#039;s (NRPB) independent advisory group on non-ionising radiation (AGNIR).
</p>


<p>
<a name="50303w27.html_para5">
The review gives clear evidence that exposure to ultra-violet radiation (UVR) is a risk factor for developing melanoma and other skin cancers. There is less certainty about the relative roles of cumulative (lifetime) exposure or burning episodes in the genesis of the different types of skin cancer. Chronic exposure to solar radiation also causes photo-ageing of the skin. The risk of developing melanoma has increased substantially in white populations in the United Kingdom and Europe for several decades. The review did not consider clinical issues such as the effect of sun exposure on survival rates for melanoma.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50303w27.html_para6">
The review noted that the possibility has been raised that the immunosuppressive effects of UVR might be involved in causing lymphoma. The review concluded that overall the results are not-consistent with a major role for solar UVR in the aetiology of non-Hodgkins lymphoma (NHL), but they leave open the possibility of a minor role, or an aetiological relation for a particular subtype of NHL.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50303w27.html_para7">
The review also contains a chapter on vitamin D, which considers the amount of vitamin D needed from UV exposure or the diet to sustain adequate vitamin D levels. It considers the role of vicarious sun exposure in vitamin D synthesis. It notes that infant formula milks are fortified with vitamin D. There is no information in the review on vitamin D and multiple sclerosis, or on any relationship between vitamin D levels in early childhood and illness in adulthood.

The Government argued that the budget needed to be determined according to rigorous prioritisation and clear EU value added. The Government also argued, along with other supporters of an overall 1 per cent. GNI budget package, that the proposed budget (a threefold increase) was far too high. All member states endorsed research and development as a general priority but with different emphases on where EU value-added lay.

But EU funding was required to support this. He hoped that a solution could be found by the time of the next GAERC. Second, election plans for the DRC were unrealistic. If a referendum on the constitution was held in July, as planned, elections could not take place until 2006. One solution would be to hold elections in July and for both houses of the provisional parliament to vote on a new constitution immediately thereafter.

 UK Government officials in Iraq, as members of the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA), and other officials in the UK were consulted and invited to comment during the drafting of CPA Order 81. The Order was the subject of consultation and co-ordination with the Iraqi Governing Council, and was consistent with the needs identified by the Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General for the development of Iraq and its transition from a centrally planned economy to a market economy.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50303w31.html_para0">
The provisions of CPA Order 81 concern the registration and protection of intellectual property rights in new plant varieties. The Order should not affect the ability of Iraqi farmers to save seeds from traditional sources. Any restrictions would relate only to patented biotech inventions or protected plant varieties. This is the normal effect of introducing such an intellectual property law. To secure protection, plant varieties would have needed to have been shown to be new, distinct from other varieties in common knowledge, uniform and stable. Farmers will have a choice of sources for their seed supply: they may choose to continue using current sources, such as saving their own seeds of traditional and unprotected varieties, or may choose to buy seeds which are subject to patent or plant variety rights protection.
