<P>
<P>
<a name="30716w01.html_wqn2"><B> Miss McIntosh: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will list the revenue received by the Government from taxes paid by different modes of transport that are designed to have an environmental impact <i>(a)</i> as a proportion of total UK environmental tax revenue and <i>(b)</i> in relation to the contribution made to UK GDP by each transport mode.  [124766]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30716w01.html_spnew2"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 The Chancellor considers a range of relevant economic, social and environmental factors when deciding all taxation policy. Determining a definition of what is an environment tax is therefore difficult as: some taxes have been specifically designed to help achieve environmental goals, such as the aggregates levy, landfill tax and the climate change levy; some have been restructured to reflect environmental impacts, such as fuel duty differentials, company car tax and reforms to capital allowances to provide tax incentives for environmentally-friendly technologies; and some taxes were introduced for non-environmental reasons, but can have some environmental impact&#151;for example, air passenger duty.




<P>
<P><I>16 Jul 2003 : Column 302W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="30716w01.html_para0">A number of these environmental taxes, such as landfill tax, climate change levy and aggregates levy, were introduced alongside offsetting tax cuts and recycling of revenue into environmental spending programmes, making them broadly revenue neutral.
<P>

<a name="30716w01.html_para1">This Government has also demonstrated a commitment to using alternatives to taxation to protect and improve the environment, for example tradeable permit schemes as well as regulation and spending programmes.
<P>

<a name="30716w01.html_para2">A modern economy could not function properly without an effective transport system. Figures are not readily available disaggregating the contribution of transport to the economy into different transport modes.
<P>

<a name="30716w01.html_para3">In addition, many of the outputs of transport, such as the benefits from journeys by car, are not fully captured in national measures of UK GDP. The table below sets out revenues from the main taxes with a strong environmental dimension in 2002&#150;03.

<a name="30716w01.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Syms: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what studies his Department is undertaking on the possible effects of an increase in income tax.  [125044]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30716w01.html_spnew5"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 The Government have committed themselves not to increase the basic or top rates of income tax within the lifetime of this Parliament. Policies on income tax rates and allowances are set out in the Budget and Pre-Budget reports, which are available in the Library of the House.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer pursuant to his answer of 26 June 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 933W, on income tax, what factors underlay his conclusion that the information could be provided only at disproportionate cost.  [125398]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30716w01.html_spnew6"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 The information could be provided only at disproportionate cost because nearly 2,000 pieces of information have been requested (increasing the basic rate limit to seven different levels, and for each limit, introducing 13 additional higher income tax rates for 20 annual gross income levels). The sum of these requests would require a separate analysis that would exceed the rate for reasonable cost.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer with reference to the statistics on the Inland Revenue regarding approved pension schemes, available at: http://www.inlandrevenue.gov.uk/stats/pensions/p t091 htm, which of the figures are based on <i>(a)</i> administrative data and <i>(b)</i> information compiled by the Office for National Statistics.

<a name="30716w01.html_spnew7"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 The figures in the table are compiled from a number of different sources. Inland Revenue estimates of average marginal rates of income tax are used with ONS data on occupational pension contributions (net of estimated transfers, refunds and surrenders compiled from FSA and ABI data); investment income; lump sum payments; and pensions in payment. All other components of the table are Inland Revenue estimates based primarily on administrative data.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will make a statement on the effect of his policies on unemployment levels within the London borough of Wandsworth during the last 12 months.  [126175]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30716w01.html_spnew8"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 In Wandsworth, as in the rest of the UK, the Government's policies to deliver a sound and credible platform of economic stability and to improve labour market performance are helping to achieve our long-term goal of employment opportunity for all. As a result, the claimant count in Wandsworth is down by 44 per cent. on its 1997 level.
<P>

<a name="30716w01.html_para6">Recognising the importance of worklessness as a constraint on the economy, the Government have made a particular commitment to help those excluded from the labour force back into employment. The Government's new deal policies have helped almost 900 long-term unemployed aged 25 and over in Wandsworth over the last 12 months to gain new skills and experience. This, in combination with our other policies, has helped to reduce both youth and long-term claimant count unemployment in Wandsworth by over 20 per cent. in the last year and by over 60 per cent. since 1997.

 A national roadside survey June 2002 showed that some 1.75 million vehicles were evading vehicle excise duty (VED). There are currently over 30 million registered vehicles.
<P>

<a name="30716w02.html_para0">The survey indicated the loss of revenue from evasion at some 4.5 per cent. of that due. This equates to &#163;193 million in 2002&#150;03.

 The recent announcements on the roads strategy and West Midlands Multi Modal Study could not take account of any future airport expansion as no decisions have yet been made.

<a name="30716w02.html_para8">The car emissions are average figures for Euro III petrol vehicles operating at an urban speed. The bus emissions are average figures for Euro I vehicles also at an urban speed. It should be noted, however, that in practice many 10-year-old buses have been retrofitted with newer engines meeting tighter (ie Euro II or Euro III) emissions limits, or with pollution reducing equipment such as particulate traps. In these cases, emissions of NOx and PM10 would be much lower. Specific data for a bendy-bus is not currently available: much would depend on the age of the bus and the emissions standards it was required to meet at the time of purchase. The train emissions are average figures for diesel multiple unit trains used on regional networks. The majority of commuting by train is in London and the South East, where most of the trains are electric and so have zero local emissions. A full environmental comparison would need to incorporate occupancy figures but comparative data per passenger km is not available in the form requested.

 A total of 105,404 letters were sent to livestock holdings on which we had information that livestock were present from their latest census return. By 30 May we had received 36,249 responses from farmers in England to the questionnaire, of which 32,489 expressed an interest in joining the scheme, 1,833 stated that they were not interested due to cost, and 1,927 stated they would be making other arrangements. No reply was received to 69,155 letters. These numbers exclude responses where farmers said they no longer had livestock or where the letter was returned by the Post Office as gone away.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what the load factor was in each year from 1999, of each power station without flue gas desulphurisation equipment fitted; and on what date a BATNEEC application to allow the loading to exceed forty per cent. was <i>(a)</i> submitted, <i>(b)</i> agreed and <i>(c)</i> rejected in each applicable case.

<P>
<a name="30716w04.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Morley  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 4 July 2003]</i>: Operators of large coal and oil fired power stations are regulated by the Environment Agency ("the Agency") through a system of authorisation under the provisions of the Environmental Protection Act 1990. Conditions are set in authorisations to ensure environmental protection and include emission limits with which operators must comply.
<P>

<a name="30716w04.html_para6">In 1999 a review of the conditions contained in the authorisations was carried out by the Agency to secure further reductions in sulphur dioxide emissions, and to achieve a 50 per cent. reduction by 2005 of the 1999 



<P>
<P><I>16 Jul 2003 : Column 317W</I><P>
emission limits. In order to achieve this reduction, the Agency introduced conditions in the authorisations to encourage the building and operation of Flue Gas Desulphurisation ("FGD") equipment. The Agency formed the view that if a power station were to operate above a load factor of 40 per cent. then it would become economically viable to fit FGD equipment. Conditions were included in the authorisations whereby operators that did not have FGD equipment fitted, were required to submit a Best Available Techniques Not Entailing Excessive Cost ('BATNEEC') justification if they wanted to continue operating after September 2001 at a load factor exceeding 40 per cent. The justifications were received in May and June 2000, as listed in the table to this answer.
<P>

<a name="30716w04.html_para7">The exercise coincided with the introduction of the New Electricity Trading Arrangements (or "NETA"). It was recognised that the NETA could alter the market structure of the sector, and that such change could have significant repercussions for the BATNEEC considerations. Because of this economic uncertainty, the Agency did not, at that time, formally accept or reject the BATNEEC cases.
<P>

<a name="30716w04.html_para8">As NETA is now established, the BATNEEC cases made in 2000 are being reviewed. This may lead to a modification of the authorisations of those plant that are operated at high load factors without FGD equipment. This exercise will form part of a wider review of the performance of the coal fired power stations and will take into account further commitments by operators to fit FGD equipment and the requirements under the revised EU Directive concerning Large Combustion Plant.

<i>[holding answer 2 July 2003]:</i> I have today, along with the Environment Ministers for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, appointed Katharine Bryan as Chair of the new Committee on Radioactive Waste Management, CoRWM. Her task will be to lead CoRWM in recommending how the UK should manage its most highly radioactive waste and keep it safe for many thousands of years. Together, we shall receive CoRWM's recommendations, and around 2006, we shall decide how these should be implemented to secure the best outcome for the UK as a whole.
<P>

<a name="30716w05.html_para1">In September 2001, we invited comments on our proposed programme, Managing Radioactive Waste Safely. As we said, a substantial legacy of solid radioactive waste is being stored, awaiting a decision on how best to manage it for many thousands of years while radioactivity falls to safe levels. Even if no new nuclear plants are built, around 500,000 tonnes of waste will arise over the next century as existing plants are shut down and cleaned up. We proposed a rigorous and public review of alternative options, including underground disposal and surface storage. We proposed a new independent body to advise us when enough information had been gathered to decide the best option or combination of options. There was general support for this approach.
<P>

<a name="30716w05.html_para2">We advertised for CoRWM in March 2003. We received over 400 applications. We have begun by appointing the Chair who will help us identify the best team. We shall now interview and appoint the remaining members so that CoRWM is up and running by October 2003.

<P>

<a name="30716w05.html_para3">CoRWM's terms of reference require it, among other things, to aim to make its recommendations no later than the end of 2005; to prepare a work programme that will enable it to do this; to send this to us for agreement at an early stage; to meet us every six months; and to make an annual progress report which we can place before Parliament. Its review of options must be carried out in an open, transparent and inclusive manner; to inspire public confidence in the way in which it works, in order to secure such confidence in its eventual recommendations; and so to ensure the long-term safety of the UK's radioactive wastes.
<P>

<a name="30716w05.html_para4">I am confident that Katharine will lead the Committee and the review very effectively. I shall make an announcement when the rest of CoRWM is appointed and it is ready to start work. With this important step forward in the process for deciding future policy for the long-term management of the UK's radioactive waste, Government have been giving consideration to the future of United Kingdom Nirex Ltd. (Nirex). As well as undertaking important work on standards for the conditioning and packagng of radioactive waste, the company has extensive knowledge of some of the potential options for radioative waste mangement to be considered by CoRWM.
<P>

<a name="30716w05.html_para5">It is very important that Nirex stands ready, along with others, to help CoRWM reach its view and inform policy decisions. It is important also that the company can do this from a position where it is, and can be seen to be, independent of industry. The Government will consult Nirex shareholders on the best way of making Nirex independent of industry and under greater Government control, and our aim is to establish and announce the appropriate way forward by autumn of this year.

 An effective public administration is essential to the process of reconstruction in Afghanistan. DFID has been an important source of assistance to the Afghanistan Transitional Administration (ATA) as it has sought to re-establish the basic functions of government. We are supporting capacity building within institutions, including the Ministry of Finance, Central Bank, and Administrative Reform and Civil Service Commission. Other donors such as the World Bank are helping in areas such as procurement and audit. Achievements have included the introduction of a new currency, development of a national development framework, and of a payments and payroll system and implementation of measures to maximise revenue collection. But much remains to be done, and after twenty years of upheaval, there are no short-cuts to rebuilding Afghanistan's public administration. President Karzai recently issued a "Priority Reform and Restructuring" decree (executive legislation) that will allow further urgent reforms to take place in up to twenty Government Departments. These reforms will be supported by DFID and the World Bank.

 My Department has recently taken a number of measures to assist the Iraqis to protect and conserve their Cultural heritage. Two officials from my Department have been working closely in Iraq with Ambassador Cordone, Head of Cultural Affairs at the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA). Their priority has been to re-establish the Culture Ministry as soon as possible and a Culture Cabinet of six Iraqis was formed in May. DCMS officials have helped prepare a budget for the Culture Ministry for 2003&#150;04.

 I view the fair share initiative as an important tool in ensuring that those communities at greatest disadvantage do not lose out from Lottery funding.

Over &#163;31 million has been distributed through the

Now that the building blocks of the three strands of funding are in place, I expect to see a steady increase in the flow of funding over the remaining two years of the initiative.

 The Bid Company for the London 2012 bid will be responsible for the delivery of a high quality and competitive bid. This includes the preparation of the key bidding documents, the Applicant Questionnaire in the first stage of bidding and the Candidature file required in the second phase of the bid process. Both stages of the Bidding procedure should demonstrate how the London bid will reflect the commitment of the Olympic Movement to sustainable development and endeavours to contribute to the protection of the natural environment. In discharging this responsibility we would expect the Bid Company to consult the relevant stakeholder interests.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills whether the proposed National and Regional Centres for Excellence in Science Teaching will be required to provide in service training opportunities to enable practising teachers to develop their skills in out of classroom teaching in biology and other scientific disciplines.  [125269]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30716w11.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 Our plans, in partnership with the Wellcome Trust, to establish a national network of science learning centres are progressing well. The national centre and up to nine regional centres will provide a range of continuing professional development opportunities for teachers of primary, secondary and post-16 science teachers, technicians and other support staff in the science classroom. We anticipate that, over time, the centres will help teachers to develop their skills in out of the classroom teaching.
<P>

<a name="30716w11.html_para0">In addition, the Department's 'Growing Schools' initiative has worked with hundreds of schools to develop best practice in the use of the outdoor classroom for a range of curriculum subjects, including science at each key stage.

 There has been no guidance issued from the Department for Education and Skills to local education authorities or schools specifically on supporting children from homeless families in priority need.

<a name="30716w11.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Stephen Twigg: </B> 
 National Curriculum subjects, including citizenship education, have clear requirements for what must be taught and the standards of attainment at the end of each key stage (see www.nc.uk.net). A range of teaching and learning methods are described in the QCA schemes of work for citizenship (see www.standards.dfes.gov.uk/schemes). Schools can adopt a range of approaches including discrete lessons; whole school activities; and teaching through existing subjects such as Personal, Social and Health education.
<P>

<a name="30716w11.html_para2">Assessment and reporting arrangements are similar to other national curriculum subjects. Teachers must conduct pupil assessment at key stage 3 and report pupils progress in key stage 1 and 2 to parents. GCSE (Short Course) in Citizenship Studies has been developed to give pupils the opportunity to obtain a recognised qualification. QCA has developed guidance for schools on assessment (see www.qca.org.uk). It is a year since the introduction of citizenship as a statutory subject in secondary schools and pupils need time to develop the required knowledge, understanding and skills in the subject. The Department is committed to continuing to monitor the introduction of citizenship education, to provide schools and teachers with the additional support they may need. The Department has commissioned the National Foundation for Educational Research (NfER) to conduct an eight year longitudinal study, to consider the impact of the subject on pupils' knowledge, understanding and skills in citizenship. It will also consider the impact on schools understanding of the aims of citizenship education and how they relate to wider school ethos and planning. The NfER longitudinal study and Ofsted section 10 inspections regime will provide effective progress reports on a range of models of delivery, including through Personal, Social and Health Education.

Participation rates have been calculated using the 17-year-old population from the previous year to reduce the distortion caused to LEA populations by the migration of students to their place of study. Figures exclude a very small number of accepted applicants of unknown English domicile. Population figures relate to persons aged 17 at 31 August in the year prior to entry, counts taken at the following 1 January; accepted applicants are aged 18 at 30 September in the year of entry.<P>

 The information requested is contained in the following table. The increase in funding for each school will depend on a number of factors covering both central and local government responsibility. These are the increase in funding given to the school's authority by central Government; the amount which the local authority decides to increase its Schools Budget by; the increase which the local authority decides to give to the

<a name="30716w14.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 Paragraph 3 of Schedule 2 of The Education (Specified Work and Registration) (England) Regulations 2003 defines student teachers as those aged over 18 years who are awaiting admission to, or retaking part of, a course of initial teacher training leading to Qualified Teacher Status. Student teachers may undertake specified work in schools for a limited period of time only (for up to 2 years or a longer period if approved by the Secretary of State). They must be supervised and directed by a qualified teacher or a nominated teacher in accordance with arrangements made by the head teacher of the school. The Regulations define a nominated teacher as a person who is either an instructor with special qualifications or experience, an overseas-trained teacher, a teacher who has almost qualified but has not yet passed the skills tests, a graduate teacher, a registered teacher, or a teacher on the employment-based teacher training scheme. Higher level teaching assistants and other school support staff cannot direct or supervise student teachers.

 The Energy White Paper announced that the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister would start work immediately on the next major revision of the building regulations with the aim of bringing it into effect in 2005, and that we would raise boiler standards to the level of the most efficient types, A and B condensing ones. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister also indicated our intention of raising standards over the coming decade learning lessons from the standards set in comparable European countries. The revision work will, for instance, examine what improvements can be made to the winter and summer performance standards for building fabric and heating, cooling and lighting systems, while ensuring the Regulations remain technically sound, proportionate, cost-effective and sufficiently flexible for designers.

 Under integrated risk management, it will be for fire authorities, not the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, to set local standards for responding to fires and other emergencies in the light of a full assessment of the risks faced by their communities. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister believes that by

<a name="30716w15.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The changes to the appointment and promotion regulations announced in the White Paper will mean that people with the right potential and skills, both within and outside the fire and rescue service, can apply for jobs at all levels and in all parts of the service. This will provide wider and more varied opportunities for staff in all sections of the service. The White Paper also announced the introduction of the Integrated Personal Development System which will ensure staff are developed and receive training relevant to their personal needs. In many cases this will include development to help them obtain promotion. This coupled with the removal of the requirement to have served for a specific number of years before obtaining promotion will improve promotion prospects of many staff.

<P>
<a name="30716w16.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Paul Marsden: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what <i>(a)</i> the avarage waiting time and <i>(b)</i> the longest waiting time for homeless families in priority need before being placed in permanent accommodation was in the last year for which figures are available; and what the range of waiting times was in each local authority.  [124680]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30716w16.html_spnew1"><B> Keith Hill: </B> 
 Under the homelessness legislation (Part 7 of the Housing Act 1996 as amended by the Homelessness Act 2002), local housing authorities have a duty to secure accommodation for applicants who are eligible for assistance, unintentionally homeless and who fall within a priority need group (the main homelessness duty). The duty applies until a settled housing solution becomes available (for example, an allocation of housing made under Part 6 of the 1996 Act as amended by the 2002 Act) or some other circumstance brings the duty to an end (for example, the applicant voluntarily quits temporary accommodation secured for him or here by the authority). Data supplied by local authorities in England shows that, overall, in 2002/03 almost three-quarters of households owed the main homelessness duty and provided with temporary accommodation received an offer of some form of settled accommodation; for the remainder, the duty was brought to an end as a result of some other circumstance.
<P>

<a name="30716w16.html_para1">Information on the length of time that households which were owed the main homelessness duty have stayed in temporary accommodation (including any period pending a decision on their application) before the homelessness duty is brought to an end is collected in six-monthly time bands ("under six months", "six months to one year", etc to "two years or more"). It is therefore not possible to provide an average waiting time. However, it is estimated that just over half of the households who were owed a main homelessness duty, placed in temporary accommodation and subsequently received an offer of settled accommodation during 2002/03 (either an offer made under Part 6 of the 1996 Act or some other form of offer) had waited less than six months before receiving the offer. By comparison, only 10 per cent. had been in temporary accommodation for more than two years before receiving such an offer.
<P>

<a name="30716w16.html_para2">Only two-thirds of local authorities were able to provide a comprehensive analysis of time spent in temporary accommodation and, due to concerns about 



<P>
<P><I>16 Jul 2003 : Column 362W</I><P>
the data quality, comparisons between authorities are not advisable. Available information suggests that, in around a quarter of local authorities, 90 per cent. of the households offered accommodation received the offer within six months.

 There is a statistical analysis in paragraphs 8&#150;14 of the Regulatory Impact Assessment at Annex 1 of the consultation paper on Tenancy Money. This noted that according to the Survey of English Housing (SEH) some 20 per cent. of tenants said that their deposits had been unreasonably withheld in the last three years. However for the purposes of calculating the maximum number of disputed cases an SEH figure was used that showed that of the 905,000 tenancies that finished in 2001&#150;02 some 127,000 of these (14 per cent.) involved, in the tenant's view, an unjustified retention of all or part of the deposit.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister pursuant to his written ministerial statement of 16 June 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 3WS, which paragraph in Tenancy Money: probity and protection indicated that there is not a robust case for legislating to compel the protection of tenancy monies in third party schemes.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30716w16.html_spnew7"><B> Keith Hill: </B> 
 Chapter 3, paragraph 35, of the consultation paper stated that an independent evaluation of the pilot by York University was inconclusive as to the need for legislation, as the pilot had provided insufficient evidence to assess fully the nature and extent of the problem. A more detailed report published alongside (but summarised in Annex 9 of) the consultation paper concluded that there is no clear evidence that the actual incidence of tenants losing their deposits is so high as to require legislative intervention. In Annex 1 of the consultation paper the balance of costs and benefits, as estimated for the Regulatory Impact Assessment, were shown to be roughly equal.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister pursuant to his written ministerial statement of 16 June 2003, <i>Official Report,</i> column 3WS, what estimated percentage of disputed cases going to adjudication he used to calculate that the annual adjudication costs of a national tenancy deposit scheme would be &#163;19 million.  [126044]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30716w16.html_spnew8"><B> Keith Hill:  </B> 
There is a statistical analysis in paragraphs 8&#150;14 and 29 of the Regulatory Impact Assessment at Annex 1 of the consultation paper on Tenancy Money. This was based on the figures in the Survey of English Housing that of the 905,000 tenancies that finished each year approximately 127,000 tenants (or 14 per cent. of that total) felt that none or a lesser sum of the deposit should have been withheld. It further assumed, having regard to evidence from the pilot tenancy deposit scheme, that the average cost of adjudications would be &#163;150.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister if he will estimate the annual adjudication costs of the custodial option for a national tenancy deposit scheme if only 2.5 per cent. of disputed cases require adjudication.  [126045]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30716w16.html_spnew9"><B> Keith Hill: </B> 
 There is a tentative statistical analysis in the Regulatory Impact Assessment at Annex 1 of the consultation paper on Tenancy Money. It suggested that the maximum number of tenants who might feel they had a case to go to adjudication was 127,000. Assuming that (i) only a custodial option was in place (ii) only 2.5 per cent of 127,000 (3,175) sought adjudication and (iii) the average cost of adjudication under the pilot of &#163;150 applied&#151;the cost would be &#163;476,250. Although the figure of 2.5 per cent. is closer to the proportion of tenancies in the pilot that resulted in adjudication a mandatory requirement for safeguarding tenancy monies would probably result in a much higher proportion requiring adjudication.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30716w19.html_wqn5"><B> Dr. Cable: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what reports she has received from the administrators concerning the conduct of the directors of Independent Insurance Company; and what action she intends to take concerning the company's collapse.  [126073]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30716w19.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Sutcliffe: </B> 
 On 17 June 2001, the High Court of Justice appointed provisional liquidators of Independent Insurance Company Ltd. The provisional liquidators are responsible for the protection of the company estate until the court determines the winding up petition presented against the company. There is no requirement to submit conduct reports on the company directors, until such time as a winding up order is made by the court, at which time the business affairs and failure of the company would be investigated by the Official Receiver.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30716w19.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Bellingham: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry how many employees are estimated by her Department to lack adequate internal dispute resolution procedures; what proportion of these are small and medium-sized enterprises; how many are

expected to lack adequate procedures when the new rules come into force in 2004; and if she will make a statement.  [125822]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30716w19.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Sutcliffe: </B> 
 We estimate that there are just over 800,000 employers that do not have adequate dispute resolution procedures in place at this time. 97 per cent. of those firms with inadequate procedures have less than 20 employees.
<P>

<a name="30716w19.html_para3">The statutory dispute resolution procedures (as set out in draft Regulations, under the Employment Act 2002, which were published on 9 July 2003) are planned to come into force in October 2004. The implementation of these procedures will be supported by a broad, wide-reaching information and guidance campaign, in partnership with a range of small firms organisations and other advisory bodies. The campaign aims to ensure that all small firm employers are informed about the new requirements in time to implement them.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30716w19.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Bellingham: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what representations she has had from small and medium-sized enterprises concerning requirements expected to come into force in 2004 to compel staff wishing to pursue a complaint to go through internal dispute resolution procedures before going to a tribunal.  [125823]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30716w19.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Sutcliffe: </B> 
 The framework for these new dispute resolution procedures was established in the 2002 Employment Act. This was preceded by an extensive public consultation, involving many small and medium-sized firms.
<P>

<a name="30716w19.html_para4">The Government are currently consulting on draft Regulations that will bring these dispute resolution procedures into effect. The draft Regulations were developed with considerable input from an Advisory Group, which included representatives from the Small Business Council, the Small Business Service, the Federation of Small Businesses and the Forum for Private Business. Moreover, in line with Cabinet Office guidelines, two focus groups were held with small businesses to test the proposals.
<P>

<a name="30716w19.html_para5">The ongoing consultation on these draft Regulations will last for 16 weeks until 29 October 2003. We hope to collect more views from small firms, and other organisations, during this time.

<P>
<a name="30716w19.html_wqn9"><B> Andrew Selous: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what restrictions there are on mail order companies debiting customers' credit cards where they are unable to give a date when the goods will be available.  [125622]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30716w19.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Sutcliffe: </B> 
 There are no restrictions on mail order companies debiting consumers' credit cards in the circumstances described. However, consumers are protected by the Consumer Protection (Distance Selling) Regulations 2000 which stipulate that unless the parties have agreed otherwise, the supplier must deliver the goods within 30 days; and that if the goods are unavailable the consumer must be informed and reimbursed.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30716w19.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 Direct DTI funding of fission research stopped in 1994 with the cessation of the fast reactor programme and there is none included in current DTI spending plans for the next three years. DTI funding is reviewed annually and will be considered next as part of the 2004 Spending Review, which covers the period 2005&#150;08. The UK nuclear industry currently benefits from Government support for EU and OECD co-ordinated research programmes.
<P>

<a name="30716w19.html_para6">The Research Councils received funding from spending review 2002 for a research programme "Towards a Sustainable Energy Economy" which includes proposals to establish a National Energy Research Network and UK Energy Research Centre. A Scientific Advisory Committee has been established to advise the Councils on the emphasis and scope of the programme and of the Centre. It is however envisaged that the National Energy Research Network would cover a broad range of energy research. In addition, the Research Councils provide funding in the region of &#163;16 million a year for fusion research.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if she will make a statement on government liability for deficits in the pension funds of <i>(a)</i> Rolls Royce and <i>(b)</i> BAE Systems.  [124905]<P>

 The Government assumed ultimate responsibility for any outstanding liabilities of British Aerospace, which vested in its successor company on 1 January 1981 in preparation for privatisation. The Government would only become responsible for such liabilities, including those for pension fund deficits, in the event of a voluntary winding up of BAE Systems plc or an order to wind up the company by the court under the Insolvency Act.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry when in October 2002 officials of the Department of Trade and Industry's Insolvency Department met the CEO of Richard Roberts Ltd. to discuss redundancy payments for the unemployed workers in Leicester; what the original amount was that the Department of Trade and Industry agreed to pay for the Richard Roberts Company's insolvency in the Leicester factory in October 2002; and by when the Department of Trade and Industry intends to pay the agreed amount.

 My officials concerned with redundancy payments have held a number of meetings with the Finance Director of Richard Roberts Ltd. but have not met the Chief Executive Officer. The Redundancy Payments Office agreed to make payments to former employees of the company, initially of &#163;750,000 and subsequently a further &#163;1,250,000, a total of &#163;2,000,000.

But OFT may accept undertakings not to use unfair terms in lieu of seeking injunctions and in nearly all cases it secures such improvements in standard contract terms in this way, through consultation and negotiation. Since 1995, OFT has secured some 900 undertakings from businesses not to use unfair terms. These undertakings govern the use of some 5,000 unfair terms. In only one case, that of 'Director General of Fair Trading <i>v.</i> First National Bank', has the OFT had to take legal action to stop the use of a term it considered unfair. In that case, the House of Lords reversed the decision of the Court of Appeal and decided that the term in question was not unfair.

 Under the Stop Now Orders (EC Directive) Regulations 2001, there have been 26 undertakings (12 by the Office of Fair Trading and 14 by Trading Standards authorities) received against business breaching consumer protection legislation.

(3) what measures her Department will take <i>(a)</i> to ensure transparency in commercial dealings between supermarkets and their suppliers and <i>(b)</i> to prohibit below-cost selling by supermarkets.  [125685]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30716w21.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Sutcliffe </B> 
<i> [holding answers 14 July 2003]: </i>The Competition Commission (CC) monopoly report 'Supermarkets: A Report on the Supply of Groceries from multiple stores in the United Kingdom' was published on 10 October 2000. The CC concluded that the practice of persistent below-cost selling when conducted by supermarkets with market power, operates against the public interest. However, the CC stated that remedies to prevent below cost selling would require monitoring and intervention that would be disproportionate to the adverse effects they were designed to remedy. Therefore the CC made no recommendations for remedial action.
<P>

<a name="30716w21.html_para6">Following the CC's report, the four supermarkets with a market share of 8 per cent. or over (Sainsbury, Asda Wal-Mart, Tesco and Safeway) gave legally binding undertakings to comply with a Code of Practice governing relations with their suppliers. The Code is intended to provide a framework for dealings between supermarkets and their suppliers. Terms of business must be transparent and available in writing.
<P>

<a name="30716w21.html_para7">Supermarkets will not be able to change agreed terms without giving the supplier notice or compensation. The Code also includes a provision for an independent mediator, paid for by the supermarkets, to resolve disputes about the Code if the parties cannot do so themselves.
<P>

<a name="30716w21.html_para8">The Office of Fair Trading is currently reviewing the Supermarket Code of Practice. They are expected to report later this summer. My right hon.

<P>
<a name="30716w21.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Hewitt  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 11 July 2003]:</i> The EU Waste Electrical and Electronic Directive (the WEEE Directive) does not prevent the reuse or refilling of printer cartridges.
<P>

<a name="30716w21.html_para9">A number of printer ink and toner cartridge refill businesses have raised the concern, following a recent press article, that their operations may be put at risk if the scope of the Directive does not include these goods. My Department is looking at the points they have raised, bearing in mind our support for the reuse of printer cartridges and our desire to see this continue. My officials will shortly be meeting representatives of the cartridge recycling industry to explore their concerns.
<P>

<a name="30716w21.html_para10">The refill industry has raised with us concerns related to existing technology applied to some of the goods currently sold, which prevents reuse. However, the WEEE Directive does not affect this.
<P>

<a name="30716w21.html_para11">The European Commission has made clear that printer cartridges do not fall within the scope of the WEEE Directive, but considers that forthcoming EU legislation on eco-design may address the issues here. The Government agree with this assessment. In the meantime, if the spread of new technology specifically to prevent reuse begins to impinge significantly on the independent refill market, I would want to consider what additional action might be warranted.

<P>
<a name="30716w22.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Pearson: </B> 
 I believe the agreement that has been reached is a good deal for Northern Ireland farmers. It creates a long term stable policy environment and will introduce a new era for the farming industry, with a much greater emphasis on production in response to the market. The option to fully decouple subsidies will free producers from farming for subsidies and provide a much more market-orientated approach. The days when farmers had to maintain, sometimes at a loss, a certain number of cattle or sheep to qualify for subsidies will shortly be at an end.
<P>

<a name="30716w22.html_para1">Most importantly, the provision for regional discretion gives Northern Ireland sufficient flexibility in the implementation of the new arrangements to ensure outcomes which reflect fully the needs of its agricultural industry.

 It is difficult to make an accurate comparison between the pay of doctors in the Defence Medical Services (DMS) and doctors in the NHS serving in Band three posts as this would depend on a number of factors, such as their stage of training and their incremental level on the pay structure. Account would also need to be taken of the X-factor paid to DMS doctors, the non-contributory nature of the armed forces pension scheme and the fact that DMS junior doctors' pay includes an element for NHS out of hours payments.

 There has been no recent specific investigation into alcohol consumption levels in the armed forces. The armed forces employ vigorous education programmes&#151;including pamphlets, films and lectures&#151;at all stages of military training and Service to promote sensible drinking, and to ensure that personnel are aware of the dangers of alcohol misuse. The programmes are regularly reviewed and updated as necessary, and are complemented by administrative and disciplinary measures to deter alcohol misuse within the Services.

In addition, there have been an unknown number of telephone calls to the Ministry of Defence about the new medal.

<a name="30716w28.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 The question of whether of not to legalise euthanasia was considered in great detail by the House of Lords Select Committee on Medical Ethics, reporting in 1994. The Committee concluded that the practice of euthanasia could not be supported, partly because of the difficulties in setting secure limits on voluntary euthanasia and also because of concerns that vulnerable people might feel pressure, whether real or imagined, to request early death. The Government's position has been that it shares the views of the Committee, that any proposal to change the law in this area would need to be considered very carefully and that we have no plans to change the current law.

 I have not yet had discussions with particular local authorities regarding the funding of care homes. I am, however, aware that the care home sector has been experiencing financial difficulties. That is why we are giving local councils record levels of funding. 



<P>
<P><I>16 Jul 2003 : Column 408W</I><P>
Resources for social services have increased by 20 per cent. in real terms between 1996&#150;97 and 2002&#150;03, an average of over 3 per cent. per annum and will continue to increase over the next three years by an average of 6 per cent. per annum in real terms.

 <i>[holding answer 15 July 2003]:</i> The Department has not issued formal guidance to care home providers about what to do when the processing application of the application for a criminal record disclosure takes longer than normal. Under the Care Standards Act all care homes in England are regulated by the National Care Standards Commission (NCSC). It is for the NCSC to satisfy itself that care homes conform to statutory requirements and the commission provides appropriate guidance to providers on meeting the requirements.
<P>

<a name="30716w28.html_para5">The performance of the Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) has now greatly improved. In the week ending 5 July, the CRB issued 95 per cent. of standard disclosures within two weeks and 94 per cent. of enhanced disclosures within four weeks, against a service standard of 90 per cent. in each case.
<P>

<a name="30716w28.html_para6">However, for those occasions when, for whatever reason, the issue of a disclosure may take longer than normal the NCSC has published guidance for care provider. This is available on its website at www.carestandards.org.uk.

 The national health service has faced some minor problems when recruiting new staff&#151;as a result of the operating difficulties at the Criminal Records Bureau (CRB). We have agreed a number of arrangements with the CRB to expedite the clearance of disclosure applications for NHS staff. The performance of the CRB has now greatly improved. In the week ending 5 July, the CRB issued 95 per cent., of standard disclosures within two weeks and 94 per cent. of enhanced disclosures within four weeks, against a service standard of 90 per cent. in each case. These arrangements and the CRB's improved performance has enabled the NHS to manage delays at the CRB without any significant adverse effect on patient services.

 Two areas, acute and primary care, were surveyed as part of the National 2002 Patient Survey Programme. The results have been disseminated on a strategic health authority (SHA) basis. This will allow for the cross-comparison of both the acute and the primary care data for local benchmarking purposes. The approach enables SHAs to maintain an overview of how results are formulated into local follow-up plans.

 Figures for the cost to the national health service of treating obesity related health problems in the last five years are not available. However, the National Audit Office (NAO) report, "Tackling Obesity in England", published in February 2001, estimated that the direct cost to the NHS of treating obesity in 1998 was &#163;9.4 million. The NAO also estimated that treating the consequences of obesity cost the NHS approximately&#163;469.9 million for 1998.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30716w32.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The healthcare co-ordination arrangements contained in Regulations (EEC) 1408/71 and 574/72 apply in all the member states of the European Economic Area (EEA) and Switzerland. The United Kingdom also has bilateral healthcare arrangements with more than 30 non-EEA countries and territories.
<P>

<a name="30716w32.html_para2">A fundamental principle underlying all the arrangements is that emergency treatment is provided under the state healthcare scheme to entitled visitors on the same terms as it is available to insured residents of the host country. Most countries and territories make some charges for some services.

 The cost of the venues for the recruitment seminars that were held in Austria in May was &#163;7,587 and the cost of the venues for the Italian seminars, held in June, was &#163;6,718. The recruitment seminars in Germany in May were held in Foreign and Commonwealth buildings and therefore only incurred minimal catering costs. The Department of Health has received 181 new applications from doctors, as a result of these seminars.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30716w32.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 All doctors who describe themselves as medical practitioners must be registered with the General Medical Council (GMC). To become a consultant in plastic surgery in the national health service, a doctor must have a Certificate of Completion of Specialist Training in the specialty.
<P>

<a name="30716w32.html_para4">In the private healthcare sector, regulation by the National Care Standards Commission requires surgeons carrying out cosmetic surgery to be registered with the GMC. Those beginning to practise in the private sector after 1 April 2002 are required to be on the specialist register. Plastic surgeons who were already practising in the private sector at the time the new legislation came into force are allowed to continue practising, provided that they meet other stringent standards in qualification and training.

<P>
<P>

 There are currently 294 chairs of primary care trusts and 1,624 non-executive board members. Eight of the chairs and 73 of the non-executive board members are disabled.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health pursuant to his Answer of 19 June 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 174&#150;75W, on Purley Hospital, what his definition of the Croydon South locality is; and what the maximum population is that the new hospital will serve.  [124907]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30716w32.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The proposed new Purley Hospital is primarily focused on the south of Croydon, geographically defined by the electoral wards of Kenley, Purley, Coulsdon West, Coulsdon East, Sanderstead and Chroam. In practice, some planned services will serve a slightly larger population and some a smaller population dependent on the service.

<a name="30716w32.html_sbhd9"><H3 align=center>Salt</H3>


<P>
<P>
<a name="30716w32.html_wqn10"><B> Mr. Hancock: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health what research he has commissioned on the savings to the NHS which might follow from a reduction in the average adult intake of salt to no more than six grams per day; and if he will make a statement.  [122804]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30716w32.html_spnew10"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 Population average salt intake in the United Kingdom is currently around 9g per day. Previous studies have suggested that a reduction in salt intake from 9g to 6g per day would reduce diastolic pressure in the region of 2mm Hg.
<P>

<a name="30716w32.html_para5">The recently published Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (SACN) report on Salt and Health (2003) states that, "On a population basis it has been estimated that a reduction of 2mm Hg in diastolic blood pressure 



<P>
<P><I>16 Jul 2003 : Column 424W</I><P>
would result in 15 per cent. reduction in risk of stroke and transient ischaemic heart attacks and a 6 per cent. reduction in risk of coronary heart disease (Cook et al 1995). McPherson et al (2002) have estimated that 6 per cent. of deaths from coronary heart disease could be avoided if the numbers of people with high blood pressure were reduced by 50 per cent.".
<P>

<a name="30716w32.html_para6">The Department has not calculated the impact of salt reduction on national health service costs. Identifying savings attributable solely to a single intervention such as salt reduction would be extremely difficult. However, the benefits to health are clear, and based on the estimates from the SACN report, there could be substantial cost benefit to the NHS.

 The 1998 White Paper "Smoking Kills" set a target to reduce smoking among 11 to 15-year-olds from 13 per cent. in 1996 to 9 per cent. by 2010 with a fall to 11 per cent. by 2005.
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will publish the review commissioned by UKXIRA from Professor Sheila McLean into xenotransplantation; and if he will make a statement.  [125181]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30716w33.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 The Department of Health commissioned a series of three reviews on different aspects of xenotransplantation on behalf of the United Kingdom Xenotransplantation Interim Regulatory Authority (UKXIRA) between 1999 and 2001. The first two&#151;on infection and on physiology&#151;were published 2001 and 2002. A third review, on the legal and ethical aspects of xenotransplantation, was commissioned from Professor Sheila McLean of the University of Glasgow, who was also a member of the UKXIRA from 1997 to 2002.
<P>

<a name="30716w33.html_para2">The UKXIRA has considered the review and concluded that it made some useful discussion points and that the summary of the research papers should be placed on the UKXIRA website. While there are no plans to publish Professor McLean's whole review as a Department of Health/UKXIRA document, Professor McLean is free to publish it if she wishes.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30716w33.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 The United Kingdom Xenotransplantation Interim Regulatory Authority was established in 1997 to advise the Government on the acceptability of specific applications to undertake xenotransplantation procedures (the transplantation of live cells, tissues and organs from a non-human source into a human). It also acts as a focal point for xenotransplantation issues. Organisations undertaking research into xenotransplantation in the United Kingdom are required to comply with all relevant legislation. No clinical trials involving humans have yet been approved in the UK and currently no relevant organ transplant research is licensed in the UK under the Animals (Science Procedures) Act 1986.

 Along with other Government Departments, the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) has consulted with the Home Office in respect of the possible introduction of an entitlement card scheme. A very high-level consideration of impacts upon the Departments business, should the entitlement card scheme be introduced, has been made. Our initial considerations have focused upon the potential application of the National Insurance number (NINO) to the scheme, and to impacts upon our current and future business processes.

 The investigation of fraud leads to savings in two ways. The detection of fraud already in the system prevents further losses in those cases and secondly our work to tackle fraud acts as a deterrent to prevent potential fraud happening in the first place. It is therefore not possible to provide an estimate of the total savings resulting from our anti-fraud work.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. Administrative penalties, as an alternative to prosecution, were introduced by the Social Security Administration (Fraud) Act (1997) with effect from December 1998. Cautions were made available to local authorities as a sanction from the start of 2001&#150;02.<P>

2. Figures for financial years 1997&#150;98 to 2000&#150;01 are taken from local authority management information returns. It is possible that there could be some double counting with DWP data if there were cases which involved a joint prosecution.<P>

3. Management information data for financial years 1997&#150;98 to 2000&#150;01 is not available for all local authorities. The total for Great Britain includes estimates for local authorities that have not responded. These estimates are based on historical and regional data. This type of estimate is standard practice in reporting totals where there have been non-respondents. The figures for financial years 1997&#150;98 to 2000&#150;01 have been rounded to two significant figures.<P>

4. Information for 2001&#150;02 is from a count of prosecutions and sanctions completed by all local authorities; this data is collected from local authority subsidy returns. Subsidy data may differ from management information data (shown for financial years 1997&#150;98 to 2000&#150;01) at local authority level; however, analysis shows a high level of consistency between the two data sources at national level.<P>

5. The DWP figures are from the Fraud Information By Sector database, which shows completed cases commenced in the relevant period. Due to the elapsed time between commencement of an investigation and completion of a prosecution there are cases that are inserted into previously completed data for earlier periods. All DWP totals are therefore correct at the time when quoted but subject to adjustment at a later date.<P>

6. In accordance with National Statistics Guidelines all DWP figures are rounded to the nearest 10. Due to rounding process totals may not agree.<P>

 The measurement of fraud and error is complex and expensive and as such it is concentrated on benefits with the highest expenditure and risk of loss, such as housing benefit. Information on the cost of fraud and error is not available for council tax benefit. However, the measures that we are taking to fight fraud and error in housing benefit will also serve to improve the accuracy of council tax benefit.

The letters include the number of the freephone application line (0800 99 1234) and a separate textphone number (0800 169 0133). By June 2004, all pensioner households will have been contacted in this way. The two numbers will also be included in an advertising campaign scheduled to begin in September 2003. The application line will have around 1,500 whole-time equivalent staff when pension credit is implemented in October 2003.

<P>
<a name="30716w35.html_spnew11"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 The Occupational Pensions Regulatory Authority (Opra) regulates compliance with the Stakeholder Pensions workplace access requirements by responding to whistleblowers' reports and by using surveys targeted by region and business sector. When cases of non-compliance come to light, Opra focuses on working with the employer to rectify the situation rather than taking a merely punitive approach. Since the requirements came into force on 8 October 2001, Opra has received 440 reports concerning the stakeholder access requirements. To date, 427 of these cases have been closed, either because, as a result of Opra and the employer working together, full compliance was achieved, or because the employer proved to be exempt from the requirements. The remaining 13 cases are still under investigation by Opra.

 Under the Fatal Accidents Act 1976, an opposite sex cohabitant of a person who has died as a result of another person's negligence is entitled to claim for financial loss as a dependant if he or she had lived with the deceased partner for at least two years prior to the death.

 The Secretary of State and I are most concerned about possible abuses of the legal aid system. However we are confident that the Legal Services Commission (LSC) has strong controls and measures in place to prevent and investigate fraud and abuse of the legal aid system.
<P>

<a name="30716w36.html_para4">The LSC has established procedures for handling cases where allegations of fraudulent behaviour by suppliers, and clients seeking funding are made and for taking appropriate action where fraud or abuse is uncovered.
<P>

<a name="30716w36.html_para5">The reforms underpinned by the Access to Justice Act 1999 have significantly strengthened the control of fraud and abuse by suppliers. All suppliers who wish to provide publicly funded legal services are required to work to a contract and to comply with the LSC's quality standards. The LSC reorganised its Investigations Section in 2002&#150;03 to reflect the fact that fraud control is increasingly achieved via contract management audits, which are the responsibility of the regional offices. Firm action has and is being taken on a number of firms where abuses have been uncovered, including the termination of contracts. The LSC is also working jointly with The Law Society and the Office of the Immigration Services Commissioner to actively investigate recent evidence of abuse by way of giving out inducements to asylum seekers at ports of entry. LSC action includes carrying out special audits of firms and the investigation is still continuing.
<P>

<a name="30716w36.html_para6">The LSC is also committed to actively investigating where doubts arise about whether a funded client is financially eligible for funding. These investigations are conducted by the LSC's Special Investigations Unit, which also assists regional offices with the means assessment of applicants for funding whose financial positions are complex.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Department for Constitutional Affairs what process was in place to decide who was offered silk prior to the review of the system announced earlier this year; and if he will make a statement.  [125200]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30716w37.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Leslie: </B> 
 The selection process for Queen's Counsel prior to the announcement of the review was as follows:
<P>

<a name="30716w37.html_para1"><i>Application</i>
<P>

<a name="30716w37.html_para2">Applications were made annually through an advertisement and through the departmental website. The advertisement has for many years usually appeared in early September, and the list of successful applicants was published the following Maundy Thursday.
<P>

<a name="30716w37.html_para3"><i>Consultation</i>
<P>

<a name="30716w37.html_para4">Much of the Queen's Counsel exercise was conducted by means of written consultation. Written views were automatically sought from the judiciary, specialist legal associations and other senior practitioners. Applicants were invited to nominate up to six names from the list of automatic consultees who were best placed to provide comments against the criteria. They were also requested to nominate a further six consultees of their own choosing.
<P>

<a name="30716w37.html_para5">Meetings were held with the Heads of Supreme Court Divisions; the judges in charge of the Commercial Court, the Administrative Court and the Technology and Construction Court; the Presiding Judges; Family Division Liaison Judges; Circuit Leaders and the Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the Bar Council. Meetings were occasionally also held to clarify a consultee's views or, where a consultee has consulted others, the degree of consensus.
<P>

<a name="30716w37.html_para6"><i>Sift</i>
<P>

<a name="30716w37.html_para7">Following the consultation period, departmental officials conducted a sift of all applicants, to establish how far the evidence demonstrated that they met the criteria for appointment to the required standard. All marks and comments were given individual consideration. No single comment or mark could, in itself, cause an application to fail.
<P>

<a name="30716w37.html_para8">The sift was a three-stage process. First, departmental officials working independently of each other prepared a written assessment of the evidence. The second stage consisted of two panels, each comprising a senior official and a lay member. The panels reviewed the applications and classified them according to the strength of the evidence that the applicant met the criteria for appointment. The third stage was moderation by Legal and Judicial Services Group's most senior officials to ensure a consistent standard of decision making and recording.
<P>

<a name="30716w37.html_para9">The results were presented to the Lord Chancellor in the form of a long list. This list was divided into categories relating to circuit or practice type. It summarised the evidence on every applicant who appeared to meet the criteria to the required standard, dividing them into four groups according to the strength of the evidence. The long list also included the name of any other applicant whose fees were in the upper quartile for their particular practice type or circuit. The Lord Chancellor was provided with the detailed comments received for each applicant who appeared in 



<P>
<P><I>16 Jul 2003 : Column 441W</I><P>
the long list. He was provided with the names of, and the full comments received on, all ethnic minority, female, and solicitor applicants and those who had a specialist practice on provincial circuits. He also received a separate note of those not included in the long list and a brief summary of the reasons. This material enabled the Lord Chancellor and those he consulted to check the validity of the decision to exclude any of the applicants in the above categories from the Long List.
<P>

<a name="30716w37.html_para10"><i>Appointment</i>
<P>

<a name="30716w37.html_para11">The Lord Chancellor personally considered the long list and additional detailed material. He did not confine his consideration to the long list alone and based his final recommendations on all the material available to him. Following his initial consideration, he held separate meetings to discuss the applications with the Law Officers and the heads of Supreme Court divisions and their senior judicial colleagues, who also received copies of the same material. The Lord Chancellor then decided which applicants to recommend to the Queen for appointment.
<P>

<a name="30716w37.html_para12">There was no limit to the numbers of new Queen's Counsel who could be appointed in a particular year, nor was there a quota of appointments to be filled. The Lord Chancellor made his recommendations for appointment on the basis of the calibre of each individual applicant, as reflected in the views given in that year's round. All applicants who fulfilled the published criteria to the necessary high standard were recommended for appointment.
<P>

<a name="30716w37.html_para13"><i>Feedback</i>
<P>

<a name="30716w37.html_para14">Unsuccessful applicants were encouraged to discuss the outcome of their application with a senior member of Legal and Judicial Services Group. Feedback was 



<P>
<P><I>16 Jul 2003 : Column 442W</I><P>
given in confidence and usually by telephone. The aim of the feedback discussion was to help applicants to understand why they were not appointed by reference to the degree of support received and the tenor of the views obtained. They were given a full account of the comments received, edited only to the extent necessary to preserve the confidentiality of the source.
<P>

<a name="30716w37.html_para15"><i>Complaints</i>
<P>

<a name="30716w37.html_para16">The Department explored any issues of concern to the applicant during the feedback process. If there remained unresolved problems, applicants were encouraged to write to the Director General, Legal and Judicial Services Group or the Lord Chancellor.
<P>

<a name="30716w37.html_para17">If the applicant remained dissatisfied with the way his or her application had been considered, he or she could lodge a complaint with the Commissioner for Judicial Appointments, who would investigate complaints of discrimination, unfairness or maladministration in the way the procedures had been applied.

 Professional rules prohibit solicitors or their agents making unsolicited visits or telephone calls to members of the public. In addition, The Law Society has issued guidance in respect of immigration advice which prohibits solicitors or those acting on their behalf approaching people arriving at ports of entry. The breach of the rule and guidance is a disciplinary matter for the Law Society.
