<p><a name="40907w01.html_spnew0"><b> Ms Hewitt: </b> 
 The celebration and evaluation of the 10 years since the Beijing Platform for Action will be an integral part of the UK Government&#039;s work on gender equality in 2005. The 49th Session of the Commission for the Status for Women (CSW) at the United Nations in March 2005 will review and appraise the implementation of Beijing over the last 10 years. The cross-Whitehall UK Government delegation will actively participate at CSW. We have already begun feeding into this process, completing a United Nations questionnaire on progress made since 1995 in the UK (available at www.womenandequalityunit.gov.uk), which will feed into the UN Secretary-General&#039;s report. During the UK Presidency of the EU, July to December 2005, we will host a major European conference and a Ministerial Informal meeting to consider best practice across the EU in relation to national implementation of the Beijing Platform. The UK Government are a strong advocate of the Beijing Platform for Action and UN initiatives to further gender equality.

The Commission is aware that, following the Scottish Parliament (Constituencies) Act 2004 receiving Royal Assent on 22 July, it is no longer under a duty to review the regional boundaries for the Scottish Parliament. In light of its progress so far, it seems likely that the Commission will report much sooner than its deadline, but the timing is a matter for it.

 Staff working in the Wales Office before June 2003 were on secondment or loan from other Departments&#151;predominantly from the National Assembly for Wales.

 In the UK National Allocation Plan, sectors that are subject to international competition have been allocated according to projected need.

<p><a name="40907w03.html_spnew5"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 DFID is in regular contact with the Kenyan Government on the issue of corruption and its impact on our development assistance. DFID&#039;s Kenya Country Assistance Plan recognises that poverty reduction budget support is the Government of Kenya&#039;s preferred form of aid. It also makes clear that the level of British aid to Kenya, and whether or not we will provide bilateral poverty reduction budget support, will depend on the pace with which the Kenyan Government implements its Economic Recovery Strategy, especially in tackling corruption, preparing and implementing budgets that benefit the poor, and strengthening public financial management. Progress is not yet sufficient to enable us to provide such support. This point was most recently reinforced in a meeting with President Kibaki on 1 September.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40907w03.html_para1">
We are particularly concerned about recent reports of corruption allegedly involving senior members of the Kenyan Government and have urged President Kibaki, in previous meetings, to ensure that appropriate and firm action is taken to investigate these reports, make the results public and take appropriate action against all those found to have acted corruptly. Some progress is being made, i.e. in the establishment of anti-corruption institutions, but it still remains to be seen whether this will lead to decisive action in the short-term.
</p>

<p><a name="40907w04.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Gareth Thomas: </b> 
 The European Commission presented a communication to the Agriculture Council on 19 July that set out their preferred option for reform. The communication proposes to substantially reduce sugar exports and export refunds, abolish intervention, reduce ELI production and the internal sugar price and grant a de-coupled payment to sugar beet farmers. The reform process will start in July 2005. This should make the regime more market oriented and reduce the quantity of EU sugar exported to third markets. If the option were to be agreed, the Commission estimate that the combined, aggregate effect of the proposals on support price and quota reduction would be a significant reduction in the level of EU production under quota, from 17.3 million to 14.5 million tonnes per year. In turn, as a consequence of the substantial reduction in the overall level of EU production, EU subsidised sugar exports dumping are projected to fall by around 2 million tonnes. The Commission communication will be the subject of discussion between the EU Member States over the coming months.

 DFID has always stressed the need to take account of the impact that reform of the EU sugar regime will have on our developing country preferential suppliers.

 The Department for International Development&#039;s (DFID) engagement in Vietnam since 1997 has focused on supporting the Vietnamese Government in implementing its own strategies for poverty reduction. In their five-year plans, the Government of Vietnam has highlighted the severe poverty issues facing the Central Highlands where the majority of the Montagnard people live.

From 1997 to 2003 DFID&#039;s strategy focused on working with other donors.

The projects focus on greater participation by poor people in planning and monitoring services, which should ensure that the services provided are more appropriate and of better quality.

In addition to the co-financed ADB projects mentioned above, DFID is currently addressing the development needs of the Montagnard people through co-financing a number of national programmes, which include Central Highlands provinces, districts and communes along with those in other poor areas of Vietnam. In education, our two national programmes with the World Bank, Primary Education for Disadvantaged Children and Primary Teachers Development Project, are strengthening the capacity of local government to improve the quality of primary education for all children. In transport, DFID is working with the World Bank to improve access to rural roads for poor people and building Government capacity to monitor and forecast associated recurrent budget costs.

 Within the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, local authorities are required to work with the police to conduct a review of levels and patterns of crime and disorder. They are then required to consult widely with key agencies, community groups, charities (such as Help the Aged and Age Concern) and the community about these findings. Each of the 376 Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships across England and Wales conduct resident surveys on a variety of issues to find out what people&#039;s concerns are, and then act on them as necessary. The survey covers a whole spectrum of residents from young people to older people.

In addition, the Fear of Crime Team within the Home Office have presented to, and facilitated, workshops at the Help the Aged National and Regional Senior Safety Conferences, developed and published a vulnerability strategy which identifies and addresses fear of crime issues among older people, and developed Fear of Crime reassurance cards, which challenge misperceptions about local crime issues.

<p><a name="40907w07.html_spnew6"><b> Paul Goggins  </b> 
<i>[holding answer 20 July 2004]:</i> The Sexual Offences Act 2003 introduced a new civil preventative order; the sexual offences prevention order (SOPO). A court may make a SOPO against someone with a conviction or caution for a relevant sexual offence (those listed in schedules 3 or 5 to the Act) where it is satisfied that such an order is necessary to protect the 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>7 Sept 2004 : Column 959W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
public or any particular member of the public from serious sexual harm from the defendant. A SOPO prohibits the offender from doing anything described in the order. This means protecting the public from serious physical or psychological harm caused by the defendant committing one or more of the offences listed in schedule 3.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40907w07.html_para3">
It is possible that a court could make a SOPO that would limit the use of credit or debit cards by the offender, if it was thought that limiting this use would protect the public from serious sexual harm. For example, a SOPO could prohibit an offender from making online purchases. Such a restriction would have to be compatible with a defendant&#039;s rights under Article 8 of the Convention.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40907w07.html_para4">
Statistics on the forms of prohibitions contained in SOPOs are not held by the Home Office.

In addition, the Home Office has been working closely with the Association for Payment Clearing Services (APACS), who have a clear policy that acquiring banks routinely monitor the transaction activity of their internet merchants, and that they will not knowingly do business with sites that sell content inciting, advocating or perpetuating violence against persons, including scenes of sexual assault.

<i>[holding answer 22 July 2004]</i>: No departmental review of smoking in prison workplaces (where this is permitted) and prisoner smoking is planned. Governors are still operating under Instruction to Governors 16 of 1996, which instructs them where to ban smoking in prisons and gives them discretionary powers to extend this ban to other parts of the prison. Smoking policies are included in the Health and Safety Standard and are audited by the Prison Service Standards Audit Unit.

There are well tried and tested emergency plans to deal with a release of radioactive material from Sellafield&#039;s nuclear facilities. These plans are maintained under the licence condition arrangements for all such sites and have been reviewed and tested at regular intervals over many years. The off-site emergency plan, prepared by Cumbria county council in consultation with the emergency services and British Nuclear Group, has been published in accordance with the Radiation (Emergency Preparedness and Public Information) Regulations 2001. The plan covers procedures, facilities and equipment, and includes evacuation arrangements. REPPIR is monitored and enforced by the Health and Safety Executive.

There is an ongoing programme of regular off-site exercises for civil nuclear installations such as Sellafield. These test the local off-site facility for each site, and involve a wide range of local and national agencies. The last such exercise at Sellafield was held on 24 September 2003 and this tested all aspects of Cumbria county council&#039;s off-site emergency plan which clearly covers evacuation aspects. The lessons of off-site nuclear exercises are taken forward locally through a standing local Emergency Planning Consultative Committee. Any issues of national relevance are taken forward through the Nuclear Emergency Planning Liaison Group, which is administered and chaired by DTI, and are fed as appropriate into central Government&#039;s contingency planning.

The marked increases in travel costs since 2001 can be largely attributed to changes in strategy within the Immigration and Nationality Directorate (IND) where increased staff numbers and the need to travel as a result of new policy initiatives and targets for improved IND performance. Other contributing factors have been related to providing advice to the organisers of the 2002 Football World Cup in Japan and Euro 2004 in Portugal and the creation of new units to support the police reform agenda.

 There is no specific requirement for police forces to inform parents, schools or an education institute when alcohol is removed from children or pupils under the under-age drinking legislation. A decision to inform parents or an education institute is an operational matter for individual police forces.

[187012]</p>









<p><a name="40907w11.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Miliband: </b> 
 I am not aware of any representations having been received regarding the matter referred in the question other than your letter to the Secretary of State dated 21 July 2004. Essex LEA is working closely with the school to ensure that suitable accommodation is available to the Alderman Blaxill Secondary School for the new school year. The bulk of schools capital is now allocated by formula to authorities and schools so that they can address their local priorities, including accommodation issues. Prioritisation of need should be through an open, rigorous and consultative asset management process, based on assessments of the needs of all schools. This Government have increased their support for capital investment in schools from under &#163;700 million in 1996&#150;97 to &#163;3.8 billion this year and this will increase further to over &#163;5 billion by 2005&#150;06.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what research he has commissioned regarding the school exclusion rates of <i>(a)</i> autistic students and <i>(b)</i> students with Asperger&#039;s Syndrome; and if he will make a statement on his policy on whether autistic students should remain in mainstream schools.  [186943]</p>








<p><a name="40907w11.html_spnew5"><b> Margaret Hodge: </b> 
 The statistics published by the Department do not record the types of special educational need (SEN), such as autism and Asperger&#039;s syndrome, which excluded pupils with SEN have. The most recent provisional statistics, for 2002/03, do show that children with SEN, both those with and without statements of SEN, account for two-thirds of permanent exclusions and that children with SEN were nine times more likely to be permanently excluded than those without SEN. As part of the SEN strategy &quot;Removing Barriers to Achievement&quot;, published in 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>7 Sept 2004 : Column 975W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
February, we are carrying out research into exclusions and children with SEN, including those with autistic spectrum disorders (ASDs), and we will act on its findings.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40907w11.html_para8">
Research by the National Autistic Society in 2000 suggested that children with ASDs, including Asperger&#039;s syndrome, were far more likely to be excluded than their peers. The Society is represented on our Autism Working Group which produced Good Practice Guidance on ASDs in 2002. This guidance aims to raise awareness of the disorders and to give good practice pointers to schools, local education authorities and others to help develop and audit their autism provision. It is available to assist schools make the reasonable adjustments to their policies and practice with respect to children with ASDs required by the Disability Discrimination Act 1995, as amended by the Special Educational Needs and Disability Act 2001, which they need to consider when meeting their duty not to discriminate against disabled pupils, without justification, by excluding them because of behaviour caused by their disability.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40907w11.html_para9">
Children with autism display a range of strengths and difficulties of differing levels of severity and complexity. Those with SEN statements should be placed in a setting where their profile of needs can be met. The Good Practice Guidance recommends that LEAs, either singly or in regional groupings, should develop a range of provision in mainstream, special and specialist schools so that children with statements can be placed appropriately with the placement being monitored and changed as necessary.

<p><a name="40907w12.html_wqn0"><b> Mr. Woodward: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what the Government&#039;s policy is on extending child care provision; and what plans the Government have to extend child care provision.  [186813]</p>









<p><a name="40907w12.html_spnew0"><b> Margaret Hodge: </b> 
 Between 1997 and 2004 the Government aimed to create around 900,000 new child care places to help 1,600,000 children. By March 2004 some 1,000,000 new child care places had been created helping some 1,800,000 children. The Government have a target to create a further 250,000 new child care places for at least 450,000 children by March 2006 and to increase the stock of registered child care places across England by at least 10 per cent. by March 2008.


</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what the Government&#039;s policy is on the promotion of the National Childcare Strategy; and what plans the Government has to extend the strategy.  [186814]</p>








<p><a name="40907w12.html_spnew1"><b> Margaret Hodge: </b> 
 The National Childcare Strategy is promoted, as part of the Government&#039;s Sure Start programme, through a variety of channels and campaigns, targeting parents and those working with parents and children. These include: articles in the daily, local and specialist press; leaflets available in locations such as health centres, Job Centres and Post Offices, and sent to Sure Start programmes, health visitors, midwives and employment advisers; publications such as the &quot;Choosing Childcare&quot; booklet; and National Sure Start 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>7 Sept 2004 : Column 976W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
Month held each June. Children&#039;s Information Services (CISs) in each of the 150 local authorities provide detail and advice to parents on Childcare and other Sure Start programmes in their areas.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40907w12.html_para0">
The Government are continuing to expand and strengthen Childcare provision. Our PSA Target is 10 per cent. growth in the stock of registered places between 2004 and 2008. The Department for Education and Skills &quot;Five Year Strategy for Children and Learners&quot; (published on 8 July) makes clear that much of the future expansion will be provided on school premises, or in integrated children&#039;s centres, so child care becomes part of a web of personalised services, including good quality health and family support, that best suits families and their children. We will link the free early education entitlement for 3 and 4-year-olds more effectively with the hours of child care for which parents pay, to offer integrated education and care for a full day, while extended schools&#151;both primary and secondary&#151;will provide, or host, a wide range of services, including child care and a range of family learning and parental support, on-site.

<p>

In addition, the Chancellor confirmed in his &quot;Spending Review&quot; 2004 statement that the Government will publish a plan in the pre-Budget report later this year outlining our vision of choice for parents and high quality provision for young children for the period up to 2015.

<p><a name="40907w13.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Miliband: </b> 
 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Education and Skills receives many representations on a variety of issues. The academies programme is specifically designed to address the intractable problems of poor standards of teaching and learning, under-achievement and low aspirations in the most socially and economically deprived parts of the country.
</p>

It will take time for the new leadership, buildings and curriculum to turn things round. However, of the three academies with GCSE results in 2003 the number of 5A*&#150;C grades rose to 21 per cent. and 35 per cent. respectively from 7 per cent. and 25 per cent. in 2002, and the other had results broadly comparable with its predecessor schools. Academies are also improving behaviour and attendance.

 My Department is undertaking a radical transformation in its role and ways of working to deliver the ambitious agenda for reform set out in the Five Year Strategy for Children and Learners. Putting people at the heart of public services, building on the existing significant progress and substantial achievement, these changes will enable us to reduce the department&#039;s staffing levels and provide strategic leadership to the system, working with our partners and delivering resources to the front line to ensure the further improvements we are determined to secure in the services that we provide for children, young people adults and families.

As can be seen from the figures, spend on advertising fluctuates from year to year. Some campaigns will run over financial years and billing will fall in the later period. The increase in Public Relations (PR) relates to an increase in the use of external organisations to contact those elements of our key audiences that prove more difficult to reach through traditional advertising methods. Examples of this are in the promotion of adult basic skills, Aimhigher and Connexions. Since 2001&#150;02, the Department has changed its approach by concentrating on having fewer, larger, more focused communications, such as that for adult basic skills (to help adults improve their reading, writing, language and maths) instead of numerous smaller campaigns.

We do not hold information centrally on the numbers of excluded pupils unable to access a place in school. However, from September 2002 all local education authorities (LEAs) have been committed to providing suitable full-time education for permanently excluded pupils from the sixteenth day of their exclusion. Since then all but a handful of LEAs have met this commitment. Currently only two LEAs are not meeting it and the Department is working with them to help them achieve it.

Notes:<br>

1. Net current expenditure (NCE) includes expenditure within schools and also that incurred centrally by the LEA. This is divided by the number of pupils educated in mainstream schools to calculate a unit cost.<br>

2. Section 52 is collected at local authority level, not constituency level, so the figures provided are for Norfolk LEA.<br>

3. 1999&#150;2000 figures reflect the return of GM schools to local authority maintenance.<br>

4. The outturn 2002&#150;03 tables captured the data in a fundamentally different way to the previous years. Categories were aligned with the Consistent Financial Reporting framework and the spending by LEAs was no longer split by school sector. This change in calculation is identified by the dotted line. The 2002&#150;03 figure is calculated by taking all the LEA expenditure, excluding CERA and Youth and Community, and dividing it by the FTE pupil numbers in maintained pre-primary, primary, secondary and special schools.<br>

5. Data as reported by Norfolk LEA as at 22 July 2004.<br>

6. Figures are reported in Cash Terms and are rounded to the nearest &#163;10.<br>

7. The financial data are taken from Norfolk LEAs&#039; Section 52 Outturn Statement submitted to the DfES from 1999&#150;2000 onwards and the ODPM&#039;s RO1 statement previously. 2002&#150;03 data remains provisional and is subject to change by the LEA.<br>

8. Pupil data are drawn from the Annual Schools Census adjusted to be on a financial year basis.<br>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what the change in <i>(a)</i> basic skills and <i>(b)</i> proportion of working age people (i) with no qualifications, (ii) qualified to level 2 and (iii) qualified to level 4 has been in the constituency of Newcastle-upon-Tyne Central since 1997.  [186838]</p>








<p><a name="40907w20.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </b> 
 <i>(a)</i> The 2003 Skills for Life survey provides the latest estimate of literacy and numeracy levels for England, the North East and the Tyne and Wear Learning and Skills Council area in particular. At present it is not possible to estimate levels of need for the Newcastle-upon-Tyne area although such figures will be available via DfES&#039;s website this autumn. The Skills for Life survey maps skill levels to the National Standards for Adult Literacy and Numeracy and is not directly comparable with previous estimates of basic skills need. This means we are unable to look at changes in basic skills levels since 1997.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40907w20.html_para1">
The survey highlights that 22 per cent. of North East respondents were classified at Entry Level 3 or below for literacy (below a GCSE grade G). The figure for England as a whole is 16 per cent. If the North East&#039;s population is approximately 2.6 million, this would mean that over 500,000 people would have literacy skills at entry level 3 or below. For Tyne and Wear LSC area, 22 per cent. of respondents were at Entry Level 3 or below for literacy.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40907w20.html_para2">
For numeracy, 55 per cent. of North East respondents were classified at Entry Level 3 or below for numeracy. This compares with a figure of 47 per cent. for England as a whole. If the North East&#039;s population is 2.6 million, 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>7 Sept 2004 : Column 1009W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
this would mean that approximately 1.4 million people would have entry level 3 or below numeracy skills. 50 per cent. of respondents were at Entry Level 3 or below for Tyne and Wear LSC area.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40907w20.html_para3">
Available data show that between the launch of the Skills for Life strategy in April 2001 and July 2003, Learning and Skills Council funded learners in the North East achieved some 35,000 Skills for Life qualifications, 18,000 within the Tyne and Wear Learning and Skills Council area. These figures are in addition to achievements funded through the Offenders&#039; Learning and Skills Unit and the Department for Work and Pensions.

As the White Paper &#039;Fairness for All&#039; has outlined, the Commission for Equality and Human Rights (CEHR) will provide institutional support for the provisions on age discrimination, working closely with partner organisations and key stakeholders to provide advice and assistance.

In addition, the CEHR will have the powers to conduct an investigation into a named party where it has reasonable suspicion that the person is not complying with the statutory requirements of the age legislation. If unlawful discrimination or harassment is found, the CEHR will be able to require the discrimination to stop.

<p><a name="40907w22.html_spnew12"><b> Mr. Sutcliffe: </b> 
 Occupational segregation has been identified as one of the key causes of the gender pay gap. We know that women are concentrated in just two industrial sectors within low-paid occupations. Men in comparison are spread much more evenly across the labour market in typically higher-paid occupations. They also typically hold more senior positions within the labour market than women.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40907w22.html_para8">
The Government aims to break down the barriers of occupational segregation as part of a raft of measures to tackle the pay gap. It aims to increase young women&#039;s awareness of the importance of education and career choices; address the problems women face getting access to appropriate training or re-skilling and inform employers about their potential in various male-dominated sectors such as information technology, engineering and science.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40907w22.html_para9">
We have set up Sector Skills Councils and Learning and Skills Councils to address industry specific training needs and to broaden post-16 learning opportunities. These are addressing occupational segregation issues through various research and initiatives. E-skills Sector Skills Council for example launched initiatives in the South East such as &#039;Go 4 IT&#039; workshops, Computer

 The Government is continuing to take action to improve the way equal pay legislation works in practice. From 1 October 2004, subject to Parliamentary approval, we shall be introducing changes to the way in which employment tribunals deal with the complex equal value cases. The aim is to streamline tribunal procedures and help to prevent very long running cases. The key features of the new procedures include the early exchange of information, the use of tribunals with specialist knowledge and new case management powers.

We also intend to amend the Equal Pay Act to remove the &quot;no reasonable grounds&quot; defence in section 2A(1)(b) of the Equal Pay Act 1970 and limit the circumstances in which a tribunal could refuse to consider an equal value claim. Subject to Parliamentary approval, the legislation is due to come into effect on 1 October 2004, at the same time as new tribunal procedures for equal value cases. These form part of a wider package of measures to speed up and simplify equal pay cases, such as amendments that were made to the Equal Pay Act in 2003 to introduce the Equal Pay Questionnaire, and make changes to time limits and payment of arrears.

 The Government continues to lead the way in undertaking equal pay reviews.

The Government has provided funding to the EOC to prepare a model for voluntary pay reviews and have also provided funding to trade unions to train representatives in equal pay issues in the workplace.

Recent figures from the EOC show that 45 per cent. of large employers had completed an equal pay review, were in the process of completing one or were planning to do so in 2004. Among those that had carried out a pay review or were planning to do one, 41 per cent. said that government policy and publicity had influenced them.

The Government are also encouraging voluntary pay reviews by funding the TUC&#039;s Equal Pay Partnership Project.

This average mean cost has been calculated as &#163;5.813. However, this estimate would not be representative of the cost to business of equal pay claims, since equal pay claims tend to be of longer duration than the average discrimination claim. Nor, on the other hand, would it include the lower costs of the many cases that are settled, for example there were 578 ACAS conciliated settlements of equal pay cases in 2003&#150;04.

The Financial Reporting Review Panel will be given a power to require companies to provide it with the information it needs to carry out its investigations. This body currently reviews the annual accounts and reports of public and large private UK companies. The Bill will allow the Government to extend this to reviewing the interim reports of listed companies. The FRRP will also take a more proactive approach to enforcement.

I would also like to draw the hon. Member&#039;s attention to the proposal by the Home Office to establish the Serious Organised Crime Agency. This body will be part of a comprehensive strategy to target organised criminals. It will exploit hi-tech 21st century technology to uncover the new wave of crime bosses whose lucrative illegal enterprises range from drug trafficking and people smuggling through to fraud and money laundering.

The Government has recently completed a consultation on legislation to reform the law of fraud. The Government proposals for change are based mainly on the Law Commission Report on Fraud published in 2002. The main proposal is for the general offence of fraud which can be committed in three different ways: by false representation, by wrongfully failing to disclose information, or by abuse of office. In each case the behaviour must be dishonest, and must aim at securing a gain for the defendant or a loss for another.

Additionally the Government sought the views of business and other interested parties on the best means of creating and maintaining effective partnerships to reduce opportunities for crime against business and to enhance the contribution that business could make to crime reduction in England and Wales.

<p><a name="40907w27.html_spnew0"><b> Jacqui Smith: </b> 
 Regional Supply Offices (RSOs) were designed to provide a means by which small businesses could gain access to the supply chain business of large firms. The market failure was that large firms were often unaware of smaller, potential suppliers in their regions, and for their part small businesses were unable to talk to chief buyers etc because they lacked the status to do so. The role of the RSO Advisers was to go out and learn of the large suppliers&#039; supply chain requirements, and then offer to locate (small business) suppliers for them. In parallel, the RSO Advisers would help the small 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>7 Sept 2004 : Column 1047W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
suppliers to develop their services to meet the customer requirements. Practical examples of these activities included seminars and workshop to highlight the benefits companies could gain from understanding supply chain development programmes, briefing on special topics such as manufacturing issues, subsidised stand space for companies at major trade shows and exhibitions as well as the organisation of business to business events. In April 2001, responsibility for the RSOs was transferred to the Regional Development Agencies (RDAs) in the English regions.

The RDAs integrated their RSOs but services of a similar nature continue to be provided in all regions as part of the RDAs&#039; and Partners&#039; range of business support.

There is no &#039;average length of time&#039; taken by CAFCASS officers to draft reports. However, the number of weeks required to draft a private law report ranges from 10&#150;18 weeks. The length of time may vary from region to region, and also on the scale of officers&#039; workloads and the complexity of individual cases. CAFCASS officers will often seek to agree these times with the courts, on a case-by-case basis.

</p>


<p>
<a name="40907w28.html_para4">
The Government have no plans to give grandparents a legal presumption of contact. The Children Act 1989 makes clear that the welfare of the child is the paramount consideration in any proceedings relating to the upbringing of a child.. The Government believe that this principle should be sustained, without qualification, in order that there continues to be the clearest possible focus on the needs of children.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40907w28.html_para5">
The Government recognise and value the important role which grandparents can play in children&#039;s lives. Many grandparents are already involved with the care of their grandchildren and most children see their grandparents as important figures in their lives. However, the primary responsibility for bringing up children in most families lies with their parents and there may be cases where parents prefer to limit contact with grandparents.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40907w28.html_para6">
Under the Children Act 1989, grandparents may, provided that the permission of the court is obtained, apply to the court for an order granting contact with a grandchild. The requirement for the court&#039;s permission is not designed to be an obstacle to grandparents but to act as an initial filter to sift out prejudiced applications that are unlikely to succeed. Experience suggests that grandparents would not usually experience difficulty in obtaining permission where their application is motivated by a genuine concern for the child.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40907w28.html_para7">
The Government are aware there is considerable concern about how court ordered contact arrangements can be supported more effectively. Our consultation document, &quot;Parental separation: Children&#039;s Needs and Parents&#039; Responsibilities&quot;, published in July, outlines how the Government propose better to support families who are going through separation. It details a range of measures, including better information for parents, parenting plans to help parents make good arrangements, in-court conciliation and mediation for those parents who do go to court, active judicial management and stronger powers for judges to enforce court orders.

<p><a name="40907w29.html_spnew6"><b> Mr. Leslie: </b> 
 Statutory responsibility for the training of magistrates currently rests with the 42 independent magistrates courts committees (MCCs). In court lay magistrates sit with their justices&#039; clerk or a legal adviser. The justices&#039; clerk has a statutory duty to provide advice to the magistrates on questions of law, practice and procedure. This will include advice on applying any case law and relevant Court of Appeal judgments when making decisions. Cases concerning contact (access) arrangements are therefore considered by magistrates on individual merit and with appropriate advice on law and procedure. In each case the child&#039;s welfare shall be the court&#039;s paramount consideration.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40907w29.html_para4">
The Children Act 1989 introduced the legal framework for contact (access) arrangements for children in cases of family breakdown. A grandparent is entitled to apply to the court under s.10 of the Act for permission to make an application for contact.

<p>
<a name="40907w29.html_para5">
Only magistrates who sit on the Family Panel can hear cases that involve contact arrangements. The recently updated Magistrates&#039; National Training Initiative (MNTI 2) sets out (and confirms the current practice) that magistrates should only be invited to sit on the Family Panel after successfully demonstrating the competencies required to sit in the adult court. Magistrates have been using a competence framework since 1998 for appraisal and training. Under MNTI 2 there are new competence frameworks for both the adult and family courts. These competence frameworks set out the knowledge, understanding, and skills magistrates need to demonstrate to perform their role.

This is the job of the joint committee on postgraduate training for general practice (JCPTGP), which is the competent authority for general practice training in the United Kingdom.

 The choice of paints and cleaning products for use in hospitals is decided locally by individual national health service trusts.

As a result of the PEAT inspections; the introduction of the national standards of cleanliness; the investment of &#163;68 million and the efforts of the NHS, standards have risen from a position where, in autumn 2000, only a little over 20 per cent. of hospitals were assessed as having good standards of cleanliness to one where nearly 80 per cent. were assessed as good and the remainder assessed by PEAT as acceptable. We consider that these changes have been important factors in raising standards across the NHS over the past four years, but recognise further improvements are needed.

<p><a name="40907w37.html_wqn2"><b> Andrew Mackinlay: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Health what guidance he gives to ambulance authorities on <i>(a)</i> combating MRSA and <i>(b)</i> infection control generally; and what additional resources he plans to make available for this purpose.  [184409]</p>








<p><a name="40907w37.html_spnew2"><b> Miss Melanie Johnson: </b> 
 Management action and resources for infection control are matters for individual national health service trusts. Each trust will have an infection control policy which should comply with current best practice and have access to local advice. Healthcare organisations including ambulance trusts should have systems in place to minimise the risk to patients from healthcare associated infections. Health Service Circular 2000/002 required all NHS trusts, including ambulance trusts to take action to strengthen prevention and control of infection, to secure appropriate health care services for patients with infection and improve surveillance of infection. This was reinforced by &quot;Winning Ways&#151;Working together to reduce Hospital Acquired Infection in England&quot;.


</p>







<p><a name="40907w37.html_wqn3"><b> Andrew Mackinlay: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Health (1) whether the isolation procedures set down by the Department to combat MRSA and which were operative as at 19 March 1997 are still operative; when the procedures were last brought to the attention of hospitals; and if he will make a statement;  [184411]

</p>



<p>(2) in what circumstances hospitals are required to provide strict isolation for MRSA sufferers; and if he will make a statement.  [184413]</p>








<p><a name="40907w37.html_spnew3"><b> Miss Melanie Johnson: </b> 
 Decisions on isolation are made locally. The guidance issued in 1995 is still in place and we require national health service organisations to regularly assess their needs for isolation facilities. Health Service Circular 2000/002 on the management and control of hospital infection, required trusts to undertake a risk assessment to determine appropriate provision of isolation facilities within each trust.

<a name="40907w37.html_para4">
&quot;Winning Ways&#151;Working together to reduce healthcare associated infection in England&quot;, published in December 2003 requires chief executives to ensure that there is appropriate provision of isolation facilities within their healthcare facilities.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health whether hospitals are required to destroy bed linen of MRSA sufferers after use; and if he will make a statement.  [184412]</p>








<p><a name="40907w37.html_spnew4"><b> Miss Melanie Johnson: </b> 
 The destruction of bed linen is not necessary as methicillin resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> is removed by normal laundering.


</p>







<p><a name="40907w37.html_wqn5"><b> Andrew Mackinlay: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Health what the results were of the national surveillance by 40 hospitals in respect of MRSA announced by the Minister on 19 March 1997; and if he will make a statement.  [184414]</p>








<p><a name="40907w37.html_spnew5"><b> Miss Melanie Johnson: </b> 
 The results were used to develop the nosocomial infection national surveillance service, which was a voluntary and confidential reporting system. This surveillance system aimed to help hospitals benchmark their own performance and investigate their own infection rates. It had two module hospital acquired blood stream infections, which has been replaced by the mandatory surveillance system, and surgical site infections. Orthopaedic surgical site infection (SSI) surveillance is now part of the mandatory system and the rest of SSI module was developed into the surgical site infections surveillance system.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health what measures he proposes to introduce to tackle MRSA in nursing homes; and if he will make a statement.  [184421]</p>








<p><a name="40907w37.html_spnew6"><b> Dr. Ladyman: </b> 
 Implementation of our action plan, &quot;Winning Ways&#151;Working together to reduce Healthcare Associated Infection in England&quot;, will reduce infections in both hospital and community settings. This report will raise standards by reinforcing the need to follow existing good practice, such as the 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>7 Sept 2004 : Column 1087W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
public health medicine environmental group guidelines on the control of infection in residential and nursing homes, published in 1996 and the National Institute for Clinical Excellence guidance, &quot;Infection control; prevention of healthcare associated infection in primary and community care&quot;, published in 2003. In addition, we have asked the public health medicine and environmental group to update the existing guidance on infection control in nursing homes.

 It is for local national health service trusts to determine their local work force priorities and to recruit staff according to local need and national priorities.

 It is expected that nurses with the skills and knowledge to take on the role of community matron will be recruited from a range of community, hospital and intermediate care settings, in particular district nursing.

<p><a name="40907w40.html_wqn0"><b> Mr. Norman: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Health how many hospitals were <i>(a)</i> put on special measures and <i>(b)</i> offered additional support following inspection by a Patient Environment and Assessment Team (PEAT) in each year since inspections began; and what the overall (i) PEAT score and (ii) star rating were in each case.  [185333]</p>







<br>&nbsp;<br><i>7 Sept 2004 : Column 1095W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>





<p><a name="40907w40.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 Since 2000, assessments of hospital cleanliness have been undertaken by patient environment action teams (PEATs). Following these assessments hospitals are allocated a rating on a &#039;traffic-light&#039; scale&#151;Red equals poor, Amber equals acceptable and Green equals good. Since August 2001, PEATs have confirmed that there are no hospitals where overall standards are less than acceptable.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40907w40.html_para0">
However, following the PEAT assessments in 2002, some hospitals were identified where, although overall acceptable levels had been achieved, it was felt that there were grounds for additional support to be provided to ensure that standards were maintained and any shortfalls identified remedied. This was also the case in 2003.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40907w40.html_para1">
In 2002, 51 hospitals were identified where such support was been deemed appropriate and in 2003 this number was 111. The PEAT rating for all of these hospitals was &#039;Amber&#039;.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40907w40.html_para2">
The star rating process is applied to the aggregate performance of a trust, whereas the PEAT rating is applied to each hospital within a trust and it is therefore possible that a trust with an overall good star rating may have an individual site where cleanliness standards are a cause for concern.

1. An in-year admission is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider, excluding admissions beginning before 1 April at the start of the datayear. Periods of care ongoing at the end of the datayear (unfinished admission episodes) are included. Please note that admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health what plans he has to introduce targets to reduce the number of winter deaths.  [186798]</p>








<p><a name="40907w42.html_spnew1"><b> Ms Rosie Winterton: </b> 
 There are no plans to introduce additional targets specifically to reduce the number of winter deaths. The Government are committed to decreasing the number of national targets imposed on the national health service and allowing more locally agreed targets. The document, &quot;National Standards, 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>7 Sept 2004 : Column 1102W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
Local action: Health and Social Care Standards and Planning Framework 2005&#150;06 to 2007&#150;08&quot;, published on 21 July 2004, has already set out the national targets for the next five years.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40907w42.html_para0">
However, there is an existing target to tackle influenza, one of the biggest seasonal killers. A target for influenza vaccination in those aged 65 and over has been set since 2000&#150;01. In 2003&#150;04, the target was that nationally over 70 per cent. of that age group would be vaccinated, and thanks to last year&#039;s successful &#039;flu immunisation campaign, this was exceeded, with 71 per cent. of those aged 65 or over being vaccinated. The 70 per cent. take-up target remains this year.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40907w42.html_para1">
In addition to the &#039;flu target, the Government have several other initiatives to reduce avoidable winter deaths. These include the &quot;Keep Warm, Keep Wel1&quot; campaign, which offers people advice on staying warm and keeping well in winter and winter fuel payments for older people, which help to keep warm those most susceptible to the cold weather.

<p><a name="40907w42.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b>

<p><a name="40907w42.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 Strategic health authorities are responsible for performance managing trust implementation of Working Time Directive (WTD) compliance for doctors in training from 1 August 2004. The Working Time Regulations have applied to all other national health service staff since 1998 and trusts are expected to comply with them in the same way as any other national legislation. The Department does not routinely collect information on compliance either by trust or by specialty.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40907w42.html_para3">
The vast majority of trusts are now fully compliant. A handful of trusts are having problems in securing compliance in a limited number of specialties.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions if he will make it his policy to require companies to be registered for employers&#039; liability compulsory insurance.  [187185]</p>








<p><a name="40907w43.html_spnew0"><b> Jane Kennedy: </b> 
 The Department will assess the costs and benefits of registering employers on an ELCI database by autumn 2004. This is part of our work to consider how best to tackle the small number of employers who do not have Employers&#039; Liability Compulsory Insurance (ELCI) cover, and how best to help claimants trace employers&#039; ELCI insurance policies.


</p>







<p><a name="40907w43.html_wqn1"><b> Mr. Lidington: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what assessment he has made of <i>(a)</i> the extent of evasion of employers&#039; liability compulsory insurance within the construction and roofing industries and <i>(b)</i> the impact of such evasion on (i) the health and safety of workers and (ii) the profitability of insured employers.  [187186]</p>








<p><a name="40907w43.html_spnew1"><b> Jane Kennedy: </b> 
 There are no figures available to show compliance with the Employers&#039; Liability Compulsory Insurance (ELCI) Act 1969 solely within the construction and roofing industries.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40907w43.html_para0">
The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) carried out a survey of compliance with ELCI in the autumn of 2003. That survey included small, medium and large firms across all sectors in England, Scotland and Wales and concluded that ELCI compliance was high&#151;nearly 99.5 per cent. of those employers surveyed were ELCI compliant.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40907w43.html_para1">
The provision of ELCI does not, of itself, impact on the health and safety of workers. ELCI merely ensures that there is some money available to compensate a person who successfully claims against their employer in the event of an injury or ill health arising out of their employment.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40907w43.html_para2">
The survey found that the most commonly sited response to the increased cost of ELCI has been to &quot;try and improve health and safety performance&quot; (50 per cent. of respondents). In the context of our work to promote a risk-based approach to the setting of ELCI premiums, better Health and Safety performance will enable insurers to better reflect good Health and Safety practices in the terms they can offer.

Notes:<br>

1. Figures are for GB and overseas in 2004&#150;05 price terms, using the Gross Domestic Product deflator index, rounded to the nearest &#163;100 million.<br>

2. Gross basic state pension costs are estimated by the Government Actuary&#039;s Department and are consistent with Budget 2004 assumptions and use 2002 based population projections. Basic state pension costs refer to the additional costs after allowing for consequential changes to National Insurance Fund benefits and non-income-related vote benefits.<br>

3. Costs net of income-related benefits (savings credit, guarantee credit, housing benefit and council tax benefit) and income tax are calculated using the Department&#039;s policy simulation model for 2005&#150;06 and 2006&#150;07. For illustrative purposes it is assumed that the proportion of savings calculated for the 2006&#150;07 year is constant for subsequent years.<br>

4. Average male earnings are taken from table 3.2 of the Department for Work and Pensions annual abstract of statistics. The April 2003 figure was &#163;525 per week, and this was used to set a category A basic state pension of &#163;175 for the following year. This was then projected forward using Budget 2004 economic assumptions for earnings growth.<br>

<p><a name="40907w44.html_wqn5"><b> Chris Ruane: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (1) if he will set out the timescale for compliance with the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 for <i>(a)</i> voluntary and community groups and <i>(b)</i> small businesses; and if he will make a statement;  [187572]

<p><a name="40907w44.html_spnew5"><b> Maria Eagle: </b> 
 Many voluntary and community groups and small businesses, where they are employers or provide services to the public, are already under a duty to meet certain requirements of the Disability 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>7 Sept 2004 : Column 1116W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
Discrimination Act (DDA) 1995. For example, they are already required not to discriminate unjustifiably against, and to make reasonable adjustments for, disabled people in recruitment, employment or in the way that they deliver services to disabled people.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40907w44.html_para6">
On 1 October 2004, the employment provisions of the DDA are being extended to employers with fewer than 15 employees. At the same time, service providers will be under additional duties to tackle physical features of their premises which otherwise make it impossible or unreasonably difficult for a disabled person to access the service, or to provide the service by another reasonable means.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40907w44.html_para7">
The Government, and the Disability Rights Commission, have undertaken wide-ranging publicity campaigns over the last two years to raise awareness of the new duties in order to give employers and service providers the opportunity to understand, and plan for, their implementation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40907w44.html_para8">
There is no specific funding available to help <i>(a)</i> voluntary and community groups and <i>(b)</i> small businesses, or indeed any business or organisation with duties under the DDA, to meet the requirements of the Act. This is because employers and service providers are only required to do what is reasonable, and factors such as the cost and practicability of making reasonable adjustments, and the financial and other resources available to the business or organisation, will be taken into account in determining what is reasonable.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40907w44.html_para9">
In certain instances, an employer who employs a disabled person may be able to obtain assistance to make adjustments for the disabled employee from the Access to Work programme. Employers can obtain further information about the programme by contacting their nearest Access to Work Business Centre.

Firstly, the Department for Work and Pensions is currently reviewing ELCI in respect of those limited companies in the UK where the owner is the only employee.

<p><a name="40907w46.html_spnew2"><b> Malcolm Wicks: </b> 
 We recognise that pension saving is far more affordable when done over a long period and the key is for young people to start taking action early in life as they become financially independent and enter the workplace for the first time.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40907w46.html_para2">
Through our Informed Choice <sup>1</sup> programme we are encouraging all people, including young people, to plan ahead.

The range of initiatives include measures to: 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>7 Sept 2004 : Column 1121W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
maximise workplace pensions savings, provide personalised information about an individual&#039;s forecasted state and occupational/private pension positions, working with employers to provide information and advice in the workplace, and introducing a new web-based retirement planner.

</p>


<p>
<a name="40907w46.html_para4">
We already provide incentives to encourage long-term savings by giving more generous tax treatment on pensions than on other forms of investment. Pensions are one of the most efficient ways of saving for all age groups. To encourage and reassure individuals who save in occupational pensions that their pension is secure, the Pension Protection Fund, will, for the first time in the UK, serve to protect members of defined benefit schemes if their sponsoring employer becomes insolvent and the scheme is under-funded.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40907w46.html_para5">
We are also introducing other measures to encourage the savings habit. For example, in June, we announced our proposals for the stakeholder suite of simple, low-cost, risk-controlled savings and investment products to meet the needs of all, including the young, for their short, medium and long-term needs. Measures such as the Savings Gateway, the Universal Banking Services, the Community Finance and Learning Initiative and the introduction of the Child Trust Fund, also serve to encourage young people to engage with the financial sector.

[186976]</p>

 It is up to individual transport operators to fund CCTV systems on their vehicles and a growing number recognise the importance of doing so. For example, although the Strategic Rail Authority has not stipulated CCTV as a requirement for trains, CCTV has been included on all new trains and most refurbished trains.

There has been no Government research into the effects on the number of charges and convictions for criminal activity on public transport if full operational CCTV were to be installed.

<p><a name="40907w48.html_spnew9"><b> Mr. Jamieson: </b> 
 The 10 Year Plan for transport marked the beginning of a more strategic approach to delivering transport improvements. It delivered a long term Government commitment to sustained increases in transport spending.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40907w48.html_para0">
Much of this investment will benefit freight alongside other transport users. The plan is delivering new capacity on the road network, with 80 schemes at various stages in the Targeted Programme of Improvements totalling around &#163;8.8 billion. 13 of these schemes are currently under construction, including widening of the M25 between Junctions 12 to 15 around Heathrow. We have also invested in the Rail Network, renewing 800 miles of track last year. And we have increased total Government capital support for local authorities from &#163;650 million in 2001 to &#163;1.9 billion in 2004&#150;05.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40907w48.html_para1">
In relation to specific references to Freight in the 10 Year Plan, there has been a significant increase in freight on rail over recent years. The possibility of dedicated HGV only lanes on our strategic routes has 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>7 Sept 2004 : Column 1128W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
been under consideration, but suitable sites have yet to be identified, though a number of schemes have been introduced .which afford goods vehicles priority, along with buses and cyclists, over general traffic in congested urban areas. Finally, we have made significant progress in implementing road haulage efficiency measures as outlined in the 10 Year Plan, particularly through the Road Haulage Modernisation Fund. In particular we have been funding projects to offer training in safer and more fuel efficient driving, and to promote operational practices that save on the use of fuel.

<p><a name="40907w48.html_spnew10"><b> Mr. Jamieson: </b> 
 The M6 expressway is no more than a broad concept at this stage.

The Merchant Shipping (Carriage of Packaged Irradiated Nuclear Fuel etc.) (INF Code) Regulations 2000, SI 3216 provide for both certification that vessels have been constructed to international standards, and periodic review to ensure that they continue to comply with the requirements.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport if he will list planned road resurfacing projects broken down by the number of houses affected by above 68dB of noise that will benefit from noise reduction; and how many of these projects will be financed from the &#163;5 million ringfenced sum.  [186728]</p>








<p><a name="40907w49.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Jamieson: </b> 
 In general, priorities for resurfacing sections of the strategic road network are assessed according to maintenance need rather than noise criteria. Detailed information on the numbers of houses exposed to more than 68dB that are expected to benefit from this resurfacing programme is not available.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40907w49.html_para1">
An assessment of the number of houses exposed to more than 68dB is only made for sites meeting the criteria for noise announced on 22 March 1999 in connection with the &#163;5 million ringfenced sum. This ringfenced sum was specifically aimed at funding noise mitigation measures at sites where the noise problems were serious and pressing and where resurfacing with quieter materials could not be justified on normal maintenance grounds.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40907w49.html_para2">
In the majority of cases, the ringfenced sum has funded the provision of noise barriers at locations identified on the list published on 11 November 1999. There is only one resurfacing scheme in the 2004&#150;05 programme with funding from, the ringfenced sum. This will deal with the problem identified on M6 junctions 34&#150;35, Camforth and should provide a significant noise reduction for approximately 300 houses currently exposed to more than 68dB of noise.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland if he will make a statement on the level of delayed hospital discharges in the Homefirst Health and Social Services Trust area; and if he will make a statement.  [186221]</p>








<p><a name="40907w50.html_spnew8"><b> Angela Smith: </b> 
 The most recent figures show that, at the end of April 2004, there were 111 patients in the Homefirst Health and Social Services Trust area whose discharge was delayed, amounting to 29 per cent. of the Northern Ireland total of 387. The total number of delayed days amounted to 6,124 with a patient average of 55 delayed days. Thirty-three Homefirst residents had remained in hospital for more than three weeks and another 47 were still in hospital at the end of eight weeks.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40907w50.html_para5">
It is unacceptable that some people have to remain in hospital long after they are medically fit for discharge. A target has been set for all Health and Social Services Boards to ensure that, by 31 March 2005, 85 per cent. of all people who are medically fit for discharge should wait no more than eight weeks for community services to be provided and that the number of delayed discharge days is reduced by 10 per cent. compared to 2003&#150;04 levels. Considerable additional resources have been allocated to ensure that these targets are met.

<p><a name="40907w50.html_spnew9"><b> Angela Smith: </b> 
 The Northern Health and Social Services Board has developed a strategy for older people to reflect the needs of its growing and ageing population. Over the past 18 months the board has been working to implement a comprehensive range of services to address the high levels of delayed discharges in its area, and is planning to invest over &#163;4 million in the Elderly Programme of Care during 2004&#150;05.

<p>
<a name="40907w50.html_para6">
A number of measures have been put in place aimed at reducing hospital admissions and speeding up the discharge process. Additional nursing home places have been funded, Home from Hospital and community rehabilitation services have been expanded across the whole Homefirst Trust area, and Rapid Response Nursing services have been established to provide acute care in the Homefirst community.

<p><a name="40907w50.html_spnew10"><b> Angela Smith: </b> 
 Delayed discharges have some impact on waiting lists at Antrim, Whiteabbey and other hospitals, although the scale of this is difficult to quantify. Delayed discharges increase the pressure on medical beds and when medical beds are full, new medical patients may be admitted to surgical wards and this can sometimes impact on the level of surgical activity.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40907w50.html_para7">
Work is currently under way to re-design and reform the emergency care service in Northern Ireland. Health and Social Services Boards and Trusts are required to develop plans to streamline processes relating to emergency patient flows at all hospitals so that, by 31 March 2005, the number of delayed discharge days is reduced by 10 per cent. compared to 2003&#150;04 levels. This work, coupled with planned increases in capacity, such as the 24-bed ward at Antrim hospital due to open in 2005, will reduce the need for medical patients to be cared for in surgical wards.

The average processing target time operated by the legacy organisations IDE and LEDU, was 83 days. Invest NI has set target times which are shorter than those operated by these legacy bodies.

<p class="tabletext">Water Service estimates that the existing wastewater treatment works at Sion Mills serves a population equivalent of some 3,100 taking account of both domestic and non-domestic properties.

<p class="tabletext">The new Works will be designed to cater for a population equivalent of 3,700 by the year 2030. This has been assessed using established methodologies taking into account population growth and anticipated housing and commercial development. This projection does not take into account the recent proposal to develop the Herdman&#039;s Mills site in Sion Mills. This could have an impact on the required capacity of the new Works but the implications cannot be assessed at this stage. However, as the design of the Works is still at an early stage, it should be possible to allow for the impact of the proposals for the Herdman&#039;s Mills site at a later stage in the design.</p>

Belfast City Council and the Northern Ireland Tourist Board are currently in the process of commissioning research into realising the potential value of the &#039;Titanic&#039; theme for Belfast and Northern Ireland.

The Titanic brand could have substantial tourist potential, especially on the centenary in 2012 and the years immediately after.

Notes:<br>

1. The figures reflect prices at the completion stage.<br>

2. Purchases by sitting tenants (under &quot;Right-to-Buy&quot; schemes) are excluded because the prices are below market value.<br>

3. Prices below &#163;1,000 or above &#163;20 million are also excluded&#151;so that the average prices are not affected by outliers.<br>

4. The average prices are simple averages, not mix-adjusted averages. The reason for this is that the number of transactions obtained through the Survey of Mortgage Lenders is relatively small for a single county. Consequently Land Registry figures have been used instead. However, these can only be presented as simple averages. It should be noted, however, that changes in simple average prices from one period to the next may reflect both actual price change and change in the mix of properties sold in the respective periods.<br>

<sup>(77)</sup> Published figures for the whole of North West region are not available prior to 1999. So the figures shown for 1997 and 1998 are estimates derived from a weighted combination of published prices for Merseyside and for &quot;North West excluding Merseyside&quot;.<br>

Notes:<br>

1. Mix-adjustment nullifies the effect of changes in the mix of properties sold from one period to the next through the use of fixed weights. New weights are introduced in January each year.<br>

2. The above figures are based on mortgage completions only&#151;i.e. they exclude purchases for cash.<br>

3. Up to 2002, the figures are based on a 5 per cent. sample of completions obtained through the Survey of Mortgage Lenders. From 2003, the figures are based on a substantially larger sample.<br>

 To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what research his Department has carried out to assess the impact of expanding shared ownership schemes on the production of affordable rental housing for key workers and low-income groups.  [187530]</p>








<p><a name="40907w57.html_spnew4"><b> Keith Hill: </b> 
 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister published the results of an Evaluation of the Housing Corporation funded Low Cost Home Ownership Programme in 2002. The research found that shared ownership proved good value for money for both the public purse and for the consumer.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40907w57.html_para3">
Shared ownership provides a means of helping key workers, existing social tenants and those on housing waiting lists into home ownership while at the same time helping to reduce pressure on housing waiting lists and freeing up existing social rented accommodation for those in priority housing need. The balance between social rented and shared ownership accommodation is dependent on the Government&#039;s national housing priorities together with regional and local housing strategies and investment priorities.

<p>
<a name="40907w57.html_para4">
The funding provided in the Spending Review 2004 will, along with efficiency improvements, produce 75,000 social rented homes and 40,000 homes for essential public sector workers and low cost home ownership over the three years to 2007&#150;08.

 It is anticipated that the Sustainable and Secure Buildings Bill will receive Royal Assent during September.

It will be impossible to complete the investigations in time to influence this amendment but it will be taken into account next time.

Notes:<br>

1. The CML figures are based on mortgage completions supplied through the Survey of Mortgage Lenders.<br>

2. The figures exclude cash purchases and also exclude mortgage purchases where the type of buyer was not stated.<br>

3. In the context of the Survey of Mortgage Lenders, the term &quot;first-time buyer&quot; refers to those buyers who were not homeowners immediately prior to this purchase. But they might have been homeowners at an earlier stage in their lives. For example someone who, after a period of home ownership, sold up, moved into rented accommodation and is now returning to home ownership&#151;as a &quot;first-time buyer&quot;.<br>

<p><a name="40907w59.html_spnew6"><b> Phil Hope: </b> 
 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister currently has four externally commissioned research projects on different aspects of homelessness, which include consideration of homeless families.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40907w59.html_para3">
1. A nationally representative survey of homeless families will collect data on the characteristics of homeless families and on the reasons for their homelessness. It will also assess the impact of homelessness and living in different types of temporary accommodation on the health and education of children, and collect 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>7 Sept 2004 : Column 1168W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
information on the additional costs faced by families as a result of their homelessness. Findings from the survey will help to inform future policy on homelessness and the use of temporary accommodation. Planning for this major survey has been informed by a successful feasibility study, which reported this summer. This study will complement quarterly statistical data collected on households accepted as statutory homeless by local authorities.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40907w59.html_para4">
2. Research about the causes of homelessness among black and minority ethnic communities. People from BME groups are disproportionately represented in statutory homelessness statistics. A development guide to assist local authorities and other agencies to address the needs of homeless black and minority ethnic households is expected to be published by the end of this year.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40907w59.html_para5">
3. A study to evaluate the effectiveness of a range of homelessness prevention initiatives, including family mediation services, help for victims of domestic violence to remain safely in their own homes, and homelessness advice services. This research has recently been commissioned, and will produce good practice guidance for local authorities and service providers, to be published early in 2005.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40907w59.html_para6">
4. A survey of households receiving Supporting People legacy funded services. This survey was commissioned to measure satisfaction with housing related support services provided by the Supporting People programme. The survey included interviews with 351 families receiving Supporting People funded services for homeless families. The survey reported on their support needs, the help and services that they receive, and on the problems they had experienced. It is due to be published in the autumn of 2004.

This announcement followed work carried out by officials from the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and local government experts during the last year to remodel Formula Spending Shares (FSSs) using the 2001 Census data. Incorporating the new Census data in the funding formula is not a simple task. It is technically incorrect to update the Census data in the police formula; and in other areas the changes needed to incorporate the 2001 Census data would break the current formula freeze, and could cause large changes to the distribution of FSSs. I should also add that, for the Environmental, Protective and Cultural Services and the Highways Maintenance formulae, we still do not have all the 2001 Census data we need.

<ul>

<p class="tabletext">The form of all postal-voting defined in law for the regional referendum is a significant improvement over that piloted in June, in part as a result of changes advocated by the Commission earlier in the year.

<a name="40907w63.html_sbhd0"><h3 align=center>Regional Planning</h3>





<p><a name="40907w63.html_wqn0"><b> Mr. Andrew Turner: </b> 
 To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what rules govern whether a unitary council&#039;s area can be treated as a sub-region for the purpose of regional planning arrangements.  [187716]</p>








<p><a name="40907w63.html_spnew0"><b> Keith Hill: </b> 
 There is no rule. It is up to each RPB (Regional Planning Body) to decide how best to take sub-regional matters forward and to define the sub-regions in the draft RSS (Regional Spatial Strategies) revision. What might be an effective sub-regional approach in one region may not necessarily suit the circumstances and geography of another.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40907w63.html_para0">
The definition of need for a sub-regional approach should be based on an assessment of the functional relationship between settlements, such as journey-to-work patterns, or land uses within the area affected by the same strategic planning issue or issues which may well differ from administrative boundaries. This could include consideration, for example, of how the strategic planning system can assist not only in creating and sustaining the economic competitiveness of a city or a cluster of towns but in spreading the benefits of a prosperous city to the wider region (the concept of a &#039;city-region&#039;).
</p>


<p>
<a name="40907w63.html_para1">
The sub-regional definition should be based on a clearly recognisable &#039;strategic policy deficit&#039; which cannot be adequately addressed by general RSS policies or by LDDs (Local Development Documents) on their own. In some parts of a region, LDDs may be capable of being prepared within the context of the generic policies of a RSS. In some cases this may need to be on a joint LDD basis and the RPB may need to encourage the relevant LPAs (Local Planning Authorities) to produce a joint LDD in order that the RSS can be effectively implemented. However, in many cases there will be sub-regional strategies issues which cannot be tackled through a joint plan or where the LDDs require a more detailed strategic policy context which cannot be provided by generic policies in a RSS. Therefore, it will be common to have sub-regional policies as part of the RSS revision.




<br>&nbsp;<br><i>7 Sept 2004 : Column 1181W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>


<p>
<a name="40907w63.html_para2">
Where the RPB decides that it is appropriate to have RSS policies which are specific to a particular part or parts of the region, section 5(5) of the Act requires a section 4 (4) authority or authorities to be first to make detailed proposals, unless it is agreed that the RPB itself or a district council should do so instead. Providing these section 4(4) authorities agree, there is no reason why an RPB should not continue to take the lead, as it has in the past, in preparing detailed proposals on a partnership basis with these authorities and others.

A combination of significant advances in capability, both within some existing aircraft fleets and as a result of the introduction to service of new types, such as Typhoon, and changes in investment towards greater deployability. better targeted action and swifter outcomes have enabled us to make a number of changes in the RAFs force structure.

<p><a name="40907w66.html_spnew3"><b> Dawn Primarolo: </b> 
 St. Helens, like the rest of the UK, has benefited from a range of measures since 1997 to reduce unemployment and make work pay, and to raise the incomes of the poorest families with children. Since 1997, the Government have committed substantial resources to tackle child poverty, both through universal and targeted public services and through financial support. For example, by 2004&#150;05, total spending on financial support for children through tax credits, child benefit and other benefits will have increased by &#163;10.4 billion in real terms from its 1997 level, a rise of 72 per cent. In addition, the Government have increased spending on the Sure Start Unit, and has invested over &#163;2.9 billion on child care, early years and Sure Start local programmes from 1998&#150;99 to 2003&#150;04.

 The Government are making steady progress towards the PSA target to reduce by a quarter the number of children in low-income households by 2004&#150;05, as a contribution to the longer-term goals of halving child poverty by 2010 and eradicating it by 2020. By 2002&#150;03 there were around half a million fewer children in relative low-income households compared to 1998&#150;99. The 2004 Spending Review announced a new child poverty PSA target, shared by the Department for Work and Pensions and HM Treasury, to halve the number of children in relative low-income households between 1998&#150;99 and 2010&#150;11, on the way to eradicating child poverty by 2020. The Government will also set an additional target in the 2006 Spending Review to halve by 2010&#150;11 the number of children suffering a combination of material deprivation and low income. The child poverty review, published alongside the 2004 Spending Review, sets out a range of key measures to reduce child poverty and improve poor children&#039;s life chances, thus breaking cycles of deprivation.

<p><a name="40907w67.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Boateng: </b> 
 In line with Sir Michael Lyons&#039; recommendations contained in his report published in March this year and endorsed in the 2004 Spending Review, it will be for Departments and public bodies themselves to determine the destination of relocated activities from London and the South East. Departments&#039; decisions will be based on their own business needs and priorities, taking account of the requirement to improve public services, secure greater efficiencies and value for money for the taxpayer as well as of local economic conditions. Departments will also take into account forthcoming locational guidance that will be issued by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister.

Unfortunately, although the Tax Credit Office dealt promptly with the points raised in the hon. Member&#039;s letter, there was a long delay in replying to the letter itself because of an oversight. The Tax Credit Office has apologised to the hon. Member for the delay.

 To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what representations he has made to <i>(a)</i> the International Monetary Fund, <i>(b)</i> the World Bank and <i>(c)</i> the G8 regarding further topping up of highly indebted poor countries debt relief in the event of further oil price or other price shocks.  [186785]</p>








<p><a name="40907w67.html_spnew3"><b> John Healey: </b> 
 The HIPC Initiative is delivering real benefits to participating countries. It is providing over $70 billion of debt relief, to the 27 countries that have reached decision point. It is helping increase annual social expenditures in countries receiving debt relief. Total social spending has increased by around $4 billion since 1999&#151;equivalent to 2.7 per cent. of GDP. On average, health and education spending account for 65 per cent. of the use of HIPC debt relief.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40907w67.html_para2">
But there are countries that are forecast to exit the initiative with debt-to- export ratios above the HIPC target of 150 per cent. because of factors beyond their control. The UK continues to push for additional relief to be granted to all these countries at completion point (&#039;topping up&#039; relief). We successfully campaigned for Niger and Ethiopia to receive such additional relief, resulting in over $800 million in additional relief for two of the world&#039;s poorest countries.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40907w67.html_para3">
At the recent G8 Summit at Sea Island, the UK successfully pushed for Heads of Government to reaffirm their commitment to the provision of topping up relief for eligible countries at completion point. The 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>7 Sept 2004 : Column 1195W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
UK also continues to lobby for a change in the topping up methodology to maximise the quantum of topping up relief.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40907w67.html_para4">
The UK also believes that more must be done beyond the HIPC Initiative to ensure debt sustainability in the world&#039;s poorest countries. We are proposing that the international community review further debt relief for the poorest countries, including making better use of IMF gold using a revaluation or off-market transactions, so that, to match bilateral debt relief, which we provide at up to 100 per cent., we can begin to consider how we provide multilateral debt relief of up to 100 per cent. as well.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40907w67.html_para5">
However, all low-income countries will need additional aid to meet the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). This is why the UK has called for an examination of possible financing mechanisms to provide up to 100 per cent. multilateral debt relief for HIPCs, and continues to push the International Finance Facility (IFF), which could provide the much- needed substantial increase in aid&#151;in the form of grants, concessional loans, or further debt relief&#151;needed to attain the MDGs without threatening the long-term debt sustainability of the world&#039;s poorest countries.

 To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what efforts he is making to improve public understanding of financial products and services; and if he will make a statement.  [186627]</p>








<p><a name="40907w68.html_spnew0"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 The Government are working closely with the voluntary sector, the financial services industry and others to develop and implement a national strategy for raising levels of financial capability, under the leadership of the Financial Services Authority. This strategy has identified a number of priority areas, based around key life events, from prospective parents to those who are planning for retirement. The Government already provide incentives to encourage long-term savings by giving generous tax treatment on pensions and is also working with industry to set up a suite of simpler savings products. In June this year the Government announced their proposals for the stakeholder suite of savings and investment products to be launched into the marketplace in April 2005. These are a suite of simple, low-cost, risk-controlled products to meet the short, medium and long-term savings needs for all consumers.

<p><a name="40907w68.html_spnew1"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 As explained in my statement to the House of 4 November 2003, the review is considering the impact of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 on competition, changes to aspects of the Financial Services Authority&#039;s practices, changes to the Financial Ombudsman Service, and changes to the boundary of regulation.

 In 2003 the Financial Services Authority (FSA) commissioned Europe Economics to undertake a major survey of the financial costs of regulation and published the results. This survey found that the median increase in annual incremental compliance costs from 1998 to 2002 resulting from changes to FSA regulation was less than 1 per cent. of operating costs.

 To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what action he is proposing to improve the working of the UK mortgage market following the Miles Review; and if he will make a statement.  [186633]</p>








<p><a name="40907w69.html_spnew1"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 On 12 March 2004 David Miles published his review of the UK mortgage market. His remit was to undertake analysis of supply and demand side factors limiting the development of the longer-term fixed-rate mortgage market in the UK, and to examine whether there has been any market failure that has held back the market for longer-term fixed-rate mortgages. In Budget 2004 the Chancellor endorsed the conclusion in David Miles review of the UK mortgage market that &quot;urgent reform is desirable to make the market work better for consumers in a number of areas&quot;. The Treasury has been discussing the recommendations with a range of stakeholders including the Financial Services Authority, and intends to provide a detailed update in the Pre-Budget Report.

There has been no official review of PFI insurance costs by HM Treasury. However, guidance on the treatment of insurance costs is contained in the HMT Standardisation of Contracts Version 3 (SOPC3) and OGC Business and Operational Guidance &quot;PFI Contracts: Insurance Costs&quot;. SOPC3 states that the risk of increases in insurance costs should be borne by the contractor, while recognising that it will not represent best value for money if bidders price in worst case scenarios for future insurance premium levels in to their bids. The OGC guidance therefore sets out a mechanism for sharing insurance cost increases should there be exceptional circumstances in the international insurance market.

 The Saving Gateway pilot final evaluation is due in early 2005. No substantial conclusions can be drawn until we receive the full research findings, however indicators so far are good. The latest interim evaluation report showed that 1,478 accounts had been opened (the target was 1,500), and the participants were mostly drawn from young families with children. The total amount saved by account-holders was approaching &#163;300,000 by the end of February 2004, and there was little evidence that people had transferred money from existing savings accounts or borrowed to save. This report is available on the HM Treasury website.

<p><a name="40907w74.html_spnew5"><b> Estelle Morris: </b> 
 Digital television services, except those provided by the BBC, S4C and TeleG, are licensed by the Office of Communications (Ofcom) under the powers granted to it by the Broadcasting Acts of 1990, 1996 and the Communications Act 2003. With the exception of the public service channels (Channel 3, 4 and 5), the choice of whether a licensed television programme service is available free of charge or as part of a subscription package is for the broadcaster to decide. Where services are to be broadcast via satellite, Ofcom does not limit the number of licences available to either pay-TV or free channels and it will issue licences to any eligible organisation wishing to broadcast television programme services provided they meet the relevant regulatory requirements, for example as to content, advertising and sponsorship issues. In relation to the digital terrestrial platform, however, spectrum capacity is a key factor in determining how many services may be licensed at any one time.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what discussions she has held with <i>(a)</i> the Department of Transport, <i>(b)</i> transport authorities, <i>(c)</i> public transport user groups and <i>(d)</i> companies operating public transport services on ensuring that public transport services are able to respond to the increased demand for late night services arising from increased use of late licences resulting from powers granted to licensing authorities under the Licensing Act 2003.  [187157]</p>








<p><a name="40907w76.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Caborn: </b> 
 The implementation of the Licensing Act 2003 can have no impact on the demand for late night transport services until November 2005 at the earliest. The content of the Licensing Act 2003 and the Licensing Guidance issued by the Secretary of State on 7 July this year, following approval by Parliament, were discussed with and approved by the Department for Transport. There have been no direct discussions with individual transport authorities, public transport user groups and companies operating public transport services other than through the public consultations that preceded the introduction of the Licensing Bill and the laying of the Guidance in Parliament. At paragraph 3.50, the Licensing Guidance advises licensing authorities when developing local statements of licensing policy to have regard to the existing policies and strategies of the relevant local transport authority as set out in their local Transport Plan. Local Transport Plans are the mechanism by which local authorities are expected to work in partnership with all appropriate bodies to deliver effective local transport services that meet the needs of local people. These are expected to include provision of night-time and evening services, where this is appropriate to the local situation. It is for local authorities to identify where and how to take action.
