<a name="01124w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Gill: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food how many names were appended to the petition presented to the Prime Minister last month regarding meat inspection charges; and what action he has taken in response.  [137568]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01124w01.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 Although not counted individually, there were several thousands of signatures on the petition. We are aware of the considerable public support for the recommendations made by Colin Maclean in respect of meat hygiene charges for small and medium-sized abattoirs. The Government are considering whether those recommendations may be implemented.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what assessment he has made of the geographical spread of abattoirs and their proximity to livestock production areas.  [137556]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01124w01.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 There is over-capacity in the slaughtering sector and a reasonable spread of abattoirs across the country.
<P>

<a name="01124w01.html_para0">Despite the closure of some abattoirs in recent months, we are not aware that animal welfare has been in any way compromised by longer journey times from farm to slaughter. The welfare of livestock in transit and at their arrival at abattoirs is closely monitored.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, pursuant to his answer of 28 July 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 1128W, what further discussions he has had with other EU ministers regarding rules on hedgerows and field margins; and if he will make a statement.  [136930]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01124w01.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 8 November 2000]:</i> The reply given to my hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish (Mr. Bennett) on 7 November 2000, <i>Official Report,</i> column 150W, explained that the European Commission had proposed a change to the rules of the Integrated Administration and Control System (IACS) which would allow United Kingdom farmers to continue, on a permanent basis, to treat hedges and other field margins in the same way as they had done in the past so far as their inclusion in IACS claims was concerned. I am pleased to say that the adoption of this proposal has now been secured. It will enter into force on 1 January 2001.

<P>
<P>
<a name="01124w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Ruffley: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food how many samples of imported meat have been tested for classical swine fever virus by Government scientists since July.  [138412]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01124w01.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 14 November 2000]:</i> Meat which is legally imported must be accompanied by veterinary certificates giving assurances about the health status of the animals from which it came. It is not routinely tested for specific diseases such as classical swine fever virus. In connection with the recent outbreaks in East Anglia, epidemiological studies revealed that the strain was an Asian one. Work was then carried out to establish in which countries it had previously been reported. From 18 September, the Government have been conducting tests on any meat imported from those countries. Since none of the countries concerned is approved to export meat to the European Community the tests are carried out only when illegally imported meat is identified. To date two such tests have been conducted, each of which gave a negative result.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food how many legal advisers are employed by his Department; and how many of those advise on matters relating to animals.  [138920]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01124w01.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 21 November 2000]:</i> The Ministry currently has 45 lawyers in post, of whom six advise on matters relating to animal health and welfare. Other lawyers (eg prosecutors and litigators) also deal with these issues from time to time.

 The Church Commissioners' responsibility is to manage their investments so as to provide support for the payment of clergy stipends, pensions and other legal commitments. As to the Children's Society, this is not a matter for the Church Commissioners.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions for what reason the Local Transport Plan Settlement announced on 13 November allocated to Stoke-on-Trent a reduction in capital allocations between 2000-01 and 2002-03.  [139502]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01124w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 The capital allocations for highway maintenance were calculated using a formula applied on a consistent basis to all authorities. One criteria was that authorities should not receive a smaller allocation in 2001-02 or 2002-03 than they did in 2000-01. However, allocations were rounded to the nearest &#163;1,000.

<P>
<P>
<a name="01124w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 The current agreement between the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) and Post Office Network Banking (PONB) expires at the end of March 2002. A variety of payment methods will be considered when negotiations take place on the next agreement.

<P>
<a name="01124w01.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 No. The current nation-wide network of 4,000 motor vehicle licence-issuing post offices provides the best balance between the needs of customers and cost to the taxpayer.

 The information is as follows:
<P>

<a name="01124w01.html_para3"><i>(a)</i> The Secretary of State's powers under the Channel Tunnel Rail Link (CTRL) Act 1996 only allow for the acquisition and retention of as much land as is needed for the operation of the CTRL. The application of these powers is closely regulated by my Department and its engineering advisers. For properties that are not actually required for the CTRL there is a Discretionary Purchase Scheme operated by Union Railways and policed for consistency and fairness by an independent Discretionary Purchase Auditor who makes regular reports to this Department.
<P>

<a name="01124w01.html_para4"><i>(b)</i> The Complaints Commissioner has no locus in property matters. There is a recognised statutory mechanism for the remedy of disputes arising from compulsory purchase through the Lands Tribunal. In addition Union Railways are actively promoting the availability of a range of other new disputes resolution mechanisms which are simpler and quicker for owners and occupiers.

 Kent county council were successful in the Rural Bus Challenge 1999 with a bid for the Swale Unified Network project. None of the Department's grant awarded to this project has yet been paid to the council, though an initial payment will shortly be due on the basis of forecast expenditure in this financial year. The question of interest on unspent grant has not therefore arisen.

 Both the Dome Europe and Legacy bids have been assessed within the framework of the competition to find a long-term sustainable use for the Millennium Dome.

<P>
<a name="01124w02.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Armstrong: </B> 
 The evaluation criteria for the Dome legacy competition include that schemes should demonstrate minimum reliance on access by car and maximum use of public transport.

 The evaluation criteria for the Dome legacy competition include the expectation that the winning scheme will be commercially and financially successful. Legacy plc has provided advice on likely commercial demand for a business park and a business plan related to this, which have been evaluated by the Government advisers. This evaluation is confidential. Further development of evidence of commercial demand will be important in conducting negotiations towards exchange of contracts.

 The proposals put forward by GoVia and Connex Transport UK Ltd. both offered substantial improvements over current standards of service.

<P>
<P>

 A new franchise agreement will be signed with GoVia once detailed negotiations and funding plans have been developed and terms have been agreed between them and Connex Transport UK Ltd. for the early transfer of the existing South Central franchise. GoVia do not currently propose the closure of any station included in this franchise. Service provision will be based on existing Passenger Service Requirements (PSRs), which provide a specified minimum service level.

Marine Accidents Investigation Branch investigations into the sinking of the <i>(a)</i> Derbyshire, <i>(b)</i> Marchioness and <i>(c)</i> Gaul, cost.  [139818]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01124w03.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 The Derbyshire sank in 1980 well before the Marine Accidents Investigation Branch (MAIB) had been established and the Branch played a very limited role in the investigations into the ship's loss. The cost of the MAIB's involvement cannot be separately identified but was not significant. Overall, the cost to the Department of the Derbyshire investigations up to and including the re-opened Formal Investigation are estimated as totalling between &#163;9 and &#163;10 million, including legal fees.
<P>

<a name="01124w03.html_para0">The MAIB undertook an investigation into the loss of the Marchioness and has, more recently, assisted the Attorney-General in the Formal Investigation which is currently being held. The costs of individual MAIB Investigations are not separately recorded. Overall, the cost to the Department of the Marchioness investigations, including the current Formal Investigation, is estimated at some &#163;6 million, including legal fees.
<P>

<a name="01124w03.html_para1">The Gaul sank in 1974 and a Formal Investigation was subsequently held. Following the location of the wreck of the vessel by a TV film crew the MAIB undertook an underwater survey of the vessel. The survey cost some &#163;600,000 and the MAIB subsequently produced a report of their survey including model tests undertaken on their behalf. The Formal Investigation into the loss of the Gaul was re-opened and the MAIB are currently assisting the Attorney-General in his preparatory work which will include a re-survey of the wreck. It is too early to estimate the likely costs which will fall to the Department and will include the subsequent hearings before a Wreck Commissioner and legal fees.

<P>
<P>
<a name="01124w03.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 The Civil Aviation Authority has recently produced a paper for the Department on the economics of ring-fencing slots. No detailed study has been done of the practicalities involved. However, the Government are not generally attracted to ring-fencing slots for particular air services as this would introduce an element of undesirable rigidity into the slot allocation system. The current arrangement, where slots are not route-specific, allows changes in the routes operated by airlines in response to market developments. Without this flexibility there would be restrictions in the scope to develop new business and limitations on the development of competition on some routes.

<P>
<P>
<a name="01124w03.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 RAF Brize Norton is home to the RAF's VC10 and TriStar Air-to-Air Refuelling/Air Transport aircraft, which are due to be replaced from 2007 under the Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft (FSTA) programme. We are currently investigating the potential for achieving a solution under the Private Finance Initiative which 



<P>
<P><I>24 Nov 2000 : Column: 335W</I><P>
would involve a commercial consortium working in close partnership with the RAF to provide an Air-to-Air Refuelling service.
<P>

<a name="01124w03.html_para3">Once an Invitation to Negotiate has been issued, we will evaluate the proposals for meeting the FSTA requirement. Final decisions on the programme are not anticipated before 2002.
<P>

<a name="01124w03.html_para4">In seeking Private Finance Initiative bids for FSTA we do not plan to place commercial constraints on the competing consortia by specifying the UK location of the operating base. However, any proposal to move Air-to-Air Refuelling operations from RAF Brize Norton would need to provide us with best value for money and protect our operational capability. At the same time, and without prejudicing the FSTA programme, we are looking at some further commercialisation of RAF Brize Norton to utilise irreducible spare capacity.
<P>

<a name="01124w03.html_para5">In addition, I announced on 7 June 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 389, that RAF Brize Norton would be the future home of the C17 fleet, which will provide a strategic air transport capability. RAF Brize Norton is also the location for a number of key operational units.

<P>
<P>
<a name="01124w03.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 There are a number of factors which have resulted in the decision to remove Type 675 from Royal Navy service. Essentially the maritime emphasis has shifted away from large-scale open ocean naval operations towards the littoral. In addition the air threat in the littoral is more varied and complex and, at a time when Anti Ship Missile technology continues to grow and proliferate, the provision of an effective maritime Anti Air Warfare capability is essential to provide air superiority. To meet challenges of the new operating environment the Royal Navy has had to review all its countermeasure systems. The decision to withdraw the Type 675 jammer from service was taken as part of this review.

Self-employed taxpayers can claim in the normal way when they receive their tax return for the year beginning April 2001.

<a name="01124w07.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Alan Johnson: </B> 
 There are insufficient data and too many variables to enable such a calculation to be carried out. The independent Low Pay Commission is monitoring the impact of the national minimum wage on the labour market and the economy and is currently gathering evidence.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if he will make a statement on the enforcement procedures for the <i>(a)</i> minimum wage and <i>(b)</i> Working Time Directive indicating the number of prosecutions secured to date.  [140091]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01124w07.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Alan Johnson: </B> 
 <i>(a)</i> The National Minimum Wage Act 1998 provides both civil and criminal powers of enforcement. Inland Revenue officers enforce the national minimum wage issuing notices against employers as appropriate and representing workers at employment tribunals where necessary. There have been no criminal prosecutions for underpayment of the national minimum wage. Officers have issued 308 enforcement notices, 41 penalty notices and taken 24 cases to tribunals since April 1999. They have also recovered almost &#163;3 million in back pay for workers. In addition, under the provisions of the 1998 Act, workers are able to take their own cases of underpayment to an employment tribunal or to a civil court.
<P>

<a name="01124w07.html_para0"><i>(b)</i> The health and safety enforcing authorities (the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) and local authorities) enforce the provisions of the Working Time Regulations (WTR), related to working time limits, limits on night-working and health assessments for night-workers. The entitlements to rest and leave are enforced through employment tribunals; 3,408 applications to tribunals were made in the financial year 1999-2000 where the primary complaint related to breach of WTR entitlements.
<P>

<a name="01124w07.html_para1">Enforcement of the limits is in line with the Health and Safety Commission's Enforcement Policy Statement: that is, proportionate to any risk to health and safety, targeted at those in control, transparent in what is required and consistent in approach. In practice this means that the WTR are enforced in response to complaints. The HSE have handled 416 such complaints and served 13 Improvement Notices. The HSE have not initiated any prosecutions to date. There are currently no central records of local authority enforcement, but at least one case brought by a local authority has led to a prosecution for breach of the provisions on health assessment for night-workers.

 In accordance with this Department's policy on compensation and in line with other Departments', the Child Support Agency makes payments to cover financial loss in cases where maladministration has occurred.

 As set out in a protocol between Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons and the Director General of the Prison Service, the Home Secretary receives draft inspection reports in advance of publication. At regular bilateral meetings with Sir David Ramsbotham, both the Home Secretary and myself are kept informed of emerging findings from inspections of individual establishments, including young offenders institutions.

The Board's purpose is to monitor the operation of the youth justice system and to ensure the delivery of the appropriate standard of care.

<a name="01124w08.html_para2">The Prison Service's key response to past criticisms of how it has dealt with young people placed within its custody has been to create a new, distinct estate for 15 to 17-year-old boys, comprising juvenile units in young offenders institutions <sup>1</sup> .

For the first time, the vast majority of under-18s will be held in either dedicated under-18 establishments, or in dedicated under-18 living units within other establishments. The new regimes will be based upon providing a "full, purposeful and active day"; rigorous assessment of each individual's health, social, educational and vocational needs; formal and specific planning and provision of education and training to meet these needs; regular reviews of each individual's plans and inter-agency co-operation and support.

 Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons (HMCIP) is entitled to inspect any prison establishment in England and Wales at any time. He does this by means of announced and unannounced inspections. Although it is usually the case that he promptly revisits those establishments of which he has been very critical, I consider it appropriate to leave follow-up timescales to HMCIP. It is quite possible that HMCIP would consider a follow-up inspection to be appropriate to a longer or shorter timescale.

 <i>[holding answer 17 November 2000]:</i> BCG vaccine has been in limited supply for some time due to severe manufacturing problems encountered by the sole United Kingdom licensed source, Celltech Medeva. As a result, we had no alternative but to request health authorities suspend their routine schools immunisation programme for 10 to 14-year-olds from September 1999. In the meantime, stocks are being used specifically for those at higher risk.

 Neither the Department nor the Medical Research Council (MRC), which is the main Government agency for research into the causes of and treatments for disease, are directly commissioning any research projects specifically on osteogenesis imperfecta, at present. However, the MRC is funding research related to osteoarthritis and always welcomes high-quality applications for support into any aspect of human health.

 The issue of stem cell research was comprehensively discussed in the report of the Chief Medical Officer's Expert Group--"Stem Cell research: Medical progress with responsibility"--published in August of this year, copies of which are available in the Library.
<P>

<a name="01124w10.html_para0">The report concluded that research on stem cells from all sources provides the possibility of exciting prospects for future therapies for a range of debilitating diseases including Parkinson's, diabetes, spinal injuries and liver disease. However, a great deal of research will be needed to realise such potential. It is hoped that research with embryonic stem cells will provide the information necessary for the future use of adult cells for treatment.

<P>
<a name="01124w10.html_spnew1"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 We agree with the aim of this Resolution to the extent that human reproductive cloning should be prohibited. This is entirely in accordance with the stated view of the United Kingdom Government.

 <i>[holding answer 23 November 2000]:</i> The Department recognises the serious nature of both pre-eclampsia (hypertension of pregnancy) and its rarer complication, eclampsia. Pre-eclampsia can occur in up to 10 per cent. of pregnancies, and its severer condition, eclampsia, complicates 5 per 10,000 pregnancies. Eclampsia currently causes up to six maternal deaths a year in the United Kingdom and up to 140 foetal deaths in England and Wales.
<P>

<a name="01124w10.html_para6">The Department's Confidential Enquiries into Maternal Deaths investigates all maternal deaths and publishes regular, updated guidelines on the management of eclampsia. It has also funded the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) and Royal College of Midwives to produce guidelines for the management of antenatal care including the detection and treatment of pre-eclampsia. Apart from these guidelines the RCOG has also issued recent guidelines for the management of eclampsia. The Medical Research Council is funding several studies into the aetiology of this condition.

<P>

<a name="01124w10.html_para7">Part of the explanation for the increasing number of children identified as having an autistic spectrum disorder is improvement in diagnosis by the medical profession. The National Health Service Executive has funded an evaluation of the Diagnostic Interview for Social and Communication Disorders (DISCO) against other new approaches to diagnosis. DISCO was developed at the Medical Research Council Unit at the Institute of Psychiatry and is making a major contribution to the more reliable diagnosis of autistic spectrum disorders. Its continuing development is being undertaken by the National Autistic Society.

 The Government treat all matters of food and consumer safety with the utmost seriousness. That is why we established the Food Standards Agency (FSA).

But the agency plans to visit France urgently to ensure that the French Government have in place effective measures to implement their planned action on beef and to ensure that the beef banned in France will not be exported to the United Kingdom. The position will be reconsidered by Ministers following the report from the FSA of its findings in France.
<P>

<a name="01124w10.html_para9">In addition, the agency is commissioning a risk assessment of French beef. The Government will be pressing for the European Commission to ensure the compulsory labelling of countries of origin of meat, including processed products. All allegations that imported over-30-months-beef is being or has been sold for human consumption are vigorously investigated. The agency will be asking local authorities to step up enforcement action on the 30-months rule in meat processing plants and retailers. The FSA has advised Ministers to consider tightening the 1996 regulations so that they cover certification and beef products and we will be doing that urgently.

<a name="01124w11.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Bercow: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment if he will make a statement on progress with the Fresh Start Initiative.  [139777]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01124w11.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 The Government are committed to preventing schools from failing, and turning round those that do as quickly as possible. There are now under 380 schools on special measures compared with 515 in 1998. Over 600 schools have been turned round since 1997. The average turn-round time currently averages 18 months, compared to 25 months in 1997.
<P>

<a name="01124w11.html_para3">Over 100 schools in special measures have closed, and the pupils been educated elsewhere. Where it proves impossible to turn a school round in a reasonable time, closure should be the preferred option. In exceptional circumstances, where closure is not feasible, the local education authority may consider a Fresh Start, closing the existing school and opening a new school on the same site. This is a difficult course, and should be reserved for the hardest cases. Twenty five schools have been "Fresh Started". All were causing concern and the majority had been on special measures for over two years.
<P>

<a name="01124w11.html_para4">We have built on the experience of the early Fresh Starts. We are now providing targeted capital and recurrent funding, and professional support. We will not provide funds or support unless the Fresh Start process planned and supported by the local education authority, and there is a strong likelihood of success.
<P>

<a name="01124w11.html_para5">Fresh Start schools are new and fragile, and there are no quick fixes. They will be treated in the same way as other schools on special measures, including termly monitoring by Ofsted. They need to focus on raising the achievement of their pupils. We expect all Fresh Start secondary schools to achieve the minimum standard of 15 per cent. of pupils achieving five GCSEs at grades A <sup>1</sup> -C within three years of opening.

<P>
<a name="01124w11.html_spnew4"><B> Jacqui Smith </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 20 November 2000]:</i> Some 130 special schools have closed since 1 May 1997. This includes at least 11 special schools whose closure was approved before that date. It also includes 15 schools whose closure has been approved but has not yet taken place. Twenty-two of these schools were failing schools.
<P>

<a name="01124w11.html_para6">The closure of special schools is often part of a larger reorganisation of provision for children with special educational needs, which may consist of the opening of other special schools, or the establishment of special units within mainstream schools. The pupils from a closing special school will transfer to another school which can meet their needs--whether that be another special school, a special unit or appropriately supported in a mainstream school.
<P>

<a name="01124w11.html_para7">In January there were 93,018 pupils in such schools; in January 2000 there were 91,708, a reduction of 1.4 per cent.
<P>

<a name="01124w11.html_para8">Since 1 September 1999, proposals for opening, closing or making alterations to schools have been determined by local School Organisation Committees rather than by the Secretary of State. These committees are made up of representatives of the local education authority, local primary, secondary and special schools and others.

Learning Mentors have already been introduced in nearly 500 city secondary schools through our Excellence in Cities initiative. As the initiative is extended in the next school year, we are enabling city secondary schools to employ 1,500 Learning Mentors in a total of 1,000 secondary schools. That will mean that one third of all secondary school pupils will be

covered by the programme. Learning Mentors help young people overcome barriers to learning, both inside and outside school.

<a name="01124w12.html_para3">The new Connexions service will operate from April next year. It is a major new advice, guidance and support service for young people aged 13-19. Its aim is to connect and reconnect young people with learning, and help them to make a successful transition to adult life.
<P>

<a name="01124w12.html_para4">The Children's Fund, announced last week and worth &#163;450 million over three years, will lead the Government's policy on preventing poverty and disadvantage for children and young people. The majority of the Fund will be targeted on preventive work with children (primarily in the 5 to 13 age group) and their families, helping them before they hit crisis. &#163;70 million of the Fund will be distributed directly to local communities through a network of local funds administered by the voluntary sector itself.
<P>

<a name="01124w12.html_para5">The Government take child protection seriously and have made recommendations to local education authorities and schools about protecting children from abuse. These include that all schools should have a child protection policy; that schools should have a designated member of staff responsible for co-ordinating action within the school and liaising with other agencies; and procedures to be followed if a member of staff is accused of abuse.

<a name="01124w12.html_para6">Schools are also encouraged to support the emotional health and well-being of children through the National Health School Standard.

 Parents of children in maintained schools are entitled to see their child's educational record, free of charge, within 15 school days of making a written request. They are similarly entitled to receive a copy at no greater cost than that of supplying it. In both cases, the Data Protection Act 1998 prevents disclosure of some material--for example, that which would be likely to cause serious harm to the physical or mental health or emotional condition of the pupil or someone else.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what measures he is taking to support the development of skills in media and broadcasting technology among people of school age.  [140181]<P>

<a name="01124w13.html_spnew0"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 The National Curriculum enables pupils from an early age to develop the skills needed to access and judge information from a variety of sources, including television and the media. There are many opportunities for pupils to develop technological skills, particularly within Information and Communications Technology and Design and Technology.
<P>

<a name="01124w13.html_para0">With our encouragement, the British Film Institute has worked with a range of partners, including teachers, to produce an excellent guide 'Moving Images in the classroom' for secondary schools. It offers a range of practical activities to develop pupils' skills in many different subjects including, for example, using video and software editing in Music and using a video or ICT to produce a foreign language voice-over for a news item.

GCSEs in Media Studies are now taken by some 25,000 pupils each year. Vocational GCSEs will extend these opportunities to greater numbers of young people.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what steps he is taking to fill teaching vacancies in England; and if he will make a statement.  [140287]<P>

<P>
<a name="01124w13.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 As a result of the Government's policies, more teachers are now working in English schools than for a decade. A sample survey undertaken by my Department in September suggested that the national teacher vacancy rate remained below 1 per cent. the same as in January. However, we recognise that there is difficulty in some subjects and in some parts of the country, and that more needs to be done if schools are to be able to recruit all of the staff that they need.
<P>

<a name="01124w13.html_para1">That is why current plans provide for over &#163;0.5 billion to be spent on teacher recruitment between this year and 2003-04. The &#163;6,000 training salaries for postgraduates and enhanced Golden Hellos for shortage subject teachers announced on 30 March have led to the first rise in the number of people registering for teacher training since 1992-93. 2,000 more teachers have applied this last year. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has also announced funding to more than double the number of employment-based graduate trainees working in schools in 2000-01. In addition to a &#163;4,000 grant to cover training costs, &#163;13,000 in a full year is being paid to schools from 1 September in respect of each of these trainees in order to allow them to be employed as supernumeraries. A special assistance package for teacher recruitment in London was also announced in August.
