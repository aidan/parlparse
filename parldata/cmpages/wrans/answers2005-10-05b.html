</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1">Information on the number of young people who have applied, enrolled and received EMA is available at Local Education Authority level, but not at constituency level. Attached is a breakdown by school/college of 16, 17, 18 and 19 year old students who have received EMA during the academic year 2004/2005 in the Local Education Authorities of Gloucestershire, Somerset, Bath and North East Somerset, City of Bristol, North Somerset and South Gloucestershire. If a young person attended and received payment from more than one institute then they will be counted more than once in this report.</p>

<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2">During the Academic year 2004/2005 EMA was available to all 16 years olds across England who met the eligibility criteria and also to those 17, 18 and 19 years olds who reside in former EMA pilot areas (and meet eligibility criteria).</p>

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3">Although there were no pilot areas in Gloucestershire, West of England and Somerset Local Learning and Skills Council (LSC) areas the attached data shows some 17 and 18 years olds having received EMA payments. This is because either the young person travels across area borders to attend school/college (assessment is based upon residence of young person) or they have moved residence from a non-pilot area during the academic year.</p>

<sup>(10)</sup> The figures for assessments for occupational deafness show all cases where there is a level of disablement assessed as, due to the nature of the scheme, all assessments for occupational deafness have to be at least 20 per cent. and therefore above the threshold for receiving Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit.<br>

NIESR calculated that by March 2000, NDYP had reduced unemployment among all age groups by 35,000. They also estimated that NDYP raised youth employment by 15,000 (excluding those on the environmental task force and voluntary sector options).

These were associated mainly with temperature fluctuations relative to the trend in temperatures. The underlying trend in emissions is determined by the interaction between economic growth, the mix of fuels in the economy and the energy needed per unit of economic output.

Ch <sub>4</sub>  emissions follow a gradual downward trend that can be attributed to the sum of reductions in emissions from energy, waste and agriculture. The underlying decrease is a result of changing waste disposal practices and a reduction in fugitive emissions from fuels. Agriculture emissions were reasonably steady until the foot and mouth outbreak of 2001 led to reduced livestock numbers and a subsequent reduction in enteric fermentation.

The more gradual rise from 1993 to 1997 can be attributed to an increase in the number of cars fitted with catalytic converters and to a slight rise in emissions from agriculture. The overall downward trend in N+O emissions is due to the gradual rise in emissions from energy being offset by a larger decrease in the industrial sector and general downward trend in agricultural emissions.

<p><a name="st_66"><a name="51005w09.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 The original intention of the Animal By-Products Regulation (EC) No. 1774/2002 was to impose a complete ban on former foodstuffs containing products of animal origin being sent to landfill from 1 January 2006. However, on 20 May this year, prior to a working group meeting in Brussels on 23 May, officials from my Department along with those in other member states received papers from the European Commission indicating a change in the Commission&#039;s approach to implementing the ban. Subsequently, at the meeting on 23 May, the Commission announced its intention to allow pre-treated former foodstuffs that member states believe do not pose a risk to animal or public health to continue to go to landfill, under the control of the EU Landfill Directive rather than the Animal By-Products Regulation. The Commission has now tabled a draft amending Regulation to bring this into effect. The draft covers former foodstuffs that are not considered safe to be fed to livestock but which can safely be disposed of to landfill or treated in an alternative system; and, those that can be fed to livestock (bread, pasta, etc) or be disposed of to landfill. The measure does not apply to raw meat and raw fish which are already banned from disposal to landfill and which must be disposed of in accordance with the Regulation i.e. by rendering, incineration, composting or treatment by biogas.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51005w09.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_53">The Department did not ask the Commission to reverse the complete ban on former foodstuffs being sent to landfill. However, in the light of discussions with a variety of parties, we drew the Commission&#039;s attention to the difficulties they had with compliance, and particularly those that small retailers anticipated. We suggested to the Commission that these difficulties could be lessened if the requirements for commercial documentation and transport were brought more into line with existing environmental controls, and if alternative treatments were to be permitted providing livestock were not able to have access to the treated product. Nevertheless, we support the principle that as far as the Animal By-Products Regulation is concerned the ban on landfill should apply only to those former foodstuffs which present a risk to animal and public health. The Government is committed to reducing the UK&#039;s reliance on landfill, in order to reduce its environmental impact and because landfilling is a missed opportunity to recover value from waste. Therefore the 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>5 Oct 2005 : Column 2836W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>

Most recently, officials met a number of waste management companies and the Environment Services Association on 13 April, the UK Renderers&#039; Association on 10 May and 21 June, the Composting Association on 27 May and the Regulated Incinerator Operators on 21 June.

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_36">Between 2004&#150;05 and 2007&#150;08, magnetic resonance imaging activity needs to increase by more than 100 per cent.</p>

 Until April 2002, local councils regulated independent sector care homes and health authorities regulated nursing homes. Each council regulated the care homes in its area, based on national regulations using locally developed standards. This system led to inconsistencies between different areas and some services, like domiciliary care, were not regulated at all. The Government addressed this by introducing new regulatory arrangements to ensure consistency and improve the quality of life and level of protection for vulnerable people receiving social and health care.

 The most recent round of revenue allocations to primary care trusts (PCTs), covering the period 2006&#150;07 and 2007&#150;08, was announced in February 2005. The Department, in conjunction with the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, was able to include an adjustment for the growth area initiative in this round of allocations. The growth area adjustment informs the target position of PCTs within the growth areas. It is the PCTs&#039; target positions that determine their fair shares of the revenue allocations. The table shows the 2006&#150;07 and 2007&#150;08 revenue allocations to those PCTs covered by the growth area initiative.

 There have been no formal assessments made on the level of abuse of methadone.

 It is not standard practice for the World Health Organisation (WHO) to consult member states about the compilation of the list of essential medicines. The WHO has an expert scientific advisory committee, which provides advice on maintaining and developing its list of essential medicines.

 By 2007&#150;08, we plan to deliver an unparalleled expansion in most diagnostic services to reduce waiting time for patients further. Most of this expansion will be delivered through increasing investment and productivity in the national health service, using the record levels of NHS funding for the next three years and making the best use of existing equipment and facilities. These plans are based on understanding and meeting local needs for diagnostic services, which have been developed through working closely with local health communities to understand their needs for extra capacity. While the independent sector has a key part to play, NHS providers of diagnostics services also need to ensure that they are using their diagnostic capacity to the full.

<p><a name="st_157"><a name="51005w19.html_spnew4"><b> Jane Kennedy: </b> 
 Compulsory inspections of the hospital environment are undertaken every year through the patient environment action team (PEAT) process. This includes inspection of a sample of wards, but goes beyond this to assess a wide range of public and patient areas. The PEAT process is broad and considers more than hygiene standards, but cleanliness, including specific mention of wards, is weighted in the final score in recognition of its importance to patients. In addition to this national programme, many trusts undertake regular local inspections of their wards and other clinical areas.




<br>&nbsp;<br><i>5 Oct 2005 : Column 2872W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>


<p>
<a name="51005w19.html_para3">
Standards for the patient environment have risen since PEAT began in 2000. Then, around a third of hospitals were rated poor or unacceptable. Today, 95 per cent. of national health service trusts are rated as acceptable or better.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51005w19.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_113">Most scientific evidence stresses hand hygiene and sound clinical practices as being particularly important in preventing healthcare associated infections (HCAIs). It is unlikely that a more stringent environmental inspection regime alone would significantly reduce HCAI rates.

 The present night restrictions regime at Heathrow refers to both a night period, 2300&#150;0700 hours, and a night quota period 2330&#150;0600. In the night quota period movements by all types of aircraft, except the very quietest, are restricted by a movements limit and a noise quota, which are set for each season. At Heathrow, the movements limit for each summer season from 2000&#150;04 was 3,250 and for winter 2001&#150;02 to 2004&#150;05 was 2,550. The airport operator may carry over a limited number of movements from one season to the next depending on usage from the previous season.

<i>[holding answer 20 July 2005]:</i> The West Midlands Route Utilisation Strategy was published by the Strategic Rail Authority (SRA) on 21 July. The Strategy concluded that Coventry Arena station would present low levels of traffic for most of the week with occasional large event demands requiring train capacity far in excess of the current provision. The cost of rail provision to meet these high peaks in demand would be very high. Consequently a proposal to meet this demand had not been evaluated by the promoter and no business case for the station had been received. The SRA concluded that it was unable to support the inclusion of the station on the Coventry-Nuneaton route.

<a name="51005w21.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_124">The SRA wrote to Coventry city council on 24 August 2004 identifying a number of areas of concern with the outline business case. If the council wishes to pursue the proposal, it will need to address those concerns and submit to the Department a viable and funded business case.
