<P>
<P>
<a name="70708w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Pickthall: </B> 
To ask the Prime Minister when he expects to receive the Third Report of the Committee on Standards in Public Life; and if he will make a statement. [7541]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70708w01.html_spmin0"><B>The Prime Minister:</B> 
 The Third Report of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, under the Chairmanship of Lord Nolan, is being published today as Command Paper 3702. I am arranging for copies to be placed in the Vote Office and the Library of the House.
<P>

<a name="70708w01.html_para0">We are committed to ensuring the highest standards in public life in this country. I am grateful to Lord Nolan and his colleagues for the significant contribution that they continue to make towards improving the standards of conduct throughout the public sector. Their Third Report covers local government in England, Scotland and Wales.
<P>

<a name="70708w01.html_para1">The Committee received wide-ranging written submissions and heard extensive oral evidence in open proceedings. It has concluded that there are:

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>
<BR>
"an enormous number of dedicated and hard working people"
<BR>
in local government. It has, however, identified that there is a lack of clarity about rules or expectation of proper behaviour, which it believes is because the responsibility for the maintenance of standards has moved away from local government.

<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="70708w01.html_para2">The Committee is, therefore, proposing that in the new climate of improved relations between central and local government, a new start should now be made on building an ethical framework for local government. This would take the best of what already exists, but place responsibility with local government itself. In this context the Committee has unanimously made some forty detailed recommendations. These, if implemented, would result in a radical restructuring of the ethical framework in which local authorities--their members and officers--operate.
<P>

<a name="70708w01.html_para3">I welcome the Committee's careful examination and analysis of conduct--both of councillors and of officers--in local authorities. Their confirmation of the strengths of local government in Great Britain is reassuring, and demonstrates that there is a firm foundation on which we can build. We entirely accept the Committee's conclusion that now is the time to make a new start on the ethical framework for local government.
<P>

<a name="70708w01.html_para4">Accordingly, we shall now be consulting widely on the Committee's specific recommendations, including with the Local Government Association, the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, the Welsh Local Government Association, the Audit Commission of England and Wales, and the Scottish Accounts Commission. In parallel with this consultation the Nolan Committee will be consulting on a proposal for a new statutory offence of 



<P>
<P><I>8 Jul 1997 : Column: 390</I><P>
misuse of public office, which would apply across the public sector, including local government. Copies of the Committee's consultation paper are available with the Report.
<P>

<a name="70708w01.html_para5">Our intention is to work in partnership with local government to establish a framework for local authorities guaranteeing the highest standards of conduct. Such a framework will be central to achieving our manifesto aim of more independent but accountable local government.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what plans he has to work towards a uniform electoral system for the 1999 elections to the European Parliament. [5735]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70708w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 The Government remain committed to the introduction of a proportional voting system for elections to the European Parliament but no decision has yet been taken on the timing of a change.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70708w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 We will be giving early consideration to taking forward the recent review by the Home Department and the Treasury of the police pension scheme in general, including the question of a consultation exercise, but we have no present plans to extend the scope of the police widows pension.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many police officers in the Metropolitan Police are currently awaiting a placement with a police station and assigned no other specific duties; and what is the estimated cost of these police officers in salary or costs. [6450]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70708w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 The Commissioner informs me that there are no officers within the Metropolitan Police District currently awaiting a placement with a police station and assigned no other specific duties.
<P>
<P>
<a name="70708w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Burstow: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what estimates the Metropolitan Police Commissioner has made of the cost of providing the necessary retraining arising from his Career Management policy. [6451]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70708w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 The Commissioner informs me that there will be no increase in the Metropolitan Police's training budget as a result of the introduction of the new tenure policy. Any additional demands for training will not be significant and will be met from within existing budgets.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what is his estimate of the cost of policing the British Field Sports Rally in Hyde Park on 10 July. [7125]




<P>
<P><I>8 Jul 1997 : Column: 391</I><P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70708w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 The Commissioner informs me that the estimated staffing cost to the Metropolitan Police for policing the British Sports Rally in Hyde Park on 10 July is &#163;119,374, on the basis of a complete eight hour tour of duty for all staff. The figure covers the cost of the normal duties the officers would have otherwise undertaken. No figure is available for the costs of support services, such as catering and transport. The extent to which officers are deployed to police a public order event is an operational decision for the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis.

<P>
<a name="70708w01.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Baker: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what is the date and title of the oldest document or archival unit retained by his Department which has not been passed on to the Public Record Office for release for public inspection. [7203]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70708w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 The oldest documents retained in the Home Office under section 3(4) of the Public Records Act 1958 date from 1876. They are concerned with matters relating to national security. It had earlier been decided that it would not be in the public interest to disclose their nature. Now that the matter has been drawn to my attention by the hon. Member's question, I have asked that this decision be reviewed, given the antiquity of the files in question.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70708w01.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. David Atkinson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make a statement on his Department's timetable for dealing with the Year 2000 Computer Problem; who is in charge of the project; how many staff are working on it; what is the projected cost of resolving the problem; and whether the project is on schedule. [7142]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70708w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 The Year 2000 computer problem will impact directly on the business of the Department. For this reason, the Director of each business area in the Home Office has appointed a Year 2000 manager who is responsible for ensuring that computer systems within their area are Year 2000-compliant. Initial inventory and audits were completed by December 1996 and costed plans for resolving the problem are to be produced by each business area by October 1997. The aim is for all system changes to have been implemented and tested by December 1998, and for the cost of preventive and remedial action to be met from within existing provision. At present, the project is on schedule to meet these dates.
<P>

<a name="70708w01.html_para6">The Corporate Resources Director is chairing a Year 2000 Steering Committee, the terms of reference for which include the monitoring of action taken across the Department to ensure that the timetable is met and the sharing of information to ensure that business areas benefit from experience elsewhere and that they co-operate where appropriate. My Department is represented on the Central Computer and Telecommunications Agency's (CCTA) Year 2000 Public Sector Group and is using the guidance issued by CCTA "Tackling the Year 2000".

To ask the Secretary of State for Wales what monitoring takes place of the quality of surgery carried out in general practitioners' surgeries in Wales; how this compares with the monitoring of similar surgical work in hospitals; and if he will make a statement. [5321]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70708w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Win Griffiths: </B> 
 Since 1 April 1996, GPs providing secondary care services in a primary care setting are required to obtain Health Authority approval to ensure the safe and effective provision of such services. Health Authorities must also satisfy themselves of a GPs competence to undertake and continue to undertake minor surgical procedures, as part of their normal general medical services commitments. Authorities must ensure the strict criteria for admission to their minor surgery list is met prior to agreeing to pay for these services, as with any other provider for whom it has a contract to purchase services.

To ask the Secretary of State for Wales if he will set out the steps which are being taken by his Department to end in Wales the internal market of the national health service. [5874]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70708w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Win Griffiths: </B> 
 I have deferred approval of the eighth wave of GP fundholding until July 1998 to allow breathing space to develop alternative commissioning models. I recently announced that I would be inviting proposals to pilot new arrangements for locality commissioning, supported by some of the savings generated by the postponement.
<P>

<a name="70708w02.html_para0">Officials have notified health authorities and GP fundholders that revised budgetary arrangements will be developed to remove some of the disadvantages experienced by patients of non-fundholding practices. Detailed guidance will issue shortly.
<P>

<a name="70708w02.html_para1">I have also asked the Welsh Association of Fundholding Practices (WAFP) and the General Medical Services Council (GMSC) for Wales to work with me to determine the direction of health care in the principality, building on current best practice.
<P>

<a name="70708w02.html_para2">On 25 June the Government announced a White Paper on the National Health Service's internal market. It will be the subject of extensive consultation throughout Wales in the autumn.

<P>
<a name="70708w02.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Ron Davies: </B> 
 I have today laid before the House a White Paper, the first in modern times to focus exclusively on education in Wales. Called 'Building Excellent Schools Together', it sets out our vision of improving standards through co-operation to create an education system designed to benefit the many, not the few.
<P>

<a name="70708w02.html_para4">Central to the White Paper are our key principles. We have promised to make education and training the cardinal priority of government in Wales. We shall work with teachers, recognising their efforts and encouraging them to succeed in lifting achievement and attainment across the board. We shall focus on standards, rather than a damaging concentration on structures-and we will not tolerate underperformance. We shall also ensure that government policy is applied in a way that reflects the distinctive needs and circumstances of Wales.
<P>

<a name="70708w02.html_para5">Raising standards of literacy and numeracy will be at the heart of our programme of reform. Following my right hon. Friend's Budget Statement to the House on 2 July, substantial extra funding will be allocated to education in Wales and we shall use this where we can achieve the best results. We shall also provide leadership and support to all those who have a contribution to make in the drive to raise standards overall. This will draw in the help of everyone with a stake in excellent education for all pupils at school in Wales; teachers, parents, governors, education authorities and business people alike.

 We welcome an active dialogue with WaterAid. We are currently co-funding 12 WaterAid projects with a total cost of &#163;950,000 this financial year. My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for International Development met WaterAid's Director on 3 July. My officials are in regular contact. I have made it clear that access to safe water and sanitation is a priority

 We expect to have resolved problems relating to the year 2000 on information systems critical to the business of the Department by the end of 1998. We are working in parallel on smaller systems established by various sections within the DFID, and expect to resolve them by mid-1999. The identifiable cost of dealing with Year 2000 issues is around &#163;200,000 although this figure is an underestimate of the total since other Year 2000 costs have been subsumed within the costs of rewriting critical systems for a new operating environment. The official in overall charge of dealing with the Year 2000 is the head of the Information Systems Department. The number of staff working on the project is around five, supplemented by resources brought in from consultants.

The total required within the European Community if the proposal were to be adopted would depend on which countries participate in the single currency.

<i>Letter from Tim Holt to Ms Oona King, dated 8 July 1997:</i>

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>
<BR>
The Chancellor of the Exchequer has asked me to reply as Director of the Office for National Statistics to your recent questions on the duration of unemployment of under and over 25 year olds.
<BR>
The measure of unemployment, derived from the quarterly Labour Force Survey (LFS), is defined on a consistent and internationally recognised basis set out by the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and counts as unemployed people who are: a) without a paid job; b) available to start work within the next two weeks and c) have either looked for work in the last four weeks or are waiting to start a job already obtained. However, largely because it is a sample survey, information is not available from the LFS in as much geographical detail as from the claimant count measure described below.
<BR>
ONS also publishes the monthly claimant count, which is based on the administrative system and includes all people claiming unemployment-related benefits (i.e. Jobseekers Allowance, Income Support or National Insurance credits) at Employment Service offices on the day of the monthly count, who on that day had signed on as unemployed and available to do any suitable work. Essentially, all people who attend an Employment Service office to sign are counted, irrespective of whether they are actually receiving benefit.
<BR>
The data you have requested for London local authority districts can only be derived from the claimant count, as the Labour Force Survey does not provide sufficient detail at this level. As the concept of "economically active" is an ILO one, it is not compatible with claimant count data, and therefore percentages are not given for claimant figures.
<BR>
The latest available data, April 1997, for under 25 year olds and over 25 year olds claiming unemployment-related benefits for over 6 months and 2 years respectively are shown in the attached table.
<BR>
The winter 1996/7 LFS shows there were 262,000 (5.7 per cent of economically active in the same age group) people aged 16-24 and 467,000 (1.9 per cent. of economically active in the same age group) people aged 25 and over who have been ILO unemployed for 6 months or more and 2 years or more respectively.

The Chancellor of the Exchequer has asked me to reply as Director of the Office for National Statistics to your recent question on how many people aged 18 to 24 years left the claimant count in each of the last five years in the parliamentary constituency of Stoke-on-Trent North, and the reasons why they left.
<BR>
The information requested is not available for the exact areas of parliamentary constituencies. The estimates provided refer to claimants who are registered at the two Employment Service jobcentres situated within the Stoke-on-Trent North parliamentary constituency area.
<BR>
Total numbers leaving the claimant count from 1992 to 1996 are shown in Tables 1 to 3, but information on the destination of leavers from the claimant count is not available for 1992 to 1994.
<BR>
For 1995 and 1996, numbers of leavers from the claimant count are shown in Tables 2 and 3 according to the claim end reason categories identified in those years. The percentages shown in these tables are expressed in terms of leavers with a known destination.

The Chancellor of the Exchequer has asked me to reply as the Director of the Office for National Statistics to your recent question on earnings.
<BR>
The latest information, from the New Earnings Survey (NES) April 1996, is given in the attached tables. Data are provided for the Great Britain as information for the United Kingdom is not available.
<BR>
It is ONS practice for NES answers to be given as proportions earning below specified thresholds, rather than numbers, because of problems with obtaining appropriate grossing factors for the NES sample at a very detailed level of disaggregation (e.g. by industry and electoral ward).

Estimates available from the Labour Force Survey for non-pensioner households are shown in the attached table using the new Government Office Region (GOR) geography. This information is not available below county level.
<BR>
It is widely accepted that analyses of households with no one in employment or, in this case, no one in full-time employment, should exclude pensioner households. This area of analysis is relatively new for the LFS and the definition of non-pensioner or working age households is not yet firmly established. The table provided is based on the same definition of non-pensioner household as previous responses to parliamentary questions to this topic. The ONS has been assessing the various alternative definitions and expects to publish its recommendations in the September issue of Labour Market Trends.

 The Government has decided to adopt a twin-track approach of pursuing a revised Export Certified Herds Scheme, and developing a new proposal for a date-based export scheme. We have put our ideas to the Commission about both schemes, and will press both with equal vigour.
<P>

<a name="70708w06.html_para0">The Export Certified Herds Scheme is being revised taking account of criticisms made earlier by the EU Scientific Veterinary Committee.

<P>
<a name="70708w06.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The cleansing requirements for vehicles transporting waste material form the slaughter of cattle, including Specified Bovine Material (SBM), were considered by the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee (SEAC) in May last year. It concluded that decontamination and proper cleaning of vehicles was important but that given the extreme nature of the chemicals which had to be used if chemical disinfection were to be relied upon it was more important to use dilution and washing with large quantities of water and detergent to ensure that vehicles were returned to a suitable state for further use.
<P>

<a name="70708w06.html_para2">The Specified Bovine Material Order 1997 requires any person transporting SBM to ensure that the vehicle, or part of the vehicle, in which it is conveyed is impervious and contains nothing but SBM. It must be kept covered at all times except for loading or unloading or inspection by an authorised officer of an enforcement authority. It also requires that any person transporting SBM shall ensure that the part of the vehicle in which SBM is carried is thoroughly washed and disinfected before any food, feeding stuff or other animal material or any cosmetic, pharmaceutical or medical product is subsequently placed in that part of the vehicle.
<P>

<a name="70708w06.html_para3">Enforcement of the vehicle cleansing requirements set out in the Specified Bovine Material Order 1997 is the responsibility of local authorities. No central record is kept of the number of local authority inspectors that examine vehicles transporting SBM or how many inspections they have made since 1 August 1996 or how many vehicles failed local authority inspections and this information could be obtained only at disproportionate cost.

 <i>[holding answer 7 July 1997]:</i> The British Isles is an internationally recognised rabies free zone for terrestrial animals. We do not allow unrestricted access to rabies vaccine because its use, except for animals going for export or those going into quarantine, is unnecessary.

<a name="70708w06.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The International Office for Epizootics (OIE) has considered the revised protocol and published it as the OIE standard recently. Whilst this is a small step in overcoming the problems of test result variability, we understand that only two laboratories are using the new protocol. The OIE is also making arrangements for a new canine standard serum to be calibrated and validated for use with this test to ensure that different laboratories produce comparable results. As far as we are aware these arrangements are still being made and no timescale for completion of the work is known.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food how many farmers have been found to have been in possession of BSE-contaminated feed since August 1996. [4863]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70708w06.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 Remnant work on the Feed Recall Scheme brought to our attention one farmer who has, since 1 August 1996, been in possession of feed containing mammalian meat and bone meal (MBM). The feed in question was not fed to livestock and has now been safely disposed of. It is impossible to say whether this feed was contaminated with the BSE agent but the controls on Specified Bovine Materials, which require the destruction of all tissues known to harbour BSE infectivity, mean that the likelihood of infectivity being present is very low.
<P>

<a name="70708w06.html_para4">In another incident, a farmer was found to have been storing mammalian MBM in a farm store together with ingredients used in the production of livestock feed. The MBM was disposed of in landfill. Thorough sampling showed no evidence that cross-contamination had occurred, and the premises were <i>not </i>part of a livestock enterprise.
<P>

<a name="70708w06.html_para5">The State Veterinary Service carries out a survey of feed mills and on farm feed mixers for evidence of breaches of feed controls. Since 1 August 1996, when the latest controls came into effect, no evidence of a breach of the legislation has been found.

 This draft Directive--which is still under discussion--would not in general either limit or increase the availability of patent protection as compared to that already provided in UK law. The Ministry has not commissioned research into the implications for agriculture or animal welfare. We do not consider that the patent system is the right approach for dealing with ethical and related issues arising from biotechnology. The purpose of patenting is to prevent others claiming to own or trying to use inventions. However, patent holders must also comply with all other relevant legislation and regulations which, for example, give protection to the welfare of animals.

</i>(7) Final payments made by 30 April 1997.<P>

(8) The relatively high failure rate for F and CGS 1989 non-plan claims is due to a large number of claims being received in the month before the scheme closed, making it impossible to meet the Charter target in many cases.<P>

<P>

 1. The total percentage has been calculated by setting the entire number of applications or claims cleared within the target time, against the total number received. Applications and claims not cleared due to reasons beyond our control (incorrect information supplied by applicant, etc.) are not included as failures to meet target.<P>

 2. The Farm and Conservation Grant Scheme (1991) Plan applications, the Farm Diversification Grant Scheme (Capital Items) Claims, and the Farm Diversification Grant Scheme (Feasibility and Marketing) Claims have all been omitted from the table, as the numbers involved are de-minimis.<P>

 3. Three complaints were referred to the MAFF Adjudicator during the year. Two of these complaints were resolved, the other was referred to the Minister. One complaint from a previous year has been referred to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration and is currently under investigation.<P>

 Following an impact assessment study in 1996, a programme of remedial projects and related activities was initiated earlier this year. The total cost is expected to be of the order of &#163;2.7 million over the period to Spring 1999. The programme covers the core Department's IT systems and separate programmes are in place to deal with the issue in Next Steps agencies.
<P>

<a name="70708w07.html_para0">The core Department's Year 2000 programme is being overseen by a steering group chaired by the Department's Director of Information Management and Technology. The resources involved vary according to the requirements of individual projects and will peak at 16 personnel in September/October 1997. Those resources are being provided by private sector contractors and the programme is being supervised by the Department's own Project Manager. All required parts of the core programme are currently on schedule.

 On 30 June the President announced an inter-departmental review of utility regulation which will include an examination of the various models of consumer representation currently operating in the utilities, including in the telecommunications industry. If the review concludes that changes are necessary we will publish a consultation document setting out the options and reasons underlying the case for change.
<P>

<a name="70708w07.html_para1">In addition OFTEL is currently considering the responses received to its consultation document on the role of organisations who represent consumers on telecommunications matters, including the telecommunications advisory committees, and will publish a statement of its recommendations shortly.

 Resort Hotels plc collapsed in 1994 with substantial debts. The managing director of Resort Hotels, Mr. Robert Philip Feld, was found guilty on 1 April 1997 of fraud and forgery and was jailed for eight years; the audit of the accounts was referred to during his trial. Under Part II of the Companies Act 1989 the Recognised Supervisory Bodies (RSBs), are responsible for dealing with complaints against registered auditors. In the case of Resort Hotels the responsible RSB is the Institute of Chartered Accountants of England and Wales who are inquiring into the auditing of Resort Hotels in the light of Mr. Feld's trial. I shall write to my right hon. Friend when I hear the outcome of their inquiries.

 The abolition of the Primary Purpose criterion of the Immigration Rules has been widely publicised in South Asia.

Posts in South Asia are now also offering specific advice to those whose applications are affected by the abolition of the Primary Purpose criterion.

If such an interview proves inconclusive, the Entry Clearance Officer can invite the applicants and the sponsor to take a free DNA test under the government-funded scheme. The DNA test will satisfactorily establish the relationship between applicant and sponsor.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70708w10.html_spnew5"><B> Dr. Reid: </B> 
 The Ministry of Defence's long-term costing is the process by which the Department re-costs its internal plans and adjusts them. The product of this process is not contained in any single document. It has been the policy of successive governments not to publish detailed information on the outcome of the long term costing. The Department's internal plans represent projections and assumptions which inform advice to Ministers on the affordability of particular elements of the Defence programme. Accordingly, I am withholding the information requested, which constitutes internal discussion and advice, under exemption 2 of the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information. In addition, disclosure of some elements of this information could harm national security and international relations, prejudice the competitive position of the Department in future negotiations with contractors and reveal commercially confidential data. Accordingly, exemptions 1, 7 and 13 of the Code also apply.

 Service personnel records are routinely retained for about seventy five years so that my Department can respond to any administrative matters that may arise such as, for example, pension entitlement. The oldest such documents are Royal Naval ratings ledgers covering the period 1892-1923. These records will be assigned to Public Record Office class ADM 188 with transfer taking place during 1998.

 As indicated by my hon. Friend, the Minister of State for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food-- 1 July, <i>Official Report,</i> columns <i>158-160--</i>the discovery that radioactive waste had been dumped within the Beaufort's Dyke explosives disposal site followed a discovery of old papers in the Public Records Office. The lack of awareness of these papers and their contents led to previous Governments inadvertently giving inaccurate assurances.
<P>

<a name="70708w11.html_para0">The papers located thus far reveal that radioactive waste was disposed of at Beaufort's Dyke during the 1950s on behalf of Edinburgh and Glasgow Universities, Babcock and Wilcox Ltd., Ferranti Ltd. and Luminisers Ltd. The accepted practice for dealing with the waste, which was regarded at the time as being non-hazardous, was to encase it in concrete in mild steel drums. If necessary the drums were also weighted with scrap metal to ensure rapid sinking at the disposal location. We cannot be sure of the current condition of the steel drums since it would be extremely difficult to locate them given the large quantities of debris that are present on the seabed. 



<P>
<P><I>8 Jul 1997 : Column: 428</I><P>
However, the amounts of radioactivity that they contain are so small that release of the contents would be of no significance in terms of either public health or the marine environment. I therefore see no merit in initiating an independent enquiry.
<P>

<a name="70708w11.html_para1">Of importance is the fact that regular monitoring of the area has been carried out since the early 1960s; the most recent report entitled "Radioactivity in Food and the Environment 1995" is available in the Library of the House of Commons. This monitoring has not detected any measurable effect on radioactivity levels in the Beaufort's Dyke area, which remain well within internationally agreed safety levels.
<P>

<a name="70708w11.html_para2">My Department and others that were involved in the consultation and consenting procedures that were followed some 40 or so years ago, are currently carrying out an exhaustive check of records and archive material. Any relevant information which emerges will be made available to the House and the public at the earliest opportunity.

<a name="70708w11.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Dewar: </B> 
 The records of my Department are specifically exempted from the Public Records Act 1958, and therefore are not passed to the Public Record Office. However, broadly similar procedures apply to the transfer of records to the Scottish Record Office (SRO). In 1994 a review was conducted within the Scottish Office to establish the number of files retained beyond the 30 year point, and this list has since been updated annually. All such files are reported to the Scottish Records Advisory Council (SRAC), with an explanation as to why they have been retained. The oldest recorded file in this category was opened in 1949 and is titled "Agriculture (Scotland) Act 1948--Cottars". It has been held for administrative reasons as it contains papers relevant to the eligibility of a rare class of landholder for assistance under the Crofters Building Grants and Loans Scheme.

 We are currently considering the future shape of Private Finance Initiative in the National Health Service. Current guidance published jointly by the Private Finance Panel and Her Majesty's Treasury ("Transferability of Equity" (1996)) advises that the public sector should not seek to restrict the private sector's freedom to transfer its investments unless there are exceptional reasons arising from the special nature of a project.

geographical location or registration with a particular general practitioner; efficiency--health care that makes the best use of tax payers money; effectiveness--health care that focuses on quality of treatment rather than quantity alone; and responsiveness--health care that is sensitive and understanding of patients needs and concerns.

 The main agency through which the Government support biomedical and clinical research is the Medical Research Council.

 There are no Patient's Charter targets for reducing the number of patients on waiting lists.

 The Department of Health does not forecast health service inflation. Her Majesty's Treasury has notified the Department that the Gross Domestic Product deflator is forecast to be 2.75 per cent. in 1997-98.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what proportion of carers have been assessed under the provisions for assessment in the Carers (Recognition and Services) Act 1995; and what action is being taken to increase that figure. [6821]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70708w13.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 It is not possible to assess the proportion of carers receiving an assessment under the Act, as the total pool of carers who would qualify for assessment, if they requested it, is not known. A recent survey by the Carers National Association concluded that, to date, a relatively small proportion of carers had been assessed. We intend to monitor the Act closely, both through commissioned research and as part of the Social Services Inspectorate inspection programme, and will need to consider what action to take if this reveals that the Act is not being effectively implemented.

 We welcome the report. The White Paper published yesterday sets out the Government's plans to tackle the issues raised by the report. Our plans to establish a General Teaching Council, raise standards in teacher training, and develop a framework of professional standards should raise the status of the profession and assist with the recruitment of good candidates for the teaching profession. We announced last month that we are introducing new standards for initial teacher training courses, and started consultation last week on proposals for employment-based routes into teaching that will also help to boost the supply of well-trained teachers.

There is, however, scope within the programmes of study for a number of National Curriculum subjects, including design and technology, maths, science and art, for schools to ensure that pupils have the opportunity to gain the knowledge, skills and understanding which they will need to study engineering.

 As stated in the White Paper "Excellence in Schools" published yesterday, the Government intends that all secondary schools should have a role in teaching young people the skills of good parenting, both formally and through contact with good adult role models. Schools need to impress upon young people at an early stage the emotional, financial, social and practical responsibilities which parenthood entails and the lifelong nature of the commitment it brings. The Department will be considering with teachers and others how this might best be achieved and what parenting education programmes should contain.

 No major trunk road schemes have passed an approval stage since May 1997.

 The costs of enhancement investment do not have to be recovered from a train operating company over one franchise period. The treatment of access charges in respect of network enhancements at future periodic reviews should generally take account of any agreement between the funding body or bodies and Railtrack on the future basis of charging, while having regard to specific public interest concerns.

The Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions has asked Lawrie Haynes to reply to your recent questions about the accuracy of the map of motorway lighting prepared by the Highways Agency.

The map of motorway lighting provided by the Highways Agency was produced to indicate the approximate distribution of lighting on motorways across England. Regional information was gathered and centrally collated onto a base map. Whilst every endeavour has been made to ensure the accuracy of the information, unfortunately an error occurred in the categorisation of the section of the M65 operated by the Highways Agency.
<BR>
I apologise for this error and confirm that the Agency's section of the M65 is completely lit. An updated list and map is enclosed for your information and updated copies of the map will be sent to the Library.

Over 150 individual representations have been received by the Inspectorate all raising concerns about the proposals. A 450-signature petition in support of the proposals was received by the local planning authority. As the appeals are still to be heard it would not be appropriate to comment on the merits of the proposed developments.

 We have no plans to reintroduce a statutory duty on local authorities to provide gypsy caravan sites. Local authorities already have a discretionary power (in section 24 of the Caravan Sites and Control of Development Act 1960) to provide sites for gypsies if necessary. My Department's Circular number 18/94, "Gypsy Sites Policy and Unauthorised Camping" also advises local authorities to keep their existing gypsy sites open and well maintained, and to consider the provision of emergency stopping places for gypsies visiting their area.

<a name="70708w16.html_para0">The vast majority of rent charges are on properties in the Bristol, Manchester and Wearside areas. The Rentcharges Act 1977 enables some householders who are liable to pay rent charges to redeem them cheaply and easily. However, certain rent charges are excluded from the Act and we are actively studying suggestions that there may as a result be scope for abuse by owners of such rent charges.

 An assessment of the abolition of tax credits on the income flow of local authority pension funds will in the first instance be a matter for each of the funds to consider, in discussion with their actuaries, investment managers and other advisers.

 A record number of 125 member countries attended the conference, the majority of whom favoured greater liberalisation of controls in favour of sustainable use in line with the agreements reached at the Earth summit in 1992 and since confirmed at the UN General Assembly Special Session last week.
<P>

<a name="70708w17.html_para1">Three southern African countries, Botswana, Namibia, and Zimbabwe, secured approval to transfer their elephant populations from Appendix I to Appendix II with the intention of allowing a limited resumption of trade in ivory stockpiles, live animals, and hunting trophies. During the Conference it became clear that a majority of countries supported an immediate resumption of trade in ivory. The United Kingdom and other EU Member States, working with African countries, were instrumental in deferring a final decision until stronger controls, verified by an independent panel of experts, are confirmed to be in place. In consequence, there will be no trade in ivory for at least 21 months. If trade in raw ivory does resume, the stockpiles will be exported to a single country, Japan, in a one-off experiment, subject to review. The UK abstained on the final vote in line with the European Union's Common Position.
<P>

<a name="70708w17.html_para2">After active interventions by the UK and other EU Member States, the Conference voted to maintain controls on a number of key species. Proposals from Japan and Norway to block the International Whaling Commission's primacy in matters concerning commercial whaling, whilst allowing trade to resume in several whale species, were rejected, as were South Africa's proposal for a limited trade in rhinoceros horn from their white rhino population, and a proposal from Cuba to resume trade in their stockpiles of hawksbill turtle shells.
<P>

<a name="70708w17.html_para3">With support from the EU the Conference adopted Germany's proposal to include all species of sturgeon on Appendix II, thereby ensuring that future trade in these species will be monitored and controlled. Agreement was reached on increased collaboration between CITES and the Food and Agriculture Organisation to gather data on shark landings, but the Conference rejected proposals from the USA, strongly supported by the UK, to establish a marine fish working group.
<P>

<a name="70708w17.html_para4">The Conference endorsed a major UK initiative to tackle the impact of traditional medicines on wild animals and plants. It agreed a resolution sponsored by the UK, Japan and Korea detailing actions to reduce over-exploitation of wild species for medicinal use though better communication with traditional medicine communities, the introduction of comprehensive legislation in consumer countries and range states, effective enforcement, and more research into substitutes for endangered species. The proposals were agreed by consensus following constructive discussions between the sponsor countries and China.
<P>

<a name="70708w17.html_para5">Proposals from Argentina, Bolivia, and Peru for a limited and controlled trade in sheared wool, cloth, and handicraft products from wild vicuna were adopted, but with a zero quota for the Bolivian population and other safeguards.

<a name="70708w17.html_para6">Finland withdrew from a proposal, which they had submitted jointly with Bulgaria and Jordan, to transfer all populations of the European Brown Bear from Appendix II to Appendix I. Most range states, including Russia, strongly opposed the proposal. In a series of votes, the Conference rejected the original proposal and subsequent amendments which would have confined its application to specific populations. In the absence of a common position, the UK and other EU Member States abstained on the first vote. Member States opposed the amended proposals which would have been impossible to enforce.
<P>

<a name="70708w17.html_para7">The UK and other EU Member States strongly supported a proposal from the USA and Bolivia to include Big Leaf Mahogany on Appendix II of the Convention. However, as in 1994, this was rejected by the Conference. Instead, a working group will examine ways of protecting this species from unsustainable logging.
<P>

<a name="70708w17.html_para8">In total, conference decisions will result in stricter controls on 17 species; one of these will transfer from Appendix III of the Convention to Appendix II, three from Appendix II to Appendix I, and thirteen will be added to the Convention for the first time. Less strict controls will apply to six species which will move from Appendix I to Appendix II. A further eleven species, which are presently on Appendix II but not in international trade, will be removed from the Convention altogether. Controls will also be removed from over a thousand artificially propagated hybrid plants widely sold through retail outlets.
<P>

<a name="70708w17.html_para9">With UK support, the Conference adopted an important initiative by tiger range states for stronger action to protect this critically endangered species. As the new Chair of the Convention's Standing Committee, we will ensure there are opportunities to discuss progress before the next Conference.
<P>

<a name="70708w17.html_para10">A proposal by the USA to establish a permanent Enforcement Working Group was rejected despite strong UK support, but Customs and Police members of the UK delegation organised an enforcement workshop during the Conference to discuss training, information exchange and co-operation between agencies. Several other countries took part, including the USA, Canada, South Africa, Mexico and a number of EU Member States.
<P>

<a name="70708w17.html_para11">The UK delegation also played an active role in discussions on other key issues, chairing a working group which produced an action plan to implement the findings of a report on the effectiveness of CITES, and a resolution calling for increased co-operation between CITES and other conventions, in particular, the Biodiversity Convention. The UK also brokered a compromise agreement on the Convention's budget over the next three years which will allow extra work to be done whilst limiting the overall increase in contributions to 5 per cent. An offer by the UK, strongly supported by the EU to host the next conference, was narrowly rejected in favour of Indonesia.
<P>

The Agency intake of new work in 1996-97 was 368,026. The intake for the 3 previous years was 356,317 in 1995-96; 398,584 in 1994-95; and 858,011 in 1993-94.

The table attached shows the total live and assessed caseload, and the number of cases with full maintenance assessments at the dates mentioned.
<BR>

Of the &#163;399.9m collected or arranged for payment by the Agency in 1996-97, &#163;267.7m (67%) has been calculated as offsetting benefit spending. This leaves an estimated &#163;132.2m (33%) which did not offset benefit spending.

I am replying to your Parliamentary Question to the Secretary of State for Social Security about the number of persons with care who have received payments of interest on delay from the Child Support Agency.
<BR>
The measure whereby persons with care are compensated for delays caused by the Agency in passing on maintenance payments was introduced in March 1996, and was applicable to payments made from 1 April 1995. At the 30 April 1997, the total number of persons with care who have received payments under this measure from the Agency was 835, from a live and assessed caseload of approximately half a million.
<BR>
I hope this is helpful.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70708w18.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Bradley: </B> 
 The formula provisions are designed to ensure that absent parents pay a reasonable amount towards the costs of their children, and contain a number of safeguards to ensure they retain a fair proportion of their income to meet other commitments. The additional maintenance payable when absent parents have sufficient income to meet the basic maintenance requirement helps to ensure that children share their higher standard of living.

I am replying to your Parliamentary Question to the Secretary of State for Social Security regarding the level of Child Support Agency full maintenance assessments against absent parents net income and the proportion of absent parents that have a maintenance assessment that is higher than the maintenance requirement.
<BR>
The tables below outline full maintenance assessments of absent parents by net income as requested.
<BR>
The proportion of absent parents with a final maintenance higher than the maintenance requirement is approximately 12%.

I hope this is helpful.

Absent parents with a net income of &#163;0.00 includes all cases where the absent parent is on income support JSA(IB). This includes a small number of cases where the maintenance assessment is greater than &#163;4.80. These are normally suspended cases where the CSA is investigating the current status of the absent parent.<P>

<BR>
The amount of debt, which includes final maintenance assessments and all interim maintenance assessments (except Category A maintenance assessments) remaining to be collected by the Agency at the end of March 1997 was &#163;513,124,641.
<BR>
The amount of maintenance outstanding attributable to Category A assessments remaining to be collected by the Agency at the end of March 1997 was &#163;613,765,094.
<BR>
Compliance rates are only available from November 1995. Prior to that date information available was of insufficient reliability to produce accurate results. The tables attached reflect the position from November 1995.
<BR>
We will not be including these statistics in the CSA Statistical Information report which is placed in the House of Commons Library, as these statistics are available to the public in the DSS Analytical Services Division CSA Quarterly Summary of Statistics.

The clearance of maintenance assessments is the subject of a Secretary of State target, which in 1996/97 required that 60% of new applications be cleared within 26 weeks. We therefore monitored the progress of applications with this target in mind.
<BR>
In 1996/97, we reported that 54% of new applications were cleared within 26 weeks. This was the figure for the full year. Performance was improving as the year-end approached in February and March, the in-month achievement was 60% and 63% respectively.
<BR>
Performance this year shows a continuing upward trend in the clearance of cases.

Details of the number of cases awaiting assessment at the end of each year of operation are as follows:
<BR>
<BR>
1993-94: 550,000
<BR>
1994-95: 425,561
<BR>
1995-96: 409,659
<BR>
1996-97: 406,649
<BR>
<BR>
Details of the Agency's live and assessed cases are provided by the Department of Social Security Analytical Services Division, and are measured for the Agency's Quarterly Summary of Statistics (QSS). The quarterly measurement has not always coincided with the end of the financial year; the following figures are therefore from the QSS nearest to the year-end:
<BR>
<BR>
1993-94: 203,600 (June 1994 QSS)
<BR>
1994-95: 345,400 (March 1995 QSS)
<BR>
1995-96: 460,800 (February 1996 QSS)
<BR>
1996-97: 579,200 (February 1997 QSS).
<BR>
<BR>
We would expect to have reduced work on hand to around 200,000 by the end of 1998-99. The Agency is constantly seeking to improve clearance times and taking this into account would expect to have around 150,000-200,000 cases on hand during the following three years.
<BR>
<BR>
The number of live and assessed cases at the end of each of the next five years is expected to be as follows:
<BR>
<BR>
1997-98: 730,000

1998-99: 855,000

Most letters of complaint to the Agency are not dealt with centrally, but are handled by the Child Support Agency Centres (or, in a small number of instances, field offices) responsible for the complainants case. The number of complaints received by the Centres (or the field) over the last six quarters is as follows:

It is important to consider the amount of correspondence, whether complaints or other matters, in the context of the Agency's overall business. From launch in April 1993 to the end of 1996/97, the Agency has taken on just under two million cases. A relatively small proportion of the Agency's workload, therefore, results in complaints or other correspondence.<P>

In response to a written Parliamentary Question, the then Parliamentary Under Secretary of State announced on 25 March 1996, that an Independent Complaints Examiner would be recruited for the Agency. This was followed by a press release, on the same day, stating his intentions to recruit an Independent Complaints Examiner, following a pilot to inform the guidelines within which the Examiner would operate. The appointment of Anne Parker as Independent Case Examiner was announced in a press release on 31st December 1996 and a leaflet explaining the service was published at the end of March 1997. Additionally, moves to 



publicise the service have included meetings between the Examiner and stakeholder organisations, and correspondence from the Ombudsman to MPs.<P>

The Office of the Independent Case Examiner opened for business on 7th April 1997, but there were some restrictions on publicity during the General Election period.<P>

I hope this is helpful.<P>

<BR>
I am replying to your Parliamentary Question to the Secretary of State for Social Security about the Child Support Agency initial period arrears cases.
<BR>
This measure was introduced to encourage absent parents to start paying maintenance where significant levels of arrears had accrued, as a direct result of Agency delays in processing initial maintenance assessments in the early period of the Agency. Under this arrangement, if absent parents continue to comply for 52 weeks, they would only be liable for the latest 6 months of arrears. Where this results in a balance of arrears being due to the person with care, this is paid by the Agency in the form of a special payment.
<BR>
The table attached shows the number of cases where initial period arrears have been deferred and the number of cases where the person with care has been compensated.
<BR>
Because of the 52 week qualifying period no payments were made during 1995/96. It follows that any agreements made for 1996/97 would not be actioned until the beginning of the following financial year, namely 1997/98.
<BR>
I hope this is helpful.

I am replying to your Parliamentary Question to the Secretary of State for Social Security about the performance of the Child Support Agency in 1996/97.
<BR>
Performance statistics for the final quarter of the year were placed in the Library on 4th June 1997.
<BR>
The Agency was given a demanding set of targets for 1996/97 by the Secretary of State, and performance indicated the good progress made in its main activities, with four out of five targets achieved in full. Full details of performance against the targets are shown in the attached table 1.
<BR>
The original Agency Charter was published in April 1993 to coincide with the launch of the Agency. It has now been revised, following consultation with Agency staff, client representative groups, DSS Headquarters, and the Citizen's Charter Unit. The new Charter was published in November 1996, and was the first Agency leaflet to be awarded the Plain English Campaign "Crystal Mark". Performance in 1996/97 against the revised standards is shown in the attached table 2.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security in how many Child Support Agency cases <i>(a)</i> liability orders have been registered in the county court, <i>(b)</i> inspectors have been appointed and <i>(c)</i> category C IMAs have been made. [5258] <P>

 The Government believes all children are entitled to the support of both parents, irrespective of where they live. We cannot tolerate absent parents not paying the maintenance that they owe. It is therefore right that the Child Support Agency should chase up fathers who avoid paying.
<P>

Legal action against an absent parent is a serious step, and is not taken lightly by the Agency. Nevertheless, if all other voluntary methods have failed, and if a deduction from earnings order is not a possibility, then a liability order is applied for. The Agency's intention in such cases is to secure maintenance--it is hoped that the threat of such action will be enough to ensure compliance.
<BR>
During 1996/7 the Agency initiated liability order action in 2101 cases. The number of cases where a liability order was granted during 1996/7 was 1136.
<BR>
Additionally, since May 1996 the Agency has been able to enter liability orders in the County Court Register of Judgments in England and Wales. In 1996/97, 110 liability orders were entered in the County Court Register. In the first two months of 1997/98, 78 liability orders have been entered in the Register.
<BR>
Under Section 15 of the Child Support Agency 1991, the Secretary of State may appoint a designated officer to act as an inspector, to visit an employer or self-employed absent parent in order to obtain relevant information on a specific case. The Agency does not employ staff specifically to undertake the role of an inspector. Where it is appropriate to utilise inspectorate powers, a suitably qualified and experienced officer is designated. We do not collate information on the number of cases where it has been necessary to invoke the powers of an inspector.
<BR>
Category C interim maintenance assessments are only used where a self-employed person is genuinely attempting to cooperate, but is having difficulty providing all the necessary information. Where a self-employed person is being deliberately uncooperative a punitive Category A interim maintenance assessment is imposed. Very few Category C interim maintenance assessments have been made since their introduction in April 1995; the numbers are as follows:
<BR>
1995/96: 10
<BR>
1996/97: 3
<BR>
1997/98: 1 (to 31.5.97)
<BR>
I hope this is helpful.

 One of our key aims is to restore confidence in the benefits system by tackling fraud and ensuring value for taxpayers' money.
