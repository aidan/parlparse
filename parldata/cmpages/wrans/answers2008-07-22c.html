 In June this year we published the Legacy Action Plan (LAP) which sets out the long term benefits we hope to stimulate through hosting the Olympic games and Paralympic games in 2012, and how we plan to achieve them. This is unprecedented as no other host city has ever been at this stage of planning, nor so committed to a broad and sustainable legacy this early in preparations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_615"><a name="80722w0001.htm_para4"><a name="0807233000043">The LAP sets out the Government's priorities for UK-wide legacy as defined by our five legacy promises, published in Our Promise for 2012 in June 2007. This includes a target to help get two million people more active through sport and physical activity by 2012. Sport England will seek to get one million more active through sport; they will do this through new engagement with national governing bodies and through county sport partnerships.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_616"><a name="80722w0001.htm_para5"><a name="0807233000044">Further to the announcement in June, Government have now set out further details of the £140 million cross-Government free swimming scheme. The scheme is designed to encourage as many local authorities as possible to participate in making swimming free for over 60s and under 16s in their local communities, but also to stimulate ambitious authorities to maximise and sustain uptake through other initiatives such as free lessons for adults who cannot swim, the introduction of swimming coordinators and to provide incentives for the most ambitious to move further towards a universal free swimming offer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_617"><a name="80722w0001.htm_para6"><a name="0807233000045">The LAP also includes initiatives to stimulate economic and social benefit by increasing tourism and improving access to skills and business opportunities. This includes, for example, the London 2012 Business Network giving business across the UK access to the 75,000 contracts in the London 2012 supply chains worth £6 billion.</p>

 The UK Government have been working closely with the major international organisations (World Bank, International Monetary Fund, UN agencies and International Food Policy Research Institute) in order to assess future price trends and cereal production. Increased cereal production and the removal of export bans have brought about a calming of markets, and prices have fallen back from the very high levels seen earlier this year. But the consensus remains that the underlying demand for food remains strong, and this is likely to keep prices high for some years yet, with the trend price for grains stabilising at around 10-25 per cent. higher than 2001 levels.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_641"><a name="80722w0003.htm_para8"><a name="08072322000192">Many countries have experienced serious social and economic consequences of the recent surge in food prices, aggravated by similar movement in fuel prices. The macroeconomic impact on developing countries varies according to the degree of dependency on food and fuel imports. Some countries (e.g. Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and Mozambique) are experiencing significant food price rises; some (e.g. Kenya and Zanzibar) are experiencing clear food shortages; countries in West Africa (e.g. Nigeria and Niger) are heavily affected due to their reliance on imports from international markets; some (Malawi and Zambia) are relatively insulated from global price movements, while others (e.g. Vietnam) are benefiting. The poorest are hardest hit, with some families spending up to 90 per cent. of their income on food. The UK Government are pressing for a global partnership to address both the short term impact of surging food prices, and the longer term challenges of promoting food security for the 850 million people who continue to face hunger.</p>

We believe that a combination of factors has contributed to the significant reduction in the numbers of abandoned vehicles recorded in recent years. Those factors include the introduction of the End-of-Life Vehicles Regulations 2003 and the End-of-Life Vehicles (Producer Responsibility) Regulations 2005, improvements in the accuracy of the vehicle register, various Government and local campaigns to tackle abandonment, and the continuing high value of scrap metal. It is difficult to isolate the individual impact of any one of these factors.</p>

 DEFRA published farm incomes in England by farm type in January 2008. These were based on figures from the Farm Business Survey. Farm Business Income per farm on dairy farms was expected to have increased to £50,700 in the year ended February 2008, from £33,600 in the previous year—an increase of about 50 per cent. This was largely due to a higher farm gate milk price in 2007-08, although higher input costs, particularly feed, dampened down the size of the expected increase. This compares with the average income across all types of farms, including dairy farms, which was expected to have increased by 20 per cent. from £37,600 to £45,000 in 2007-08. DEFRA will publish actual incomes for the year ended February 2008 in October this year, and forecast incomes for the year ending February 2009 in January 2009.</p>

 The Forestry Commission's statutory remit under the Plant Health Act 1967 charges them with the responsibility for the protection of forest trees and timber against attack by pests. This statutory remit does not specifically extend to monitor amenity and urban trees in relation to pests and disease. In practice the Forestry Commission occasionally does this, either by individually financed surveys aimed at detecting specific pest problems, or by monitoring the issues raised in calls for advice through the Tree Health Diagnostic and Information Service operated by Forest Research. I have asked the Forestry Commission to consider whether there is a need to extend their remit to include a more targeted approach to amenity and urban trees.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_798"><a name="80722w0017.htm_para4"><a name="08072356000525">The Ministry of Defence (MOD) has its own well defined criteria for assessing the condition of its properties. For the majority of SFA, this consists of a list of over 100 individual attributes that are assessed to arrive at an overall Standard for Condition (SfC) score for the property. SfC scores are banded into categories, S1fC the highest to S4fC the lowest. SfC assessment includes aspects such as the structure of the property, its energy efficiency, health and safety features, security arrangements and sanitary items as well as an assessment of the kitchen and bedrooms. On that basis, the majority of SFA is already at either S1fC or S2fC. This includes over 12,800 properties that have been upgraded to S1fC since 2001. By the end of this financial year, no Service family will have to live in S4fC accommodation.</p>

Rather than simply conforming to a minimum acceptable level of accommodation, MOD aspires to provide accommodation to a higher standard; and this is reflected in the criteria that must be met to achieve S1fC. (All eight categories must score at Standard 1 for the overall Standard for Condition to be 1).</p>

 The theoretical phenomenon known as "popcorning" is a process whereby a series of accidental detonations of a number of warheads' conventional explosives could lead to some nuclear yield. This is extremely unlikely and could occur only if the warheads were located in close proximity to each other without mitigation. Warheads are designed such that there cannot be a nuclear detonation without authorisation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_815"><a name="80722w0018.htm_para8"><a name="08072356000736">Warhead handling, transit and storage facilities, and processes are designed to reduce the risk of popcorning to ‘As Low As Reasonably Practicable’ levels by, for example, separating stored warheads and having physical shielding between them. Similarly, moves of warheads are planned and executed to minimise the proximity of warheads to each other.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_816"><a name="80722w0018.htm_para9"><a name="08072356000737">Safety in the nuclear weapons programme is of paramount importance. There are well-rehearsed generic response plans in place to protect workers and the general public in the unlikely event of an accident; all measures are taken to ensure acceptable levels of safety throughout the life cycle of the Trident warhead.</p>

<tr valign="top"><td class="tabletext" colspan="4"><i>Notes:</i><br></br>
1. Finished admission episodes (FAE)<br></br>
A FAE is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. Please note that admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br></br>
2. Diagnosis (Primary Diagnosis)<br></br>
The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 14 (seven prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data set and provides the main reason why the patient was in hospital.<br></br>
3. Secondary Diagnoses<br></br>
As well as the primary diagnosis, there are up to 13 (six prior to 2002-03) secondary diagnosis fields in HES that show other diagnoses relevant to the episode of care:<br></br>
F10 Mental and behavioural disorders due to use of alcohol<br></br>
K70 Alcoholic liver disease<br></br>
T51 Toxic effect of alcohol<br></br>
4. Data Quality<br></br>
HES are compiled from data sent by over 300 national health service trusts, and PCTs in England. Data are also received from a number of Independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br></br>
5. Assessing growth through time<br></br>
HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. During the years that these records have been collected the NHS there have been ongoing improvements in quality and coverage. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series.<br></br>
 Some of the increase in figures for later years (particularly 2006-07 onwards) may be due to the improvement in the coverage of independent sector activity.<br></br>
Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example a number of procedures may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and may no longer be accounted in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.<br></br>
 6. Uncrossed Data<br></br>
Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (ie the data are ungrossed).<br></br>

 The key elements of the Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Act 2003 were as follows. The Act made provision for the creation of national health service foundation trusts (FTs), accountable to local communities rather than the Secretary of State; placed a duty on NHS bodies to monitor and improve the quality of healthcare that they provide; gave the Secretary of State power to publish standards in relation to healthcare; created a Commission for Healthcare Audit and Inspection (usually referred to as the Healthcare Commission (HCC)) and a Commission for Social Care Inspection; and made new provisions in relation to primary dental services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_880"><a name="80722w0024.htm_para9"><a name="08072356001663">There are now 103 NHS FTs in place. NHS FTs have demonstrated their ability to establish strong finances and deliver high quality services; the Healthcare Commission’s Annual Healthcheck for 2006-07 showed that FTs are delivering better care and improved finances compared to non-FTs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_881"><a name="80722w0024.htm_para10"><a name="08072356001664">The Commission for Healthcare Audit and Inspection, or HCC, reports directly to Parliament on the state of healthcare in England, and on the quality of NHS and independent healthcare, and its value for money. The assessment of individual providers of NHS healthcare takes into account the standards for healthcare published by Secretary of State. By bringing together the expertise of previous health inspection bodies, the HCC is helping to reduce the fragmentation of inspection, easing the burdens on front-line staff.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_882"><a name="80722w0024.htm_para11"><a name="08072356001665">Similarly, the Commission for Social Care Inspection (CSCI) is an independent body, which provides a comprehensive picture of the quality of social care services and the performance of local authorities in meeting social care needs in their areas. It gives a star rating to councils annually and, from 2008, a quality rating to care services. The CSCI regulates, inspects and reviews all adult social care services in the public, private and voluntary sectors in England. It does so on the basis of regulations and standards issued by the Secretary of State. It makes an annual report to Parliament on the state of social care that gives a comprehensive overview of the social care sector in England.</p>

 The guidelines on the quality of herbal medicinal products prepared by the European Medicines Agency largely reflect good practice identified by the herbal industry. In its regulatory impact assessment of the traditional herbal registration (THR) scheme the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) estimated that typically the costs of registering a product under the scheme could be several tens of thousand pounds but that the figure would vary widely according to specific circumstances, not least depending on whether companies already had systematic quality control systems in place. This assessment has not changed. The MHRA would expect some rationalisation in the manufacturing of herbal medicines reflecting the fact that to carry out this activity to systematic standards within a regulated environment requires specialist expertise. However, there is no basis on which to make specific estimates and feedback to the MHRA from individual companies suggest that many are still developing their plans. So far 14 companies have submitted applications to register one or more product in the United Kingdom under the THR scheme and we therefore anticipate that there will be a competitive market.</p>

 The Regional Development Agencies Act 1998 states explicitly that a regional development agency's purposes apply as much in relation to the rural parts of its area as in relation to the non-rural parts of its area. The Act requires a Regional Development Agency (RDA) to formulate and keep under review a strategy in relation to its purposes and to have regard to the strategy in exercising its functions. This strategy should reflect the distinctiveness of the different parts of the region, including rural areas, identifying challenges and opportunities for these geographic areas.</p>

<i>[holding answer 7 July 2008]: </i>As we set out in the consultation document each eco-town location will need its own approach and the consultation document only provides an indication of some of the benefits that eco-towns will provide. Also, as referred to in the consultation document, the Town and Country Planning Association have produced a best practice worksheet on community development, which is available to all those taking eco-towns forward, and provides advice about working with communities, including faith communities. We will be encouraging schemes to put this guidance into practice as individual projects are taken forward, including for example the funding and endowment of community assets which may be available to faith groups, as part of the development gain.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1047"><a name="80722w0038.htm_para0"><a name="08072397001210">As part of the second stage of consultation we will be consulting on community issues among other criteria in the draft planning policy statement on eco-towns, and we will also be engaging more closely with faith communities to ensure that their views are taken into account in how the programmes goes forward.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1048"><a name="80722w0038.htm_para1"><a name="08072397001211">In planning for eco-towns local authorities will also need to take account of ‘PPS1: Delivering Sustainable Development’ which requires that they take into account the needs of all the community, including particular requirements relating to age, sex, ethnic background, religion, disability or income.</p>

We always intended that it should be used only as a last resort where other measures have proved unsuccessful. Our policy is to encourage voluntary re-occupation of empty homes but this can only work well where there is realistic compulsion to back them up. EDMOs provide this compulsion and should therefore be a key component of a council’s comprehensive empty property strategy.</p>

 Poverty is a complex and multidimensional issue and, as such there are many possible measures of poverty. Nevertheless, it is generally accepted that low income is central to any poverty measurement. Definitions of low income households are set out in the annual National Statistics publication ‘Households Below Average Income’. This reports numbers of individuals in households below or persistently below 50 per cent., 60 per cent. and 70 per cent. of median household income before and after deducting housing costs.</p>

<i>[holding answer 7 July 2008]: </i>The Department runs pilots to test the effectiveness of different approaches to service provision in achieving results and in improving the customer experience. The decision on where these pilots are operated is based on a number of different criteria. These can include the type and location of the service being tested, the customer group involved, and the location of other pilots already under way. The decision on the location of a pilot also takes account of the need to ensure the customer base is sufficiently large to make the results of the pilot meaningful. Any pilot testing a service in Wales includes testing service provision in the Welsh language.

1. Figures are rounded to the nearest 10,000.<br></br>
2. The figures provided in the tables are not seasonally adjusted. This means direct comparisons between different quarters are not possible.<br></br>
3. In order to provide the more detailed breakdown that is required to answer the question, a country is defined as being in the EU only from the date at which it became a member state. This means that workers from some countries (e.g. Estonia) will be counted as non-EU nationals for some years (in the case of Estonia prior to 2004) and EU nationals for other years.<br></br>
4. The totals for foreign nationals in Table (D) may not be equal to the sum of the corresponding numbers shown for EU and non-EU nationals—Tables (D) (a) and (D) (b) respectively—due to rounding.<br></br>
5. As these figures are based on a sample survey they are also subject to sampling variability.<br></br>
6. It should be noted that the nationality question in the LFS is an undercount because:<br></br>
it excludes those who have not been resident in the UK for six months;<br></br>
it excludes students in halls who do not have a UK resident parent;<br></br>
it excludes people in most other types of communal establishments (e.g. hotels, boarding houses, hostels, mobile home sites, etc);<br></br>
it is grossed to population estimates that only include migrants staying for 12 months or more.<br></br>

1. Data for Northern Ireland has only been collected since 2002-03, so the information shown is for the United Kingdom from 2002-03 to 2006-07, and for Great Britain for 1996-97 to 2001-02.<br></br>
2. A pensioner is defined as anyone over state pension age.<br></br>
3. The income measures used to derive the estimates shown employ the same methodology as the Department for Work and Pensions publication “Households Below Average Income” (HBAI) series, which uses disposable household income, adjusted (or “equivalised”) for household size and composition, as an income measure as a proxy for standard of living.<br></br>
4. The figures are based on OECD equalisation factors.<br></br>
5. Numbers of pensioners have been rounded to the nearest 100,000, while proportions of pensioners have been rounded to the nearest percentage point.<br></br>
6. Small year-on-year movements should be treated with caution as these will be affected by sampling error and variability in non-response.<br></br>

1. Net total income is total retirement income after tax from private pension income, basic state pension, second state pension and income related benefits. Replacement rate is total retirement income as a percentage of final salary<br></br>
 2. These examples assume full-time female median earnings of £19,240, part-time median earnings of £9,620, an annual management charge of 0.5 per cent., and that contributions are phased in over a three-year period. The break from labour market activity is assumed to occur at age 30. The whole of the pension pot is annuitised using gender-specific RPI-linked annuities. Replacement rates are rounded to the nearest 1 per cent. and income figures are rounded to the nearest £1. Figures are based on standard assumptions about factors such as investment growth and a lifestyled fund.<br></br>

1. These statistics are based on Households Below Average Income data.<br></br>
2. Data for Northern Ireland has only been collected since 2002-03, so the information shown is for the United Kingdom from 2002-03 to 2006-07, and for Great Britain for 1997-98 to 2001-02.<br></br>
3. Small changes should be treated with caution as these will be affected by sampling error and variability in non-response.<br></br>
4. The reference period for Household Below Average Income figures is single financial years.<br></br>
5. The income measures used to derive the estimates shown employ the same methodology as the Department for Work and Pensions publication 'Households Below Average Income' (HBAI) series, which uses disposable household income, adjusted (or "equivalised") for household size and composition, as an income measure as a proxy for standard of living.<br></br>
6. The figures are based on OECD equivalisation factors.<br></br>
7. Figures have been presented on both a Before Housing Cost and After Housing Cost basis. For Before Housing Cost, housing costs (such as rent, water rates, mortgage interest payments, structural insurance payments and ground rent and service charges) are not deducted from income, while for After Housing Cost they are.<br></br>
8. The Government's preferred measures of low income for pensioners are based on incomes measured after housing costs. Measuring income on an after housing costs basis is appropriate, as two thirds of pensioners own their property outright and so face lower housing costs to meet from their current income while still deriving value from their home. This is different to the current working age population and to the situation for pensioners in the past. Considering pensioners' incomes compared to others after deducting housing costs allows for more meaningful comparisons of income between working age people and pensioners, and between pensioners over time<br></br>
9. As part of PSA Delivery Agreement 17 three indicators of low income poverty will be monitored: the percentage of pensioners below 60 per cent. contemporary median income, 50 per cent median income and 60 per cent. of 1998-99 median income uprated in line with prices.<br></br>
10. Numbers of individuals in each age range have been rounded to the nearest 100,000 individuals, while proportions of individuals in each age range have been rounded to the nearest percentage point.<br></br>

 There are many possible measures of poverty. Nevertheless, it is generally accepted that low income is central to any poverty measurement. Definitions of low income households are set out in the annual National Statistics publication Households Below Average Income. This reports numbers of individuals in households below or persistently below 50 per cent., 60 per cent. and 70 per cent. of median household income before and after deducting housing costs.</p>

If there are mitigating or aggravating circumstances, the guideline suggests a range of a Band C fine (125 to 175 per cent. of weekly income) to 12 weeks custody. Where the weapon was not used to threaten or cause fear but the offence was committed in dangerous circumstances, the suggested starting point is six weeks custody, with a range of a high level community order to referral to the Crown Court. Where the weapon was used to threaten or cause fear and the offence was committed in dangerous circumstances the guideline states that the case should be allocated to the Crown Court.</p>

 There are currently no plans to conduct a review of the cost of telephones calls made from prisons. The National Offender Management Service continues to discuss the cost of calls with the providers but they are not contractually obliged to reduce the cost. To do this without their agreement would require a large subsidy from the taxpayer. The current contract is in place until 2011 and the re-tendering project will commence this year. Reasonable call prices for prisoners will form part of the requirements of the new contract. However, we are implementing reductions for some international calls as part of an extension to a contract with a third party supplier.</p>

 We currently have no plans to extend the provisions of section 11 of the Children Act 2004 to the armed forces. Working Together to Safeguard Children (HM Government 2006) provides statutory guidance on how to help safeguard and promote the welfare of children, including young people under the age of 16 who are in the armed forces as recruits or trainees, or who may be dependents of a service family, whether based in the UK or overseas. The armed forces are fully committed to co-operating with statutory and other agencies in supporting families and have procedures to help safeguard and promote the welfare of children. In addition, the Department for Children, Schools and Families continues to work closely with the Ministry of Defence and offers advice on safeguarding children and young people attached to garrisons abroad.</p>

<i>[holding answer 21 July 2008]:</i> The administration and marking of national curriculum tests is a function of the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA) that is delivered independently of Government. The National Assessment Agency (NAA) oversees the marking process which is delivered by ETS Europe, the new test delivery contractor, on the QCA's behalf.

 The following table shows the percentages of secondary school children, primary school children and all children who have access to the full extended school core offer in each local authority. The core offer comprises a varied menu of activities in primary and secondary schools; high quality childcare 8 am to 6 pm 48 weeks a year in primary schools; parenting support; swift and easy access to a wide range of specialist support services such as health and social care; and wider community access to ICT, sports and arts facilities, including adult learning.</p>

Monthly variations can occur, resulting in figures going down as well, for example as a result of local school reorganisations. By 2010 we expect all schools to be offering access to extended services.</p>

<i> [holding answer 21 July 2008]:</i> We are not aware of any specific research into the effect of stress caused by bullying in schools. However, we are aware that many external studies link being bullied to outcomes such as anxiety, depression, lowered self-esteem and, in extreme cases, suicide. The Anti-Bullying Alliance (ABA) has carried out a number of research projects on behalf of my Department around various aspects of bullying, and the findings have informed our wider work to prevent and tackle this happening in schools. My Department has also recently tendered for research into the effectiveness of our anti-bullying strategies.</p>

This is slightly higher than all STEM graduates (48 per cent.), which suggests that either there is slightly higher demand for computing graduates so that computing graduates are more likely to have the right skills that employers are looking for than other STEM graduates. Five per cent. of e-skills employers have skills-shortage vacancies, the same as the UK average. There are still some 36 per cent. of computing graduates or 73,000 individuals not working in a STEM job, who could be used to overcome any excess demand.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1297"><a name="80722w0074.htm_para8"><a name="080723152000066">I am encouraged by the range of contact currently taking place between the Sector Skills Council (e-skills UK). The Higher Education Funding Council for England and the higher education sector to ensure their IT and computing courses continue to meet the needs of industry. The ITMB degree framework helps prepare undergraduates for the changing rote of the IT professional by providing them with the technology and business skills employers need. E-skills are also supporting activity in schools such as the 14-19 Diploma in Information Technology and Computer Clubs for Girls which improve the information available to pupils and can help drive demand for computer science courses.</p>

There is no similar requirement for advance notification for the current Income Contingent Repayment (ICR) Student Loans which have a low interest rate exemption from arrangements governing consumer credit agreements. ICR statements are issued in September each year for those borrowers whose loans are not yet in repayment. For ICR borrowers who are in repayment, statements are issued after receipt of a file from HMRC.

Borrowers with ICR loans receive notification of the change with their annual statements. While any change in the interest rate applied affects the overall balance of the outstanding loan, it does not alter the income-related repayments of these borrowers.</p>

<i>[holding answer 21 July 2008]:</i> Since it was rolled out nationally from April 2006 the Train to Gain service has engaged almost 93,000 employers and led to over 488,000 employees starting learning funded by LSC. The brokerage service has played an important part in the development of Train to Gain. It has helped engage a high proportion of hard to reach employers, many of which are small businesses. Satisfaction with brokerage is high, at 80 per cent., and recent evaluations show that employers particularly value the local knowledge and impartiality of the brokerage service in helping them source high quality training.</p>

In view of this, we have no plan to revoke or amend any project licences that have been granted authorising marine biotoxins testing.

Owing to the commercial nature of these contracts, if we were to release the information requested on the financial value of each such contract, in each of the next five years this would be likely to prejudice the commercial interests of both the UK Border Agency and those companies with whom the UK Border Agency enters into contracts.

<i>[holding answer 21 July 2008]:</i> The numbers provided in my answer of 8 July 2008, <i>Official Report,</i> column 1443W, related only to visas issued in the entry category “Gap Year Entrant for Work in Schools”. UK Ancestry is a separate entry category for persons aged 17 or over who intend to take or seek employment in the UK. Persons admitted in this category are allowed to stay for an initial period of five years, after which they may apply for Indefinite Leave to Remain. Unlike the Gap Year entry category, the UK Ancestry route is therefore not restricted to young persons who only wish to spend a limited period of time working in the UK.</p>

<i> [holding answer 21 July 2008]:</i> The concession for gap year entrants allows applicants to be aged 17, 18 or 19 when they apply under the concession. A participant in the scheme can enter and remain in the UK for up to 12 months on a gap year entry clearance, and this is not affected by any birthday he may have while in the UK. These conditions will continue to apply to any participants in possession of valid gap year entrant entry clearances when the scheme is abolished later this year prior to the launch of the new Youth Mobility Scheme (YMS) under the points based system (PBS).</p>

<i>[holding answer 29 February 2008]:</i> Over the last 12 months we have drawn up plans for the biggest ever shake-up of Britain's border security. This year we will make the change.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1409"><a name="80722w0089.htm_para1"><a name="08072427002333">We have put in place fingerprint checks before we issue a visa anywhere in the world. We have already delivered 1.4 million sets of finger-scans, generating over 14,000 hits and bringing to notice 1,255 cases of identity swaps.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1410"><a name="80722w0089.htm_para2"><a name="08072427002334">In February, we introduced large on the spot fines for employers who don't make the right checks. In financial year 2006-07, there were 15 successful prosecutions including cautions under section 8, and 21 so far this financial year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1411"><a name="80722w0089.htm_para3"><a name="08072427002335">Last month we introduced the first stage of the points based system as part of a phased approach to manage the flow of migrants coming to the UK. Applicants under the points based system will earn points for their skills and the potential they show for economic success, competence in the English language and ability to support themselves and their dependents. It is a simple, transparent and objective process that enables us to ensure that only those migrants who benefit the UK can come here to work or study. So far over 1,800 applications have been received under tier 1, highly skilled migrant workers. Future tiers will include students, skilled workers, youth mobility and temporary workers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1412"><a name="80722w0089.htm_para4"><a name="08072427002336">On 1 April we launched the UK Border Agency, an organisation of 25,000 staff, with a presence in 135 countries world-wide. The new Agency will protect our border with single immigration and customs checks, tackle smuggling, immigration crime and border tax fraud, and implement fast and fair decisions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1413"><a name="80722w0089.htm_para5"><a name="08072427002337">We have already had successes thanks to exporting the border. Airline liaison officers have assisted in preventing nearly 180,000 people boarding planes over the last five years. That's equivalent to about two jumbo jets a week. In 2007 our strengthening of cross channel border controls stopped 17,658 individual attempts to cross the channel illegally. Additionally at juxtaposed controls in France and Belgium we have refused over 6,000 people entry to the UK. This means the number of illegal immigrants arriving in Kent from juxtaposed locations has reduced by 86 per cent. since 2002.</p>

 It is not possible to identify those offences that are knife-related from the data centrally collected on overall recorded crime. However, since April 2007, police forces have been providing the Home Office with aggregate data on serious violence (attempted murder, GBH and robbery) involving knives and sharp instruments. Data relating to such offences recorded during 2007-08 were published in table 3.09 of the recent “Crime in England and Wales 2007/08” statistical bulletin. A breakdown by region is shown in table A. Information about the number of persons charged and number of offences detected, or ‘cleared-up’, by police cannot be provided as they are not collected on the new statistical return.</p>

Table B shows the number of such offences recorded within each region in England and Wales in the years 2004-05, 2005-06 and 2006-07, the number of these homicides with a current suspect and the number that have resulted in a homicide conviction. Figures for 2007-08 are scheduled to be published in January 2009.</p>

<i>[holding answer 21 July 2008]:</i><i></i>We have been working closely with the Joint Education Taskforce and Ofsted and from early 2009 accreditation by an independent accreditation body approved by the UK Border Agency will be required by all private education providers that recruit international students.</p>

 The total operating costs for the interview office network of 68 offices during June 2008 was £2.4 million which excludes the cost of depreciation of relevant set-up capital expenditure. There are a number of central costs within the £2.4 million such as call centre appointments and IT maintenance which make it impossible to give meaningful comprehensive monthly costs for each individual office. A total of 32,792 interviews were carried out in the network during June resulting in an average cost per interview of £73.19, just below the planned figure.</p>

 Procedures and supporting systems for reporting lost, stolen and recovered British passports were introduced in December 2003. Since then the Identity and Passport Service has provided a range of management information on the number of passports that have been processed under these arrangements. In 2007 there were 251,751 reports of lost passports and 41,393 reports of stolen passports. In addition 10,428 passports were reported under the “other” category which includes those damaged or destroyed. The systems, however, do not capture specifically the age of the holder whose passport is reported lost or stolen.</p>

<i> [holding answer 10 July 2008]:</i> Since April there has been a neighbourhood policing team in every area—meeting the Government's commitment. Neighbourhood policing gives local communities a role in deciding policing priorities by working with them to identify and tackle local problems together, as well as providing a highly visible presence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1430"><a name="80722w0095.htm_para0"><a name="08072427004835">Both Sir Ronnie Flanagan's review of policing and the Casey review ‘Engaging Communities in Fighting Crime’ contain recommendations about how best to embed neighbourhood policing and ensure communities have a say in how they are policed. In the forthcoming Policing Green Paper the new Police Pledge will take forward many of the recommendations and will set out new national standards for the police service to ensure the public receive visible, accountable and responsive policing.</p>

 The Home Office police funding formula is designed to assess the relative need for resources between police authorities in England and Wales.

The number of unanswered calls fluctuates according to the peaks in HMRC's business.
