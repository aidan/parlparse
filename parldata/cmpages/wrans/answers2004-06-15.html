The remainder will be spent during 2004&#150;05 and 2005&#150;06 on the delivery of generalist and specialist support to the Sector frontline bodies in rural areas. The first strand will go towards priorities identified by these county consortia, the second will be to increase the uptake of financial entitlements among pensioners in some rural areas and the third will be go towards researching the potential for sustainable income generation through trading by rural voluntary and community organisations.

An application was received by the Department to kill a small number of robins that were persistently fouling a cafeteria located within a garden centre. The application was considered by one of the Department&#039;s wildlife management advisers and based on the adviser&#039;s recommendation the licensing unit granted a licence to allow up to four robins to be killed to preserve public health and safety. An investigation of this case, showing that the shooting of the birds by a pest control company was legal and proper procedures were followed, was published on the DEFRA website (www.defra.gov.uk) on 11 June.

<p><a name="40615w04.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Caborn: </b> 
 Alcohol licences are granted by licensing justices and, where available, statistics are broken down by petty sessions areas and not by local authority areas. Generally, no justices&#039; licences permit the sale or consumption of alcohol all night. This is the effect of section 60 of the Licensing Act 1964 which details the permitted hours for the sale and supply of alcohol from licensed premises. There are however four exceptions. Firstly, all on-licensed premises are able to sell alcohol all night on each New Year&#039;s Eve unless the premises are subject to a restriction order. Secondly, the 1964 Act does not prohibit or restrict the sale or supply of alcohol to, or its consumption by, any person in any licensed premises where he is residing, or the supply for consumption by any private friends of such a person who are being entertained by that person at his own expense. Thirdly, the 1964 Act does not prohibit or restrict the supply of alcohol for consumption on the premises to persons employed there for the purposes of the business carried on by the holder of a justices&#039; licence if the alcohol is supplied at the expense of their employer or the person carrying on or in charge of the business on the premises. Fourthly, under section 74 of the 1964 Act, justices of the peace on application from premises situated in the immediate neighbourhood of a public market or place where people follow a lawful trade or calling, may grant an order adding, either generally or for such days as may be specified in the order such hours as may be so specified, to the permitted hours in those premises. These are commonly called &quot;general orders of exemption&quot;. There are no centrally held statistics on the numbers or dispersal of general orders of exemption. However, the number permitting the sale or supply of

An initial decision on the most appropriate care pathway is made at the time of referral, and is reviewed once the diagnosis is confirmed. Occasionally, use is made of private healthcare providers to enable Service personnel to be returned to operational fitness quickly if it is anticipated that treatment within the NHS would fail to meet an urgent operational requirement.

<p><a name="40615w07.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 In the main, the armoured vehicles used by the British forces rely on the protection afforded to the fuel tanks by the vehicle&#039;s armour and the positioning of tanks themselves within the vehicle.

<p><a name="40615w07.html_spnew9"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 The Government&#039;s Defence Industrial Policy, published in October 2002, seeks to provide the armed forces with the equipment which they require at best value for money for the taxpayer while sustaining a healthy and globally competitive defence industry. The factors that we take into account when making acquisition decisions are set out in Tables 1 and 2 of the Policy and, taken together, enable the best value for money solution to be identified. These factors include consideration of the impact on long-term value for money and on industrial capabilities which it is desirable to retain in the United Kingdom industrial base not only for defence reasons but also owing to the high value which they bring to the industrial economy. Copies of the Policy, together with detailed implementation guidance are freely available, and are included on the Ministry of Defence&#039;s website (www.mod.uk).

<p><a name="40615w08.html_wqn3"><b> Mr. Tynan: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what estimate she has made of changes in carbon emissions which would result if all gas fired power stations which have been approved, but are yet to enter service, replaced existing carbon emitting generators.  [178323]</p>








<p><a name="40615w08.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Timms: </b> 
 The answer depends on the assumptions made about the type of existing carbon emitting generation which the new gas-fired capacity would replace and the load factor for the new gas-fired plant. There is currently around 4,800MW of gas-fired capacity, comprising six large stations, approved but yet to enter service.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40615w08.html_para5">
If coal-fired plants are replaced then the carbon saving would amount to around 4 million tonnes per annum as coal emits more than twice the amount of carbon as gas per TWh of generation. If older gas-fired generation plants were replaced then the change in emissions would be around 0.3 million tonnes per annum, the change reflecting only the higher efficiency of new gas-fired generation compared with older gas generation technologies. A load factor of 70 per cent. is assumed for gas-fired generation.


</p>







<p><a name="40615w08.html_wqn4"><b> Mr. Tynan: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what estimate she has made of how much carbon would be emitted if all gas fired power stations which have been approved, but are yet to enter service, entered service.  [178324]</p>








<p><a name="40615w08.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Timms: </b> 
 There is currently around 4,800MW of gas-fired capacity comprising six large stations, approved but yet to enter service. The level of associated carbon emissions will depend on the operational load factor associated with this capacity. On the assumption of a 70 per cent. load factor, emissions from these stations would amount to around 3 million tonnes of carbon per annum. The net impact on UK emissions will depend on what type of capacity (conventional fossil fuel or nuclear generation) this new capacity is replacing.


</p>







<p><a name="40615w08.html_wqn5"><b> Mr. Tynan: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what estimate she has made of the likely changes in carbon emissions if all renewable electricity generators which have been approved, but are yet to enter service, replaced carbon emitting generators. [178325R]</p>








<p><a name="40615w08.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Timms: </b> 
 There is currently around 1700MW of renewable capacity approved but yet to enter service. This comprises 500MW of onshore wind and 1200MW of offshore wind as well as 20MW of hydro power. The change in carbon emissions associated with this level of new renewables capacity will depend on the assumption made about the type of carbon emitting generation which it replaces and the operational load factors associated with the renewables capacity.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40615w08.html_para6">
If new renewables capacity replaces gas-fired generation, which would otherwise have been built, then the reduction in emissions would amount to around 0.5 million tonnes of carbon per annum. If the new capacity is assumed to have replaced coal-fired generation then the change in emissions would amount to around 1.2 million tonnes of carbon per annum. 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>15 Jun 2004 : Column 815W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>

 The flexible working law was designed by the Work and Parents Taskforce to be light-touch and is based on employer best practice. In translating the Taskforce proposals into legislation, the Government accepted their recommendation on handling unresolved requests.

<p><a name="40615w10.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Timms: </b> 
 In accordance with international practice, the inventory difference that occurs when the result of a physical inventory of nuclear material is compared with the book inventory is referred to as MUF (&#039;material unaccounted for&#039;. The difference may be negative (an apparent loss) or positive (an apparent gain). MUF is a recognised feature of accounting for nuclear material and is caused primarily by the uncertainties inherent in the techniques used to measure nuclear material.

MUF figures at UKAEA, BNFL and Urenco sites are published annually by the industry. Figures published since 1973&#150;74 will be placed in the Libraries of the House. There is no evidence to suggest that there have been any real losses or gains of nuclear material.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry how the employment rights and benefits of constables in the Atomic Energy Authority Constabulary will change under the provisions of the Energy Bill.  [178317]</p>







<br>&nbsp;<br><i>15 Jun 2004 : Column 821W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>





<p><a name="40615w10.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Timms: </b> 
 The Energy Bill requires that the Secretary of State make a nuclear transfer scheme providing for the transfer to the Civil Nuclear Police Authority those employees of the UKAEA who are members of the UKAEA Constabulary. The Bill also provides for members of the UKAEA Constabulary to hold office as members of the new Civil Nuclear Constabulary.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40615w10.html_para2">
There will be no practical effect on the employment rights and benefits of members of the UKAEA Constabulary as a result of this transfer. The Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 1981 (TUPE) will apply, and current and future members of the Constabulary will continue to be eligible for membership of the UKAEA pension scheme.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40615w10.html_para3">
The Bill prohibits members of the Constabulary from joining trade unions (subject to the same limited exceptions that apply to other police officers). This puts current informal arrangements on a statutory footing. It also brings the Constabulary into line with long established arrangements for other police forces. The restriction on trade union membership will not extend to civilian employees of the Police Authority.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40615w10.html_para4">
The Bill also provides for statutory recognition of a Civil Nuclear Police Federation, and requires the Civil Nuclear Police Authority to align any provisions it makes about conditions of service of members of the new Constabulary with the provision made on such matters by police regulations (unless differences are justified due to the circumstances and structure of the Constabulary). Again this provides a statutory basis for current informal arrangements.

In addition further benefits and savings will accrue over the life of the contract, for example through the transfer of risk and payment by the departments of a reduced facilities price as an offset against the deferred capital payment at the outset of the contract. Because all of these savings and benefits are taken over the 20 year life of the contract it is not possible to quantify annual savings.

 The value of with-profits funds depends on the interaction between annual bonuses over the lifetime of the policy and the level of terminal bonus. Surrender values sometimes incorporate market value reductions where the nominal value of a policyholders funds is in excess of the value of the underlying assets and the terms of the insurance contract allow one to be imposed. It is important that the amounts paid to departing policyholders are fair both to those who leave the fund and to those who wish to remain invested for the longer term.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what assessment he has made of the 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>15 Jun 2004 : Column 840W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
tonnage of materials containing white asbestos in use by the farming industry; and what the total costs of disposal would be at current prices.  [176644]</p>








<p><a name="40615w14.html_spnew5"><b> Jane Kennedy: </b> 
 Asbestos is present on a large proportion of farms in the form of asbestos cement sheeting. Much, though not all, of this material contains white asbestos. There is no requirement under the new duty to manage asbestos in non-domestic premises regulation to remove or dispose of asbestos-containing material if it is in good condition. HSE advice is that in this case it is safer to leave it in place and manage it.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40615w14.html_para4">
The Regulatory Impact Assessment for the new regulation estimated the total cost of compliance for agricultural buildings at a present value of &#163;180 million over the 50 years, 2000&#150;50. There are approximately 163,540 agricultural premises in Great Britain. The cost of disposal was not estimated separately.

<p><a name="40615w14.html_spnew6"><b> Jane Kennedy: </b> 
 The Control of Asbestos at Work Regulations 2002 came into force in November 2002 with the exception of Regulation 4: the Duty to Manage Asbestos in Non-Domestic Premises, which came into force on 21 May this year.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40615w14.html_para5">
Now that the new duty is in force, HSE expects duty-holders to have adopted a precautionary approach to prevent accidental exposure and to deal with emergency situations. They also expect to see a compliance strategy in place, which should set out how and when the specific steps required in the legislation will be complied with.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40615w14.html_para6">
Assuming these steps have been taken, HSE inspectors do not necessarily require farmers or any group to be fully compliant with the duty to manage asbestos in these early stages.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40615w14.html_para7">
However, HSE inspectors will take enforcement action where disregard for the Regulation means that people are being put at serious risk of asbestos exposure.

<sup>(13)</sup> It is a basic principle of the social security system that only one benefit at a time can be paid for the same purpose. For example, even though the circumstances that give rise to entitlement to carer&#039;s allowance (CA) and state pension (SP) are different, they are both designed to provide a degree of replacement for lost or foregone income. CA replaces income where the carer is over working age or has had to give up the chance of working to look after a severely disabled person, while SP replaces income in retirement. CA is therefore not payable, or not payable in full, in addition to SP The payment of SP takes precedence, either extinguishing or reducing the payment of CA.<br>

<p><a name="40615w15.html_spnew1"><b> Maria Eagle: </b> 
 As part of the Government&#039;s National Strategy for Carers, substantial improvements have been made to the financial support available to the carers of severely disabled people from social security benefits. These include extending the availability of carer&#039;s allowance to new carers aged 65 and over and for up to eight weeks after the death of the person being cared for, increasing the earnings limit for the benefit and linking it to the national insurance lower earnings limit so that it goes up each year. This means that carers can now earn up to &#163;79 per week net of allowable expenses and still be entitled to the benefit. It is therefore possible for a carer to earn well in excess of &#163;79 per week and be entitled to carer&#039;s allowance.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40615w15.html_para2">
For those entitled to carer&#039;s allowance and on low incomes, the carer premium in the income-related benefits and the equivalent amount payable through pension credit has been substantially increased. Carers may also be entitled to other benefits depending on their circumstances. Carers who wish to keep in touch with the labour market can get help, advice and training from personal advisers in Jobcentre Plus.

 1,061 home purchases with Homebuy loans were completed in London during 2003&#150;04. From a Housing Corporation survey, CORE Sales, at least 211 of these Homebuy loans were given to tenants in social housing and at least 59 to people on housing waiting lists. The Housing Corporation&#039;s investment system shows that over 400 of the loans were made to key workers in London.

<p><a name="40615w17.html_spnew4"><b> Phil Hope: </b> 
 Under the local e-Government programme the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is supporting a national project called LAWS&#151;Local Authority Websites, to develop guidance for local authorities on best practice for designing and managing websites. One of the issues addressed is website accessibility, including for disabled people. Ensuring that their websites are accessible to all their citizens is fundamental to the design of individual authorities&#039; websites. Another national project, e-SB&#151;the Standards Body, will incorporate website accessibility information into the forthcoming website standards for local authorities.

<p><a name="40615w17.html_spnew9"><b> Keith Hill: </b> 
 No. The Office&#039;s Public Service Agreement 5 underpins the Government&#039;s commitment to improve the balance between supply and demand for housing. In this context, the main function of a performance indicator for overcrowding would be to monitor progress in alleviating the position of those at the bottom of the housing ladder. However, PSA5 already incorporates such an indicator&#151; number of statutory homeless households with children in temporary accommodation. The further indicator proposed here would simply cover the same ground, albeit from a slightly different perspective.

<p><a name="40615w19.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Browne: </b> 
 The Government are committed to identifying and removing those who have no right to be here by ensuring a transparent and fair system where all applicants are treated humanely and fairly and only seeking to return those who have no legal basis of stay in the UK. This is done by having an internal complaints procedure and an independent appeal system established by Parliament to resolve disputes between the Home Office and applicants who feel that their applications for leave to remain or asylum have not been properly assessed or the correct decision reached.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what steps he is taking to reduce the non-attendance of witnesses and defendants in Merseyside.  [170534]</p>








<p><a name="40615w19.html_spnew5"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 The Government&#039;s Criminal Case Management Programme will reduce the non-attendance of defendants and witnesses. It is made up of three complementary strands: ensuring that charges are 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>15 Jun 2004 : Column 858W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
more appropriately brought; providing victims and witnesses with proper care and attention; and ensuring that trials are effectively managed.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40615w19.html_para3">
Witness care units are currently at the planning stage in Merseyside and will be introduced for Crown courts towards the end of this year and in the magistrates courts in 2005. As part of its delivery plan to improve public confidence in the criminal justice system, Merseyside Criminal Justice Board carried out a survey examining reasons for witness non-attendance. The results will be used as part of the planning process for the introduction of witness care units. For example, one petty sessional area found that if witnesses were contacted by telephone shortly before they were due to appear, attendance increased, and consequently, this practice is being rolled out across Merseyside.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40615w19.html_para4">
The Effective Trial Management Programme will be implemented in Merseyside in November. It includes specific measures to improve defendant attendance at court hearings through the early communication of the benefits of co-operating with the process and the potential consequences of non-attendance, as well as improved enforcement procedures for non-attendance.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40615w19.html_para5">
There are a number of warrant enforcement initiatives in place in Merseyside to ensure that defendants are brought to justice for failing to appear in court. Bench warrants in Merseyside are circulated on the Police National Computer as soon as they are received from the courts, with priority given to persistent offender and street crime offences. Merseyside police have also run Operation &#039;Cardsharp&#039; in which defendants were sent letters following their failure to appear, informing them that a warrant had been issued and advising them to surrender to the court or face police visits. This initiative proved to be a success, with defendants surrendering themselves to the court after receiving the letter, and over 1,000 warrants executed in the month the operation was running. It is continuing to operate successfully in Merseyside, and has now been recognised as best practice nationally.

Within Defra&#039;s area of responsibility local authorities in England are able to issue fixed penalty notices for offences related to litter, dog fouling and, since 31 March, graffiti and fly-posting. They can also issue fixed penalty notices for night time noise offences but, until 31 March, only if they elected to do so. Only information for each is available in the form requested and the following information shows the litter fixed penalty notices issued in each local authority in the last five years. Local authorities that are not named did not issue any fixed penalty notices for litter during these periods.

 The numbers of life sentence prisoners recalled to custody from 1 April 2000 onwards are shown in the table. However, the reasons for these licence revocations are only recorded from October 2002.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40615w21.html_para1">
Life licences can be revoked for a specific reason or a combination of reasons. In broad terms, a licensee&#039;s recall to custody is likely to occur in two main areas. Firstly, where specific behaviour, criminal or otherwise, is giving rise to concerns over the potential risk of harm to the public. Secondly, where probation staff are unable safely to manage the level of risk as a result of the licensee&#039;s non-compliance with licence conditions. Other issues will frequently combine with these main factors, most notably concerns relating to alcohol and drug misuse.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40615w21.html_para2">
Of the 70 lifers recalled from 1 October 2002 to 31 March 2004, the reasons for recall were listed as:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">actual or potential risk of harm to others (17 cases);</p>

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">breach of licence conditions (20 cases);</p>

Under grant protection arrangements in England, police authorities have been guaranteed a minimum increase a &#039;floor&#039; in general grant funding each year since 2002&#150;03. Grant &#039;floors&#039; are not applied by the Welsh Assembly, but to ensure North Wales received a grant increase equivalent to the English minimum of 2.3 per cent. in 2002&#150;03, the Home Secretary made a special payment to North Wales Police Authority of &#163;362,000. North Wales was also supported by this arrangement in 2004&#150;05 (&#163;1.5 million). Its increase in general grants in 2003&#150;04 was 4.5 per cent. well above the funding floor of 3.0 per cent.<br>

<i>[holding answer 9 June 2004]:</i> The Prison Service is undertaking a number of initiatives to address racism. In December 2003 a full scale and comprehensive joint action plan to combat all aspects of racism was agreed between the Prison Service and the Commission for Racial Equality (CRE). The plan, entitled &quot;Implementing Race Equality in Prisons&#151;A Shared Agenda for Change&quot;, was produced in partnership with the CRE. It brings together work currently being undertaken to ensure compliance with the Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000 through the Prison Service Race Equality Scheme and incorporates lessons learned from the CRE Formal Investigation into race relations.

<a name="40615w23.html_para13">
The number of self-inflicted deaths among women prisoners is recognised as a very serious concern by the Prison Service and Ministers. Women prisoners are to benefit from a specifically targeted and separate suicide prevention and self-harm management strategy being developed for them. This builds upon a number of interventions including: individual crisis counselling for women prisoners who self-harm; the continued development and evaluation of dialectical behaviour therapy, which is currently being trialled at Durham, Bullwood Hall and Holloway prisons; investment and planning to ensure progress on the detoxification strategy in women&#039;s prisons; and the introduction of a new training pack for all staff working with women in custody, which includes a module on the health and well-being of women prisoners. &#163;1 million from the Department of Health has been allocated to women&#039;s prisons to be spent on the recruitment of psychiatric nurses.

 There is no specific research on the effects of transferring women between prisons nor on the mental health effects of being located far from home.

The Prison Service has recently started research with Oxford University Public Health Department on the effects of imprisonment on women&#039;s health. The effects of women&#039;s locations in relation to their families and the effects of transfers between prisons are expected to be examined as part of that work. It is hoped that the preliminary results will be available by the end of 2005.

 The maximum class size of 20 for pupils in practical music classes was initially included in the Department&#039;s 2001 Circular on Class Sizes in Practical Subjects. More recently the Department reassessed the position by consulting with various educational specialists/organisations including the Department&#039;s Education and Training Inspectorate, representatives of heads of post-primary schools, school authorities and teacher unions.

</p>


<p>
<a name="40615w25.html_para0">
The professional view emerging from this consultation again confirmed that in general, health and safety hazards are such that adequate and safe supervision of pupils is not possible if more than 20 pupils are present in a class and involved in practical activities. This limit only applies to music classes involving the practical use of musical instruments. Also, the limit does not apply to choirs or orchestras, which are not classified as classes for the purposes of the Department&#039;s circular.

As Dr. Campbell made clear in her recent interview with the <i>Belfast Telegraph</i>, while she favours a ban, this would not, of itself, address the appalling toll of premature death and avoidable illness caused by smoking.

<p><a name="40615w26.html_spnew4"><b> Angela Smith: </b> 
 The Driver and Vehicle Testing Agency (DVTA), which is responsible for vehicle testing, has taken a range of measures to alleviate the impact of industrial action. These include contacting customers directly affected and, where possible, offering alternative appointments; maximising the use of the capacity available at other test centres; redeploying staff from non-urgent duties; and cancelling non-essential training.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40615w26.html_para3">
DVTA has also introduced temporary exemption certificates for goods vehicles, to mitigate the difficulties for the commercial sector. A temporary exemption certificate allows a vehicle to be used on the road without a goods vehicle test certificate for up to three 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>15 Jun 2004 : Column 890W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
months from the date of issue. It does not alter the responsibility of the owner or operator to maintain the vehicle in a roadworthy condition. The use of temporary exemption certificates has freed up capacity for the testing of vehicles in priority categories such as ambulances and public service vehicles.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40615w26.html_para4">
DVTA has also been keeping in contact with the Police Service for Northern Ireland (PSNI) and the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Northern Ireland (DVLNI) regarding the implications for motorists. The law is very clear: technically it is an offence to drive a vehicle without a valid MOT certificate, and it is an offence to use or keep an unlicensed vehicle on a public road. However, PSNI and DVLNI are aware of the difficulties and have advised that for the moment each case will be considered on its merits. They have also indicated that all relevant circumstances will be taken into account before anyone is prosecuted. The agency has also been in touch with the Association of British Insurers, who have indicated that in most cases motorists affected by industrial action will continue to be covered by their insurance policies. However, they have also advised those affected to check the detail of their policies and also to make direct contact with their insurers.

If a dentist working in the GDS wishes to terminate a patient&#039;s NHS registration, he/she must give three months notice of his/her intention to the patient.

<p><a name="40615w28.html_spnew2"><b> Miss Melanie Johnson: </b> 
 National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines, such as those for fertility services, are based on assessments of clinical and cost-effectiveness rather than national health service capacity. We recognise, as does NICE, that the NHS cannot reasonably be expected to implement the fertility guideline overnight, but primary care trusts (PCTs) will need to consider the detail of the guideline and review their services. We have advised all PCTs to offer, by April 2005, a minimum of one cycle in vitro fertilisation (IVF) to those who meet the clinical criteria, and to give priority to couples with no children living with them. We expect the NHS, overall funding for which is increasing from &#163;56 billion to over &#163;90 billion between 2003&#150;04 and 2007&#150;08, to make progress to full implementation in the longer term, including progress towards the maximum of three cycles of IVF which the guideline recommends.

 I have discussed with the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) its overall funding position for 2004&#150;05. Adult learning funding through further education and our support for adult education services will continue to provide a wide range of learning from approved vocational qualifications to community based informal learning. As part of the normal annual planning cycle local LSCs discuss with learning providers the mix of provision that is required to meet the needs of local communities, learners and employers. Where there is a need for more vocational provision to meet the needs of learners and employers I would expect local LSCs and learning providers to re-direct resources to meet those priorities.

Sector Skills Councils (SSCs) have the remit for assessing skills needs in their sector. The Creative and Cultural Industries SSC (CCISSC), which is in development, will cover circus performers.

Regionally, the NW Development Agency, working in partnership with stakeholders in the region, has the lead responsibility for developing and taking forward the economic strategy for the North West.

Notes:<br>

1. The financial data are taken from local education authorities&#039; Section 52 Outturn Statements submitted to the DfES from 1999&#150;2000 onwards and the ODPM&#039;s RO1 statement previously. 1999&#150;2000 figures reflect the return of GM schools to local authority maintenance. Financial data is in &#163;000&#039;s. Figures are adjusted to 2002&#150;03 prices using the March 2004 GDP deflators.<br>





2. In 1987&#150;88 and 1988&#150;89 pre-primary expenditure was not collected on R01. From 1989&#150;90 onwards expenditure was not distinguished between pre-primary and primary sectors until the inception of the Section 52 outturn statements in 1999&#150;2000. Pre-primary expenditure does not match the number of pre-primary schools because it also includes expenditure on nurseries in the private sector, which are not included in the school count.<br>

3. Net Current Expenditure (NCE) includes expenditure within schools and also that incurred centrally by the LEA. Between 1987&#150;88 and 1992&#150;93 NCE after recharges was not recorded on RO1. In these years Net Recurrent Expenditure is used and consequently figures in those years may not be strictly comparable with future years.<br>

4. Spending in 1997&#150;98 reflects the transfer of monies from local government to central Government for the nursery vouchers scheme. These were returned to local government in 1998&#150;99.<br>

5. The number of schools is taken from the Annual Schools Census. Middle schools are included as deemed secondary.<br>

2. The outturn 2002&#150;03 tables captured the data in a fundamentally different way to the previous years. Categories were aligned with the Consistent Financial Reporting framework and the spending by LEAs was no longer split by school sector. Consequently the unit costs per pupil in 2002&#150;03 are not strictly comparable with earlier years as they are calculated differently and include an apportionment of LEA expenditure based on pupil numbers.<br>

3. Net current expenditure (NCE) includes expenditure within schools and also that incurred centrally by the LEA.<br>

4. The NCE per pupil figures for primary relate the net current expenditure (after recharges) in the maintained primary schools to the total number of financial year pupils who are educated in the maintained primary schools sector.<br>

5. The NCE per pupil figures for secondary relate the net current expenditure (after recharges) in maintained secondary schools to the total number of financial year pupils who are educated in the maintained secondary schools sector.<br>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what assessment he has made of the relationship between levels of authorised and unauthorised absence from school. [174719]</p>








<p><a name="40615w35.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Ivan Lewis  </b> 
<i>[holding answer 20 May 2004]:</i> In general, there is a statistically positive relationship between authorised and unauthorised absence levels in schools. There is a tendency for schools with low levels of authorised absence to also have low levels of unauthorised absence and vice versa. The relationship is stronger for secondary schools than for primary schools and, in both sectors, there are numerous exceptions to the general rule.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40615w35.html_para0">
The latest detailed published analysis of the relationship can be found in the Department&#039;s Statistical Bulletin 13/01 &quot;Pupil absence and truancy from schools in England, 2000/2001&quot;. Paragraphs 14 to 16 and Tables 4 and 5 of this Bulletin are particularly relevant. A copy has been placed in the Library. It is also available at www.dfes.gov.uk/rsgateway/DB/SBU/b000309/index.shtml Furthermore, when concerted action is taken to tackle absences, it is usual to see an increase in unauthorised absences. This is due to schools taking a stricter stance on authorising absences leading to more absences being classed as &quot;unauthorised&quot;. In turn, schools will see an increase in attendance levels: (i) as pupils and parents come to understand that certain types of absence will no longer be tolerated; and (ii) as this clearer identification of truants leads to speedier 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>15 Jun 2004 : Column 924W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
interventions and return to the classroom. More schools are adopting this approach: 2002&#150;03 saw the highest level of school attendance on record&#151;93.17 per cent.&#151;with schools identifying more truants than previously, but with the average number of sessions missed by each secondary school truant falling to 15&#151;a decrease of 25 per cent. since 1997.
</p>


<p>

2002 figures are based on data checked by schools as part of the Performance Tables checking exercise.<br>

Prior to this schools did not have the opportunity to check and correct their underlying data and therefore figures prior to 2002 should not be released.<br>

The basis for post 16 performances for 2003 has changed and cannot therefore be compared to previous years.<br>

However, Wanstead High School average point score at 215.9 average point score per pupil for GCE and VCE results is below both Redbridge LEA (249.0) and England averages (258.6).<br>

<p><a name="40615w36.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </b> 
 There has been significant progress in establishing the Skills for Business network of Sector Skills Councils with 18 councils now licensed or recommended for licence. The Sector Skills Development Agency has been working with the developing Skills for Business network to agree a performance monitoring and evaluation framework to evaluate its performance over time against its policy objectives. That framework is now in place.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40615w36.html_para0">
The first phase of the evaluation is now complete. It has shown that Sector Skills Councils are making good progress in analysing the skills gap in each of their sectors. The evaluation has provided baseline performance information so that the effectiveness of SSCs and the broader network can be tracked over time. The evaluation has further provided early information on emerging good practice and continuous improvement which will help to assess future impact.

<p>
<a name="40615w36.html_para2">
We continue to engage employers, public sector organisations and others in initiatives within the Skills for Life strategy. The Skilled for Health joint project with the Department of Health continues to help adults gain a better understanding of their own health as well as improving their basic skills. The Link Up project, co-funded with the Home Office, recruited 6,410 volunteers as Adult Learner Supporters. The Learning and Skills Council Skills for Life Quality Initiative has provided Leadership and Management Training to 1,310 staff, provided 1,200 people with funding for new teaching qualifications and trained 1,266 teachers in the basic skills Core Curriculum.
