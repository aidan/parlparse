 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport if he will make a statement on the development of community railways in Lancashire.  [220406]</p>




<p><a name="50308w01.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 The Strategic Rail Authority published a Community Rail Development Strategy in November last year. The Strategy aims to involve local communities in the development of their lines, to increase patronage and to reduce the costs of the lines so that they will be sustainable for the longer term. Under the Strategy, seven lines in Lancashire have been selected for Community Rail designation.

<p><a name="50308w01.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 Regulations require the operator of a local bus service to provide the traffic commissioner and the local authority with at least 56 days notice of any change. We encourage all parties to work together to ensure the interests of passengers and the community are taken into account.
</p>





<p><a name="50308w01.html_wqn3"><b> Paddy Tipping: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what financial support he has made available for improved bus services in <i>(a)</i> Nottinghamshire and <i>(b)</i> England in the last four years.  [220407]</p>




<p><a name="50308w01.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 In the period 2000&#150;01 to 2003&#150;04, the Department made available to English local authorities a total of &#163;305 million in bus grants of which &#163;5.43 million was allocated to Nottinghamshire.
</p>

<br>&nbsp;<br><i>8 Mar 2005 : Column 1628W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>



<p><a name="50308w01.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Jamieson: </b> 
 I have had several discussions recently with many of our social partners on this important topic. I am aware of the lobby of Parliament today that has been organised by the RMT union, and I have had the opportunity to meet their representatives in four different forums in the last three months to discuss tonnage tax. This includes my meeting on 22 February with the RMT parliamentary group which my hon. Friend attended.
</p>

<p><a name="50308w01.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Jamieson: </b> 
 Current guidance remains good advice, and local authorities can design schemes that fit local circumstances. The Department aims later this year to publish a local transport note on the design and effectiveness of traffic calming measures including road humps, drawing together existing research and guidance.
</p>




<a name="50308w01.html_sbhd5"><h3 align=center>Regional Air Services</h3>


<p><a name="50308w01.html_wqn6"><b> Mr. Carmichael: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport if he will make a statement on public service obligations for regional air services.  [220419]</p>




<p><a name="50308w01.html_spnew6"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 The Air Transport White Paper set out the Government&#039;s readiness to impose Public Service Obligations (PSOs) in certain limited circumstances in order to guarantee a minimum level of air services from UK regional airports to London.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50308w01.html_para1">
Last year DfT consulted with stakeholders to clarify the circumstances in which this policy might be implemented. The consultation closed last November and officials are now analysing all views expressed both in the responses and meetings.

<p><a name="50308w01.html_wqn8"><b> Mr. Greg Knight: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport for what reason and upon whose authority the entrance doors to Berwick upon Tweed railway station were closed to the public on Sunday 27 February at a time when the station was supposed to be open to the public and trains were stopping there.  [219901]</p>




<p><a name="50308w01.html_spnew8"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 The station was locked due to an error on the part of GNER staff, and resulted in a 30 minute delay for passengers wanting to travel on the 0940 departure. GNER arranged for an additional stop to be made by the next train passing through the station. 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>8 Mar 2005 : Column 1629W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
I understand that this was an isolated incident, and that GNER have publicly apologised for the inconvenience caused to passengers.

<p><a name="50308w02.html_wqn0"><b> Mr. Boris Johnson: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport (1) what representations he has received from the Thames Valley Chamber of Commerce concerning First Great Western Link&#039;s new timetable for the Thames Valley area;  [220365]
</p>



<p>(2) what assessment he has made of the impact First Great Western Link&#039;s new timetable for the Thames Valley area has had on local businesses;  [220366]
</p>



<p>(3) what plans he has to <i>(a)</i> reduce overcrowding and <i>(b)</i> improve punctuality on the Henley-Twyford-Paddington line.  [220367]</p>




<p><a name="50308w02.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 No representations have been received from the Thames Valley Chamber of Commerce. Timetable changes on services to and from London Paddington were consulted on by the Strategic Rail Authority in early 2004. The majority of stakeholders recognised the benefits of the overall package of measures, although there was no specific assessment of the impact of the changes on local businesses. On 31 January First Great Western Link (FGWL) enhanced the 0727 Twyford-London Paddington service by increasing it from a five-carriage train to a 10-carriage Adelante train to reduce crowding. FGWL have also recently seen a slight improvement in overall punctuality. Both the Strategic Rail Authority and FGWL are continuing to monitor the performance of the timetable.

</p>





<p><a name="50308w02.html_wqn1"><b> Mr. Boris Johnson: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport if he will meet First Great Western Link, the Strategic Rail Authority and interested hon. Members to discuss timetabling of services in the Thames Valley area.  [220368]</p>




<p><a name="50308w02.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 I have already agreed to meet the hon. Gentleman and his hon. Colleague from Maidenhead on 10 March 2005. Further meetings with relevant parties will be arranged as necessary.

<p><a name="50308w02.html_wqn2"><b> Mr. Hancock: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what formula will be used to calculate the financial allocations in the Local Transport Plans 2006&#150;11; and if he will make a statement.  [219551]</p>




<p><a name="50308w02.html_spnew2"><b> Charlotte Atkins: </b> 
 A formula is used to allocate most of the capital highways maintenance funding between local authorities. This formula considers the size and condition of the road networks and the size of the bridge stock, for which local highway authorities are responsible.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50308w02.html_para0">
The Department is also developing a formula to represent local transport pressures, such as road casualties and local public transport patronage, for .possible use in influencing financial allocations for integrated transport block schemes. Subject to the satisfactory completion of development work, the Department proposes to consult with local authorities on this formula later this year.

<p><a name="50308w02.html_wqn3"><b> Mr. Greg Knight: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport for what reasons the M1 Motorway near junction 18 was closed on 21 February; upon whose authority; whether a heavy goods vehicle was involved; and if he will make a statement.  [219899]</p>




<p><a name="50308w02.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Jamieson: </b> 
 The southbound carriageway was closed by Northamptonshire police following an incident involving a car and a heavy goods vehicle. The HGV shed its load of heavy concrete blocks and the closure was needed to deal with the build up of traffic and enable the road to be cleared by large, specialised recovery crews, in order to remove the hazard to road users. Traffic was diverted off the motorway at Junction 18.

<p><a name="50308w02.html_wqn4"><b> Mr. Greg Knight: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport when he expects the M42 to be free of <i>(a)</i> roadworks and <i>(b)</i> lane closures.  [219566]</p>




<p><a name="50308w02.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Jamieson: </b> 
 Work is currently being carried out in connection with two pilot projects on the M42, both of which are designed to improve journey reliability. Between Junctions 3A and 7 the Active Traffic Management scheme, involving the installation of signs, signals and detector loops in the road surface designed to improve information to drivers and improve traffic flow, is on programme to be complete by the end of April 2005. There will be a need for limited lane closures during the summer whilst message signs and CCTV systems are commissioned.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50308w02.html_para1">
On the northbound carriageway between Junctions 10 and 11, signs are being installed in connection with a project to prevent HGVs from overtaking on an uphill section of the motorway and causing delays. This work is being carried out at off-peak times and does not involve lane closures and is also due for completion by April.

<p>(2) how much has been spent on the acquisition of <i>(a)</i> land and <i>(b)</i> buildings in connection with the Manchester Metrolink extension;  [220648]
</p>



<p>(3) how much has been spent on demolition costs so far in connection with the Manchester Metrolink extension.  [220650]</p>




<p><a name="50308w02.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Darling: </b> 
 The Department has provided some &#163;170 million. Around &#163;80 million was for Greater Manchester Passenger Transport Executive (GMPTE) to buy the concession for the operation of Metrolink. This has continuing value to generate revenue for GMPTE and give them control over the network. The rest has been for advanced works (i.e. utility diversions); around &#163;32 million has been provided for the buying of property (including demolition) and land, some of which may still be required for the package that GMPTE now develop.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport in what percentage of accidents occurring on motorways resulting in a motorway closure a heavy goods vehicle was involved in each of the last five years; and if he will make it his policy to collect and publish such figures annually.  [219900]</p>




<p><a name="50308w02.html_spnew7"><b> Mr. Jamieson: </b> 
 Based on the major incidents reported to the Highways Agency over the last 12 months that resulted in a full carriageway closure of the motorway, approximately 50 per cent. of those incidents have involved, but were not necessarily caused by, heavy goods vehicles.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50308w02.html_para2">
The Highways Agency is taking over responsibility for certain aspects of incident management on motorways from the police over the next twelve months. As part of this process data relating to incidents will be systematically collected by the Highways Agency. No decision has yet been made about which aspects of that data would be routinely published.

<p><a name="50308w03.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Jamieson: </b> 
 Variable speed limits have been successful in easing congestion and improving traffic flow on sections of the motorway network such as on the M25.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50308w03.html_para1">
Local Highway Authorities have the powers to introduce variable speed limits under section 84 of the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984. The most common use of a variable speed limit other than on motorways is to reduce traffic speeds outside schools particularly at school opening and closing times.

<p>
<a name="50308w03.html_para2">
However there are significant signing and enforcement costs associated with the implementation of variable speed limits on roads other than motorways. Past experience has also shown that, unlike on motorways, they achieve only a slight reduction in vehicle speeds in these circumstances.

During this four year period, six of these deaths in the former metropolitan county of Tyne and Wear were of people aged under 30.</p>

<p class="tabletext">The ONS definition of alcohol-related deaths only includes those causes regarded as being most directly due to alcohol consumption. Apart from deaths due to accidental poisoning with alcohol, this definition excludes external causes of death, such as road traffic deaths and other accidents, and alcohol-related suicides and homicides. Estimates of the annual total number of deaths in which alcohol has played a role can therefore vary widely depending on the criteria used. The definition used by ONS allows for consistent comparisons over time for those deaths where a clear association with alcohol consumption can generally be assumed.</p>

<sup>(6)</sup> For the year 2000 the cause of death was defined using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (1CD-9). The codes used by ONS to define alcohol-related deaths are listed below:<br>

291&#151;Alcoholic psychoses.<br>

303&#151;Alcohol dependence syndrome.<br>

305.0&#151;Non-dependent abuse of alcohol.<br>

425.5&#151;Alcoholic cardiomyopathy.<br>

571&#151;Chronic liver disease and cirrhosis.<br>

E860&#151;Accidental poisoning by alcohol.<br>

For the years 2001&#150;03 the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) was used. To maintain comparability with earlier years the following codes were used:<br>

F10&#151;Mental and behavioural disorders due to use of alcohol.<br>

142.6&#151;Alcoholic cardiomyopathy.<br>

K70&#151;Alcoholic liver disease<br>

K73&#151;Chronic hepatitis, not elsewhere classified.<br>

K74&#151;Fibrosis and cirrhosis of liver.<br>

X45&#151;Accidental poisoning by and exposure to alcohol.<br>

 Customs and Excise do not collect data on the number of VAT registered businesses by local authority. However, information on the number of enterprises registered for VAT at the start of the year is available via the Small Business Service website at www.sbs.gov.uk. This can be used to give an indication of the size of the business population within Tyne and Wear. Table 1 shows the number of VAT registered enterprises in this area at the start of each year between 1999 and 2004.

There is no correlation between the data within a specific year. The data refers to the year in which (columns B and C) applications were presented to council and column D the year that the final approval decision was taken by the planning service. It cannot be assumed that the number of applications overturned in one year is directly related to the number of applications presented to council with a recommendation to refuse. Neither can it be assumed that the number of site meeting requested relates to the number of applications overturned and given approval. Due to the complexity of the planning process it can be a considerable time between the receipt of an application and a final decision being taken.

<i>Letter from Dr. Malcolm McKibbin to Mr. Gregory Campbell dated 8 March 2005:</i>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">You recently asked the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland a parliamentary Question asking how many accidents on Ballyquin Road, Limavady, County Londonderry, have been reported to DRD Roads Service within the past 10 years (220441). I have been asked to reply as the issue raised falls with my responsibility as Chief Executive of Roads Service.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">With regard to accident statistics I should explain that the Police Service for Northern Ireland (PSNI) gathers road traffic injury collision information. Roads Service has access to this information for its own investigation purposes. We currently hold PSNI records for the B68 Ballyquin Road for the period January 1996 to February 2005. During that period there were 50 such injury collisions, including the recent double fatality at a bend on the road near Dungiven.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">Like the vast majority of the rural road network, Ballyquin Road was not designed to modern standards, though a number of improvement schemes have been carried out on the road over recent years, including the erection or bend warning signs at the double fatality accident location. However, the collision history along this road remains a cause for concern. We have, therefore, been analysing the nature and type of collisions along the road, with a view to delivering a package of measures designed specifically to reduce the number of collisions.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">As a result of this work, a route action Collision Remedial Scheme (signs, white lines etc.) for the Ballyquin Road has been included in our programme of works for the next financial year. Detailed analysis of the route is underway and we are intending to complete the necessary design work for this scheme within the next few months. The bend referred to above will be given priority within the scheme, so that any suitable measures can be implemented at this location, as soon as possible. Any more major improvement proposals along the road (realigning of bends, improving sight distances, road widening etc.) would, of course, have to compete for funding with other worthwhile schemes within our Northern Division area.</p>
</ul>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how much block leave is allocated to units <i>(a)</i> prior to an operational tour of Iraq and <i>(b)</i> on return from Iraq.  [219064]</p>




<p><a name="50308w14.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Caplin: </b> 
 There is no established regulation on the provision of &#039;block leave&#039; prior to deployment on an operational tour. Many units do work a &#039;block leave&#039; system in which the unit will stand-down as a whole. These periods may take place at the discretion of the commanding officer before an operational tour, 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>8 Mar 2005 : Column 1673W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
providing they do not conflict with the interests of the service and that there is sufficient time prior to deployment for leave to be taken.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50308w14.html_para2">
Post operational tour leave and post operational detachment leave were introduced in recognition of the stresses and strains that operational deployments bring to both an individual and their family and friends. The general entitlement for all personnel returning from a tour in Iraq of six months is a minimum of 20 working days leave. However, the breakdown of this entitlement between additional post-operational leave and an individual&#039;s annual leave entitlement differs between the three services.

<p><a name="50308w18.html_spnew0"><b> Ms Blears: </b> 
 Acceptable Behaviour Contracts (ABCs) were first pioneered by the London borough of Islington with the Metropolitan police. Their successful model has been promoted by the Home Office and adopted across the rest of the country. They are voluntary agreements between a person who has been involved in antisocial behaviour and one or more local agencies. They are not statutory orders and we currently have no plans to place ABCs on a statutory basis.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50308w18.html_para0">
The use of ABCs and other early interventions are crucial as they show communities, and potential perpetrators of antisocial behaviour, that action will be taken against those who behave in an antisocial manner.

 No assessment has been made however, we are aware that voluntary organisations are working closely with local authorities in many areas, for example, youth justice agencies like NACRO and Crime Concern are delivering local work with young people involved in antisocial behaviour and offending to support them to change their behaviour.

<p><a name="50308w18.html_spnew3"><b> Ms Blears: </b> 
 An antisocial behaviour order (ASBO) is a civil order that protects the community from acts that cause or are likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress to one or more persons not of the same household. Orders often contain prohibitions that prohibit a person from carrying out certain acts and excluding them from certain places.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50308w18.html_para6">
The most common behaviour tackled by ASBOs is general loutish and unruly conduct such as verbal abuse, harassment, assault, graffiti and excessive noise. The wide range of antisocial behaviour that a can be tackled by ASBOs and the ability to tailor the terms of the order to each specific case illustrates their flexibility.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50308w18.html_para7">
It is for the courts to decide what prohibitions go into an order. Prohibitions should aim to cover the range of antisocial behaviour acts committed by the defendant and be specific to the behaviour.

<a name="50308w18.html_para8">
Breach rate is not an indication of failure. What it shows is that ASBOs have teeth and if people don&#039;t abide by them there are serious consequences.

<p><a name="50308w20.html_spnew1"><b> Caroline Flint: </b> 
 The Serious Organised Crime and Police Bill includes building on the existing common law provisions relating to Queen&#039;s Evidence. Placing it on a statutory footing is intended to increase the use of Queen&#039;s Evidence while minimising the risk of miscarriages of justice. The Bill&#039;s provisions will increase the transparency of the process and provide for those who get a reduction in their sentence to be re-sentenced if subsequently it is discovered their co-operation was not genuine, both of which are significant additional safeguards.

In the meantime, we continue to investigate options for providing further increases in capacity over the coming years and keep the number of prison places required under review.

Revised prison population projections were issued in January 2005. These new projections anticipate a prison population of between 76,500 and 86,000 in 2009. The National Offender Management Service will continue to monitor population movements, improve projections and keep prison capacity under review. Projected prison population for each of the next five years is presented in the Home Office Statistical Bulletin 01/05 (Prison Population Projections 2005&#150;11, England and Wales). A copy of this bulletin has been placed in the House of Commons Library.

<p><a name="50308w22.html_spnew0"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 Private sector prisons do not currently have access to the Quantum IT infrastructure, although they do have access to the strategic Inmate Information System, and its local component, the Local Inmate Database System (LIDS), alongside their own IT provision.

In January 2005 limited access to the e-OASys offender assessment system was provided to all contracted establishments except HMP Wolds. It was not possible to provide this same level of access to HMP Wolds due to technical difficulties, but work in ongoing to rectify this problem.

<p><a name="50308w22.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Charles Clarke: </b> 
 Should compulsory registration for ID cards be introduced under the terms of the Identity Cards Bill currently before Parliament, Her Majesty the Queen would be exempt as the Bill is not binding on the Crown. Clause 41 of the Bill allows for exemptions and exceptions to be made in any order requiring compulsory registration. No decisions have yet been taken on what exemptions and exceptions may apply. Prior to any order requiring compulsory registration, people will register with the scheme when applying for documents such as passports which will be designated under powers contained within the Identity Cards Bill. Members of the royal family other than Her Majesty the Queen hold passports and would therefore join the scheme in the same way as members of the public.

<p><a name="50308w22.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Charles Clarke: </b> 
 With the exception of the powers in Part 4 of the Anti- Terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001, which are immigration powers applicable to foreign nationals, counter terrorism measures are aimed at terrorists, whatever their background, section of society or nationality they may come from.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50308w22.html_para2">
The Home Office provides the law-enforcement and security agencies with the powers and funding they need to do their job. There are two main pieces of legislation which they use to fight terrorism: the Terrorism Act 2000 and the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 These Acts deliver UK-wide legislation that is effective in countering the threat we face from terrorism. The legislation includes measures to outlaw membership, support and fundraising for terrorist groups, seizure of terrorist cash and property, the creation of offences specific to terrorism at home and abroad, and special powers for terrorist investigations.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50308w22.html_para3">
The Home Secretary introduced on 22 February a Bill&#151;The Prevention of Terrorism Bill which contains new proposals for preventative control orders which are intended to disrupt and restrict individual&#039;s involvement in terrorist related activities. We are also looking at the scope for new terrorist related offences and other measures to bring suspected terrorists to justice. My hope is that we will be able to bring further legislative proposals on this as soon as time allows.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50308w22.html_para4">
The Government have provided resources to finance a 50 per cent. increase in the size of the Security Service over the next three years. The bulk of these extra resources will go into counter- terrorism work. In 2005&#150;06 dedicated ring fenced counter terrorism funding for the police service in England and Wales, including the Metropolitan police service, will amount 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>8 Mar 2005 : Column 1705W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
to &#163;96 million revenue and &#163;8 million capital. This is very nearly double the amount of the first dedicated counter-terrorism grants in 2002&#150;03.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50308w22.html_para5">
Combating the threat posed by terrorism does of course go beyond funding and legislation and it is important that we continue to build and develop partnerships at every level in accordance with our overall strategy&#151;to prevent terrorism, to pursue terrorist networks, to protect the UK, its citizens and its critical infrastructure, and to plan for attacks in order to minimise their consequences. Our objective remains to reduce the threat from terrorism so that our people may continue to go about their business freely and with confidence.

<p><a name="50308w22.html_spnew6"><b> Ms Blears </b> 
<i>[holding answer 1 March 2005]:</i> The Home Office runs a national programme of Counter Terrorist exercises to test the UK&#039;s response to terrorist incidents. Participation in these exercises by Government Departments, agencies and associated bodies depends on the content of the scenario for each exercise. To date, the scenarios have not required participation by these bodies. However, the Government is holding discussions on protective security with both the IGD and BRC.

 England&#039;s Regional Development Agencies (RDAs) may decide to invest in or support investment in regional transport initiatives, assuming such initiatives are consistent with the goals of the regional economic strategies for their regions. The Regional Development Agencies Act 1998 provides broad powers to RDAs to do anything which they consider expedient in pursuance of their statutory purposes, which include promoting economic development and regeneration in their regions and contributing to the achievement of sustainable development in the UK. In addition to their activities being subject to general requirements of the law, the Act places some specific restrictions on the use of such powers. RDAs may only give financial assistance to achieve their aims if the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry consents. Restrictions also apply to the disposal of land in certain circumstances and to the acquisition and use of housing by RDAs.

1. Figures are in line with current uprating policy. The Chancellor announced in the pre-Budget report that the guarantee element of pension credit would be uprated in line with earnings over the current spending round (to 2007&#150;08). The savings credit threshold is currently equal to the maximum rate of basic state pension and is assumed to rise in line with prices.<br>

2. The estimates for the financial years 2006&#150;07 to 2009&#150;10 are based on the 2004 pre-Budget report assumptions for average earnings growth and growth in the retail price index.<br>

<p><a name="50308w27.html_spnew2"><b> Malcolm Wicks: </b> 
 The policy on charging for residential care is the responsibility of health departments. The current financial assessment for residential care takes account of an individual&#039;s income, including benefit income, leaving each resident with a personal expense allowance. Pension credit, which may include an amount of savings credit, is taken into account in the council&#039;s financial assessment. For those individuals in receipt of the savings credit, they are left with the amount for personal expenses and in addition receive a savings credit disregard. For individuals living in their own homes and being financially assessed for home care and their non-residential care services, the savings credit is fully disregarded.

<p>
<a name="50308w27.html_para0">
Payment of attendance allowance (AA) and disability living allowance (DLA) stops after four weeks residence in a care home, except where a resident can meet the full cost without help from a local authority or other source of public funding (other than payments for free nursing care), as this does not affect payability of AA/DLA for self funders. The mobility component of DLA can continue in payment because care home costs do not cover mobility needs. Pension credit recipients who have been in a care home for 13 weeks or more at the end of the specified qualifying week are not eligible for a winter fuel payment.

<i>[holding answer 3 March 2005]:</i> The majority of surplus land remaining in the ownership of the Secretary of State for Health is included in a transfer of land and property to English Partnerships (EP). This transfer, which was announced in April 2004, will assist the Government&#039;s sustainable communities plan. Around 1,650 hectares of land will transfer to EP and it is estimated that this has the capacity to provide around 15,000 homes.

<p><a name="50308w29.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
<i>[holding answer 28 February 2005]:</i> Primary care trust&#039;s (PCT) capacity planning identified the need for significant increases in diagnostic capacity to meet the 18-week waiting time target. For example, the number of scans required will need to increase from 6.4 million in 2004&#150;05 to 8.9 million in 2008.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50308w29.html_para0">
This additional capacity is required quickly and I believe that the independent sector is well placed to provide some of this capacity. That is why we announced the procurement of &#163;1 billion over five years, which includes one million scans annually. This still leaves significant growth for the national health service.

The Department has been working with strategic health authorities and PCTs to develop specific proposals for the procurement, choosing what they wish us to purchase for them.

Friend, the Secretary of State, has received representations from ASH and other health groups raising concerns that the availability of cheap illegal tobacco is undermining the Government&#039;s tobacco control strategy, particularly the use of high duty rates to discourage people from smoking. Smuggled tobacco has meant a continuing supply of cheap tobacco, often targeted on areas of deprivation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50308w30.html_para2">
This is why the Government, in &quot;Tackling Tobacco Smuggling,&quot; published in March 2000, has set challenging targets for Her Majesty&#039;s Customs and Excise to reverse the growth in tobacco smuggling. As a result, in the first four years of the strategy, the total number of cigarettes smuggled into the United Kingdom each year has been reduced by over five billion, a reduction of over a third.

 Sudan 1 can cause liver cancer in laboratory rats. Although Sudan 1 could contribute to an increased risk of cancer in humans, at the levels present in food that risk is likely to be very small. It is not possible to further quantify the risk, but experts advise that exposure should be kept as low as possible. Since Sudan 1 is not permitted for food use, it should not be present in food at all.

 Following advice from the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee, the Department commissioned two research programmes in 1999 to study the therapeutic benefit of pentosan polysulphate (PPS). The first study, lead by Dr. Christine Farquhar of the Institute for Animal Health&#039;s Neuropathogenesis Unit in Edinburgh, showed that PPS was effective in preventing the development of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease in mice, but only if given at the time of infection or shortly after. It was not effective if given after clinical disease had developed. The second study, lead by Dr. Harbans Sharma from Manchester University, studied the pharmacokinetics (uptake) of PPS in mice and in human volunteers.

 Since the publication of the report of the Gambling Review Body (Cm 5206) in July 2001, the Department has undertaken a very extensive programme of consultations with interested bodies about options and proposals for changes to gambling law in Great Britain. There have been two formal public consultations, the first on the Review Body&#039;s report and the second on the draft clauses published for pre-legislative scrutiny in November 2003.

Culture Online was launched in 2002 to increase access to, and participation in, arts and culture. Many of its projects are aimed at children of school age and at audiences that might not otherwise participate in arts and culture, including those who do not easily have access to arts and culture, people from deprived communities and people with particular educational or physical needs. People in Croydon, Central will be

Through our commitment to public service broadcasting we have helped to foster an environment in which a creative, commercially successful broadcasting industry provides a wide range of UK-made, high quality original programmes catering for all viewers and listeners. We have ensured a secure funding base for the BBC and Channel 4, while giving them the freedom to develop commercial operations which complement and support their public service remit. The Communications Act 2003 includes provisions to ensure that public service broadcasting will continue to have a key role to play in the digital future.

We have changed the licensing laws to allow people to hold and attend commercial dances on Sunday, to make it easier for restaurants to open an hour later, and to relax the alcohol licensing hours from 11 pm on New Year&#039;s Eve to 11 am on New Year&#039;s Day in all future years; and we have given the police greater powers to take action against under-age drinking and disorderly and noisy licensed premises. The Licensing Act 2003, when fully implemented, will introduce a streamlined, consistent and fair licensing regime for the provision of alcohol, public entertainment and late night refreshment. It will provide greater choice for consumers, bring regeneration and increased employment opportunities and protect local residents whose lives have been blighted by disturbance and antisocial behaviour.

The Gambling Bill will, when implemented, transfer responsibility for licensing gambling premises to local authorities. Local people and businesses will be able to make representations about applications for licenses and local authorities will be able to decide not to issue licenses for casino premises. These changes will give local communities, including those in Croydon, Central, a greater say in the regulation of gambling in their area.

Note:<br>

&quot;Allocated&quot; and &quot;distributed&quot; columns naturally differ because many awards are not distributed in the year in which the money is allocated.<br>

&quot;Awards for All&quot; is a joint scheme and not a distributor, so it does not draw down money itself from the NLDF.<br>

The table excludes the lottery proceeds used to fund NESTA (&#163;200 million in 1998 and further &#163;95 million in 2003).<br>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport (1) what plans she has to review the procedures for the licensing of nightclubs;  [220499]

<p>(2) if she will bring forward proposals to require local authorities to publicise more widely applications for licensing of nightclubs.  [220558]</p>




<p><a name="50308w38.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Caborn: </b> 
 There is no legal definition of &quot;nightclub&quot;. The procedures for the licensing of all premises selling alcohol or providing regulated entertainment or late night refreshment were reviewed during the White Paper consultation on licensing and the subject of detailed scrutiny during the Licensing Bill&#039;s passage through Parliament. The Licensing Act 2003 and Guidance to Licensing Authorities explain the new procedures and can be read on the Department&#039;s website (www.culture.gov.uk ). The requirements for advertising applications for the grant or variation or review of premises licences are contained in regulations that are also available on our website. These include the need to display for 28 consecutive days, a legible notice prominently at or on the premises to which the application relates where it can be conveniently read from the exterior of the premises and, in the case of a premises covering an area of more than 50 sq m, a further notice in the same form and subject to the same requirements every 50 m along the external perimeter of the premises abutting any highway; and also to publish a notice in a local newspaper or, if there is none, a local newsletter or similar document at least once during the 10 working days after the application is given to the licensing authority. We do not think that there is a case for further extending the publicising of applications for licences for nightclubs.

 Since April 2001, all new building work at schools has been subject to the Building Regulations. With regard to fire safety, the design of new school buildings must comply with Part B of the Regulations.

<p>
<a name="50308w40.html_para0">
The Building Regulations do not require the installation of sprinkler systems in schools, but this does not prohibit local education authorities from specifying their use. Currently the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is carrying out a review of the fire safety aspects of the Building Regulations and its accompanying guidance Approved Document B. The review will include schools and it should be completed early in 2006. The decision on whether or not to install sprinklers in new schools needs to be taken locally. For example, in the Department&#039;s Managing School Facilities Guide 6, 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>8 Mar 2005 : Column 1770W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
&quot;Fire Safety&quot;, we give the example of a school in an area of high arson risk as being a suitable candidate for their installation see www.teachernet.gov.uk/fire. However, we are mindful of the need to provide more detailed advice than before and have produced new draft guidance&#151;&quot;Designing and Managing Against the Risk of Fire in Schools&quot;. This stresses the value of using risk assessments to determine what sort of fire detection and alarm systems should be used in a new school, and whether or not sprinklers should be installed. This advice will be subject to public consultation, which will commence shortly, and we expect to publish it in the early autumn.

<p><a name="50308w40.html_spnew3"><b> Margaret Hodge: </b> 
 The Special Educational Needs and Disability Act 2001 amended both the Education Act 1996 and the Disability Discrimination Act 1995. To help schools, local education authorities and others meet their amended special educational needs (SEN) duties under the Education Act 1996 the Department published the Special Educational Needs Code of Practice (2001). To help schools meet their duties under part 4 of the amended Disability Discrimination Act, the Disability Rights Commission produced a Code of Practice in 2002. The Code of Practice explains, and provides guidance on, the duties schools have not to discriminate, without justification, against children for a reason related to their disabilities and to make reasonable adjustments to prevent discrimination. In June 2002 the Department for Education and Skills issued separate guidance to schools on carrying out their duty to draw up and publish plans for improving access to disabled pupils.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50308w40.html_para3">
The Department for Education and Skills has made widely available a guide for parents and carers on the Special Educational Needs Code of Practice. The Disability Rights Commission provides advice to parents and schools on disability discrimination and runs a dedicated telephone help line. Parents have the right to appeal to the SEN and Disability Tribunal and admissions appeal panels if they think their children have suffered discrimination or if they disagree with the decisions of their local education authority about their child&#039;s special educational needs. The Tribunal has made available to parents publications explaining their rights of appeal, how they can make an appeal, and what this entails.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50308w40.html_para4">
The Office for Standards in Education (OfSTED) consider how well schools are meeting the needs of children with special educational needs as part of their inspections; they consider how schools are complying with their duty to produce accessibility plans and the quality of those plans. OfSTED&#039;s recent survey reviewing the implementation of the revised inclusion framework introduced as a result of the Special Educational Needs and Disability Act 2001, &quot;Special Educational Needs and Disability&#151;towards inclusive schools,&quot; found that schools had a growing awareness of the benefits of inclusion and that there had been some improvements in practice. It also identified the need for further progress, for example, of the schools surveyed around 50 per cent. had produced a disability access plan. OfSTED recognised that the broad and sustained programme of action under the SEN strategy &quot;Removing Barriers to Achievement&quot; (February 2004) is designed to bring about improvements to the provision for children with learning difficulties and disabilities. The programme includes the development of practical resources for schools that should help them to comply fully with their duties under part 4 of the Disability Discrimination Act.

 Delivery of special needs education within North Yorkshire is a matter for determination by the local education authority (LEA) within the framework of law and guidance issued by Government. It is an essential function of every LEA to make effective arrangements for special educational needs (SEN) by ensuring that the needs of pupils are identified and assessed quickly and matched by appropriate provision.

<p><a name="50308w42.html_spnew0"><b> Margaret Hodge: </b> 
 The target for 50 per cent. of children to reach a good level of development was set in July 2004. It is based on the 2003 foundation stage profile (FSP) results and data from Sure Start local programmes. It is provisional as the 2003 FSP data were published as &#039;experimental statistics&#039;. FSP data for 2004 will be published on 17 March, and for 2005 later this year. At this point we will be able to confirm the target and establish the baseline against which progress towards the target can be assessed.

<p><a name="50308w42.html_spnew1"><b> Margaret Hodge: </b> 
 We set this target to be challenging, but achievable. The Social Exclusion Unit&#039;s 1999 &quot;Bridging the Gap&quot; report identified three important elements in reducing the number of young people not in education, employment or training: an improved curriculum offer, appropriate financial support and high quality advice guidance and support focused on the needs of young people.

The strategies set out in the recent 14&#150;19 Education and Skills White Paper, alongside the earlier &quot;Supporting Young People to Achieve&quot; and &quot;Every Child Matters&quot; publications, build on the good practice and progress that has been made since Bridging the Gap. This includes the success that Connexions has had in achieving its own target to reduce the proportion of young people not in education, employment or training between 2002 and 2004. They will make sure we give the

 Since 1998&#151;the baseline year for the strategy&#151;the England under-18 conception rate has fallen by 9.8 per cent. The 2010 PSA target is very challenging and achieving it will require sustained and strengthened implementation of the strategy at national and local level, involving a wide range of services, professionals, parents and young people. That is why we have written to local authority chief executives, asking them to strengthen delivery of local strategies in high rate neighbourhoods and on teenagers most at risk&#151;50 per cent. of conceptions occur in the 20 per cent. of wards with the highest rates.

<p><a name="50308w44.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Mullin: </b> 
 All applications for entry to the UK as students are considered under the immigration rules. The requirements for entry are therefore the same, irrespective of where the application is made. Local conditions, including the prevalence of forged documentation, mean that different procedures may apply in respect of the application process. However, differences in local processes serve only to facilitate the consideration of the application in accordance with the immigration rules.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what the expected total cost of the student visa scheme was in <i>(a)</i> 2002, <i>(b)</i> 2003 and <i>(c)</i> 2004; and what the estimated amount of revenue expected to be accrued from the new student visa charges is for 2005.  [220762]</p>




<p><a name="50308w44.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Mullin: </b> 
 The overseas entry clearance operation is required to function on a full cost recovery basis and is therefore non-profitable. The student visa fee is calculated to ensure that it covers the cost of the work involved in processing the application. The charge for a student visa application is currently &#163;36 irrespective of factors such as the duration of the course, where the student applied for entry clearance overseas or where they intend to study in the UK. The fee was last raised in 2002 and the level of visa fees is currently under review.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50308w44.html_para1">
As UKvisas operates on a cost recovery rather than a profit basis, there is no estimate for revenue accrued for 2005.

<p><a name="50308w44.html_spnew6"><b> Mr. Mullin: </b> 
 UKvisas holds statistics on the numbers of refusals of student visa applications at entry clearance posts worldwide, as each refusal relates to paragraph 57 of the immigration rules. The recording of refusal data is not further subdivided into reasons for refusal.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50308w44.html_para4">
An application by a student will be refused if they have failed to meet the requirements of the immigration rules for a person seeking to enter the UK for studies. Among the common reasons for the refusal of an application is the failure of the applicant to show an intention or an ability to undertake a proposed course of study. In addition, students who fall for refusal will often have failed to show that they can meet the cost of the proposed course or that they can be adequately maintained and accommodated in the UK without recourse to public funds.

<p><a name="50308w45.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Mullin: </b> 
 The UK Government have worked with the Government of Swaziland over many years to promote democracy and good governance. Since March 2003, as acting local Presidency of the EU, our High Commissioner in Mbabane has also engaged in a formal political dialogue with the Government of Swaziland, as mandated by Article 8 of the Cotonou Agreement. Meetings are held three times a year with senior members of the Swazi Government to encourage further efforts to implement democratic reforms, to promote adherence to UN human rights accords, to restore the rule of law and to move the constitutional process forward. I discussed progress in the constitution and rule of law with the Prime Minister of Swaziland on 3 February during his visit to the UK.

 A fair multi-party system needs to be established sufficiently in advance of the 2006 elections. We are concerned by delays in implementing the government&#039;s roadmap on transition published last July, and the short time remaining to debate such a wide-ranging and complicated Constitutional Amendment Bill. We have urged the Government of Uganda to ensure that the process is constitutional, respects press freedom, the rule of law and institutions of governance, and is free from physical intimidation or manipulation.

However, we are not convinced that Zimbabwe has taken the steps required to ensure a free and fair election. As I said in the House on 1 March, we are concerned about reports of serious irregularities in the electoral roll. We continue to urge the Government of Zimbabwe to honour in full its commitment to the South African Development Community (SADC) electoral principles. We also urge the SADC to ensure that its guidelines are adhered to. The elections in Zimbabwe will be a test of the credibility of the SADC as well as of the Zimbabwean Government.
