<a name="50225w01.html_sbhd0"><h3 align=center>HIV/AIDS (Children)</h3>


<p><a name="50225w01.html_wqn0"><b> Alistair Burt: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development by what date the review of country assistance plans in countries with large numbers of orphans and children made vulnerable by HIV and AIDS will be completed.  [217558]</p>




<p><a name="50225w01.html_spnew0"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 Country assistance plans (CAPs) are reviewed annually by DFID country offices. The purpose of CAPs is to report progress against public service agreement (PSA) targets that includes tackling HIV and AIDS. This year, reviews will have a strong focus on assessing what progress each country has made on AIDS, and what contribution the international community has made, and where further action will be required.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport if he will provide a second entrance/exit for Ivybridge on the A38; and if he will make a statement.  [218054]</p>




<p><a name="50225w01.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Jamieson: </b> 
 I have no plans to provide another junction on the A38 to serve Ivybridge.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50225w01.html_para0">
Congestion does occur on local roads within Ivybridge during peak periods. However, relief of congestion on the local road network is a matter for the local highway authority.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50225w01.html_para1">
Facilitating further use of the trunk road to solve these problems would be contrary to Government policy.

<p><a name="50225w01.html_wqn2"><b> Mr. George Osborne: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport how much has been spent on <i>(a)</i> entertainment lunches involving civil servants and guests and <i>(b)</i> working lunches, in each year since 1997.  [215041]</p>




<p><a name="50225w01.html_spnew2"><b> Charlotte Atkins: </b> 
 The Department does not maintain separate records of the expenditure on entertainment lunches and/or working lunches and is unable to provide figures in the breakdown requested without incurring disproportionate cost.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50225w01.html_para2">
I refer the hon. Member to my answer of 13 January 2005, <i>Official Report,</i> column 599W, for expenditure on entertainment for 2002&#150;03 and 2003&#150;04.

<p><a name="50225w01.html_wqn3"><b> Charles Hendry: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what advice he gives to highways authorities regarding the use of keep clear zones on <i>(a)</i> highways and <i>(b)</i> other roads.  [218243]</p>




<p><a name="50225w01.html_spnew3"><b> Charlotte Atkins: </b> 
 The Department for Transport&#039;s advice on the use of keep clear markings is set out in section 22 of Chapter 5 of the Traffic Signs Manual. A new edition was published in 2003. The guidance is applicable to all roads to which the public has access.

<a name="50225w01.html_sbhd4"><h3 align=center>Noise Pollution (Heathrow Airport)</h3>


<p><a name="50225w01.html_wqn4"><b> Martin Linton: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what studies his Department has conducted on the effect at different times of day and night of noise pollution in Battersea from Heathrow airport.  [218516]</p>




<p><a name="50225w01.html_spnew4"><b> Charlotte Atkins: </b> 
 The Department and its predecessors have commissioned a range of studies over the years about the effects of aircraft noise on annoyance and sleep disturbance at various times of day and night. These include the large-scale &quot;Aircraft Noise Index Study&quot; (CAA DR Report 8402) in the early 1980s, and the DoT &quot;Report of a Field Study of Aircraft Noise and Sleep Disturbance&quot; in the early 1990s. Neither study included fieldwork in Battersea, but the results of both can be generalized to that area.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50225w01.html_para3">
On behalf of the Department, a consortium led by the MVA Consultancy is currently engaged in a major study of &quot;Attitudes to Noise from Aircraft Sources in England&quot; (ANASE). If this project proceeds to its second (major fieldwork and analysis) phase, sites will be sampled from a wide range of possible areas around Heathrow and other airports.

<p><a name="50225w01.html_wqn5"><b> Mr. Greg Knight: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what action is being taken <i>(a)</i> by his Department and <i>(b)</i> by Network Rail to warn young people of the dangers of trespassing on railway property.  [218142]</p>




<p><a name="50225w01.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 The cross-industry National Route Crime Group (NRCG), whose membership includes the Department and Network Rail, works with schools to educate young people about the dangers of trespassing on the railway. The NRCG has helped to create a number of interactive educational materials, for example the &#039;Trakkies&#039; website for younger children and the &#039;Track Off&#039; website which provides educational materials for teachers and which is accredited under the National Grid for Learning scheme. Network Rail, the British Transport Police and a number of train operating companies also have staff who visit schools on a regular basis to reinforce safety messages. The NRCG&#039;s Annual Plan 2005, copies of which will be placed in the Libraries of the House and are available at www.trackoff.org , describes the approach to be taken to increase awareness of railway crime issues during this year. Network Rail will also be launching a campaign before the school Easter break aimed at reminding older children and young teenagers about the dangers of the railway.

<p><a name="50225w01.html_wqn7"><b> Mr. Laurence Robertson: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport (1) what representations she has received from the Racecourse Holdings Trust regarding its plans to build an all-weather horseracing track at Kempton Park; and if she will make a statement;  [218106]
</p>



<p>(2) if she will review the restrictions on the opening hours of licensed betting offices with a view to increasing opening hours in the summer; and if she will make a statement.  [218107]</p>




<p><a name="50225w01.html_spnew7"><b> Mr. Caborn: </b> 
 We have been informed of the company&#039;s plans to build such a track, and of its belief that it would benefit from increased betting turnover flowing from an extension later into the evening, during the winter months, of the hours during which licensed betting offices are allowed to open. We have already announced our intention to allow such an extension when the Gambling Bill, if enacted, is brought into force.

<p><a name="50225w01.html_wqn8"><b> Mr. Stephen O&#039;Brien: </b> 
 To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer how many prosecutions of <i>(a)</i> small and medium enterprises and <i>(b)</i> large businesses were brought in 2003&#150;04 for breaches of regulations sponsored by his Department; how much in total was imposed in fines in each case; and how many visits were made in 2003&#150;04 by officials from his Department or agencies for which his Department is responsible to verify regulatory compliance in each case.  [217179]</p>




<p><a name="50225w01.html_spnew8"><b> Mr. Timms: </b> 
 In 2003&#150;04 the Inland Revenue and HM Customs and Excise undertook prosecutions only for breaches of criminal law, and not for breaches of regulations. Details of the criminal prosecution activity undertaken in 2003&#150;04 are set out in the Annual Reports produced by each of those departments, copies of which are available in the House of Commons Library. Those figures do not, however, give details of the number of prosecutions involving small and medium enterprises 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>25 Feb 2005 : Column 840W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
and large businesses; the amount of fines imposed by the Courts in those cases; nor the number of visits made by officials to verify compliance in those cases.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50225w01.html_para4">
That additional information is not readily accessible and could be ascertained only at disproportionate cost. In the case of regulations made by the Treasury for financial services regulation, 31 prosecutions were brought in 2003&#150;04 by the Financial Services Authority under powers conferred as a result of the transfer of functions to it by the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Mutual Societies) Order 2001 (SI 2001/2617). Of these prosecutions, 16 were for failure to file returns required by s.39 Industrial and Provident Societies Act 1965, as amended by the 2001 Order and 15 were for breach of s.43 Friendly Societies Act 1974, also as amended by that Order. The prosecutions were brought for offences contrary to s.61 of the Industrial and Provident Societies Act 1965 and section 98 of the Friendly Societies Act 1974. All resulted in convictions. In 4 cases, 12-month conditional discharges were ordered and in the other 27 cases fines totalling &#163;16,675 were imposed.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50225w01.html_para5">
It has not been possible in the time available to ascertain the number of visits made in the context of each case in order to verify regulatory compliance, as visits which may be characterised in this way are made on a regular basis by staff of the Financial Services Authority. Nor has it been possible in the time available to obtain a breakdown of prosecutions by size of firm.

Figures are cumulative. This table shows marginal deduction rates for working households in receipt of income related benefits or tax credits, where at least one person works 16 hours or more a week and where higher earnings would lead to reduced benefits or tax credits. They include the marginal effects of income tax and national insurance contributions, and the withdrawal of housing benefit and council tax benefit.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50225w03.html_para1">
This analysis does not take into account the way in which the new tax credits will respond to rises in income. The new tax credits only respond to rises in income in the current year of more than &#163;2,500, disregarding the first &#163;2,500 of any rise. This means that recipients will not see their tax credits reduced as soon as their income rises, so reducing the effective marginal deduction in any one year.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50225w03.html_para2">
As a result of the Government&#039;s reforms, almost half a million fewer low-income households now face marginal deduction rates in excess of 70 per cent. than did so in April 1998. The increase in the number of households facing marginal deduction rates of between 40 and 70 per cent. is primarily due to the introduction of tax credits, and more recently the extension of support to workers aged 25 or over without children.

 The available figures show that the detection rate for domestic burglary in Northamptonshire in 2003&#150;04 was 15 per cent. Detection rate figures for individual months are not provided as they are potentially misleading. This is because many crimes are not detected in the same month that they are recorded. Detection rates are therefore estimated on the basis of those detected in that month. This tends to provide reliable estimates only for longer periods than one month, and the Home Office therefore prefers to provide figures for twelve month periods at least.

<sup>(13)</sup> No Figures for December 2004 for the number of reviews registered and successful reviews. Therefore the total will be slightly lower than the actual year.<br>

Notes:<br>

1. Figures are taken from 100 per cent. Management Information System data.<br>

2. Figures are rounded to five.<br>

3. Information from the MIS system works on a &#039;hit&#039; basis and therefore a case within a year for registration may not also be within the same year for decided or successful, therefore figures are not comparable.<br>

4. Data for unsuccessful reviews is not available, and on the basis of point 3, the number of these claims cannot be calculated from decided and successful reviews.<br>

Note:<br>

Figures for gross contributions are after account is taken of the UK&#039;s abatement and the bringing to account of surpluses and deficits in respect of member states contributions in earlier years. Since 1988, member states&#039; contributions exclude 10 per cent. collection costs (25 per cent. from March 2001) in respect of sugar and agricultural levies and customs duties payments&#151;which are deducted before contributions are made to the Community. Prior to 1988 member states made their sugar and agricultural levies and customs duties contributions available in full. The 10 per cent. collection costs were paid from the expenditure side of the Budget to member states and thus scored as receipts.<br>

Notes:<br>

1. With effect from 1988, payments to member states no longer include collection costs in respect of sugar and agricultural levies and customs duties. Since 1988 member states have retained 10 per cent. (25 per cent. from March 2001) of their levies and duties before making these contributions available to the Community.<br>

2. Information for 1986 to 1991, which has been taken from ECA reports, may not include full data on the benefit to member states from spending on administration or &quot;other institutions&quot;. Figures for 1986 to 1991 are not therefore fully comparable with those for later years.<br>

<p><a name="50225w06.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Alexander: </b> 
 In the last 12 months, there have been several visits by embassy staff to Aceh. Two members of the British embassy visited Aceh in February 2004. They held meetings with members of the Indonesian army, and with local NGOs. The Defence Attach&#233; visited Aceh as part of an EU delegation in May. On both occasions, there were restrictions on movement, due to the security situation in the province. Since the tsunami disaster on 26 December and the lifting of restrictions, there have been many visits to Aceh where movement was only restricted by the physical devastation following the earthquake and tsunami.

 We welcomed Mr Boutroue&#039;s comments on 8 February 2005 about the importance of involving the Acehnese in reconstructing their devastated province after the disaster on 26 December 2004. The Government of Indonesia has made clear that its main priority is to rebuild Aceh so that the lives of the people there who have suffered such tragic losses can be returned to normal as soon as possible, and that a political settlement to the long-running conflict is reached. With this objective in mind, the international community including the UN are in discussion with the people of Indonesia, particularly the people of Aceh, as to what help they can provide to assist in the recovery of the province.

 Corruption continues to be a problem in Uganda. In September, the UK, along with other donor partners, raised the issue directly with President Museveni.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what the outcome was of the Education and Youth Council held on 21 February 2005; what the Government&#039;s stance was on the issues discussed, including its voting record; and if she will make a statement.  [218159]</p>




<p><a name="50225w08.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </b> 
 I attended the Education and Youth Council on behalf of the United Kingdom. During the education part of the Council, we discussed the education and training aspects of the Lisbon mid-term review and adopted conclusions on the importance of education and training to Lisbon. The conclusions will be transmitted to the European Council and ask it to emphasise education and training in the Lisbon mid-term review, for example by calling on member states to have lifelong learning strategies in place by 2006 and by improving the exchange of good practice on education and training at European level. As part of the discussion, Commissioner Figel presented the Commission&#039;s communication on Lisbon and explained that it identified six key areas of work for Education Ministers; effective investment; national lifelong learning strategies; higher education; vocational training; European qualifications framework and the Youth Pact.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50225w08.html_para0">
I tabled a paper setting out the UK position and also spoke to emphasise that growth and employment should be the focus of the Lisbon strategy and that achieving the Lisbon goals depended on investing effectively in education and skills, which was strongly supported. I also highlighted the importance of a flexible labour market and suggested that while it was important for the state to pay for basic skills, employers and individuals should invest in higher level skills. I also suggested that member states should work together on reforming higher education funding, discuss the use of ICT in delivering lifelong learning and collect evidence on the links between skills and productivity.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50225w08.html_para1">
On the basis of presentations from experts, we held an exchange of views on how discussion did not lead to any conclusions but the presidency has asked the Commission to continue to look at these issues. I also tabled a paper under this item and explained that the UK was beginning to give schools more autonomy, but that school leadership was also a key element to success. I also noted, along with Italy, that we are developing an approach based on the principle of personalising the learning experience to the needs of the individual. On the issue of equal opportunities for all, I explained that financial incentives were being offered in the UK for pupils from lower income backgrounds to stay on in school after compulsory education.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50225w08.html_para2">
During the youth part of the Council, we discussed and adopted conclusions on the youth aspects of the Lisbon mid-term review. The conclusions endorse the initiative proposed by France and supported by Germany, Sweden and Spain to establish an EU Youth Pact. I tabled a UK position paper and said that I saw the Youth Pact as an opportunity to demonstrate to young people that the EU is not simply a remote bureaucracy with no impact on their lives. The Pact should work towards eliminating youth unemployment, developing young people&#039;s skills and confidence to prepare them both professionally and personally and 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>25 Feb 2005 : Column 868W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>

 The Student Loans Company only issues Notices of Default (NODs) after a few months of arrears when initial attempts at contact have failed. Therefore not all borrowers behind with payments are issued with NODs. In addition some borrowers may be issued with more than one NOD. Therefore it is not possible to calculate the number of borrowers in receipt of NODs as a percentage of the total number of borrowers in repayment status.

The Working Group&#039;s remit is to consider how Government Departments, agencies and non-departmental public bodies can best work together to ensure that the risk of homelessness is reduced and that the full range of appropriate services is available to homeless people. The strategy being developed by the Working Group, which must be affordable and deliverable, will aim to ensure that better services are delivered by using existing resources in a more joined-up way. However, the Housing Executive is currently spending almost &#163;30 million per year on temporary accommodation and other services for the homeless.

 A total of 13 staff were seconded to a variety of groups to assist local communities at no cost to the Housing Executive as the salaries were recouped from the organisations concerned. The work of many of these groups would cross constituency boundaries and could not therefore be categorised by constituency.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland how many Protestant applicants who qualified to join the Police Service of Northern Ireland have been rejected since its establishment because of the 50:50 sectarian recruitment procedures.  [214228]</p>




<p><a name="50225w14.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Pearson: </b> 
 We have been extremely encouraged by the fact that 37,957 applications have been made from across the whole community, to join PSNI as a trainee constable. As a result, large numbers have made it to the pool of suitably qualified candidates, yet failed to be appointed due to the finite number of posts available.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50225w14.html_para0">
I am advised that there have been 2,427 occasions where qualified non-Catholic applicants have been rejected from the trainee constable competitions run since the introduction of the temporary 50:50 recruitment provisions contained in the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 2000.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50225w14.html_para1">
Of these, 408 applications have been rejected as a result of the 50:50 provisions. The remaining 2,019 applications would have been rejected, irrespective of 50:50, if appointment from the pool had been on merit only.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50225w14.html_para2">
The Government fully acknowledges that 50:50 recruitment amounts to discrimination, but believes that the provisions are justified as a temporary means of rectifying an acute historical imbalance in the composition of the police service. This is clearly working, with the proportion of Catholics among regular officers rising from 8 per cent. in 2001 to 17.14 per cent. today. Our target is to increase this proportion to 30 per cent. by 2010&#150;11.

2. Figures are grossed for both coverage and missing/invalid clinical data, except for 2002&#150;03 and 2003&#150;04, which are not yet adjusted for shortfalls.<br>

3. Figures prior to 2003&#150;04 exclude NHS commissioned activity performed in the independent sector. Additional activity takes place in other care settings: in 2003&#150;04, there were 517,000 operative procedures in primary care and 2,072,000 procedures in outpatients. Equivalent outpatient figures for 2002&#150;03 are 1,735,000 procedures and 1,115,000 procedures for 2001&#150;02.<br>

 The Comptroller and Auditor General presented a report to the House on 23 November 2004 entitled &quot;Reforming NHS Dentistry: ensuring effective management of risks&quot;. This includes a review of the Personal Dental Service (PDS) system. This reported that in 1998, the Department commissioned the university of Birmingham to review the implementation of the PDS pilot scheme. The review focused on all 15 first wave pilots and five of the second wave pilots and examined developments over the first three years of operation, As the aim of each pilot was unique the review reviewed each pilot&#039;s progress against its specific objectives and did not compare relative performance.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50225w16.html_para0">
The review&#039;s key findings were that the PDS system improved access to national health service dental services and provided greater flexibility to provide NHS services. Changes in the method of payment changed the nature of professional work undertaken; the specialist pilots were successful in providing specialist dental care in a non-hospital setting; and most pilots had a key person whose enthusiasm was central to facilitating progress. There was also some evidence to suggest that dentists may initially prescribe proportionately fewer intricate dental appliances from dental laboratories under the PDS system than dentists working to the current general dental services contract. Against this, the research shows that dentists in the PDS spend more time on treating patients and this should generate more work for dental laboratories. Case studies which the NHS Modernisation Agency are carrying out on the field sites, which they are managing to develop and test new ways of working in NHS dentistry should provide further information on changes in practice.

GDS time as a percentage of GDS time and private practice time in March 2000 was 76 per cent.

We are to introduce new contractual arrangements for NHS dentistry which are intended to make NHS dentistry more attractive to dentists. One of the main changes is the replacement of the treatment based, item of service method of paying dentists with a remuneration package derived from an evidence-based assessment of patients&#039; overall oral health care needs. 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>25 Feb 2005 : Column 906W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
This will enable dentists to spend more time with their patients and reward them for giving oral health promotion advice.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will estimate the cost of implementing a policy of free eye tests for all NHS patients.  [217492]</p>




<p><a name="50225w17.html_spnew0"><b> Ms Rosie Winterton: </b> 
 Free sight tests on the national health service are already available to priority groups: children under 16, those aged 16&#150;18 in full-time education, people on low incomes who might otherwise be deterred by the cost of a private sight test and defined categories of people at particular risk of developing eye disease. In April 1999 we extended free sight tests to all people aged 60 and over.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50225w17.html_para0">
Based on the most recent data available, we estimate that the cost of extending free sight tests to all those who currently pay privately for sight tests would be an additional &#163;89 million based on the 2004&#150;05 rate of &#163;17.82 per test.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50225w17.html_para1">
We believe that the current range of entitlements to free sight tests and optical vouchers is sufficient to meet the needs of young people, people on low incomes and individuals at particular risk of developing eye disease. A further extension would not be the best use of the funds available for the development of the NHS.
