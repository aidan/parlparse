 To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what minimum <i>(a)</i> additional utilities infrastructure, <i>(b)</i> additional works to existing electricity supply infrastructure and <i>(c)</i> change in per capita consumption of electricity he expects to be required in order to enable an adequate electricity supply to be maintained when the Government have achieved its target for additional new dwellings in Mid Sussex by 2016; and what steps the Government are taking to ensure an adequate electricity supply.

<p><a name="st_1"><a name="60310w01.html_spnew1"><b> Malcolm Wicks  </b> 
<i>[holding answer 6 March 2006]:</i> This is a matter for the companies concerned, in discussion with their energy providers. However the Government recognises the importance of infrastructure as an essential element in developing sustainable communities, whether delivered by the private or public sector, and is developing several initiatives to facilitate infrastructure delivery and funding. For example consultation on a Planning Gain Supplement and a cross cutting government review of infrastructure were both announced by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor in December 2005.

<p><a name="qn_2"><a name="60310w01.html_wqn2"><b> Mr. Hands: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what steps the Government are taking to protect consumers from high gas prices; and if he will make a statement.  [57130]</p>




<p><a name="st_2"><a name="60310w01.html_spnew2"><b> Malcolm Wicks: </b> 
 A number of programmes are in place to help vulnerable consumers. In particular, the 2001 Fuel Poverty Strategy set out programmes across the UK with the target that no household in the UK should be in fuel poverty by 2018. Funding for fuel poverty programmes was increased by &#163;300 million in the Chancellor&#039;s pre-Budget report.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60310w01.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_0">The Government have no role in setting prices, and cannot direct Ofgem as to its approach to the market, which has delivered gas and electricity prices that remain below the EU 15 median price. Expenditure on energy was, on average, three per cent of household income in 2004/05. The Government are concerned that, 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>10 Mar 2006 : Column 1780W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
at a time of rising prices, all consumers take measures to minimise energy expenditure while properly heating their homes, by choosing the most appropriate supplier and tariff, using the cheapest payment method (usually direct debit), and taking energy efficiency measures.

<a name="60310w01.html_sbhd3"><h3 align=center>Geothermal Energy</h3>


<p><a name="qn_3"><a name="60310w01.html_wqn3"><b> Mr. Grogan: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what assessment he has made of the potential contribution of geothermal energy to meeting <i>(a)</i> current and <i>(b)</i> future domestic energy requirements.  [57282]</p>




<p><a name="st_3"><a name="60310w01.html_spnew3"><b> Malcolm Wicks: </b> 
 The UK Government have previously assessed the potential geothermal resource from aquifers (permeable rock formations) as part of a broader strategic evaluation of indigenous energy supplies during the 1980s. The conclusions of this work were published in 1986  <sup>1</sup> . The results revealed that the resource was limited either because surface temperatures or permeabilities were lower than expected. It is possible that this resource could be developed in the future for commercial or other applications if the resource is sufficiently promising and is in close proximity to a large heat demand.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60310w01.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_1">Between 1977 and 1994 the UK attempted to develop Hot Dry Rock technology. The development of the technology revealed a number of problems. These included the creation of a suitable reservoir, the ability to seal short circuits, and the extrapolation of rock mass characteristics to a depth where temperatures might be sufficiently high enough for electricity generation (~6km). In order to determine the relative performance of an HDR system at this depth a conceptual design for a commercial prototype was developed which provided the basis for resource/cost modelling. This conceptual design highlighted the very high unit costs of generation (~17 p/kWh at 1990 prices). In view of these difficulties it was decided to re-evaluate the costs and performance of HDR systems in combination with collaborative participation in the European programme.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60310w01.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_2">The European HDR programme is still under development and will be further evaluated through the development of a small pilot plant. Its performance will be monitored, however there is no certainty that even if successful the technology would be competitive for the UK.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60310w01.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_3">More recently interest has been growing in the use of Ground Source Heat Pumps. This technology can be applied to buildings of virtually any scale including domestic dwellings. It relies on heat exchange with the ground immediately beneath or close to buildings. There are at least 15 installations connected to commercial or public buildings in the UK, including the recently opened Welsh Assembly building.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60310w01.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_4">The UK Government have directed its efforts into promoting the technology rather than resource assessment, which could be regarded as virtually ubiquitous. Both Defra and the DTI, in collaboration with the Heat Pump Association, have helped establish a UK Heat Pump Network to develop a partnership between manufacturers, specialist advisers, and user 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>10 Mar 2006 : Column 1781W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
groups. This network will ensure that independent and authoritative advice is available on the application and use of heat pumps.

We have commissioned research into the support systems available in OECD counties. This found that most OECD countries have complex and often fragmented systems of financial support for 16 to 19-year-olds.

<i>[holding answers 2 March 2006]:</i> The Seafish Industry Authority (Seafish) has produced a report on the efficacy, costs and availability of pingers. My officials are in active discussions with the Cornish Fish Producers Organisation, Seafish and the pinger manufacturers to address the issues raised in the report and are undertaking final trials to establish the most suitable device. Further, the European Commission, responding to a paper submitted by the Irish Government, are holding a meeting of technical experts from affected member states to consider the Seafish report and others from France and Ireland which reached similar conclusions.

 Land raising, settlement and variations in density of the materials deposited, together with re-use of old areas within sites means that information is not usefully recorded in the form requested.

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_70">The National Statistician has been asked to reply to your recent Parliamentary Questions concerning the number of electoral wards in the UK which have registration levels below 80 per cent. and the 100 electoral wards which have the lowest registration levels. I am replying in her absence. (57735 & 57736)</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_71">Data for Scotland are not available, and therefore this response reflects England, Wales and Northern Ireland only. Using the most recent electoral data for which estimates of the population aged 18 and above are available in order to calculate the registration rate, the number of electoral wards with a registration rate below 80 per cent. is 257. This represents 2.7 per cent. of the 9,421 wards in the England, Wales and Northern Ireland for which electoral registration rates have been calculated. I am placing in the House of Commons library a table listing the 100 electoral wards which have the lowest registration rates in ascending order.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_72">It should be borne in mind that the percentage of the resident population who are registered to vote does not provide a reliable estimate of the registration rate of the eligible population. This is mainly because there are definitional differences between &quot;usually resident&quot; and eligibility to vote and therefore the estimated resident population aged 18 and over is not the same as the number of people eligible to vote. For example, the resident population includes all those who usually live in an area irrespective of nationality, whereas the parliamentary electorate excludes foreign nationals (but Commonwealth and Irish citizens are included) and may include some overseas electors who do not currently live in the area. Further, there is inevitably some double counting of the registered electorate. This can occur for a number of reasons. People who have more than one address, including 



<br>&nbsp;<br></ul><i>10 Mar 2006 : Column 1804W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
<ul>students, may register in more than one place. Electoral registration officers may vary in how quickly they remove people from the registers after they have moved away from an area or after they have died.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_73">For England and Wales, the closest available geography to current electoral wards, for which population estimates are available, is Census Area Statistics (CAS) wards. This geography was created for outputs from the 2001 Census and is based mainly on 2003 electoral wards.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_74">The electorate counts are on electoral ward boundaries and so it has been necessary to convert these to the CAS ward geography.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_75">The England and Wales ward registration rates have been calculated using December 2002 parliamentary electors, including attainers and the latest available ward population estimates which are for mid-2002. The parliamentary electorate has been used rather than the local government electorate, even though the latter is definitionally closer to the resident population, because the local government electorate is not available at ward level.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_76">The registration rates are based on population estimates that are subject to a margin of confidence, which is proportionately larger for ward level estimates than for local authority estimates. The CAS ward population estimates have been published with the status of &quot;experimental statistics&quot;. Therefore, the registration rates derived from them, should be treated with some care.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_77">Where there are large differences between the electorate counts and population aged 18 and over, these cases may be attributable to: definitional differences between the estimates and electoral counts; the margin of confidence in the ward estimates; the accuracy of the electoral registers; and limitations in the methodology used to convert electoral counts to the CAS ward geography.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_78">The Northern Ireland registration rates have been calculated using the December 2001 electorate (which reflects those resident and eligible to vote in October 2001), and the latest available ward population data which are from the 2001 Census, taken on 29 April 2001. The ward electorate counts include all those registered to vote in any election. These counts do not exclude foreign nationals but do include overseas electors.</p>

<sup>(7)</sup> Wards which fall within two parliamentary constituencies.<br>

Notes:<br>

1. For England and Wales the registration rates are based on December 2002 electorate counts and mid-2002 population estimates.<br>

2. For Northern Ireland the registration rates are based on December 2001 electorate counts and the 2001 Census population.<br>

3. Data for Scotland are not available.<br>

4. For England and Wales the electorate counts are not necessarily consistent with the statutory RPF 29 returns, due to the need for population estimation purposes to convert historic electorate counts on different ward geographies onto a consistent ward geography i.e. Census Area Statistics ward geography. Missing electorate data have been imputed.<br>

 A directly bookable service is one where the patient, or someone on behalf of the patient, can view and then book an appointment while in their general practitioner&#039;s (GPs) surgery, or later either on the internet or on the telephone through the choose and book appointments line. In order for services to be directly bookable, service providers, for example acute trusts, must have a patient administration system (PAS) which is compliant with the choose and book application. This means that the PAS is able to publish available slots to choose and book for the referrer, for example a GP, and patient to review.
