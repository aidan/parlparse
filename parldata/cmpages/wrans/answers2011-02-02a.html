 In response to the challenges facing bees, in 2009 DEFRA allocated £2.3 million to the Food and Environment Research Agency's National Bee Unit (NBU) to implement the first two years of the 10-year Healthy Bees Plan in partnership with the Welsh Assembly Government and others. This work is aimed at protecting and improving the health of honey bees. DEFRA also allocates funding to the NBU to control statutory diseases and pests of honey bees, to monitor colony losses and to provide advice to enable beekeepers to become more self-reliant in combating disease through improved bee husbandry; this year's allocation was £1.3 million. Over the last two years, there has been a significant reduction in the number of colonies that have been lost compared to previous years and last year's losses were the lowest since 2001.</p>

The Department for Work and Pensions forwards ESA appeals to the First-tier Tribunal-Social Security and Child Support.

 Policy on referendums rests with Elections and Democracy Division in the Cabinet Office.

Different members of the team have had involvement at various points in work on the Parliamentary Voting System and Constituencies Bill that makes provision for the referendum on the voting system for the House of Commons. In addition, other officials within the Division working on the conduct of elections have been engaged on the Bill. Given the range of responsibilities within the relevant team and wider Division, it is not possible to quantify exactly how much time officials have spent developing policy for the voting systems referendum.

 To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what the cost to the public purse was of each lord lieutenancy in England in 2009-10; and what the estimated such costs are for <i> (a)</i> 2010-11 and <i> (b)</i> 2011-12. [37362]</p>

 The Lord Lieutenancies of England are only partly funded by the public purse. The 11 Metropolitan Lieutenancies in England submit bids each year for a fixed amount of funding on the basis of an annual budget negotiated in advance between the Lieutenancy and the Cabinet Office. The 36 Shire Lieutenancies, however, are entitled to submit claims forms for certain costs to the Cabinet Office in order to be reimbursed for some of their duties.</p>

There are limits to the amounts which can be claimed for certain areas of expenditure, such as secretarial costs and car hire and driver costs.</p>

The specific role and functions performed by each Lord-Lieutenant vary widely depending on the Lieutenancy itself, the geography (i.e. physical size), population density, number of Royal visits, Lieutenancy engagements and other factors, and simple comparisons between the figures claimed by different Lieutenancies provide an inaccurate picture.</p>

 The fund, referred to by the Prime Minister in August 2010, will be used to support an overseas tourism marketing and public relations campaign to promote Britain, taking advantage of the unique opportunities afforded by the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic games and other major events, such as Her Majesty's diamond jubilee. Expenditure will therefore primarily take place abroad. Tourism businesses in all parts of the United Kingdom, including East Anglia, will benefit from the one million additional overseas visitors per year that we expect the campaign to attract. The campaign will be co-ordinated by VisitBritain in co-operation with private sector partners who have contributed to the fund.

 The Office of Fair Trading (OFT) is not aware of having received complaints in respect of this particular practice. However, it considers that no further interest should be charged on loans once it is apparent to the lender that due repayment has been made. While it is accepted that banks need time to process payments, the OFT would expect the processing time to be appropriately short in particular where the payment is being made from an account held with the same lender. The OFT would expect lenders to be transparent with borrowers about the processing time for repayments of loans in order that borrowers can take steps to submit repayment in sufficient time to avoid the imposition of further interest or charges.</p>

 The WCA is a functional assessment, which looks at what someone can do rather than basing entitlement on their diagnosis. However, in recognition of the potentially severe functional limitation caused by types of chemotherapy, these customers can be 'treated' as having limited capability for Work-Related Activity even if they do not meet the functional criteria. Chemotherapy can be associated with a range of side effects varying from mild to severe. The purpose of this policy is that those experiencing the most severe functional limitations as a result of cancer treatment are automatically entitled to enter the Support Group of ESA. We have asked Professor Harrington, as part of his second annual review of the WCA, to explore whether the current policy best reflects this intent.</p>

The Department has established a rolling programme of GP consortia pathfinders to test the different elements involved in GP-led commissioning and enable emerging GP consortia to get more rapidly involved in current commissioning decisions. A Pathfinder learning network has been established to support the development of emerging consortia and to facilitate shared learning during the transition. The shadow NHS Commissioning Board will produce and publish an analysis of the findings of the pathfinder programme and set out the lessons learned that will be applied as consortia become formally established during 2012-13.</p>

 The deprivation pupil premium for 2011-12 will be allocated to local authorities and schools with pupils that are known to be eligible for free school meals (FSM) as recorded on the January 2011 School Census, Pupil Referral Unit Census and Alternative Provision Census. Each pupil known to be eligible for free school meals will attract £430 of funding which will go to the school or academy, via the local authority or YPLA if the pupil is in a mainstream setting, or will be managed by the responsible local authority if the pupil is in a non-mainstream setting.

Following on from this exercise, DECC plan to repeal 28 regulations. The exact process for repealing these is still being explored (a suitable vehicle for repeal is being considered, and consultation with relevant parties such as the devolved Administrations needs to take place for certain policies).

 The Health and Social Care Bill takes forward the proposals contained in the White Paper "Equity and Excellence: Liberating the NHS". The Government undertook an extensive process of consultation and engagement around these proposals from July-October 2010.

<i> [holding answer 1 February 2011]:</i> The Redfern Inquiry Report makes clear that the Atomic Weapons Establishment and the Ministry of Defence's involvement in these cases is believed to have been very limited, and, in most cases, was primarily to arrange for analysis of tissue samples at the request of individual coroners. It is our view that the findings of the Inquiry are not relevant to broader policy on nuclear test veterans, as the findings relate solely to the analysis of tissue samples from up to 15 individuals compared to some 28,000 that took part in the tests. The Redfern Report does not record any of the analyses as being productive in determining the cause of death. We do not believe that there are any wider conclusions that can be drawn that would be relevant to the nuclear test veterans' situation as a group or to any individual appeals currently before the War Pensions Tribunal.</p>
