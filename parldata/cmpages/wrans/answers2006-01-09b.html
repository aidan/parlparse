 Of the 17 distinct stops on the visitor route, only St. Stephen&#039;s Hall is entirely inaccessible to wheelchair users. Wheelchair users can view the Lords Chamber from alongside the throne and from the Bar of the House, but cannot transit the Chamber due to the narrow space between the benches and the Table of the House.

 To ask the hon. Member for North Devon, representing the House of Commons Commission what assessment the Commission has made of the impact on visitor numbers to the Public Gallery in the Chamber since the erection of the security screen.  [39063]</p>




<p><a name="st_1"><a name="60109w01.html_spnew1"><b> Nick Harvey: </b> 
 There is no reason to suggest that the erection of the Chamber screen has had any impact on numbers of visitors to the Public Gallery. In the year April 2003 to March 2004 before the temporary security screen was in place there were 107,136 visitors from the public queue and 10,355 from Members&#039; allocated tickets (total 117,491). From April 2004 to March 2005 with the screen in place the corresponding figures were

111,846 from the public queue and 10,329 from Members&#039; allocations (total 122,175). I refer the hon. Member to my answer to the hon.

 To ask the Solicitor-General in which areas primary responsibility for decisions to charge for offences has been passed from the police to the Crown Prosecution Service; and what the clear-up rates for crime in <i>(a)</i> the year before and <i>(b)</i> the year after implementation of the policy were in each case.

<p><a name="st_2"><a name="60109w01.html_spmin0"><b>The Solicitor-General:</b> 
 To date, 30 areas are operating under statutory charging. The remaining 12 areas have been operating shadow charging schemes since 2003, whereby charging is operating on a non-mandatory basis, which mirrors as closely as possible statutory charging arrangements between 9 am and 5 pm Monday to Friday. These remaining areas are scheduled to move onto statutory charging by April 2006.

<p>
<a name="60109w01.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_0">The expected benefits of the charging scheme are a reduction in the rate of discontinuance, an increase in the guilty plea rate, and a reduction in the rate of attrition.

</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_10">I have provided tables below to show the number of complaints received by the Agency by clients, and by other bodies, for which information is available. It should be noted that it is difficult to use this information to make meaningful comparisons over time due to changes in the way that information has been recorded. In particular, whilst the volume of Stage 1 complaints undoubtedly rose between 2002/3 and 2003/4, this is likely to have been due in part to more rigorous recording of complaints received at the time, and the introduction by the Agency of a three tier complaints process during 2003/04.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11">The three tier complaints process comprises of; Stage 1 complaints from clients which are dealt with by the Complaints Resolution Team located within each of the Agency&#039;s six business units. Stage 2 complaints which are an escalation to the relevant Area Director when the client is not satisfied with the outcome of stage 1, and stage 3 which is an escalation to the Chief Executive if the client remains dissatisfied.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12">Complaints are also received into the Agency from MPs, or via MPs from a member of the public.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13">The outcome of whether a complaint to the Agency is upheld is not recorded. However, as described above, clients are signposted to the next level of the process should they remain dissatisfied. The table below shows the volume of cases escalated to stages two and three, for which information is available. Once these internal avenues have been exhausted, the client may wish to contact the Independent Case Examiner (ICE), their MP or, via their MP, to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration.</p>

<sup>(10)</sup> While the agency did receive stage 1 telephone complaints prior to 2002&#150;03, their volumes were not recorded, thus preventing meaningful comparison with later years.<br>

<sup>(11)</sup> Although 671 stage 1 telephone complaints were recorded between December 2002 and March 2003, their volumes were not recorded throughout the whole year, thus preventing meaningful comparison with later years.<br>

<sup>(12)</sup> While the agency did receive complaints directly to the chief executive, treat official complaints, and MP complaints to business units prior to 2000&#150;01, their volumes were not recorded, thus preventing meaningful comparison with later years.<br>

<sup>(13)</sup> During 2003&#150;04 complaints sent directly to the chief executive were not recorded separately from those complaints, which were escalated to him as part of the 3 stage process. Therefore, although 7,183 complaints in total were received during 2003&#150;04, it is not possible to separate out those complaints received by the chief executive directly (as opposed to those escalated via the complaints process), thus preventing meaningful comparison with data for earlier years.<br>

<sup>(14)</sup> In April and May of 2004, the chief executive received a total of 1,435 complaints but is not possible to separate out those complaints received by the chief executive directly, as opposed to those escalated to stage 3 of the complaints process). From June 2004-March 2005, after which time such complaints were recorded separately, the chief executive received 4,352 direct complaints and 2,549 complaints escalated upwards from stage 2. Again, these recording issues prevent meaningful comparison of this category with earlier years.<br>

<sup>(15)</sup> Treat official letters are those received by a Minister from a member of the public, and referred for initial consideration to an official of the agency.<br>

Notes:<br>

1. Percentages rounded to the nearest whole number.<br>

2. The percentages are calculated by combing information from the CSA administrative system with that from the benefits system to get current benefit status. Information from the latter system does not exist prior to 1997.<br>

3. We cannot provide information for 2003&#150;04. This is due to limitations with the new system (CS2), which mean we do not currently hold information for new scheme cases and old scheme 



cases on CS2 for that period. This is an issue we are working to address and are hopeful that we will be able to provide this information in the near future.<br>

4. The methodology used to produce these statistics is consistent with that used in the measurement of the Department&#039;s Public Service Agreement target in this area. Namely, all those cases with a child maintenance calculation or assessment where the parent with care is on income support or income based job seekers allowance (including those with a nil liability) who are in receipt of maintenance.<br>

We have introduced a number of simplification measures to reduce complexity in the housing benefit rules.

Notes:<br>

1. Expenditure figures are for Great Britain.<br>

2. Expenditure has been rounded to the nearest million pounds.<br>

3. Gross domestic product percentages have been rounded to one decimal place. A percentage less than 0.1 per cent. is indicated by the symbol *.<br>

4. Expenditure for the basic state pension, minimum income guarantee and other benefits for pensioners include a small amount of expenditure on child dependency increases which are paid with some of these entitlements.<br>

5. Disability benefits for pensioners include disability living allowance, attendance allowance and severe disablement allowance.<br>

6. For figures up to 2004&#150;05, other benefits for pensioners include additional state pension/SERPS, non-contributory retirement pension, contribution based Christmas bonus, pensions compensation board, over65&#039;s payment, over70&#039;s payment, the over 75 TV licence, widow&#039;s benefit, bereavement benefits and incapacity benefit.<br>

Incapacity benefit is only included until 2000&#150;01 as incapacity benefit was no longer paid to people over pension age after that year, following the 1995 Reforms.<br>

7. For figures from 2010&#150;11, other benefits for pensioners include additional state pension/SERPS, non-contributory retirement pension, contribution based Christmas bonus, non-contributory Christmas bonus and the over 75 TV licence.<br>

8. As per the above notes (6 and 7), the breakdown of expenditure is not on a consistent basis.<br>

Source:<br>

Expenditure and percentage of gross domestic product figures have been taken from data which underlies the 2005 pre-Budget report.<br>

<sup>(16)</sup> Individual estimates have been uprated in line with 2004&#150;05 expenditure and may differ from published values.<br>

<sup>(17)</sup> Figures expressed as percentages (percentage) give the overpayments as a percentage of the benefit paid out in the year.<br>

<sup>(18)</sup> The housing benefit estimates in this table include approximations for the purposes of producing an overall fraud and error figure. The estimates in the table will therefore be different from those published previously as National Statistics.<br>

<sup>(19)</sup> The 2004&#150;05 DLA National Benefit Review identified cases where the change in customer&#039;s needs have been so gradual that it would be unreasonable to expect them to know at which point their entitlement to DLA might have changed. These cases do not result in a recoverable overpayment as we cannot quantify or define when the customer&#039;s change occurred. Because legislation requires the Secretary of State to prove that entitlement to DLA is incorrect, rather than requiring the customer to inform us that their needs have changed, cases in this subcategory are legally correct. The difference between what claimants in these cases are receiving in DLA and related premiums in other benefits and what they would receive if their benefit was reassessed is estimated to be around &#163;0.7 billion (+/- &#163;0.2 billion). This figure is not included in the total above, but a similar figure was included in the global fraud and error figure of &#163;3 billion reported in the resource account for 2003&#150;04.<br>

<sup>(20)</sup> Official error rates have been updated with estimates from the 2003&#150;04 measurement exercise.<br>

<sup>(21)</sup> Overpayments due to knock-on effects between loss of DLA component entitlement and premiums on income-related benefits.<br>

<sup>(22)</sup> The estimated rate of fraud and error on unreviewed benefits, for which we have no reliable review information, has been set at 2.7 per cent. and divided equally among fraud, customer error and official error.<br>

Notes:<br>

1. Fraud and error on CTB has not been measured before and is assumed here to be equal to fraud and error rates on HB.<br>

2. Although quoted to the nearest &#163;0.1 billion, there are considerable uncertainties around the total estimates (95 per cent. confidence intervals of between &#177;&#163;0.2 billion and &#177;&#163;0.3 billion).<br>

3. Individual figures may not add across to total fraud and error figures due to rounding.<br>

Note:<br>

The figures for April 2003-March 2004 and October 2003-September 2004 in the above table have been adjusted for data quality problems found. Previous figures have not been adjusted in this way as there is not enough information available to do so. The tables therefore are not all suitable for making reliable comparisons over time but give a reference of our best estimate of these overpayment figures in each year. Confidence intervals are not provided in these tables although are typically around &#177;20&#150;30 per cent. of the central estimates.<br>

Notes:<br>

1. These figures will not include all overpayments in HB through official error. They were published in the latest National Statistics report for HB fraud and error, and only cover the 85 per cent. of HB expenditure that is within the scope of the HBR sample. In these reports, there was an extra category of error labelled &quot;non-residence&quot; error, an unknown amount of which will be due to mistakes made by officials&#151;these overpayments are not included in the figures in this table.<br>

2. The Second National Housing Benefit Accuracy Review, in 1997&#150;98 gave an estimate of &#163;60 million for official error, but was based on a different methodology, so the results are not considered comparable with more recent estimates.<br>

1. These estimates are subject to wide margins of error. Our best estimate of STB overpayments for 2004&#150;05 includes a further amount of around &#163;20 million due to incorrectness types not captured under methodology in earlier years.<br>

Notes:<br>

1. The sample for long-term benefits is a small one and excludes some types of cases. It provides reassurance that official error on these benefits is a very low proportion of expenditure, but the estimate is only a broad indicator.<br>

2. As a result of the wide margins of error, the changes over time are not statistically significant.<br>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what measures he is taking to remove the barriers to work for people with caring responsibilities.  [27007]</p>




<p><a name="st_133"><a name="60109w14.html_spnew3"><b> Mrs. McGuire: </b> 
 In the National Strategy for Carers, &#039;Caring About Carers&#039;, published in February 1999, the Government set out its commitment to encourage and enable carers of working age to remain in work and to help those carers who are unable, or do not want, to combine paid work with caring to return to work when their caring responsibilities cease or diminish. Many people providing informal care already do paid work as well.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60109w14.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_155">From April 2004, Work Focussed Interviews (WFIs) have been introduced for partners of benefit customers in Jobcentre Plus areas. Although partners who are full-time carers with entitlement to carer&#039;s allowance are exempt from WFIs, they are however entitled to help and support, including through new deal for partners, on a voluntary basis.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60109w14.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_156">Carers who are in receipt of carer&#039;s allowance can work and earn up to &#163;82 per week. This amount is calculated net of expenses such as income tax, some national insurance contributions, and half of any contribution towards an occupational or personal pension. Help can also be given with the cost of care of the disabled person when the carer is at work, provided that the substitute carer is not a close relative of either the carer or the disabled person. The amount allowable is 50 per cent. of the net earnings after deduction of the other allowable expenses. Therefore, it is possible for a carer to earn well in excess of &#163;82 and still remain eligible for carer&#039;s allowance.

Decision notices issued when entitlement is established and annual award notices issued when benefit rates change include written reminders of the need for customers to notify changes of address. In addition to this when it is known that an address is out of date various steps are taken depending upon the benefit in payment, for example in jobseekers allowance the customer is seen on a regular basis where correct address details are confirmed. Disability & Carers Service would contact such people as carers, health care professionals involved in the case etc to confirm address details. In other areas checks would be made with local authorities where housing benefit and council tax benefit are in payment.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60109w17.html_para9">
<a name="stpa_188">If an address could not be traced banks would be contacted to suspend payments and data matching takes place with organisations such as Royal Mail redirect. Details of changes in addresses notified to one part of my Department are shared with other Agencies within the Department through cross-benefit computer systems. These systems also receive address data from Her Majesty&#039;s Revenue and Customs where many customers who are in receipt of child benefit, child tax credits and new tax credits are also customers of my Department.

2. Information for percentages of people from this group still claiming jobseeker&#039;s allowance (JSA) is given to June 2005 as this is the latest benefit information available and gives a more accurate reflection of people still claiming JSA.<br>

3. Information is only for those who were claiming JSA when they started new deal 50 plus. It is possible to join new deal 50 plus and not be claiming JSA.<br>

4. Percentage moving into work consists of people recorded as gaining a job through new deal 50 plus and may include people claiming a benefit other than income support or incapacity benefit.<br>

5. Percentage moving into work and onto income support and /or incapacity benefit consists of people who are recorded as gaining a job through new deal 50 plus who are also recorded as having a new claim for income support or incapacity benefit after starting the programme. The income support/incapacity benefit claim may have occurred before, during, or after their job.<br>

6. People recorded as not going into work or claiming income support or incapacity benefit could still be participating on new deal 50 plus.<br>

7. The percentage claiming JSA at the end of June 2005 may include people who also went into work or claimed income support or incapacity benefit between joining the programme and June 2005.<br>

8. Jobs figures are rounded to the nearest 10.<br>

9. Individual percentages may not sum exactly to 100 per cent. due to rounding.<br>

3. Pension Credit (PC) replaced Minimum Income Guarantee (MIG) on 6 October 2003. Existing MIG recipients were automatically converted onto Pension Credit on that date (assuming they still met the eligibility criteria).<br>

4. Data from the Generalised Matching Service (GMS) 100 percent scan taken on 16 September 2005. The figures have been rated up to give month-end estimates.<br>

5. These figures are early estimates. Operational processing times mean that a number of claim commencements and terminations are not reflected in the figures. The final figures incorporated within the Work and Pensions Longitudinal Study (WPLS) will take account of such cases.<br>

6. Couples may contain a number of partners who are less than the age of 60.<br>

 It is a matter of record that the policy of both this and previous Governments has been to exclude most, but not all, full-time students from entitlement to housing benefit; since 1990 financial support for those students opting to study full-time has been seen as the responsibility of the education system, rather than the benefit system.

<p><a name="st_5"><a name="60109w25.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Byrne: </b> 
 The National Health Service Act 1977 places a duty on the Secretary of State to provide a range of facilities and services to such extent as she considers necessary to meet reasonable requirements. The Secretary of State discharges her duties through delegation to local primary care trusts who can contract with national health service trusts, NHS foundation trusts and other healthcare providers for those services. Should an NHS organisation wish to make a significant change or variation to a service then they are required to consult with local stakeholders including the overview and scrutiny committee before reaching a final decision. In addition, the core services of NHS foundation trusts are protected when they achieve foundation status and these services can only be changed if the regulator is satisfied that any changes are in the interests of the NHS. As medical knowledge advances and new ways of working are developed it is inevitable over time that there will be changes in the location of particular services in the interests of patients.

 It is for national health service trusts to assess and manage the number of critical care beds depending on local needs.

Notes:<br>

1. The dentists include principals, assistants and trainees. Prison contracts are excluded from the data.<br>

2. The postcode of the Dental Practice was used to allocate dentists to specific geographic areas. Primary care trust areas have been defined using the Office of National Statistics All Fields Postcode Directory.<br>

3. England 2005 data per population has been calculated using 2004 population data, as this is the most up-to-date available.<br>

4. PCT data per population for 1997 to 2000 has been calculated using 2001 population figures as this is the earliest date at which population data at this area is available.<br>

5. PCT data per population for 2004 and 2005 have been calculated using 2003 population data, as this is the most up-to-date available at this area.<br>

6. Data includes all notifications, received by the Dental Practice Board, up to 2 November 2005 for England and 19 October 2005 for the PCT. Figures for the numbers of dentists at specified dates may vary depending upon the notification period, e.g. data with a later notification period will include more recent notifications of dentists joining or leaving the GDS or PDS.<br>

<p><a name="st_28"><a name="60109w27.html_spnew4"><b> Ms Rosie Winterton: </b> 
 Each primary care trust (PCT) has access to the services of a consultant in dental public health, who provides advice on local oral health and the geographical areas that should be a priority for action. The British Association for the Study of Community Dentistry surveys provide information on the numbers of decayed missing and filled teeth by PCT area.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60109w27.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_16">A PCT&#039;s ability to respond to local oral health needs will be substantially strengthened by the introduction of local commissioning of primary care dental services from April 2006. PCTs will hold a local budget for dental services. When a dentist leaves the area or reduces his or her national health service commitment, the resources return to the PCT. It is at their discretion to redeploy these resources locally and to agree where new practices are established. This gives the PCT the ability to reflect the oral health needs of their local population in the distribution of NHS primary care dental services.

Notes:<br>

1. Complete leaver means the dentist had an open GDS or PDS contract in September of the previous year but no GDS or PDS contract in September of the specified year.<br>

2. Percentages are calculated on the number of dentists with an open GDS or PDS contract as at 30 September in the specified year.<br>

3. The dentist numbers include principals, assistants and trainees. Prison contracts are excluded.<br>

4. A dentist may have a contract in more than one Strategic Health Authority area. Therefore, data at Strategic Health Authority area may include duplications of dentists leaving.<br>

England data excludes duplication.<br>

5. The postcode of the Dental Practice was used to allocate dentists to specific geographic areas. Strategic health authority areas have been defined using the Office of National Statistics All Fields Postcode Directory.<br>

6. The numbers of leavers include all notifications, received by the Dental Practice Board, up to 8 November 2005.<br>

<i>[holding answer 15 December 2005]:</i> Patients receiving specialist palliative care are excluded from the system of charging for delays in discharge. In addition, many patients who have rapidly deteriorating conditions or who do not have long to live will continue to be the national health service&#039;s responsibility and as such will not trigger any payment from social services. The NHS is responsible for ensuring the patient is safe to discharge, however, some patients will have a strong preference to return home to die. If they, or their carer, need a care package, including services from social services which is not in place by their discharge date, social services will be potentially liable for a charge.

The Department has also ordered an additional 800,000 doses of vaccine for distribution to any GPs that run out. These additional stocks will arrive in January 2006.

 We have made a commitment that all national health service trusts should be in a position to apply for national health service foundation trust (NHSFT) status by 2008. To assist in that process we are rolling out a national programme to assess the readiness of all acute trusts for NHSFT status, in the context of their wider health communities. This whole health community diagnostic project will see trusts developing action plans with their strategic health authorities which set out any challenges or performance issues they need to overcome to become authorised as an NHSFT, as

<p><a name="st_118"><a name="60109w36.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Byrne </b> 
<i>[holding answer 21 November 2005]:</i> Following the recommendation of the Healthcare Commission, the Secretary of State placed two organisations on special measures (Mid Yorkshire Hospitals National Health Service Trust and North West London Hospitals NHS Trust). The Department works with these trusts, the strategic health authorities (SHAs) and the primary care trusts to improve performance. The recommendations of the Healthcare Commission include both service quality improvements and delivering financial balance.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60109w36.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_73">It is the responsibility of SHAs to deliver both overall financial balance for their local health communities and to ensure each and every body achieves financial balance. The Department works with SHAs to support them in this task. As part of this support, I have recently announced the formation of finance turnaround teams. These teams will be initially working with 63 NHS organisations. The teams will work with the chief executives of the organisations in delivering the key targets and financial stability. The chief executives will remain responsible for delivery in their organisations.

<p><a name="st_119"><a name="60109w36.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Byrne </b> 
<i>[holding answer 20 December 2005]:</i> All national health service organisations have minimum standards of quality they must deliver, including meeting the targets for maximum waiting times. These are dramatically better than the standards of the NHS in the past and there can be no trade-off between these quality standards and removing deficits. All areas of the country have seen dramatic improvements in services, and all areas of the country will continue to see improvements as additional investment is made. Progress in a particular hospital or service has to be achieved within what is affordable, otherwise the local NHS would be spending other people&#039;s money to deliver an improved service which would be unfair to the other parts of the country.

Cases of established osteoporosis can be treated both to prevent further fractures and to improve an individual&#039;s quality of life. All treatment of osteoporosis can be regarded as secondary prevention. Much of this can be managed in primary care, even in cases of advanced disease.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health what methods of restraint are approved for use on children in <i>(a)</i> hospitals and <i>(b)</i> secure hospitals.  [37575]</p>




<p><a name="st_155"><a name="60109w39.html_spnew7"><b> Mr. Byrne: </b> 
 Guidance on the use of restraint is set out in the Mental Health Act Code of Practice, paragraphs 19.6 to 19.15. This states that restraint by physical means should take place only as a last resort and never as a matter of course. In addition the guidance states that any restraint used should be reasonable in the circumstance; apply the minimum force necessary to prevent harm to the patient or others; be used for only as long as is necessary; and be sensitive to gender and race issues. The advice applies in all healthcare settings and to all age ranges. Trusts should regularly audit their physical restraint procedures consistent with the framework of clinical governance and safeguarding children arrangements.

<i>[holding answer 2 December 2005]:</i> There are no proposals or plans to give strategic health authorities (SHAs) additional powers to intervene in the running or plans of primary care trusts (PCTs) as a result of the reconfiguration exercise or to insist that PCTs outsource or market test services.

<a name="stpa_124">SHAs do not have the power to remove the chief executives and board members of PCTs and there are no plans to change this situation. Under Section 13 of the Health and Social Care Act 2001 the Secretary of State can make an intervention order if she is not satisfied that an national health service body is performing one of more of its functions adequately.

<p><a name="st_166"><a name="60109w41.html_spnew6"><b> Mr. Byrne: </b> 
 The Department collects expenditure information on non national health service staff for local NHS organisations including strategic health authorities (SHAs). Non-NHS staff expenditure figures include all agency staff and any other staff not directly employed by these bodies. Information relating to spend for the relevant staff groups in each SHA in England from 2002&#150;03, when these were established is shown in the tables. Information relating to the costs of temporary managers is not collected centrally.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60109w41.html_para11">
<a name="stpa_125">The rise in agency staff spend over the years covered in the tables has tracked the rise in established posts over the period. Data for 2004&#150;05 has not yet been verified but it suggests that expenditure in agency staff in the NHS has dropped significantly.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60109w41.html_para12">
<a name="stpa_126">Reducing agency spend is part of the Department&#039;s contribution to the &#163;6.5 billion Gershon efficiency target and the 10 human resource high impact changes as highlighted in, &quot;A workforce response to local delivery plans: a challenge for NHS Boards&quot;.

These are all areas in which DFID is actively engaged. For example, DFID will provide &#163;21 million to the African Union&#151;New Partnership for Africa&#039;s Development (AU-NEPAD) Investment Climate Facility which will help improve the environment for the private sector. DFID also acts to help ensure growth benefits the poorest&#151;such as helping to increase the productivity of agriculture and creating jobs in non-agricultural labour markets.

<a name="stpa_206">DFID is also working to halve the number of people facing hunger in Africa by 2015. This often means providing humanitarian support for the effects of drought. During 2005 for example, DFID provided &#163;64 million humanitarian relief to southern Africa alone.

<a name="60109w52.html_para2">
While continuing to respond promptly to crises, we are working to tackle chronic hunger more effectively. Poverty is an important factor. When large numbers of people live below the poverty line, even the smallest of shocks can lead to destitution and hunger. DFID is aiming to help countries that suffer from chronic hunger to establish safety nets to protect the most vulnerable from hunger (such as the elderly or orphans) and stop others falling into destitution as a result of shocks like drought or illness.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60109w52.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_207">For example, in Ethiopia we are giving &#163;70 million over three years to support a programme which aims to provide people with predictable and regular transfers of cash and food. This helps meet food gaps while also allowing households to invest in health, education or increase their farm production. In this way, safety nets can also serve as a springboard for poor households which can otherwise struggle to participate in economic growth. We aim to scale up this approach in Zambia, Kenya, Malawi and Lesotho over 2006.

 Despite the modest progress made at the World Trade Organisation (WTO) talks in Hong Kong, it is not possible at this stage to give any meaningful estimate of the numbers of people that could be lifted out of poverty as a result for two broad reasons. First, 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>9 Jan 2006 : Column 215W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
the nature of the agreement reached in Hong Kong, and second because the ministerial conference was just a staging post along the way to conclusion of the Doha Round of talks as a whole. For example, although Ministers agreed that developed countries would give duty and quota free access to their markets for the least developed countries (LDC), there is some flexibility to exclude 3 per cent. of tariff lines during a transition period of indeterminate length. The risk is that developed countries will apply them to precisely those products where the poorest countries have the best chance to export.

 The average time to close a Data Protection case between 1 April and 30 November 2005 was 50 days. The average time to close a Freedom of Information case in the same period was 96 days. The Information Commissioner has analysed his current workload and concluded that the high volume of FOI appeals that he is processing at present are a result of the initial influx of requests that public authorities experienced in the first few months of FOI implementation.

 The Memorandum of Understanding and Supplementary Agreements (Cm 5240) allows for the Joint Ministerial Committee (JMC) to meet in various &quot;functional&quot; formats to discuss specific policy areas. At present, the JMC exists in four such formats: Health, Poverty, Knowledge Economy and Europe. Of these four, the JMC on Europe meets most regularly. As described in the Memorandum of Understanding the Secretariat to these Committees is provided by the UK Cabinet Office and the devolved administrations, although in practice the Secretariat to the JMCs on Health, Poverty and Knowledge Economy is provided by my department. There is no specific group of civil servants assigned to the Secretariat; instead staff from appropriate areas service the Committees as necessary.
