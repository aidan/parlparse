To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will list the names of external consultants indicating the fees agreed in each case and nature of studies undertaken since 2 May 1997.  [74745]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90316w01.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Spellar </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 4 March 1999]:</i> Full details of consultancy engagements since 1 May 1997 could be provided only at disproportionate cost. However, I can confirm that, in financial year 1997-98, the total expenditure on external consultancy by the MOD was &#163;148.1 million involving more than 3,000 separate consultancy appointments and, in the first half of this financial year, &#163;62.8 million involving over 1,000 appointments. Details of this expenditure is placed in the Library of the House annually.
<P>

<a name="90316w01.htm_para1">The work undertaken by external consultants since May 1997 has included specialist input to procurement programmes and support to a number of Department efficiency initiatives, including market testing, the introduction of Resource Accounting and Budgeting, the review of the Department's UK estate and the development and implementation of SMART procurement.

<P>
<UL>(2) how many sites owned by his Department hold more than 10 hectares of lowland heathland; how many of these sites are notified as sites of special scientific interest; and how many have management plans with specific targets for the maintenance and re-creation of lowland heathland agreed with the statutory nature conservation agencies;  [76494]

<P>
(4) what sums his Department has allocated to bring lowland heathland habitats on its land into favourable nature conservation condition since May 1997;  [76498]
<P>
(5) how much of the target for the re-establishment of lowland heathland in the United Kingdom that was published in 1995 in the United Kingdom Biodiversity Steering Group report his Department has achieved on its land to date; and how much it is planning to achieve on its land by the year 2005;  [76496]
<P>
(6) what assessment he has made of the nature conservation condition of heathlands owned by his Department; how many of these sites were considered to be in favourable condition; and how many were in an unfavourable condition at the last assessment.  [76497]<P></UL>

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will make it the policy of Her Majesty's Government to support the Optional Protocol to the UN Convention on Human Rights to raise the age of recruitment to the armed forces to the age of 18 years.  [74308]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90316w01.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson: </B> 
 The UK has played, and will continue to play, a full and active part in negotiations on the Optional Protocol to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. We consider our current recruiting and deployment policies to be in line with the principles that are being sought internationally. We recruit only volunteers into the Armed Forces, and then only with the written consent of parents/guardians in the case of personnel aged under 18. The Services provide young people with a rewarding and challenging career, together with the opportunity to develop skills and civilian recognised qualifications in a wide range of trades and occupations.

<P>
<a name="90316w01.htm_wqn5"><B> Mr. Cousins: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if the Memorandum of Understanding signed in November 1991 by the British and Indonesian Governments is still in force; when it was last revised; and what assessment he has made of the benefits the Memorandum of Understanding has resulted in for British Governments.  [76114]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90316w01.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The MOU signed by the MOD with the Government of the Republic of Indonesia in 1991 made provision for UK MOD support to the sale to the Indonesia Navy of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary Green Rover. All arrangements provided for under the terms of the MOU have now been completed and the MOU is, to all intents and purposes, no longer in force. I understand that the MOU has achieved its aim of ensuring the efficient conduct of business over this sale.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90316w01.htm_spnew7"><B> Mr. Spellar </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 15 March 1999]:</i> HMS Vengeance is due to start Contractor's Sea Trials later in the year. The exact date is classified for reasons 



<P>
<P><I>16 Mar 1999 : Column: 572</I><P>
of physical security. The currently planned date is later than the original, due to the need to replace components found to be defective during system testing at the shipbuilding. The components have now been changed and the submarine's systems are performing well.

 I refer the right hon. Member to my written answer on 30 November 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>67</i>, to my hon. Friend the Member for Swansea, East (Mr. Anderson), which set out the interim response of the Government to the Review of the Crown Prosecution Service. On that day I placed in the Library of the House a chart setting out the position in relation to each recommendation.
<P>

<a name="90316w02.htm_para0">The Crown Prosecution Service and other Departments with responsibility for criminal justice matters have continued work on consideration and implementation of the Report. The most significant recent steps have been the appointment by the Director of Public Prosecutions of Chief Crown Prosecutors and Area Business Managers for each of the proposed 42 areas of the Crown Prosecution Service, which will come into being in April 1999. As I told the House on 30 November 1998, I expect to put a full response to the Review of the CPS before the House by the end of June.

<P>
<a name="90316w02.htm_wqn2"><B> Mr. Dalyell: </B> 
To ask the Prime Minister, pursuant to his letter to the hon. Member for Linlithgow of 9 March, if he will examine the UN's procedures in relation to the distribution of medical goods to meet humanitarian needs which have arrived in Iraq since the end of 1996; and what assessment he has made of the memorandum from the Under Secretary of the Iraqi Foreign Office on this subject, a copy of which has been sent to him.  [76781]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90316w02.htm_spmin2"><B>The Prime Minister</B> 
 <i>[holding answer 15 March 1999]:</i> According to the terms of the Memorandum of Understanding between the Government of Iraq and the United Nations on implementation of the "oil for food" programme, it is Iraq, not the UN, which is responsible for the distribution of medical supplies in central and southern Iraq. Iraq's record on distribution is woeful. According to the UN Secretary General's latest report of 22 February on the implementation of "oil for food", over half the medicines and medical supplies which have arrived in Iraq since the start of the "oil for food" programme have accumulated in warehouses. These supplies are worth over $275 million. The Secretary General also noted that the quantity of medical equipment in warehouses was "alarmingly high".
<P>

<a name="90316w02.htm_para1">This issue is one which will no doubt be considered by the panel established by the UN Security Council on 30 January to assess the humanitarian situation in Iraq. We would support proposals from the panel to increase the role of the UN in distributing medical supplies in central and southern Iraq in the interest of getting these supplies to the Iraqi people.
<P>

<a name="90316w02.htm_para2">It should be noted that in the northern governorates, where distribution is carried out by UN agencies, no problems in the distribution of medical goods were noted in the Secretary General's report.
<P>

<a name="90316w02.htm_para3">The Iraqi Memorandum is an unconvincing attempt by Iraq to divert responsibility for the distribution problems in the centre and south onto others.

<a name="90316w02.htm_sbhd5"><H4><center>Leaded Petrol</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="90316w02.htm_wqn5"><B> Mr. Maclean: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions, pursuant to his answer of 27 January 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, columns <i>253-54</i>, on leaded petrol, what estimate his Department has made of the costs of the <i>(a)</i> engine adjustments and <i>(b)</i> lead replacement petrol to motorists.  [72327]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90316w02.htm_spnew0"><B> Dr. Reid: </B> 
 Lead replacement petrol is expected to become widely available by the end of this year, enabling those motorists that currently use leaded petrol--estimated at approximately 5.3 million--to switch seamlessly to this fuel without any engine adjustments and, hence, no additional associated costs.
<P>

<a name="90316w02.htm_para5">Indeed, of these 5.3 million motorists, it is estimated that some 0.7 million could make immediate savings on their fuel bills by switching to ordinary premium unleaded petrol now. A further 2.3 million could do so with timing adjustments to their engines costing in the order of &#163;50.
<P>

<a name="90316w02.htm_para6">The remaining 2.3 million vehicles will need lead replacement petrol or, alternatively, separate additives to provide lubrication to critical engine parts. However, most of these vehicles can have engine modifications that would permit them also to save on running costs by using premium unleaded petrol. Such modifications, which are typically &#163;200-&#163;400 for a small family car, but higher for more sophisticated or specialist vehicles, would be offset by subsequent savings on running costs.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90316w02.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 We do not expect a new statutory right of access on foot to have a significant impact generally on the scientific interest of the land concerned.

Such land may include areas notified as Sites of Special Scientific Interest.

[76280]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90316w02.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The Government's proposal for a new statutory of access to open countryside will apply to mountain, moor, heath, down and registered common land. Provision will be made for the Ministry of Defence to continue to close land, or otherwise restrict access, where necessary, in the interests of defence. Provision will also be made to close land, or otherwise restrict access, on grounds of conservation, land management and health and safety. The new right of access will not apply to developed land or to agricultural land other than that used for extensive grazing.
<P>

<a name="90316w02.htm_para7">An economic appraisal study for the Government by independent consultants supports the view that the economic impact on property prices is likely to be limited.

 My Department funds the Home Energy Efficiency Scheme and a wide range of programmes which are run by the Energy Saving Trust to improve energy efficiency in the home. The Trust has introduced three new schemes since 1 May 1997. They are schemes to promote the development of energy services, encourage the installation of small scale Combined Heat and Power in residential premises and promote the installation of energy efficient boilers and heating controls. In addition a large number of schemes is run by others, including local authorities and electricity suppliers.

<a name="90316w05.htm_para2">Council Conclusions were adopted on the Commissions negotiations with Japanese and Korean car manufacturers, which seek to secure an equivalent voluntary agreement to that reached with ACEA last October. This is part of the EU Strategy on reducing carbon dioxide emissions from cars. The Conclusions impress on the Commission to conclude their negotiations by May and report back to the Council by June.
<P>

<a name="90316w05.htm_para3">First Ministerial debates were also held on two other dossiers. The first, on a proposal to amend the Directive limiting emissions of certain pollutants into the air from large combustion plants, is an integral part of the Commission's Acidification Strategy. It will reduce emissions of sulphur dioxide and nitrogen dioxides, both of which can potentially cause acidification and health problems. During discussions on whether the directive should cover existing plants emissions, I argued that these were better covered by the current IPPC directive and National Emissions Ceilings Directive being developed by the Commission. The second debate was held on a proposal that would allow voluntary participation by organisations in a Community eco-management and audit scheme. Both of these proposals will return to the Council in June, along with a proposal for a directive on the incineration of waste. At this Council the Commission reported on the progress of negotiations in working group of this dossier.
<P>

<a name="90316w05.htm_para4">I welcomed the Presidency announcement on its plans to reach a common position at the June Council on the proposal for a revision to the 90-220 Directive controlling the release and marketing of genetically modified organisms. In addition, Council Conclusions were agreed that reflect on the suspension of discussions on the biosafety protocol in Cartegena last month, and agree that a strategy be developed with a view to completing the negotiations.

We have also collaborated with the Institution of Highways and Transportation to produce "Guidelines for Cycle Audit and Cycle Review".

<P>
<a name="90316w05.htm_spnew6"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 It is, in the first instance, for individual landowners and their advisers to decide what insurance, including public liability insurance, is most appropriate for their needs. The Government have made clear that the liability owed by landowners to people exercising a new statutory right of access will be limited to that owed to trespassers.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90316w05.htm_spnew7"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The Government do not expect a new statutory right of access on foot to open countryside to have a significant impact on public insurance costs for landowners. An economic appraisal study for the Government by independent consultants suggests that any increase in the public liability insurance premium will be small.

In addition, we are currently examining the scope for further public private partnerships for trunk road maintenance.

 Local highway authorities in England (outside London) need to submit their provisional local transport plans (LTPs) to the Department by 31 July. Full LTPs are to be submitted by 31 July 2000. Publication is a matter for the local authorities, but we expect LTPs to be readily available locally.
<P>

<a name="90316w06.htm_para0">We believe there would be advantages in making LTPs statutory and propose to legislate in due course. However, LTPs can be implemented on an administrative basis, which will provide an opportunity to test the system and identify the necessary requirements of any subsequent legislation.

Current rates were set in 1997, when charges were reduced by an average of 4.6 per cent., following four years of stability. The ability to maintain light dues at current levels is an indication of the General Lighthouse Authorities' continuing efforts to achieve greater efficiency.

 The 30-year-rule established by section 5(1) of the Public Records Act 1958, as amended by the Public Records Act 1967, generally applies. However, the Lord Chancellor may give his approval for records more than 30 years old to be retained by the Security Service under section 3(4) of the 1958 Act if they are required for administrative purposes or ought to be retained for any other special reason. In the case of Security Service records, the special reason may be that the records in question contain highly sensitive information relating to national security.

<a name="90316w06.htm_spnew9"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The 1996 Victim's Charter places responsibility on the police for keeping victims informed about significant developments in their case. Pilot projects to establish best ways of doing this were set up later that year. Interim findings of an evaluation managed by the Home Office Research and Statistics Directorate and carried out by Bristol University were published late last year, and drawn to criminal justice agencies' attention in Home Office Circular 55/1998 issued on 23 December 1998. This also reminded the police, and other agencies, of their responsibilities for keeping victims informed. 



<P>
<P><I>16 Mar 1999 : Column: 590</I><P>
A final evaluation report and recommendations are expected later this year, after which it is hoped good practice guidelines can be issued.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90316w07.htm_wqn0"><B> Mr. Maclean: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many youth offender teams have been established; at what cost; and what plans he has to monitor their effectiveness.  [77019]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90316w07.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 Youth offending teams under section 39 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 have been established in 10 areas, by 16 local authorities working in partnership with the police, probation service and health authorities. These areas are piloting the teams, together with new powers for the police and the courts under the 1998 Act, ahead of national implementation. The Government expect all areas of England and Wales to have youth offending teams in place by April 2000, when it intends to implement section 39 nationwide.
<P>

<a name="90316w07.htm_para0">The Youth Justice Board for England and Wales, established under section 41 of the 1998 Act, is monitoring progress in all areas in preparing for national implementation of the Act's provisions for youth offending teams and other new youth justice measures and will monitor the effectiveness of the new teams in reducing youth offending. The Board is aware that youth offending teams have so far been substantially established on a non-statutory basis in around 35 local authority areas to undertake existing work with young offenders.
<P>

<a name="90316w07.htm_para1">The pilots will help the Government better to assess the costs and savings associated with the new youth justice measures. The Government are expecting local authorities and their partner agencies to put in place the basic structure of youth offending teams within existing resources, reflecting the work which staff within those agencies should already be undertaking with young offenders and those at risk of offending. Where local areas are being expected to deliver new services under the 1998 Act, the Government recognise that extra resources may be needed. These were estimated in the Financial Memorandum to the Crime and Disorder Bill and these estimates are now being tested through the pilots.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many <i>(a)</i> local child curfew schemes, <i>(b)</i> parenting orders and <i>(c)</i> anti-social behaviour orders have been made under the Crime and Disorder Act 1998.  [77016]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90316w07.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The power to impose a local child curfew is a permissive one. The decision as to whether or not a local child curfew is appropriate will be one which must be made by a local authority following appropriate local discussion.
<P>

<a name="90316w07.htm_para2">The relevant provisions of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 were brought into force on 30 September 1998. Before imposing a local child curfew, local authorities, in consultation with the chief officer of police and such other persons or bodies that they consider appropriate, must first draw up proposals for a local child curfew scheme, 



<P>
<P><I>16 Mar 1999 : Column: 591</I><P>
including arrangements for consultation with the residents in the area in which the curfew is to apply, and submit these to the Home Secretary for approval.
<P>

<a name="90316w07.htm_para3">No applications for local child curfew schemes have been received at this stage. Such schemes are designed to be part of an integrated response to reducing crime and disorder in local areas. In considering their potential use, local authorities will wish to take into account the wider crime and disorder reduction strategies, also required under the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, which are currently being developed.
<P>

<a name="90316w07.htm_para4">Parenting orders have been available since 30 September 1998 in the nine areas which form the greater part of the youth justice pilot exercise. By the end of January 1999, courts in these nine pilot areas had made 12 parenting orders.
<P>

<a name="90316w07.htm_para5">Although the parenting order will be available in several different court arenas, that is, the family proceedings court, a civil magistrates court and all criminal courts, the order has been introduced gradually throughout the youth justice pilot areas. This has been done partly to allow pilot areas to focus initially on the need to establish and operate satisfactorily the new youth offending teams across the full range of existing and new work with juvenile offenders. Also, to see how the parenting order will operate alongside Children Act 1989 based work with children and families in need and to put in place provision for counselling and guidance sessions required under the parenting order.
<P>

<a name="90316w07.htm_para6">The provisions in the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 in relation to anti-social behaviour order do not come into force until 1 April 1999.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90316w07.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 These offences came into force on 30 September 1998. Provisional data for the last quarter of 1998 from the Home Office Court Proceedings database should be available in June with provisional data for each quarter of 1999 becoming available at three monthly intervals thereafter.

 The Home Office is committed to monitoring the effectiveness of the sentences imposed by the courts, including their effect on reconviction. It does this through the regular collection of statistics and ad hoc research. All major new initiatives in the field of sentencing policy, as in other areas of criminal justice activity, are accompanied by measures to monitor their effectiveness. In addition, three sentencing projects are being funded under the crime reduction programme. These are in the areas of fine enforcement, restorative justice and the information available to sentencers and are aimed at improving the cost-effectiveness of sentencing.

 <i>[holding answer 12 March 1999]:</i> A working group operating under the European Union Justice and Home Affairs Council is currently considering a draft Convention on Mutual Legal Assistance which contains proposals for co-operation on the interception of telecommunications. The text of the draft Convention does not distinguish between the kinds of telecommunications mentioned in the Question. The German Presidency has also proposed a draft Council Resolution on the lawful interception of new technologies such as the Internet and satellite communications. The latest texts of these proposals have been submitted to the European Scrutiny Committees for their consideration. Copies are in the Library. This matter has been discussed at formal meetings of the Justice and Home Affairs Council, in which I and other Home Office Ministers have participated, and informally with other European Union Interior Ministers.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry under what circumstances <i>(a)</i> designs and <i>(b)</i> designs backed up by training or implementation services, require an export licence.  [76123]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90316w08.htm_spnew2"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 Specified exports of technology, including designs, are subject to control under various entries in the Export of Goods (Control) Order 1994, the Dual-Use and Related Goods (Export Control) Regulations 1996, and Council Decision 94/942/CFSP, and the controls apply irrespective of whether or not the technology is linked to the provision of training on its use or implementation.
<P>

<a name="90316w08.htm_para1">At present, as noted in the White Paper on Strategic Export Controls, published in July 1998, HMG can control only tangible exports, which means that export licences are currently required for controlled technology only when this is exported in physical form e.g. on paper or computer disc. However, the White Paper contained a proposal to provide HMG with the power to control the transfer of technology, whatever the means of transfer, and proposals for the use of that power.

<P>
<a name="90316w08.htm_spnew3"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The total number of persons recorded as requiring treatment at hospital casualty departments in Great Britain during the 1998 firework season was 831. This represents a reduction of over 8 per cent. on the previous year's total. Within the overall reduction, there was a 36 per cent. fall in injuries caused by sparklers. My Department's firework safety campaign highlighted the risk of injury from sparklers and I am particularly pleased that this message has been heeded.
<P>

<a name="90316w08.htm_para2">The number of serious injuries fell from 71 in 1997 to 46 last year. Figures also reveal a 12 per cent. drop in hooligan injuries after 21 areas were targeted by my department in partnership with local councils during the campaign to stamp out this anti-social behaviour.
<P>

<a name="90316w08.htm_para3">I am arranging for copies of a summary of the injury figures to be placed in the Libraries of both Houses. Detailed analytical and regional tables will be published soon.

 <i>[holding answers 15 March 1999]:</i> My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State announced on 4 March 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 1223-29, that the Government had decided to establish a scheme for the cashmere knitwear industry to guarantee the bonds requested by the United States. The mere threat of US action had been having a particularly significant effect on cashmere, in view of the highly seasonal nature of that industry. The precise details and scope of the bond scheme have still to be decided.
<P>

<a name="90316w09.htm_para0">The Government are very aware of the effect that the US action may have not only on the various industry sectors targeted by the US (including lithographs), but also on the possible implications for others in the UK involved with those sectors.

<a name="90316w09.htm_wqn1"><B> Jane Griffiths: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what discussions he has had with the United States Government on a resolution of the present dispute over United States increased import tariffs; and if he will make a statement.  [76783]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90316w09.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Wilson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 15 March 1999]:</i> It is of course the European Commission that acts for the European Union on this matter. The UK Government have also discussed this with the US Administration at every level. We have repeatedly made clear our desire to see the dispute resolved within the WTO framework. We have stressed that US retaliatory action will do nothing to resolve the underlying dispute, which is about the compatibility with WTO rules of the EU's revised bananas regime. We have urged the US to abide by the WTO process currently under way, which offers the best prospect for a resolution of this dispute.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90316w09.htm_wqn2"><B> Jane Griffiths: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if he will estimate <i>(a)</i> how many United Kingdom companies will incur increased export costs as a result of the increase in United States import tariffs, <i>(b)</i> how many companies Her Majesty's Government have compensated for the increase in their export costs, <i>(c)</i> the cost to public funds of this compensation, <i>(d)</i> the nature of the exports of each company and <i>(e)</i> the cost to United Kingdom businesses of the increase in United States import duties.  [76782]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90316w09.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Wilson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 15 March 1999]:</i> Against the background of historical levels of exports in each sector, it is not possible to say what the overall impact might be. Much will depend on how long any retaliatory measures remain in place, the ability of the affected firms to find alternative customers and local labour market conditions. The precise details of the bond scheme announced by the Government on 4 March 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 1223-29, have still to be decided. No companies have therefore been compensated so far. The sectors affected by the US action are: cashmere sweaters; batteries; plastics; biscuits; bath oils; candles; lithographs; bed linen; cartons; coffee makers; wallets; handbags; cheese; and felt paper.

 The White Paper "Aiming for Excellence: Modernising Social Work Services in Scotland" is published today. It contains the answers to three key questions--What kind of social work services do we want? How can they be delivered? How will we know if they are being delivered effectively? It sets out proposals to strengthen the protection of children and vulnerable adults, to support a confident and competent workforce and to ensure high quality services which meet people's needs.




<P>
<P><I>16 Mar 1999 : Column: 601</I><P>

<P>

<a name="90316w09.htm_para1">We propose to create a Scottish Commission for the Regulation of Care as the independent regulatory of social work services, whoever provides them. The Commission will register all organisations that provide care gainst agreed criteria and will make regular independent inspections to see that they are met. It will regulate residential care homes and nursing homes, making it easier for homes to offer both forms of care. It will introduce for the first time regulation of care services provided in people's own homes and will also cover all relevant children's services.
<P>

<a name="90316w09.htm_para2">We propose that the workforce should be regulated by a Scottish Social Services Council which will have the duty of registering specified groups of staff who have completed approved courses of training as a pre-condition for registration. The Council will also regulate professional and vocational education and will publish codes of conduct and practice. Social work services make a critical contribution to social inclusion, providing crucial support to people at times of personal or family crises. The White Paper also underlines the critical importance for successful services of close and effective partnership working between agencies.
<P>

<a name="90316w09.htm_para3">If enacted by the Scottish Parliament, the proposals in this White Paper will strengthen public confidence, creating modern social work services on which we can all rely.

 In all my discussions with both the Managing Director of the IMF and the President of the World Bank, I have underlined the importance of protecting anti-poverty spending during adjustment. In particular, I have stressed the importance of avoiding interventions which work against the poor having access to health and education services. We were pleased that the 1998 Review of ESAF proposed that the IMF should pay greater attention to the potential social impact of adjustment programmes, drawing on the expertise of the World Bank and paying particular attention to health and education. We are following closely the implementation of these recommendations.

 The Government are committed to encourage the take up of digital radio. Responsibility for the roll out of digital radio services across the UK rests with the BBC in accordance with the Royal Charter and Agreement and with the Radio Authority under the framework of the Broadcasting Acts. The BBC national digital radio multiplex is already broadcasting and Digital One's national commercial digital multiplex is expected to commence in the autumn. These national multiplexes will deliver services to the major population centres in Derbyshire, with the lowland populated areas particularly well served. Initially, services may not cover some of the more remote areas in the county where they are shielded from signals by local terrain. It may be necessary to consider improvements to coverage in future transmission plans, in the light of initial experience.

 The North West, like all parts of England, benefits from the work of the British Tourist Authority and of the English Tourist Board. For 1998-99, the BTA has a grant of &#163;35 million and the ETB a grant of &#163;9.7 million, of which &#163;292,000 is for the North West Tourist Board. New support structures for tourism in England, announced on 14 December, must ensure that more effective use is made of this money in the future, with a greater proportion going to the regions.
<P>

<a name="90316w10.htm_para6">The Government's new tourism strategy, "Tomorrow's Tourism" which was published on 26 February, sets out specific proposals for action by Government, local authorities, tourist boards and the industry to promote the sustainable development of a modern, competitive, high quality tourism industry.

 My Department does not directly fund gardens.

In the past three years it has assisted 20 sites. Grants are, however, restricted to outstanding historic gardens which are graded I and II* on EH's Register of Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in England. EH is also currently considering a new integrated grant scheme for gardens, buildings and monuments.

 The Department published last year the results of a survey of ICT provision in schools which indicated that 17 per cent. of primary schools and 83 per cent. of secondary schools were connected to the Internet by March 1998. This is in comparison to the previous year's survey (published in 1997), which indicated that 5 per cent. of primary schools and 47 per cent. of secondary schools were connected to the Internet at that time. Subsequent annual surveys will indicate the change in growth of schools with such connections, although the latest estimates from British Educational Communications and Technology Agency (BECTA) are that approximately 30 per cent. of primary schools, 90 per cent. of secondary schools and 45 per cent. of special schools in England currently have some form of Internet access. The Government are committed to ensuring that all schools are connected to the Internet by 2002.

 The Department for Education and Employment, together with the Department of Health, announced the Healthy Schools Initiative in May 1998. This will support personal, social and health education in schools and address the issue of emotional health and well being. As part of the initiative we have established the Wired for Health website, providing health information initially for teachers, and later for pupils and students. The site provides a link between the Young Minds Website and the Royal College of Psychiatrists fact sheets on child and adolescent mental health. We will be expanding the information relating to mental health on the website in due course.
<P>

<a name="90316w11.htm_para4">The Government regard children with emotion and behavioural difficulties and mental health problems as having special educational needs. Preventing the development of these problems is a key element of our policy. The recently published Action Programme, "Meeting Special Educational Needs" flagged as priorities measures targeted at young children to prevent them developing problems, and to strengthen provision for older children. Such activities were eligible for support under the 1999-2000 Standards Fund, and approximately 20 Local Education Authorities are to be supported to undertake pilot projects in this field.

<i>Note:</i><P>

The main figures provide the best estimate from the review for the percentage of the Housing Benefit caseload in 1997-98 within each of the categories. These estimates are uncertain since conclusions about the level of fraudulent payments were derived from evidence from a sample of HB claims. The uncertainty surrounding an estimate derived from a sample can be quantified by calculating "confidence limits". For the table above 95 per cent. confidence limits have been calculated for each of the estimates and are shown in brackets. These limits indicate the range within which we can be 95 per cent. certain that the true value lies. For each estimate derived there is a 5 per cent. chance that the true value lies outside the stated range. <P>

 Prior to awarding the contract, Trillium's credentials and proposals for managing health and safety across the DSS estate were scrupulously examined by an independent Health and Safety assessor and found to be robust and comprehensive. Post contract, Trillium now have fully trained and qualified health and safety professionals in place throughout the country. Their performance is rigorously monitored by a dedicated contract management team which includes a fully qualified in-house health and safety professional together with a team of technical auditors.

 We recognise that the use of primates as possible source animals for xenotransplantation is an emotive issue arousing strong feelings. The view taken

by the Government, as advised by the United Kingdom Xenotransplantation Interim Regulatory Authority, is that there should be a strong presumption against the use of primates as sources for xenotransplantation. The use of great apes in scientific procedures, including xenotransplantation, has already been ruled out.

 The Government are advised on all issues related to xenotransplantation by the United Kingdom Xenotransplantation Interim Regulatory Authority (UKXIRA).
<P>

<a name="90316w19.htm_para0">The UKXIRA membership provides an excellent balance of medical and scientific expertise with appropriate lay representation. The authority keeps itself fully updated on all developments in the field and has developed extensive networks, both in this country and abroad, through which to obtain additional specialist advice. For example, the UKXIRA last year hosted a workshop on the possible risks posed by porcine endogenous retroviruses, involving fifty leading experts from the UK and the United States of America. A report of the day's proceedings is due to be published shortly.

<P>
<a name="90316w19.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hutton </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 22 February 1999]:</i> The White Paper, "The new NHS", set out new arrangements for commissioning services through the introduction of long term service agreements. All commissioning in the new National Health Service will take place through service agreements.
<P>

<a name="90316w19.htm_para1">Health authorities and primary care groups will be responsible for drawing up service agreements with NHS trusts to deliver improvements in health and health care services which meet the needs of their population.
<P>

<a name="90316w19.htm_para2">Increasingly, service agreements will need to reflect the development of long-term relationships between primary care groups and NHS trusts, be based on the shared view of the outcomes of care needed, and cover integrated pathways of care. Guidance on "Commissioning in the new NHS" emphasised that this will apply, in particular, to long-term medical conditions, such as neurological conditions, where, following accurate and timely diagnosis, patient care will largely be managed outside of an acute setting.
<P>

<a name="90316w19.htm_para3">A compendium of good practice on the commissioning of neurological services is currently being considered for development in 1999/2000.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90316w22.htm_spnew4"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 Article 109b(3) of the Maastricht Treaty contains several provisions designed to balance the necessary independence of the European Central Bank with the need for democratic accountability.
<P>

<a name="90316w22.htm_para0">The Government believe that accountability and transparency in policy/making will be key to ensuring that the European Central Bank gains the trust of the European public and financial markets. Ultimately, it will help to provide the credibility needed to deliver a more effective monetary policy.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what criteria he will use to decide the appropriate exchange rate for the pound against the euro for the United Kingdom's entry into the monetary union; and what is his strategy for <i>(a)</i> achieving and <i>(b)</i> maintaining that rate.  [74877]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90316w22.htm_spnew6"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 The rate at which sterling would enter the single currency would need to be consistent with economic fundamentals in the UK and compatible with sustainable convergence between the UK and the euro-area. This was the basis for the decision on the conversion rates of currencies which joined in the first wave.
<P>

<a name="90316w22.htm_para1">The Government's policy is for a stable and competitive exchange-rate over the medium term. The Government's fiscal and monetary policy framework will help to deliver the macroeconomic stability needed for a stable exchange rate.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer when he plans to bring forward a proposal under the Deregulation and Contracting Out Act 1994 to amend the Trustee Investments Act 1961.  [74962]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90316w22.htm_spnew8"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 The Government accept in principle the case for reform of the Trustee Investments Act 1961. But any reform must provide a complete and lasting solution, which is not likely to be achieved without primary legislation. The Government are committed to reform in a number of areas and already have a full programme of legislation implementing their key policy priorities. The Government will keep the position under review and seek to make progress at the earliest opportunity.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90316w22.htm_spnew12"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 The latest Survey of Personal Incomes indicates that there were about 200,000 pensioners living in the Greater London area in 1996-97 with annual incomes in excess of &#163;10,000 per annum. Of these, some 110,000 had annual incomes about &#163;15,000, about 65,000 had incomes above &#163;20,000 and 40,000 had incomes above &#163;25,000.

 The overall cost of a UK changeover would depend on the approach taken to the changeover. By planning ahead, we can keep costs to the whole economy to a minimum.

[72530]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90316w22.htm_spnew15"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 I would expect any proposals for additional staff for the European Commission to be made in the usual way as part of the Commission's preliminary draft budget for 2000, or as a supplementary amending budget for 1999. No such proposals have been made. In assessing the merits of any proposals for new staff the Government will consider, inter alia, the priority of the tasks new staff are intended to fulfil, the extent to which redeployment has or could be used to meet additional needs, and the availability of additional resources.
