To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what discussions she has had with Able UK on how it proposes to dispose of the polychlorinated biphenyls in the US ghost ships. [143441]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40114w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 None. Regulation of this matter is for the Environment Agency. Environmental legislation requires that all wastes arising from the vessels would need to be treated or disposed of at facilities duly authorised to accept and deal with them. This includes disposal of wastes containing non-liquid polychlorinated biphenyls, which is confined to electrical insulation, gaskets, seals and similar uses on the ships.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what representations she has received about the European Union's changes to the status of animal medicines to veterinary prescription only pharmaceuticals.  [147157]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40114w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 We have received letters opposing the European Commission's proposal to require all veterinary medicines for food producing animals to be prescription only. This proposal does not apply to medicines for companion animals.
<P>

<a name="40114w01.html_para2">During the review of the EU medicines legislation officials from the Veterinary Medicines Directorate (VMD) have had regular discussions with interested parties on all aspects of the proposed changes to the veterinary medicines legislation. Particular account has been taken of the distribution of medicines for food producing animals. The Government's aim in the negotiations was to enable a flexible approach to such distribution that takes advantage of existing national practices so long as consumer protection and animal welfare can be demonstrably assured. This has been achieved.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40114w01.html_wqn4"><B> Sir Nicholas Winterton: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment she has made of the effect of the cost of veterinary prescription only pharmaceuticals on <i>(a)</i> farmers' incomes and <i>(b)</i> farm animal health. [147158]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40114w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 I have made no assessment of the effect of the cost of prescription only medicines on farmers incomes or farm animal health as the use of medicines relates directly to the husbandry methods and disease pattern on an individual farm. However, the Government have accepted Competition Commission recommendations in their Report on the supply within the United Kingdom of prescription only veterinary medicines that are designed to lead, over time, to an overall reduction in the cost of all veterinary medicines.
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs whether the United Kingdom Government will implement EU changes to the status of animal medicines to veterinary prescription only pharmaceuticals; and if she will make a statement.  [147159]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40114w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The European Parliament adopted a compromise text of amendments under Review 2001 in the second reading stage on 17 December 2003. This is expected to be considered for adoption by the Council of Ministers as soon as the translated texts are available. Once this has been achieved, we will be starting a full review of the UK legislation taking into account the changes to EU legislation, the recommendations of the Competition Commission Report on the supply within the United Kingdom of prescription only veterinary medicines and those of the Independent Review of Dispensing (Marsh Report). This will involve discussion with interested parties and will lead to formal proposals being circulated for consultation in early 2005.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40114w01.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. David Stewart: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will make a statement on the implications of the public consultation held in 2002 on the Animal Welfare Bill on progress of the Bill.  [144537]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40114w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The public consultation on an Animal Welfare Bill ended in April 2002 and attracted some 2,500 replies. The comments received in response to the consultation, together with the subsequent discussions we held with over 100 organisations representing a wide spectrum of views on animal welfare, have contributed greatly to the drafting of the Animal Welfare Bill. A further round of public consultation on a possible draft Bill is anticipated in spring 2004.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40114w01.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Paterson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs whether there is scope within the new Animal Welfare Bill to cull out contiguous pockets of m.bovis infection in species other than badgers.  [144589]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40114w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 No. The proposed Animal Welfare Bill will relate only to the welfare of captive and domestic animals. Wild animals in the wild are therefore outside the scope of the Bill.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs when the guidance will be issued to licensed premises for the recovery of CFC gases from disused refrigeration equipment.  [147101]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40114w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Environment Agency (EA) and Scottish Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA) published guidance in April 2002. A review of this guidance has taken place in conjunction with SEPA and the Environment and Heritage Service (EHS). This revised guidance was sent out for external consultation with Fridge Destruction Industry.
<P>

<a name="40114w01.html_para4">Due to the recent amendment to the ODS Regulations, which now require member states to report on the amount of controlled substances recovered, recycled or destroyed every year, the Environment Agency is now reviewing the guidance, any additional changes will require further public consultation.

 In its response to the Strategy Unit report, "Waste Not, Want Not", the Government undertook to carry out further work before a decision is taken on whether to enable local authorities to implement direct or variable charging for waste. This work, which is looking at the practicalities of operating schemes, how potential disadvantages could be overcome and is analysing international experience of such schemes, is under way. The Government will consider the results of this work during 2004.

A compromise text prepared by the Presidency was unacceptable to the Commission and to a number of member states, including Germany, Greece and Spain, who believed it would produce an insufficiently demanding new Directive. The Secretary of State made it clear that the UK would be unable to agree to the legally binding targets to be reached by 2015, on which the Commission wished to insist. It was evident that there was no realistic prospect of reaching political agreement at this meeting, and the Italian Presidency decided to leave further negotiations to the forthcoming Irish Presidency.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40114w02.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The type of trawl used for survey work varies according to target species and area. In the fisheries of interest to UK fishermen, the main trawls used for surveying bottom living fish are the GOV and the beam trawl.
<P>

<a name="40114w02.html_para9">The GOV is a general purpose bottom trawl with a high headline and is used for scientific surveys where the target species are the main commercially important whitefish including cod, haddock, whiting, pout and saithe. The net also samples some of the main shoaling or pelagic species including herring and mackerel. The design and operation of the GOV trawl is co-ordinated by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, and all countries involved in the International Bottom Trawl surveys in the North Sea use the GOV trawl with an internationally-agreed specification. In addition to the North Sea, the GOV is used in surveys in the west of Scotland and the eastern English Channel, and has recently been adopted as the main trawl for surveys in the Irish Sea and Celtic Sea.
<P>

<a name="40114w02.html_para10">For flatfish species such as plaice and sole, the main gear used is the beam trawl.

 The information requested, as at 16 December 2003 is set out in a table which has been placed in the Library. Under the new regulations, former sites can continue to accept hazardous waste if it is contained within a separate disposal cell. This is likely to lead to additional sites as well as these dedicated sites.

[146716]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40114w02.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 A draft study currently being finalised for Defra shows that lead oxide accounts for approximately 9 per cent. by mass of the cathode ray tube in television sets with screens of 19 inches and over. Lead bound up within the glass of the cathode ray tube does not leach very readily. No formal assessment of lead glass in crystal for household use has been carried out as such material when discarded is not on the hazardous waste list.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40114w02.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The decision to delay the implementation of the landfill allowance trading scheme until 2005 which was announced by the Minister of State for Local and Regional Government on 19 November 2003, was made as part of Defra's contribution to helping to reduce spending pressures on local government in 2004&#150;05. We expect local authorities to be able to save up to &#163;10 million as a result. (On 6 January 2004 we announced that Defra will also provide a targeted grant of &#163;20 million to local authorities in 2004&#150;05 to help address the spending pressures arising from their statutory recycling targets).
<P>

<a name="40114w02.html_para13">The decision reflects the views of local authorities which we received through our consultation on the implementation of the landfill allowance trading scheme, that they needed more time to prepare for this new scheme which is a significant departure from their normal operations. The delay in starting the scheme will mean that waste disposal authorities will have to make steeper annual reductions in the amount of biodegradable waste they landfill in order to meet the first target year of 2010 but they will have more time to plan how to do this.
<P>

<a name="40114w02.html_para14">The Government will use the additional time to raise awareness of the scheme within local authorities and to educate and support those who will make use of its provisions.

<i>[holding answer 9 December 2003]:</i>Yes. During regional consultation meetings on the implementation of theLandfill Allowance Trading Scheme held in September 2003, local authorities commented that they would find it difficult to operate the scheme in 2004&#150;05. This view has been reinforced by the written responses to the consultation that have been analysed to date. Local Authorities generally feel that they need more time to prepare for a trading scheme that is a completely new departure from their normal operations. It has already been announced that the start date will be delayed by one year.

<P>
<a name="40114w03.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Environment Agency considered the risk of transfer of species of wildlife or plants in ballast water and imposed a condition on the Able UK waste management licence. This requires that no removal or disposal of ballast water may take place from any of the US vessels, except in accordance with a detailed method statement submitted to and approved in writing by the Agency. These are more stringent conditions than apply to the many visiting ships to the UK.

 Four decommissioned US government-owned vessels are currently being stored by Able UK at Hartlepool. The vessels have been surveyed by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency to assess the integrity of the vessels' structures and safety systems following their passage across the Atlantic, and were confirmed to be in satisfactory condition. The US authorities accept that the four ships will have to return to the US, unless environmentally suitable and legally acceptable methods for their disposal have been identified. The immediate return of the vessels is not practicable. In the meantime the Environment Agency has modified the conditions of Abie's waste management licence so that no dismantling, cutting or breaking of the vessels is permitted, pending the best environmental option for dealing with them.

<P>
<a name="40114w03.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Waste Framework Directive (75/442/EEC as amended by 91/156/EEC) sets out a range of measures on the management of waste&#151;including its collection and disposal. These measures include Article 8 which requires that "any holder of waste has it handled by a private or public waste collector; and Article 15 which provides that "In accordance with the 'polluter pays' principle, the cost of disposing of waste must be borne by.... the holder who has it handled by a waste collector."
<P>

<a name="40114w03.html_para0">The Government has put a range of measures in place under Part II of the Environmental Protection Act 1990, the Controlled Waste Regulations 1992 and the Waste Management Licensing Regulations 1994 to comply with the Directive's requirements. These measures include the arrangements for the collection and disposal of household waste-by-waste collection and disposal authorities. The cost of collection and disposal under these arrangements is met through taxation and charges.

 WRAP'S market development programmes are delivering an extra 1,000,000 tonnes/year of additional recycling capacity in the UK, through projects that have been delivered or are close to completion.
<P>

<a name="40114w03.html_para3">It is estimated that all of the capital grant and R&D projects initiated by WRAP, once fully realised, will generate at least four million extra tonnes of recycling per year in the UK.

Both children and adults are considered as the same within these regulations.

 The Department does not hold figures of the costs to business of highway authority works.

<P>

<a name="40114w05.html_para2">A number of changes are being introduced to strengthen the enforcement of the requirement to license a vehicle (or to make a Statutory Off Road Notification (SORN) if a vehicle is being kept off the road).

now liable for a penalty of &#163;80 (reduced to &#163;40 if paid within 28 days of receiving the penalty notice). To ensure that vehicle keepers have sufficient notice to check that their vehicles are properly licensed, extensive publicity is being given to the changes including information leaflets to all registered keepers during the final month of licence validity.

 The UK government has consistently urged Israel to clarify its nuclear status by acceding to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty as a non-nuclear weapons state, and signing a full-scope safeguards agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). We urge Israel to ratify both the Chemical Weapons Convention and the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention. The UK has also consistently supported UN Resolutions calling for the establishment of a Middle East zone free of weapons of mass destruction. That zone would include Israel.

<a name="40114w06.html_para1">However, it is the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group (CMAG) that will make a decision whether to recommend to Commonwealth Heads of Government that Pakistan should be readmitted on the basis of its return to democracy. The UK is not a member of CMAG, but the UK Government believes that the recent agreement between the Pakistani Government and opposition over the country's constitution and role of parliament marks an important step in the country's transition to full democracy. We hope this will facilitate progress on joining the full Councils of the Commonwealth.

 The Foreign and Commonwealth Office does not advise against travel to Thailand. The vast majority of visits to Thailand are trouble-free. But due to a general threat to British and other Western targets from terrorism in South East Asia, including Thailand, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office advises that travellers should be particularly vigilant in public places, including tourist sites. It also advises travellers to watch out for crimes of opportunity and against the possession of even small quantities of drugs. The full Travel Advice for Thailand can be viewed on the Foreign and Commonwealth Office website at www.fco.gov.uk.

Higher Education institutions wishing to charge higher fees will have to enter into an access agreement with the Office for Fair Access. These access agreements will set out the measures that institutions will take to ensure that students from disadvantaged backgrounds are not deterred from higher education because of higher fees.

 The available information on the non-continuation of students beyond the first year in each university, and the projected course non-completion rate in each university is contained in "Performance Indicators in Higher Education in the UK", published by the Higher Education Funding Council for England, a copy of which is available from the House Library. The latest edition, published in December 2003, gives figures for students starting full-time degree courses in the United Kingdom in 2000/01.

 Information on the costs and benefits associated with the proposal in the Higher Education Bill to allow universities to set their own tuition fees is contained in the Regulatory Impact Assessment published on 8 January alongside the Bill. The Regulatory Impact Assessment illustrates the income from additional fees in different scenarios. Because of the nature of a variable scheme, the costs vary greatly according to the decisions that higher education institutions take, and they cannot be estimated precisely at this stage. The Regulatory Impact Assessment does not distinguish between individual universities. Copies of the Regulatory Impact Assessment were placed in the Library of the House; it is also available on the Department for Education and Skills website.

<a name="40114w12.html_para1">The merger enables VisitBritain to use in the domestic market its expertise in marketing Britain internationally, developing more effective partnerships with private investors to support tourism across Britain and building on the success of the Million Visitor Campaign. It brings economies in terms of overheads and central services and it creates opportunities for private industry and the regions to take a stronger leadership role in setting the marketing agenda.

<P>
<a name="40114w12.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 Reducing the number of self-inflicted deaths and instances of self-harm in prison establishments is a ministerial and Prison Service priority. A proactive three-year programme to develop policies and practices to reduce prisoner suicide and manage self-harm in prisons commenced in April 2001. The main principles of the strategy apply across all types 



<P>
<P><I>14 Jan 2004 : Column 772W</I><P>
of prisons and prisoners whether male or female. An investment of over &#163;21 million through the three-year programme is allowing physical improvements (now 75 per cent. complete) to be made at six 'Safer Local' pilot sites, one of which is the women's prison and YOI Eastwood Park.
<P>

<a name="40114w12.html_para5">The learning resulting from this programme will benefit all prisoners; meanwhile, women prisoners are to benefit from a specifically targeted and separate suicide prevention and self-harm management strategy being developed for them. This builds upon a number of interventions including: internal improvements in handling population pressures; individual crisis counselling for women prisoners who self-harm; the continued development and evaluation of Dialectical Behaviour Therapy, which is currently being trialled at Durham, Bullwood Hall and Holloway prisons; investment and planning to ensure progress on the detoxification strategy in the Women's Estate; the development (in collaboration with the University of Newcastle) of a new, three-stage screening process to more effectively detect mental health problems; and the introduction of a new training pack for all staff working with women in custody, which includes a module on the health and well being of women prisoners. &#163;1 million from the Department of Health has been allocated to the Women's Estate to be spent on the recruitment of psychiatric nurses, and 11 out of the 17 prisons for women now have mental health in-reach facilities.
<P>

<a name="40114w12.html_para6">Brockhill, Eastwood Park, Holloway, New Hall and Styal prisons were among the first establishments to have full-time, dedicated Suicide Prevention Coordinators (SPCs); and now all women's prisons have a designated full or part-time SPC. All women's establishments also deliver suicide awareness training to staff and it is an inherent part of all employees' jobs to observe and report behaviour that may indicate a tendency to self-harm.

 All new build affordable housing schemes funded by the Government through the Housing Corporation must meet the requirements of 'Part M' of the building regulations, which the Government revised in 1999 to improve the accessibility and convenience of new housing. The revised regulations include requirements to ensure that entrances, lifts, corridors, doorways and WCs are accessible, including to wheelchair users. In addition, all newly built affordable housing schemes funded through the Housing Corporation must comply with the Corporation's scheme development standards, which adopt criteria for accessibility and internal environments that help to make homes even more adaptable to long-term needs.
<P>

<a name="40114w13.html_para0">The Government also provides resources for adaptations to existing homes to meet the needs of people with physical disabilities. Local housing authorities have a statutory duty to offer means tested Disabled Facilities Grants (DFGs) to eligible applicants in both the private and social rented sectors who require adaptations to help them live independently in their own homes. The Government meets 60 per cent. of local authority expenditure incurred on DFGs, with the remaining 40 per cent. being met from the authority's own resources. We have increased funding for this grant to &#163;99 million in 2003&#150;04, compared with &#163;88 million in 2002&#150;03 and &#163;56 million in 1997&#150;98.

of three storeys or more and five people or more. It is estimated that about 120,000 houses in multiple occupation are expected to be licensed under this proposal. This estimate, however, does not include properties that could be required to be licensed where a local authority seeks to use in its area the discretionary power that the Bill provides to extend the scope of HMO licensing to HMOs not subject to the national mandatory licensing.

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what his latest assessment is of the number of people facing food shortages in Zimbabwe.  [147341]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40114w14.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Gareth Thomas: </B> 
 The Zimbabwe Vulnerability Assessment Committee's survey in April last year estimated that approximately 4.4 million people in rural areas and 1.1 million people in urban areas would require food aid during the pre-harvest months of January, February and March 2004. However, it is now clear that this figure is an underestimate and is being revised upwards to 5.1 million people in rural areas. Results of a comprehensive urban vulnerability assessment are yet to be released, but are also expected to show a significant increase in people requiring humanitarian assistance.
<P>

<a name="40114w14.html_para0">This increase in beneficiary numbers is partly due to spiralling inflation (now over 600 per cent.), which has affected food prices in shops. There is also emerging evidence of up to several hundred thousand people facing crisis in the former commercial farming areas, most of whom are former farm workers displaced by the Government's disastrous land reform programme.

Additionally, the state-controlled Grain Marketing Board has proved erratic and unreliable in contributing to food supply and distribution in the country. Donors are monitoring the situation closely, in close consultation with the World Food Programme.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40114w14.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Bercow: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what recent discussions he has had with the Government of South Africa on food imports to Zimbabwe.  [147342]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40114w14.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Gareth Thomas: </B> 
 Apart from being a major exporter of food to Zimbabwe, South Africa is also a donor in the on-going humanitarian relief effort. The South African Government donated approximately 58,000 metric tonnes of maize to the previous WFP emergency operation for 2002&#150;03, and may make a further contribution to the current operation. Accordingly, representatives of the South African Government participate regularly in co-ordination meetings concerning the humanitarian programme in Zimbabwe, where issues such as food imports are discussed.
<P>

<a name="40114w14.html_para1">Outside Zimbabwe, representatives from UK Government regularly discuss the Zimbabwe crisis with the Government of South Africa, though discussions usually focus on broad political and humanitarian issues, rather than food imports.
<P>

<a name="40114w14.html_para2">The UK Government, together with the other major donors (EU and USAID), continue to promote the liberalisation of food imports to Zimbabwe and the role of the private sector.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40114w14.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Sutcliffe: </B> 
 There is no register of bad creditors as such. Credit reference agencies hold details of credit accounts and payment histories. In some cases these may show late payments or defaults. Lenders use this information to make decisions regarding the suitability of lending to a particular consumer. These decisions may vary depending on individual lenders commercial decisions.
<P>

<a name="40114w14.html_para5">If individuals believe a particular lender has registered incorrect information about their account with a credit reference agency, they can contact either the lender or the agency to seek correction. Checks should then be made on the accuracy of the information, and corrections made where appropriate. Where individuals can show that the information on their credit file is inaccurate and the lender has refused to amend it, the matter can be referred to the Information Commissioner. Alternatively, individuals have the right to seek redress through the courts.

<a name="40114w14.html_para6">There are no centrally collated results to show the number of applications for corrections on credit reference files, nor the number of corrections made as a result of those applications.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40114w15.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The ultimate goal in WTO agriculture negotiations is to create freer and fairer world markets in agriculture. The Doha mandate commits all WTO members to substantial reductions in trade-distorting domestic support and reductions, with a view to phasing out, all forms of export subsidy. If agreed, this will make a significant contribution to reducing dumping of subsidised produce on developing country markets.

 There are no security implications associated with the published "materials unaccounted for" (MUF) figures.

 The best source of information on this topic are the large number of studies which have already been undertaken by international organisations such as the World Bank, IMF, UNCTAD and the OECD, and by charitable organisations such as Oxfam.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40114w17.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 For domestic support measures to qualify as 'green box' under WTO rules, they must have no, or at most minimal, trade-distorting effects on production. A full list of the support categories that can qualify as 'green box' is set out in Annex 2 of the WTO Agreement on Agriculture 1994.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40114w17.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 Under WTO rules, amber box support covers all trade-distorting domestic support measures paid to agricultural producers. This means all support to producers other than that:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(i) which is exempted as 'blue box' or 'green box' compatible (for a definition of payments falling under the blue box and green box see answers to PQs 146607 and 146605); or</FONT></UL>

<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(ii) which is an integral part of a development programme in developing countries, for instance to assist low-income or resource poor producers; or</FONT></UL>

<P>

<a name="40114w17.html_para8">Members do not have to declare payments to producers below a "de minimis" threshold of 5 per cent. of their total value of agricultural production.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40114w17.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 WTO rules classify 'blue box' support separately to 'amber box' support as it is less trade-distorting in impact. This is because blue box must take the form of a direct payment under a production-limiting programme and be:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(i) based on fixed areas and yields; or

 The opt-out from the weekly working time limits provides workers with the choice to work longer hours if they want to and flexibility for employers. A recent study, "The Business Context to Long Hours Working" published by my department shows that employers thought the most common barrier to reducing the hours of staff was the needs of the business and workload (55 per cent. of respondents cited this), second to this was the concern that existing staff may resist the reduction in hours as it could limit their choice to work these hours and a reduction in their overtime pay (22 per cent.)

 We are awaiting the full written judgment of the Court of Appeal in the Angela Cannings case and therefore it is not possible to make a detailed statement on the implications at this stage.
<P>

<a name="40114w18.html_para1">At the Court of Appeal hearing, Lord Justice Judge expressed concern about the difficulties for the trial jury in resolving issues regarding complex scientific evidence in relation to infant death when the present state of scientific knowledge is evolving.
<P>

<a name="40114w18.html_para4">Since the written reasons of the Court of Appeal in the case of Sally Clark were made available, and following the acquittal of Trupti Patel, the Crown Prosecution Service has undertaken a number of actions. Interim guidance was sent to all Chief Crown Prosecutors on 17 June 2003 requesting that all cases be identified in which either Doctor Williams or Professor Meadow are witnesses and requiring them to serve a copy of the judgement in the Sally Clark case on the defence and to draw attention to sections of the judgement touching on their evidence.
<P>

<a name="40114w18.html_para5">Following the appeal of Sally Clark, the Attorney General established a Group comprising representatives of the police, Crown Prosecution Service, Home Office and other relevant agencies to consider whether any cases in which Doctor Williams has given important evidence require a more in depth review.

were to be identified and, secondly, what factors would be used to select the cases on which the Group should concentrate.

<a name="40114w18.html_para7">Following that meeting, work commenced immediately on the identification of relevant cases. The Group met a deadline of mid-September for the conclusion of that process. By that date, approximately 50 previous cases had been identified, which dated back between five-seven years. These cases all involved charges of murder, manslaughter or infanticide where Doctor Williams had been instructed by the police to conduct the post mortem and which had resulted in a conviction. The cases themselves are now being individually reviewed. An experienced Metropolitan police officer and a Crown Prosecutor are conducting the review. This work is continuing.

 A number of scientific studies have investigated whether there are higher than usual levels of congenital anomalies (birth defects) in populations living near to landfill sites, but no clear picture has emerged.
<P>

<a name="40114w19.html_para5">The Government commissioned the Small Area Health Statistics Unit (SAHSU) at Imperial College to carry out a national study (Elliott et al, BMJ 2001; 323: 363&#150;8, available at http://www.bmj.com. A full report is at http://www.doh.gov.uk/pdfs/report aug13.pdf). SAHSU found a small increase in congenital anomalies in populations living close to landfill sites. The study has not shown, or indeed could show, a causal link between landfill sites and birth defects. The independent expert Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment (COT) noted that the findings for birth outcomes were not consistent, and that the study provided no evidence that the rates of anomalies increased after sites had opened. COT advised that it is inappropriate to draw firm conclusions from the results. The opinion of COT is at http://www.doh.gov.uk/cotnonfood/landfill.htm. SAHSU also specifically analysed the data on birth outcomes in populations living near "special waste" landfill sites in Scotland, and found no evidence to suggest an excess risk of congenital anomalies (Morris et al, Scottish Medical Journal 2003; 48: 105&#150;107, www.smj.org.uk).

Another project, funded by the Environment Agency, is undertaking detailed monitoring of emissions from landfill sites in order to assess the exposure of people living and working nearby.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health how many people aged <i>(a)</i> 17 years or under and <i>(b)</i> 18 years or over were registered with an NHS dentist in (i) England, (ii) each NHS region and (iii) each strategic health authority in each of the last five years; and what proportion each represents of the relevant age group.  [146219]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40114w19.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 The information showing the number of people and the percentage of the population registered with a general dental service dentist by national health service region and strategic health authority at 30 September for each of the last five years, has been placed in the Library. The figures given prior to 2002 are derived from the old health authority areas. Following reorganisation, figures for NHS regions are not available from September 2002 onwards.
<P>

<a name="40114w19.html_para11">Registrations lapse if patients do not return to their dentist within 15 months and so the registration figures exclude patients who have not been to their dentist within the past 15 months. The figures also exclude patients who receive dental treatment from other NHS dental services including dental access centres and those patients who choose not to register and who seek treatment on an occasional basis.

In line with exemptions 1(a) and 7(b) set out in Part II of the "Code of Practice" on access to "Government Information", it has been the practice of successive Governments not to comment on the outcome of such inquiries in order to safeguard security and investigative arrangements. Other than cases where legal action has been taken we are not aware of any cases where names have been made public.

 Information is not available in exactly the form requested. Figures available from the Health Survey for England are shown in the tables. The tables give, for England, the percentage of women who are obese (with a body mass index over 30) from 1991, when the Health Survey began, to 2002 by social class and for the period 1998 to 2002 by Government Office Region. Figures prior to 1998 are not available by Government Office Region. The samples sizes available in the Health Survey do not allow robust estimates to be calculated for each region broken down by social/economic status.

 The Department has not conducted any research on salt depletion in the human body during hot weather. There is insufficient evidence to suggest that people should modify their normal salt consumption during hot weather conditions. It is, however, important to maintain an adequate fluid intake.

<a name="40114w21.html_spnew1"><B> Dr. John Reid: </B> 
 Stable iodine (of which potassium iodate is only one form) has been used clinically since the 1940s to protect the thyroid glands of patients (both

children and adults) being treated with radio-pharmaceuticals which contain radioactive iodine. Potassium iodate is still routinely used in this way to this day. Its efficacy at protecting against the radiation induced thyroid cancer has been known, therefore, for over 60 years. The largest population administration occurred in Poland following the Chernobyl accident where over 9 million doses were administered. No adverse effects were reported and no increase in the rate of thyroid cancer was subsequently seen, unlike in Belorus and Ukraine were stable iodine was not administered to protect the local population.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40114w21.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 The first full month of daily winter reporting was December. In December, there were an average of 20 National Health Service trusts (out of a total of 155 trusts with accident and emergency

departments) per working day reporting operational problems. Such operational problems include the cancellation of elective operations.
<P>

<a name="40114w21.html_para0">All strategic health authorities (SHAs) have developed robust winter plans, which set out escalation procedures to cope with increased seasonal demand for health services. The decision on whether a trust should put these escalation procedures into operation is not made by ministers or the Department of Health. Instead, the locally agreed escalation procedures are activated by the trusts themselves, in agreement with local primary care trusts and the SHA. Such an approach allows the local NHS to be timely in dealing with pressures and is in line with the Government policy of Shifting the Balance of Power to the local NHS. If required, the Department of Health will support a SHA in its local management of winter.

<P>
<P><I>14 Jan 2004 : Column 808W</I><P>

<i>Letter from John Pullinger to Mr. Frank Field, dated 14 January 2004:</i>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The National Statistician has been asked to reply to your request for information on previous and subsequent births of mothers who had a birth registered without a father's name on the birth certificate (a sole registration) in each of the last 30 years. In particular you asked for information on <i>(a)</i> the social class and <i>(b)</i> the mother's age at her first live birth, and for information on how many of subsequent sole registered births the mother had. I am replying in the National Statistician's absence. (147176)</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Information is readily available, from birth registration records, on sole registration births by age of mother. However under the Population (statistics) Acts 1938 and 1960, information on birth order (that is whether a birth is a first birth, second birth etc.) is not collected at birth registration for women who are not married to the father of the child. Table 1, attached, provides information on the number of sole registrations by age of mother in each of the last 30 years (1973&#150;2002).</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Similarly only limited information is readily available by social class from birth registration records. Social class of mother and father first became available separately from 1986. Only 10 per cent. of births are coded for social class and for around two thirds of sole registrations there is insufficient occupation data to assign a social class. Table 2 provides a summary of the readily available information on social class for sole registered births, 1986 to 2001. In 2001 the National Statistics Socio-Economic Classification was introduced, replacing social class, and from 2002 data are not available by social class.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>To provide information on age at first live birth and on any subsequent sole registration requires successive birth records to be linked together. This can only be done using the ONS Longitudinal Study, a one per cent. sample of the population in which, since 1971, census records and vital events have been linked together. Extracting this information cannot be done in the time available to answer this Parliamentary Question. I will write to you again in two weeks to let you know whether the information available from this study is of sufficient quality to answer your question. You should note that, as there is currently only 30 years of birth registration records in the study, only a small proportion of women in the sample have a complete birth history that allows identification of sole registrations. It is therefore very unlikely that the last part of your question (on the number of subsequent sole registered births) can yet be answered reliably.</FONT></UL>

 Following consultation two Statutory Instruments (SI 2003/2494 and SI 2003/2495) were laid on 29 September 2003 and came into force on 20 October. The first of these requires the e-filing of an employer's end of year PAYE return from May 2005 where the employer has 250 or more employees, and from May 2006 where the employer has between 50 and 249 employees. The second makes e-filing incentives available to employers with fewer than 50 employees over the five years from the 2004&#150;05 tax year. In accordance with these regulations, the Inland Revenue has sent a letter to every employer on their database setting out the employer size band for 2004&#150;05 and giving guidance about e-filing options.

 Despite fears of outsourcing abroad having an adverse effect on UK employment, the performance of the UK labour market over recent years has been strong by both international and historical standards. The UK has the highest employment rate and the lowest unemployment rate among the G7 economies.
<P>

<a name="40114w22.html_para27">Moreover most jobs outsourced tend to be at low to intermediate skill levels. The Government's policies aim to ensure that those whose jobs are directly affected can acquire new skills and move quickly into alternative employment.

 The Financial Services Sector Skills Council (FSSSC) will not duplicate the work of existing examining bodies in the financial services sector.
<P>

<a name="40114w22.html_para28">The FSSSC will work closely with a range of industry bodies, including the Financial Services Authority and the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA) to ensure the qualifications that employers want. This will include reviewing the suitability of existing training programmes and qualifications to meet sector needs and, where there are gaps, working with awarding bodies in the sector to develop new qualifications. The QCA will retain responsibility for maintaining the rigour and fitness for purpose of the national qualifications framework, ensuring qualifications are robust and reliable measures of achievement.

 Public service pension schemes are reviewed regularly to ensure that the benefits represent value for money and continue to contribute to the overall aim of the remuneration package to recruit, retain and motivate staff. As part of this process the Government recently announced its decision to raise the normal pension age of public servants from 60 to 65 in the Green Paper "Action on Occupational Pensions" Cm 5835, June 2003. Schemes are consulting on how this might be achieved.
