<a name="80305w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Brake: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what contingency plans have been made in case of failure of <i>(a)</i> the CAA's suppliers to complete year 2000 compliance changes and <i>(b)</i> the year 2000 compliance changes of CAA's suppliers during live running.  [32633]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80305w01.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 For some equipment, National Air Traffic Services Ltd. (NATS) relies on external support and there are some cases where NATS, at this stage, is not adequately assured of completion. These suppliers are being urged to respond. Where such systems are identified as an on-going risk, a solution involving a method of working around the system or backing it up will be included in contingency plans.
<P>

<a name="80305w01.html_para0">Efforts are being made to gain assurance from suppliers that services can be relied upon. NATS aims to involve suppliers in validation tests, where that is feasible, in order to increase the level of confidence. Where there is a lack of assurance, there may be alternative sources of supply, but this may not always be the case. An example is telecommunications services--NATS uses several suppliers and it might be possible to change supplier over time. Contingency plans will be drawn up in full after the validation tests have been completed, when more will be known about the nature of the risks.
<P>
<P>
<a name="80305w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Brake: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what progress reports his Department has sought in respect of the CAA's millennium compliance; and if he will place these in the Library.  [32720]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80305w01.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 Officials in my Department first wrote to the Civil Aviation Authority on 14 March 1997 in pursuit of the Department-wide initiative to approach sponsored bodies about their work on resolving the millennium problem. Since then, my Department has contacted the Civil Aviation Authority and National Air Traffic Services (NATS) regularly to obtain progress reports and information on specific points. On each occasion, the Authority or NATS has sent a progress report or a position statement setting out how the work is progressing. In addition, officials are keeping in touch with the CAA Board in order to obtain regular overviews of how the work is progressing.
<P>

<a name="80305w01.html_para1">A memorandum by the CAA's Science and Technology Committee, entitled "Year 2000 and Computer Compliance Enquiry" (7 January 1998), and a copy of NATS' "millennium problem action plan" (26 February 1998) have been placed in the Library.

<a name="80305w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Brake: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions, pursuant to his answer of 21 January 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>553</i>, when checking of <i>(a)</i> non-National Air Traffic Service and <i>(b)</i> National Air Traffic Service operational items for millennium compliance began; how many items in each category have been checked to date for year 2000 compliance; how many have been found to be year 2000 (i) compliant and (ii) non-compliant; how many of the items which are not year 2000 compliant have been fixed and satisfactorily tested; how many man days were required to complete and test these changes; when integration testing is to start; and what contingency plans have been made in the case of failure (1) to complete year 2000 compliance changes and (2) of the year 2000 compliance changes during live running.  [32719]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80305w01.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 National Air Traffic Services Ltd. (NATS) began initial study work to address the year 2000 compliance issue in April 1996.
<P>

<a name="80305w01.html_para2">A total of 582 operational in-service items have been checked, of which 483 have been found to be compliant; 99 items have been found to be non-compliant. Fixing and testing of the non-compliant items is expected to be completed by July 1998. The work to implement any necessary changes is not accounted for centrally. Systems are fixed and tested individually and are then reintegrated into operational service as part of the existing process for change implementation. A wider set of cross-system and cross-site year 2000 validation tests will then take place between September and December this year. Estimating the number of man days used to complete the changes would involve disproportionate cost.
<P>

<a name="80305w01.html_para3">Changes required to ensure year 2000 compliance are generally of a minor nature and there are none that it is considered will not be completed in time. Ways of working around the system would be developed in the event of non-compliance. The purpose of the validation testing exercise is to identify residual risk areas which will be fed into the development of operational contingency plans in the early part of 1999.
<P>

<a name="80305w01.html_para4">With regard to non-NATS systems, I would refer the hon. Member to the memorandum placed in the Library by the CAA's Science and Technology Committee (Year 2000 and Computer Compliance Inquiry, dated 7 January 1998).
<P>
<P>
<a name="80305w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Brake: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what assessment the CAA has made of the year 2000 compliance of CAA suppliers which exchange data with the CAA electronically; and what independent assessment of the year 2000 compliance of CAA's suppliers will be conducted.  [32632]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80305w01.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The process of identifying suppliers and dependencies in order to find out what plans they have to deal with this issue, to ask for evidence of progress and tests carried out, and to arrange for testing in conjunction with National Air Traffic Services' (NATS) systems at a suitable stage has been underway since 1996. These interfaces have been identified, and dialogue with suppliers is at an advanced stage.
<P>

<a name="80305w01.html_para5">NATS is currently planning an independent audit of its year 2000 activities which will take place later this year. The audit will also consider the adequacy of the compliance assurances that suppliers have provided.

<a name="80305w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Ottaway: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions when <i>(a)</i> each of his Department's agencies and <i>(b)</i> the Government Offices for the Regions estimate their millennium compliance programmes will be completed.  [32613]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80305w01.html_spnew4"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 The estimates are provided in the latest returns released by the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster on 3 March 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, columns <i>621-22</i>, and placed in the libraries of both Houses and published on the Internet.
<P>
<P>
<a name="80305w01.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Ottaway: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions when <i>(a)</i> each of his Department's agencies and <i>(b)</i> the Government offices for the regions will have completed their examination of the available options for achieving millennium compliance.  [32614]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80305w01.html_spnew5"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 Five of the Department's Agencies have completed their examination of the options for achieving millennium compliance, and the remainder aim to complete their examination by the end of April 1998. Within the Government Office for the Regions it is anticipated that the examination of the available options will be completed by June 1998.
<P>
<P>
<a name="80305w01.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Ottaway: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what contingency plans have been made in the event of a failure due to Year 2000 computer problems for <i>(a)</i> each of his Department's agencies and <i>(b)</i> the Government offices for the regions.  [32612]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80305w01.html_spnew6"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 The position on contingency plans is included in the latest returns released by the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster on 3 March 1998, <i>Official Report,</i> columns <i>621-22,</i> and placed in the Libraries of both Houses and published on the Internet.
<P>
<P>
<a name="80305w01.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Ottaway: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if IT contracts for millennium compliance for <i>(a)</i> each of his Department's agencies and <i>(b)</i> the Government offices for the regions will be put out to tender.  [32610]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80305w01.html_spnew7"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 Most Agencies have existing contracts which will be used for millennium compliance. Where extra support is required this will be subject to competitive procurement procedures. The Government Office for the Regions will look to existing IT service suppliers to address millennium compliance issues.
<P>
<P>
<a name="80305w01.html_wqn8"><B> Mrs. May: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will make a statement on the millennium compliance of the data processing systems <i>(a)</i> at the London Air Traffic Control Centre and <i>(b)</i> due to be introduced at Swanwick Air Traffic Control Centre.  [32726]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80305w01.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 National Air Traffic Services (NATS) has been running a year 2000 project since 1996, and included within the scope of the project is the London Area and Terminal Control Centre and its supporting infrastructure. All in-service operational systems have been checked, and NATS is now in the middle of a comprehensive update programme to correct faults or replace sub-systems which might be affected by the millennium bug. NATS expects to be fully compliant by the end of 1998 and this timescale includes extensive testing at all levels of their systems.




<P>
<P><I>5 Mar 1998 : Column: 698</I><P>

<P>

<a name="80305w01.html_para6">Year 2000 compliance for the systems in the new centre at Swanwick is an essential part of NATS' overall programme. In conjunction with NATS' supplier, Lockheed Martin, NATS has conducted a full system assessment. A small number of minor corrections are required to the operational systems and some updates are required to the off-line support systems. All work in this area is included in the plan for readiness by the end of 1998.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80305w02.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Ottaway: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what revisions to the cost estimates in the Summary of Departmental and Agency Plans as received by the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster dated November 1997 have been made for <i>(a)</i> each of his Department's agencies and <i>(b)</i> the Government offices for the regions.  [32611]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80305w02.html_spnew0"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 The cost estimates are provided in the latest returns released by the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster on 3 March 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, columns <i>621-22</i>, and placed in the Libraries of both Houses and published on the Internet.

<a name="80305w02.html_sbhd1"><H4><center>Tree Preservation Orders</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="80305w02.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Gordon Prentice: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what estimate he has made of the number of trees in England which are subject to tree preservation orders; and how many have been designated primarily because of their age.  [32652]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80305w02.html_spnew1"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 Tree preservation orders are made and administered by local planning authorities. Information on the number of orders currently in force, or estimates of the number of trees protected by these orders, is not held centrally. My Department advises authorities to use tree preservation orders to protect selected trees which, if removed, would have a significant impact on the local environment and its enjoyment by the public. Age may therefore be a contributory but should not be the primary reason for designation.
<P>
<P>
<a name="80305w02.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Gordon Prentice: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions how many prosecutions have been brought in each year since 1990 for felling trees subject to a tree preservation order.  [32653]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80305w02.html_spnew2"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 This information is not held centrally.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80305w02.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Brake: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what is the number and surface area of business parks that have been built on <i>(a)</i> green-field land excluding Green Belt, <i>(b)</i> Green Belt land and <i>(c)</i> recycled land in each of the last 12 years by (i) county and (ii) region in England. [32855]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80305w02.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 The information requested is not held centrally. Most decisions on planning applications for business park developments are taken by local planning authorities. They provide statistical returns of all major applications which they handle, in order to provide an overall picture of planning activity. These data do 



<P>
<P><I>5 Mar 1998 : Column: 699</I><P>
not classify applications by location. It is, therefore, not feasible at the moment to assemble such information, except at disproportionate cost.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80305w02.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Gardiner: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what discussions his Department has had with the Institute of Chartered Accountants to ensure that full disclosure of certified accounts is made by landlords to leaseholders under section 21 of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985; and if he will make a statement.  [31131]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80305w02.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 No such discussions have taken place. It does however appear that some clarification may be needed of the duties of a qualified accountant certifying a summary of costs under section 21 of the Act, and we are considering the best way to take this forward.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80305w02.html_spnew5"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 On 29 May 1997, the Government announced a review to consider how the Hedgerows Regulations 1997 might be strengthened so that they give better protection for hedgerows. The review is being undertaken by a group which includes nominees of the statutory agencies, local authorities and the main farming and conservation bodies. It is expected to complete its work shortly.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what discussions he has had with <i>(a)</i> Railtrack and <i>(b)</i> Virgin Trains about improvements to services on the West Coast Main Line. [32864]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80305w02.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 I met with Railtrack on 27 January to discuss their plans to upgrade the West Coast Main Line. Railtrack have agreed to provide regular updates on their progress with the modernisation programme.
<P>

<a name="80305w02.html_para0">I met with Richard Branson on 10 July 1997 to discuss general rail and aviation issues. However, the Franchising Director is responsible for monitoring the performance of Virgin Trains. He has regular meetings with Virgin Trains and has impressed on them the importance that the Government place on improving services on the West Coast Main Line.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80305w02.html_wqn7"><B> Miss McIntosh: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what was the cost of acquiring the Jaguar 4.0i LWB for the use of the Deputy Prime Minister and the subsequent cost of conversion to an alternative fuel system.  [32991]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80305w02.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Prescott: </B> 
 The cost to the Government Car Service (GCS) of acquiring the second hand P registered Jaguar which I currently use was &#163;35,000. For technical reasons, 



<P>
<P><I>5 Mar 1998 : Column: 700</I><P>
Jaguar Cars Limited advise that this car cannot be converted economically to operate on alternative fuels and the cost of its conversion does not therefore arise.
<P>

<a name="80305w02.html_para1">Following several months of discussion between the GCS and Jaguar Cars Ltd., the company has offered the GCS the opportunity to replace the current car with a similar, P registered ex-test vehicle which can be converted easily to run on LPG. This car will be made available by Jaguar Cars Ltd. at no change in cost to the public purse.
<P>

<a name="80305w02.html_para2">The proposed arrangement represents an excellent opportunity for the Government to work with a major British engineering company to achieve a showcase environmentally friendly vehicle development. The replacement car will therefore be brought into service as soon as possible and will be exhibited at a Green Car Exhibition which I will be opening in Chester on 25 April on occasion of the Informal Meeting of the EU Environment and Transport Councils.

To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland how many representations calling for financial assistance he has received on behalf of people with haemophilia infected with Hepatitis C through their NHS treatment.  [32048]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80305w02.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Galbraith: </B> 
 Departmental records show that since 2 May 1997 eleven representations (four of these from hon. Members) concerning financial assistance have been received by the Secretary of State on behalf of people with haemophilia who have been infected with Hepatitis C through their NHS treatment.

To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland what investigation the Chairman of the Scottish Ambulance Service NHS Trust has made of concerns raised about management practices in the service; what conclusions and recommendations he has reached; and if he will make a statement.  [33282]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80305w02.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Galbraith: </B> 
 Mr. Clarke has carried out what I believe to be an exhaustive investigation into the matters raised as I had asked him to do and has produced a Report dealing with them honestly and frankly. The Report has 



<P>
<P><I>5 Mar 1998 : Column: 701</I><P>
identified shortcomings of practice and procedure in relation to the handling of certain personnel matters. It recommends various changes that are designed to prevent any recurrence of these shortcomings. I met Mr. Clarke recently to discuss his findings and recommendations, which I have accepted in full. I know that the right hon. Member and other right hon. and hon. Members have been taking a close interest in this matter on behalf of constituents. I hope that those concerned will, on reading the report in its entirety, feel able to accept that their legitimate claims have been fairly and objectively dealt with. I have made arrangements for copies of the Report to be sent to the right hon. and hon. Members involved and the relevant constituents and for a copy to be placed in the Library of the House.
<P>

<a name="80305w02.html_para3">It has emerged in the course of the investigations conducted by Mr. Clarke that information provided by the Scottish Ambulance Service NHS Trust and used by the then Minister during the Adjournment Debate on 26 November 1996, <i>Official Report,</i> columns 239-48, was misleading. In the course of that debate secured by the then hon. Member for North Tayside the Minister of State stated in all good faith that the matter of Hepatitis B vaccine had not been raised by the hon. Member's constituent prior to her dismissal from the Scottish Ambulance Service. The matter was in fact raised on three occasions but for the reasons set out in paragraph 6.2.5 of Mr. Clarke's Report neither the Minister nor the House were made aware of this. I apologise to the House and I am also writing to both the then Minister of State and the then hon. Member for North Tayside.

A list of possible projects was also presented by GoB but not discussed. Her Majesty's Government played an active part in the meeting which concluded that a core team of donors, led by the United Nations Development Programme, should work with GoB to identify priority needs, develop plans for co-ordinating the overall donor effort and identify appropriate implementation arrangements. This approach was proposed by GoB and is intended to provide a framework for assistance from donors, including Department for International Development.

Director is also under a general statutory obligation to assist the Prison Service Controller to discharge his or her duty to keep the operation of the prison under review.
<P>

<a name="80305w04.html_para6">This is given additional force by a contractual requirement for the contractor to notify the Controller of any behaviour by a prisoner custody officer which casts doubt on his or her fitness for certification as a prisoner custody officer. The Prison Service Controller is required by statute to investigate complaints made against prisoner custody officers. If, in the course of an investigation, the Controller considers that a criminal offence has been committed, he or she may refer the matter to the police. The Director is also expected to inform the Controller of any criminal offence alleged to have been committed by other staff that may have a bearing on their suitability to work in a prison.
<P>

<a name="80305w04.html_para7">The number of reports of such incidents is not recorded centrally for any prisons.

 We have now received Sir Donald Acheson's second report on the Special Secure Unit (SSU) at Whitemoor. His report acknowledges that significant progress has been made in implementing his previous recommendations. In particular, a series of regime improvements have been made, and a robust system of regular health reviews for all SSU prisoners has been introduced.
<P>

<a name="80305w05.html_para2">With regard to closed visits, the report accepts that the improved regime and atmosphere within the SSU is, at least in part, attributable to the confidence which closed visits give to staff. Accordingly, there is no call for a change to the visits policy.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department if it is his Department's policy that legal aid should be provided under the terms of Regulation 14 (1) of the Civil Legal Aid (General) Regulations 1989 to overseas citizens whose Governments fail to provide legal aid on the same terms to UK citizens in child abduction cases; and if he will make a statement.  [32074]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80305w06.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 It is the Government's policy that any person whose case is accepted by the Central Authority under the Hague or European Child Abduction Conventions will receive legal aid. This is because of the vital importance of cases affecting the residence of children litigated before the English and Welsh courts. The availability of legal aid in other countries is not considered. The award of legal aid to foreign nationals is perfectly proper under the terms of the existing legal aid scheme. Many applicants under the Conventions are United Kingdom citizens.

<a name="80305w06.html_wqn3"><B> Sir John Stanley: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department if he will list in respect of each country that is a signatory to the Hague Convention on Child Abduction, the number of cases where the judicial or administrative authority of the requested state has <i>(a)</i> ordered the return of the abducted child and <i>(b)</i> declined to order the return of the abducted child when requested to do so by the UK Central Authority.

<P>
<a name="80305w07.html_spnew3"><B> Dawn Primarolo </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 25 February 1998]:</i> The information held centrally by Customs and Excise categorises insurers registered for insurance premium tax (IPT) only into UK and non-UK. Of the non-UK insurers approximately 77 have indicated on their IPT returns that their payments include some tax at the higher rate. Customs are however aware that some insurers have used "higher rate" box on their IPT returns to declare tax due at the standard rate of 4 per cent. rather than the previous standard rate of 2.5 per cent.

 <i>[holding answer 25 February 1998]:</i> The discussions referred to in my answer of 16 February took place at a meeting on 22 January between Customs and Excise officials from VAT Policy Directorate and officials from the Competition directorate (DGIV) of the European Commission. The United Kingdom Permanent Representation to the EU(UKREP) was also represented. DGIV had received representations from certain UK trade bodies about the impact of the higher rate of insurance premium tax and had sought information on this subject from the appropriate UK authorities. The information provided by Customs officials was in response to the requests from DGIV for background information. Copies of letters sent to DGIV via UKREP have been placed in the Library. Although the meeting was informal, Customs officials made clear the Government's view that the higher rate of insurance premium tax would have no effect on cross-border trade and fully complied with both UK and EC law.

 <i>[holding answer 26 February 1998]:</i> The Government intend to make the tax-varying power proposed in the Scotland Bill available to the Scottish Parliament from the year of assessment 2000/01. In order to achieve this, the Inland Revenue has set up a project which will implement a system to enable them to collect income tax at any varied rate set by the Parliament, pay into the Scottish Consolidated Fund the amounts due to the Parliament, and account for tax collected on the Parliament's behalf. This system will, among other things, enable Scottish taxpayers to be identified and enable tax at the correct rate to be collected from them. The Scottish Office are represented on the Board overseeing the project. There will also be close consultation with representatives of employers and others to ensure that the system is in place by April 2000.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80305w07.html_spnew8"><B> Dawn Primarolo </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 3 March 1998]:</i> Customs and Excise previously concluded in 1995 that the normal tax rule should apply to artisan golf associations. Membership fees charged by artisan golf clubs are exempt from VAT; but charges made by other (host) golf clubs to artisan golf clubs and their members are taxable at the standard rate. This is because no membership facilities are extended by the host club to "artisan" golfers, and the normal rules for green fees charged to non-members are appropriate.

This function naturally falls to an existing post within the Treasury, and since September 1977 the occupant of this post has explicitly included co-ordination of green transport in the Department within her duties.

 <i>[holding answer 3 March 1998]:</i> The Government propose to publish separate scheme statements for the main departmentally administered occupational public service pension schemes alongside departmental resource accounts. The schemes include the Principal Civil Service Pension Scheme, the Armed Forces Pension Scheme, the Teachers' Superannuation Scheme and the NHS Superannuation Scheme. Although the Statement of Recommended Practice "Financial Reports of Pension Schemes" does not apply to unfunded pension schemes, its recommendations represent best practice for pension scheme accounting in the UK and the Treasury is 



<P>
<P><I>5 Mar 1998 : Column: 719</I><P>
developing with departments scheme statements which conform as far as appropriate to this best practice. The unfunded liabilities of these schemes will be disclosed as part of the Actuary's Report. For these schemes, contributions (or any government finance out of which contributions are paid) to meet the accruing cost of pensions will be included in departmental resource accounts and budgets.
<P>

<a name="80305w08.html_para0">The Government do not propose to include state pension liabilities in departmental resource accounts because they do not believe that it is meaningful to do so in order to provide a realistic balance sheet at departmental level. However, the Government recognised at an early stage in the development of resource accounting and budgeting that potentially different arguments might apply in considering the production of a balance sheet for the public sector as a whole.
<P>

<a name="80305w08.html_para1">The Government are currently carrying out a joint scoping study with the National Audit Office into the desirability, practicalities, timescale and resource and other implications of preparing a consolidated set of financial statements for the public sector as a whole ("whole of government accounts"). In assessing the case for proceeding within the preparation of whole of government accounts, the study will consider whether the coverage of such accounts should include Government liabilities, including state pension liabilities. The report of the scoping study will be published in the summer.

 <i>[holding answer 15 December 1997]:</i> Figures available for the effects of tax changes announced in July 1997 are given in table 2.2 of the "Financial Statement and Budget Report". The Government are currently consulting on corporation tax measures set out in the Pre-Budget Report; estimated effects of those proposed changes are on page 19 of the Inland Revenue's consultative document, "A modern system for corporation tax payments". The planned introduction of Radio spectrum pricing is not comparable with the tax changes discussed above. The primary purpose of spectrum charges is to encourage the more efficient use of the radio spectrum. Charges, whether through fees or auctions, will be in respect of licences for access to the spectrum. Estimates of the financial effects are given in the Explanatory and Financial Memorandum to the Wireless Telegraphy Bill.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer, pursuant to his oral answer to the hon. Member for Eastbourne (Mr. Waterson) of 12 February 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, column 536, which areas of tax have been covered by discussions in ECOFIN regarding aspects of tax harmonisation.  [30693]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80305w09.html_spnew2"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 A variety of tax proposals have been discussed at ECOFIN since May 1997 including Taxation of Savings, Internet and Royalties for cross border payments. Reduced Rates of VAT for labour intensive industries and the Energy Products Directive. The outcome of each ECOFIN has been reported to the House and all the Commission's proposals on tax matters discussed have been the subject of Explanatory Memoranda.

<a name="80305w09.html_spnew3"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 The issue of abolition of duty free within the EU in 1999 has not been raised in ECOFIN so far during the UK Presidency. However, as the Government have previously said, the UK will not stand in the way of any proposal for a Commission study particularly if this were also to examine the nature of any successor regime to duty free.

<a name="80305w09.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Worthington: </B> 
 Guidance on the effects of organophosphate poisoning on health has been issued to doctors on a number of occasions. The first advice to GPs and A&E consultants was issued on 20 July 1993. This was followed by further advice contained in a book on Pesticide Poisoning which was issued in April 1996. In addition, in June 1996, an article on this subject was included in the CMOs Update which is circulated to all doctors.

<P>
<a name="80305w09.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Paul Murphy: </B> 
 The licensing authorities responsible for the approval for use of organophosphate products employ expert scientific staff to assess all data available to them. Advice is also given to them by independent panels of experts, the Veterinary Products Committee, the Committee on the Safety of Medicines and the Advisory Committee on Pesticides, and only when all safety and efficacy criteria are met will a product be approved.

<P>
<a name="80305w10.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Paul Murphy: </B> 
 There are no toll roads in Northern Ireland at present. Tolling is considered as an option, where the circulation arrangements are appropriate, to advance the provision of desirable schemes. In this context, consideration is being given to the possibility of a small privately funded toll road to by-pass the village of Toome in County Antrim.

<P>
<a name="80305w10.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 First estimates are that the impact of relocating scientific staff based at the Central Science Laboratory Norwich site to the York site would be to reduce expected future pricing by approximately 5 per cent. overall.

<a name="80305w10.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what was the cost to his Department of constructing the new food research laboratory at Sand Hutton, York.  [32868]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80305w10.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The cost of the Department of constructing the new Central Science Laboratory at Sand Hutton, York (whose functions go wider than food) is &#163;126,874,000. This includes: payments to contractors; fees for architects, engineers, project managers and other specialists; legal fees; and VAT. In addition, the Department paid &#163;6,958,000 for the site, road improvements beyond the site boundary and bringing utilities to the site.

<P>
<a name="80305w10.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what estimates his Department has made of the impact on the continuity of food research contracts of a relocation of Norwich-based scientific staff to York.  [32869]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80305w10.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 Previous experience from initial occupation of the Central Science Laboratory at York was that relocation had a minimal impact on the science programme. The average down time for scientific staff during that exercise, including decommissioning, moving and recommissioning equipment, was an average of three weeks.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what estimates his Department has made of the proportion of Central Science Laboratory scientific staff who would transfer to York if requested to do so.  [32870]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80305w10.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The majority of scientific staff are in mobile grades and transfer to new locations, when necessary, forms part of their conditions of employment. Experience of the previous relocation exercise to occupy the Central Science Laboratory at York was that at a large proportion of staff in mobile grades, between 80 and 90 per cent., transferred to York.

<P>
<a name="80305w10.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Under the provisions of Council Regulation (EC) No. 162/94, it is the responsibility of the flag Member State to issue and manage the special fishing permits of vessels flying its flag. The Fisheries Departments issue such permits to vessels over 18 metres in overall length fishing for deep-water species, edible crabs, spider crabs and scallops in Western waters, as part of the licence to fish in those waters, in accordance with the provisions of Council Regulation (EC) No. 685/95. The Fisheries Departments will continue to issue such permits wherever they are required to do so by Community obligations.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80305w10.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 A copy of the Department of Transport's letter of objection has been placed in the Library. Associated British Ports did not formally object but, as recommended by the Department of Transport, my officials spoke to the Deputy Harbour Master, ABP Southampton, who confirmed that in his view the extension proposed would represent too great an intrusion into the Thorn Channel.

<P>
<a name="80305w10.html_spnew14"><B> Mr. Keith Bradley: </B> 
 My noble Friend Baroness Hollis of Heigham, the Minister with day to day responsibilities for child support, has regular meetings with the Chief Executive of the Child Support Agency to discuss operational issues. We expect the Child Support Agency to provide an efficient and effective service to all its clients throughout the child support process.
<P>

<a name="80305w10.html_para2">One of the targets for the Agency is to pass on to the parent with care 97 per cent. of payments within 10 working days of receipt. The current Agency performance statistics show that, at 31 January 1998, 98 per cent. of payments had been passed on within that timescale. The balance includes cases where the instrument of payment from the absent parent is not honoured or those where the identity details of the parents involved are not clear.

<a name="80305w11.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Leslie: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security if she will publish a revised version of the table in the 1997 Departmental Report (Cm 3613) which shows estimated numbers of people receiving benefits at a particular time; and if she will set out the reasons for this revision.  [33358]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80305w11.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Harman: </B> 
 The main reason for revising Table 6 is to correct an error in the estimates of forecast caseloads for Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit (due to incorrect transcription of figures), which was not picked up prior to publication of the 1997 Departmental Report. At the same time, other improvements have been made to Table 6 which will be adopted in the Departmental Report for 1998 and subsequent years.
<P>

<a name="80305w11.html_para0">The revised table shows caseload figures consistent with the expenditure figures shown in the 1997 Departmental Report. It is in the same improved format as will be adopted for the corresponding table in the 1998 Departmental Report (to be published in April 1998). The table differs from Table 6 in the 1997 Departmental Report in the following ways:
<P>

<a name="80305w11.html_para1">It corrects for a transcription error in the estimates of forecast caseloads for Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit, which was not picked up prior to publication of the 1997 Departmental Report.
<P>

<a name="80305w11.html_para2">It includes outturn information for 1996-97 which was not available at the time of publication of the 1997 Departmental Report. This is particularly important in improving the estimates for Jobseeker's Allowance.
<P>

<a name="80305w11.html_para3">Estimates for forecast years are for average annual caseloads. This ensures complete consistency with expenditure estimates presented elsewhere in the Departmental Report.

 I have been asked to reply.

<a name="80305w11.html_para5">The Windfall Tax is expected to raise &#163;5.2 billion to finance the Welfare to Work programme over the course of this parliament. Estimates of the allocation of the Windfall Tax between programmes and between financial years was set out in Table 2.1 of the Financial Statement and Budget Report 1997, "Equipping Britain for our long-term future". Further details of estimated expenditure in respect of 1997-98 was set out by my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Education and Employment in the answers to the parliamentary questions from my hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Sutton (Mrs. Gilroy) on 5 November 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>228</i>, and from my hon. Friend the Member for Amber Valley (Judy Malleber) on 23 February 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>109</i>. A revised allocation for future years, taking into account developments since the last Budget, will be published in the forthcoming Budget.
<P>

<a name="80305w11.html_para6">The Government have not made an assessment of the effect of the Welfare to Work programme on social security spending, tax and national insurance receipts. To do so would require information on the full effect of the programme on unemployment, wages and the broader economy. The Welfare to Work programme will be carefully evaluated to help, where possible, to determine these effects.

<P>
<P><I>5 Mar 1998 : Column: 734</I><P>

<P>

<a name="80305w12.html_para3">The Revaluation Reserve relates to the fixed assets of a higher education institution and demonstrates changes in the value of those fixed assets. It does not therefore represent cash held by an institution.
<P>

<a name="80305w12.html_para4">The Income and Expenditure Account Reserve represents the total of all reserves (excluding the Revaluation Reserve) of a higher education institution and its subsidiary undertakings and is made up of the cumulative annual surplus (or deficit). The Income and Expenditure Account Reserve is not necessarily available for spending as, in the main, the constituent reserves are not backed by cash in the bank.
<P>

<a name="80305w12.html_para5">I would like to emphasise that the figures cannot be taken as an indication of the financial health position of higher education institutions nor are they an indicator of their cash position. In order to determine financial health a wide variety of accounting factors are required to be taken into account which are far wider than just the issue of reserves.

 No public money was paid in respect of the acquisition by Merchant Designs Manufacturing of the plant at Machynlleth although the company was offered a one-year rent concession by the Development Board for Rural Wales to the value of &#163;33,000. The company also received funding from Powys TEC for the retraining of staff. The financial arrangements for the take-over of the former Laura Ashley plant were a matter for Laura Ashley and Merchant Designs Manufacturing and the Welsh Office has had no involvement in them.
<P>

As part of its efforts to attract new jobs to the area, the Board has made a substantial investment in developing the Dyfi Eco Park where two units are under construction and where the prospects for letting both units shortly after completion are considered to be good. The closure of the Merchant Designs Manufacturing operation has also generated interest in both the premises and the skilled workforce and a number of inquiries are being actively pursued by the Development Board.

Regulation 17 does not confer on the committee the function of agreeing the terms and conditions of the Chief Executive.

This agenda is being driven forward by the Competitiveness UK initiative. Business people are working directly with DTI Ministers to identify barriers to improved competitiveness and develop practical proposals to overcome them. This radical approach will lead to policies for sustainable wealth creation, based on a high skill, high investment, innovative, modern economy.

 Since 2 May 1998, the UK has issued eight licences covering the export of formulated complex growth medium to Iraq. In each case, in accordance with our obligations under UN Security Council resolution 661, the Government confirmed that the applications were to export supplies strictly for medical purposes; notified the UN Sanctions Committee; and, in accordance with the Import and Export (IMPEX) Mechanism established under Security Council Resolution 1051, notified the UNSCOM/IAEA joint unit. The IMPEX mechanism covers specified goods with the potential for use in weapons of mass destruction and in their development, and provides for monitoring of their use in Iraq by the UN Special Commission (UNSCOM).

 The Department does not comment in detail on the affairs of individual companies before proceedings have been concluded. However, this matter was referred to the Accountants' Joint Disciplinary Scheme on 4 March 1997 for investigation of the former auditors and chartered accountants employed within the company. The investigation is expected to be completed during the course of 1998. The Executive Counsel to the Joint Disciplinary Scheme will then decide whether to lay complaints for hearing by a Joint Disciplinary Tribunal. It is the usual practice of the Joint Disciplinary Scheme to issue a Press Notice when complaints have been laid; and the Reports of Joint Disciplinary Tribunals are published. Where, however, the Executive Counsel decides not to lay complaints, the Executive Committee has a discretion whether to publish the Executive Counsel's Report.

<P>
<a name="80305w16.html_spnew6"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 I have today announced the sale of a portfolio of student loans for &#163;1 bn. This is the outcome of a policy first announced in September 1996. The sale has been achieved after a vigorous competition and we have accepted the most competitive bid. NatWest Markets was the successful bidder.
<P>

<a name="80305w16.html_para0">The loans sold are those made under the current scheme. None of the new income contingent loans available from the 1998-99 academic year are involved.
<P>

<a name="80305w16.html_para1">My right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer said in his statement of 10 July 1997 that we would continue the policy of student loan debt sales as part of our pledge to work within the spending plans already announced for this year and next. The sale also underlines our commitment to developing a wide range of public-private partnerships which involve a transfer of risk to the private sector. This sale transfers to the private sector much of the risk of loans defaulting.
<P>

<a name="80305w16.html_para2">The Student Loans Company, the existing administrator, will continue to administer the loans sold for at least for the next five years. Borrowers who are currently repaying their loans or who have made deferment arrangements will consequently notice little change. We have also taken steps through the Education (Student Loans) Act 1998, to ensure that the position of borrowers is protected. Borrowers will retain their existing rights of deferment, where their income is below 85% of average earnings, and interest rates will continue to be linked solely to inflation.
<P>

<a name="80305w16.html_para3">These rights mean that existing student loans are provided at subsidised rates. Additional subsidies will therefore need to be paid to the purchaser to reflect this. Given the value of loans sold, and that some of the loans will be outstanding for a considerable length of time, the estimated net present value of these subsidies is likely to be in the region of &#163;350m. This compares with estimated present value costs of nearly &#163;300m which would have been incurred by the Government had the loans remained publicly owned. Annual subsidy payments will be high in earlier years and reduce over time as borrowers repay more of their debt and the total level of debt outstanding falls.
<P>

<a name="80305w16.html_para4">During the 1998-99 financial year a gross subsidy of about &#163;60m will be paid to Finance for Higher Education Limited (FFHE), a company formed for the purpose of acquiring the assets by NatWest Markets. However, part of the gross subsidy payment will be repaid to the Government through the administration charges paid to the Student Loans Company and tax receipts on private sector profits. The estimated cost to the Government in 1998-99 of selling these loans will therefore be in the region of &#163;15m above the &#163;40m cost of keeping loans in the public sector.
<P>

<a name="80305w16.html_para5">The agreement between the Government and FFHE for the purchase of the loans, with commercially confidential information removed, will be placed in the Library of the House on completion of the sale.

<a name="80305w16.html_spnew10"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 The Government have set the Teacher Training Agency (TTA) a target of 2,150 entrants to teacher training courses for secondary maths teaching in 1998-99, compared with a target of 2,250 in 1997-98. Each year the Government review the demand for newly-qualified teachers in each phase and secondary subject, taking into account the latest information on relevant factors. The targets issued reflect the estimated demand, so recruitment to target should ensure an adequate supply of qualified teachers. In November 1997, the Department published an explanatory paper on 'Teacher Supply and Demand Modelling', a copy of which is in the Library.

 The Government are keen to encourage out of school hours clubs in schools and in other community premises, including youth clubs and community centres. We will shortly publish a National Framework for out of school hours learning, which will acknowledge the valuable work already done by youth and community workers, as well as others, to motivate young people and help them become more active learners. The National Framework will also suggest ways in which such partnerships can be developed and make clear that, although schools have a key role to play in promoting and participating in study support, it can be provided entirely by people or organisations who are not part of a school. The New Opportunities Fund will administer &#163;200 million of Lottery funding for out of school hours learning activities.

<a name="80305w17.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Alan Howarth: </B> 
 No such representations have been made. DfEE Ministers have the lead responsibility for JSA and study rules. We have already taken action on the Jobseekers' Allowance rules on education and training. We have extended the JSA Workskill pilots so that there are now pilots in eight areas allowing people unemployed for six months or more to undertake employment-related courses of education and training, full or part-time, for up to a year while on JSA. The pilots aim to test whether and how different benefit arrangements help unemployed people obtain and retain employment.
<P>

<a name="80305w17.html_para1">We are also introducing more flexible arrangements in our New Deals for unemployed people. The New Deal for 18 to 24-year-olds includes an option of full-time education and training for up to a year. People on this option will receive a training allowance in place of JSA. Those aged 25 years and over, unemployed for two years or more, will be allowed from June 1998 to undertake full-time employment-related education and training for up to a year while receiving JSA. Learning for Work--full-time education and training--is also an option in all five prototype Employment Zones.

 <i>[holding answer 24 February 1998]:</i> The potential for acquiring <i>E. coli</i> O157, <i>Salmonella</i> or <i>Campylobacter</i> infection from the consumption of raw cow's drinking milk is considerably higher than that for pasteurised milk. Microbiological surveys have shown that raw cows' milk in England and Wales is a potential source of these pathogenic microorganisms. In England and Wales between 1992 and 1996 there were 15 reported outbreaks of illness involving <i>E. coli</i> O157, <i>Salmonella</i> species or <i>Campylobacter</i> species where milk was the suspected source. Of these outbreaks, 10 were directly associated with raw milk and 5 with pasteurised milk, of which 2 were attributed to pasteurisation failure. As the volume of raw milk consumed in England and Wales is only a small fraction of the total liquid milk drunk, the risk of a person becoming infected from drinking raw milk is, therefore, substantially greater than the risk of a person becoming infected from drinking pasteurised milk.
<P>

<a name="80305w18.html_para0">In response to a request by the Government's independent expert Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food, we commissioned surveillance of the prevalence of <i>E. coli</i> O157 in raw cow's milk cream and raw milk cheeses. The Committee will be asked to consider the public health significance of the results when these become available.
<P>

<a name="80305w18.html_para1">The Department commissioned ADAS to undertake a survey of the microbiological status of raw (unpasteurised) cows' drinking milk in England and Wales. The survey shows that 62 per cent. of milk samples had evidence of organisms indicating faecal contamination. The findings of the survey have been summarised in the December 1997 issue of the Food Safety Information Bulletin. Copies are available in the Library.
<P>

<a name="80305w18.html_para2">The Government are currently funding surveys on the microbiological status of raw milk from cows, sheep and goats. This work includes looking for microorganisms indicating faecal contamination.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will list the notified cases of food poisoning associated with <i>(a)</i> raw milk and <i>(b)</i> pasteurised milk in each of the last five years.  [31870]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80305w18.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 The information in the format requested is not routinely collected as the majority of notified cases of food poisoning are sporadic and the vehicle of infection is not known. Cases may also occur as part of general outbreaks and for some of these the vehicle of infection may be established. During the period 1993-96, there were 13 reported general outbreaks involving milk and dairy products in England and Wales. Nine outbreaks were associated with unpasteurised milk, affecting 146 people, and four outbreaks were associated with pasteurised milk, affecting 111 people. Of the four outbreaks involving pasteurised milk, three were due to pasteurisation failure and one was due to recontamination 



<P>
<P><I>5 Mar 1998 : Column: 756</I><P>
after pasteurisation. Detailed information on these outbreaks has been published in the monthly publication "CDR Review", Volume 7, No. 3, dated 7 March 1997, Table 1. Copies have been placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="80305w18.html_para4">For 1997 provisional information indicates that there were no general outbreaks of food poisoning in England and Wales associated with pasteurised milk.

To ask the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster if he will list the properties and land owned by his Department which he has identified as surplus to requirements, giving in each case their estimated value.  [30313]<P>

 <i>[holding answer 23 February 1998]:</i> For this purpose the Cabinet Office includes the Prime Minister's Office and the Office of Public Service and its executive agencies.

<a name="80305w21.html_para9">The Cabinet Office has, so far, identified only one building as surplus to our requirements. We are currently in the midst of negotiations to sell the property and to reveal our estimate of the value of that building would prejudice our position and the eventual income to the Exchequer.
<P>

<a name="80305w21.html_para10">PACE, Property Advisers to the Civil Estate, was set up as an Executive Agency of the Office of Public Service on 1 April 1996. In addition to the buildings it occupies for its own use, PACE also inherited all the wholly vacant buildings then on the Civil Estate.
<P>

<a name="80305w21.html_para11">PACE is charged with the disposal of this vacant estate which currently totals some 286 properties. I have asked the Chief Executive of PACE to write separately to the hon. Member.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I have been asked by the Parliamentary Secretary, Office of Public Service, to reply to your Parliamentary Question relating to the estimated value of the surplus government properties for which I have responsibility.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>From 1 April 1996 responsibility for individual properties was transferred to government departments. At the same time, PACE inherited wholly vacant properties that were at the time surplus to departments needs. Departments retain responsibility for all accommodation subsequently declared surplus.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Our Annual Report and Accounts spells out the numbers and value of the surplus property for which we are responsible. We inherited 384 properties in April 1996 which were reduced to 268 properties by March 1997. We are on target this year to achieve a further 110 disposals. The majority of the properties are leaseholds with a negative value. At 1 April 1996 this negative value was &#163;486 million and at 31 March 1997 it was &#163;433.3 million. So far as freeholds are concerned the opening positive book value was &#163;80.2 million at 1 April 1996, reducing to &#163;67.6 million at 31 March 1997, taking into account the disposals achieved during the year. Copies of our Annual Report and Accounts have been placed in the libraries of both Houses of Parliament. Our second Annual Report and Accounts will report the position at 31 March 1998.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>It might be helpful for me to explain how this value of surplus accommodation has arisen. Since 1990 the marked decline in civil service staff numbers, combined with rationalisation, relocation out of London and the more effective use of office space, has enabled Departments to declare an ever increasing volume of space surplus to requirements. Sluggish market conditions in the past have not enabled disposals to keep pace with these surrenders although the market has now picked up particularly in London. In the longer term reductions in the size of the government's office estate will provide the taxpayer with even greater value for money.</FONT></UL>
