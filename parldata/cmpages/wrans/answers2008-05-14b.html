 The issue of ballistic missile defence is discussed routinely, both bilaterally with the United States Administration, and in NATO forums. It is not the practice of the Government to make public details of all discussions with foreign governments as this would, or would be likely to, prejudice international relations.</p>

 The NATO/EU pan-Balkans Operational Reserve Force (ORF), currently made up of a battalion from the UK, Germany and Italy, continues to provide the necessary capability to reinforce both the NATO operation in Kosovo and EU operation in Bosnia-Herzegovina (BiH). The security situation in BiH is stable and current troop levels are considered sufficient. Should military commanders judge that reinforcements are required, the &#145;Ready&#146; and &#145;Standby&#146; ORF battalions are available to provide the additional support.</p>

In those discussions, it was made clear that all bids would be treated equally. However, no such bid has been made. It is not for us to say why, but it should be noted that the proposed contract is far-reaching and requires far more than a replication of services currently delivered by the in-house team.</p>

Figures for 1999-2000 onwards are on a resource accounting and budgeting basis. There may be differences between figures quoted in these tables and those quoted in Department for Work and Pensions accounts. 5. Figures for past years may have changed since previous publication due to changes in methodology and the incorporation of more up-to-date information. 6. Figures exclude asylum seekers from April 1999, since when the National Asylum Support Service has reimbursed DWP for benefits paid to asylum seekers. 7. Separation of rent allowance into private rental sector and registered social landlord elements is an estimate derived from the quarterly administrative data on caseloads and average awards, and the figures should therefore be treated as indicative.<br>

1. Estimates are additional to the baseline assumption of increasing the basic state pension by earnings from 2012. During the next Parliament, we will re-link the uprating of the basic state pension to average earnings. Our objective, subject to affordability and the fiscal position, is to do this in 2012, but in any event by the end of the Parliament at the latest. We will make a statement on the precise date at the beginning of the next Parliament.<br>
2. Estimates are presented in net terms reflecting that the estimated savings from reduced income related benefit payments (pension credit, housing benefit and council tax benefit) have been deducted. The proportions of additional expenditure saved through reduced income related benefit payments have been estimated using the Department&#146;s Policy Simulation Model and are assumed to remain constant over time.<br>
3. In the financial years up to and including 2013-14 Treasury Economic assumptions consistent with Budget 2008 have been used to model earnings uprating. After this point a long term earnings growth assumption of 4.93 per cent. has been applied.<br>
4. Estimates are in 2008-09 prices and have been rounded to the nearest &#163;100 million.<br>

There is no definitive list of qualifications that satisfy the requirements, and in lieu of such a list we currently accept all qualifications on the Early Years and Playwork Qualifications Database as meeting the qualifications requirement, as well as other training or qualifications that the applicant can demonstrate are common core compliant.</p>

During inspections, we check compliance with the requirements governing continued registration. At the inspection visit we also look for evidence within the organisation that the skills and knowledge from common core training are put into practice. If we find a provider to be non-compliant then we set an action telling the provider what they must do to remain registered. We currently inspect 10% of those on the voluntary part of the Childcare Register, as agreed with the Department for Children, Schools and Families.</p>

 I refer the hon. Member to the reply on 26 November 2007, <i> Official Report,</i> column 671W, to his previous question on this matter. Data for the 2006-07 school year show reductions in overall absence from all state-funded schools (6.49 per cent. compared to 6.96 per cent.), which is the lowest on record, and in persistent absence from state-funded secondary schools (6.7 per cent. compared to 7.1 per cent.). We are continuing our focus on reducing persistent absence across all local authorities and their schools, and on minimising avoidable absence through early identification of pupils developing patterns of absence and tackling the underlying causes of these patterns. We expect schools and local authorities to work with the pupils and their families on an individual basis to resolve the problems that cause the absence, with the support of other agencies and partners such as the local community, social care workers and the police, reintegrate into the school community and catch up with their peers.</p>

 The Department for International Development (DFID) recognises that many populations in the world rely heavily on working animals and livestock for their household income. Natural disasters can have a devastating impact on livestock numbers and health, cause severe damage to animal shelters and deplete fodder resources. This can result in increased vulnerability and suffering of livestock dependent, populations. DFID's humanitarian policy underlines the need to reduce risk, protect against extreme vulnerability and strengthen social protection for populations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_589"><a name="80514w0020.htm_para1"><a name="08051487001117">People who depend on livestock or the sale of livestock products for most of their income and consumption continue to fall victim to disasters, for a complex variety of reasons that include pre-existing vulnerability and also climate change. DFID has recently carried out a review of its work with such &#145;pastoralists&#146; and developed a specific pastoralist policy paper.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_590"><a name="80514w0020.htm_para2"><a name="08051487001118">DFID has provided funding to humanitarian actors for livestock projects in natural disasters, and will continue to do so where and when necessary and appropriate. DFID is also funding Tufts University&#146;s Feinstein Centre to produce Livestock Emergency Guidelines and Standards (LEGS) for the design, implementation and assessment of livestock interventions to assist people affected by humanitarian crises.</p>
