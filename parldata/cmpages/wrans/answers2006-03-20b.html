 Local authorities have a duty under Part IV of the Environment Act 1995 to review and assess the current, and likely future, air quality in their areas. Where local authorities consider that one or more of the nationally prescribed air quality objectives for each of the seven pollutants is unlikely to be met by the relevant deadline, they must declare an air quality management area (AQMA), covering the area where the problem is expected. These local authorities must then take action, along with other agencies and organisations, to work towards meeting the air quality objectives.

<a name="60320w01.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_0">Stockport MBC initially declared AQMAs for nitrogen dioxide (NO <sub>2</sub> ) and particles (PM <sub>1</sub>  <sub>0</sub> ) in December 2001. It was subsequently predicted that the national objective for particles would not in fact be exceeded in Stockport. A new AQMA declaration in July 2005 replaced the 2001 declaration, and relates to nitrogen dioxide only. The AQMA covers single roads and groups of roads and areas close to them across the borough, including some in the north of the borough, in the Denton and Reddish constituency. Stockport MBC, in conjunction with the other Greater Manchester local authorities, produced a joint air quality action plan (linked with the Greater Manchester Local Transport Plan) which was publicly consulted upon in June 2004; my Department also commented on the plan. The action plan includes a range of both Greater Manchester-wide and borough-specific measures. Stockport are now engaged in implementing measures to work towards meeting the air quality objectives. The measures are aimed at traffic reduction and modal shift from cars to other forms of transport and include park and ride/walk schemes, green travel plans, and quality bus corridors. In the most recent Greater Manchester Air Quality Action Plan Progress Report (2005), Stockport MBC reported that they were on schedule in implementing the majority of their borough-specific measures.

<a name="stpa_1">Greater Manchester authorities are now working closely with transport planners in finalising the new Local Transport Plan (LTP) which is due by the end of March 2006. Including measures within the LTP should also help increase the capacity to deliver cleaner air within the AQMAs.

 Recent research from the randomised badger culling trial (RBCT), together with the results from the Republic of Ireland&#039;s four area badger culling trial and other scientific evidence, has shown that culling badgers in hotspot areas can help reduce the incidence of disease in cattle. However, there is still enough scientific uncertainty&#151;in particular about the potential risk of increasing bovine TB in herds surrounding areas in which badgers have been culled and different culling strategies&#151;to make it important to consult on the principle as well as the method of badger controls.

<p><a name="st_20"><a name="60320w02.html_spnew11"><b> Mr. Thomas: </b> 
 DFID recognises that no serious strategy for achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) can fail to address gender equality and women&#039;s empowerment as a central concern. We are committed to full implementation of the Beijing declaration and platform for action, and DFID participated in the review of progress on implementation of Beijing commitments which took place at the UN&#039;s &#039;Beijing plus 10&#039; conference last spring. This meeting noted that progress had been made in improving the status of women and girls since the original conference in 1995 but that this progress had not been even across all areas and regions, and that considerable challenges remained. The conference called for strengthened efforts to implement the Beijing platform for action including critical areas such as health, education, tackling gender-based violence, economic empowerment and decision-making. The meeting also underlined the linkages between implementation of the Beijing commitments and achievement of the MDGs. These messages were reiterated by UN heads of state at the Millennium Review Summit in September.

<a name="stpa_20">As well as support to international processes, DFID is working to ensure that gender issues are made a priority area across our programme and that developing country partners integrate gender into their own national plans. DFID also supports specific activities to promote the rights of women and girls, including in the areas of girls&#039; education, maternal mortality and reproductive health.

<p>
<a name="60320w04.html_para3">
The first extant records of the collection date from 1898. Because of the uncertainty surrounding many of the old manual records no exact figure can be given for the number of missing works. Currently 636 are listed as missing. These are mostly prints of relatively low value. Analysis of the records of missing works indicate that most of the losses occurred before the early 1990s. A large proportion of these were reported as missing in the late 1980s as a result of improvements in recording. It is likely that most of these losses had happened many years earlier but had not been reported at the time. The completion of a decade-long period of computerisation of records and employment of a professional museum register in1991 has led to a radical improvement in inventory control and resultant reduction in missing works. Far fewer works go missing now&#151;within the last year there were two.

<i>[holding answer 16 March 2006]:</i> In the context of UK military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, the term insurgents&quot; generally refers to those violently opposing government authority and the rule of law in the particular country or countries where they live. Terrorists&quot; are those connected to a specific, named terrorist organisation which is recognised as such

 To ask the Secretary of State for Defence whether a D Notice was issued to restrict reporting of complaints from family of service personnel killed in Iraq that army vehicles had not been fixed with anti-roadside bomb detection and protective devices; and if he will make a statement.  [59842]</p>








<p><a name="st_52"><a name="60320w06.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 D Notices were replaced by the Defence Advisory (DA) Notice system in 1993. The DA Notice system is overseen by the Defence Press and Broadcasting Advisory Committee (DPBAC), a joint government/media body. The five standing DA Notices approved by the Committee (see www.dnotice.org.uk) provide the media with guidance on the areas of national security that need to be protected; they also provide the basis for prior negotiation in cases of dispute. The DA Notice code is purely voluntary and is not supported by any form of legal sanction. The five standing DA Notices are used by the DPBAC Secretary&#151;who administers the system on a day-to-day basis&#151;to provide further guidance to the media or officials about reporting on specific events or circumstances.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60320w06.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_35">On 3 September 2004 the then DPBAC Secretary wrote a general letter to editors on the subject of protective countermeasures used by British forces in Iraq. In it he acknowledged that it was widely known that the British forces in Iraq were employing various types of countermeasures to protect themselves against the roadside ambush techniques being used by Iraqi insurgents. He went on to advise that the publication or broadcasting of the specific details of these countermeasures would pose a real and serious danger to life&quot;.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60320w06.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_36">This was followed by two other general letters issued by the DPBAC Secretary to editors (respectively 22 August and 6 October 2005) repeating and elaborating the previous advice. All of these letters were written in response to developing concerns by British commanders that the publication or broadcasting of such details risked nullifying British countermeasures and thus increasing the risks faced by members of the British forces, not only in Iraq but also in other theatres.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60320w06.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_37">No DA Notice advice has ever been offered which attempts to restrict the reporting of complaints from families of Service personnel killed in Iraq that British Army vehicles had not been equipped with anti-roadside bomb detection and protective devices.

<p>
<a name="60320w06.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_38">The position of the 93 cases where the category is unclear could only be clarified by identifying and reviewing each of the claim files affected. This could only be done at disproportionate cost. Decisions under the civilian element of the scheme were suspended last year following a High Court judgement that the criteria for deciding whether a claimant met the nationality criteria had resulted in unlawful indirect discrimination. This judgement is the subject of an appeal by both sides that is due to be heard in the Court of Appeal early next month.

1. The term Catholic includes those respondents who gave their religion as Catholic or Roman Catholic.<br>

2. Cities included in this table are defined using the statutory settlement development limits provided by the DOE Planning Service as at March 2004. The Belfast Urban Area does not include the urban areas of Castlereagh, Newtownabbey or Greenisland. Newry City includes the settlement of Bessbrook.<br>

3. The boundaries for Banbridge and Newry & Mourne Local Government Districts in the 2001 Census are different from those in place at the time of the 1991 Census due to a boundary change in 1992.<br>

 The Get Safe Online campaign was launched the end of October 2005. The campaign is a joint public and private sector initiative to raise awareness of the internet security and to help people to go online line safely and with confidence.




<br>&nbsp;<br><i>20 Mar 2006 : Column 52W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>


<p>
<a name="60320w14.html_para6">
The Cabinet Office is a proud sponsor of the campaign alongside BT, Dell, eBay, HSBC, Lloyds TSB, Message Labs, Microsoft, securetrading and Yell.com. The Home Office, DTI, NISCC (National Infrastructure Security Coordination Centre) and the National Hi Tech Crime Unit&#151;soon to be part of SOCA (Serious and Organised Crime Agency) are also involved in the project.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60320w14.html_para7">
<a name="stpa_77">Get Safe Online is very much a collaboration amongst all these organisations. Government as well as online companies in the retail, finance and technology sectors all have an interest in ensuring that people know what to do to protect themselves, their families and their businesses whether they are shopping, banking or interacting with government online. In particular, as our Transformational Government Strategy states: Government will also play its part to promote public confidence by leading a public/private campaign on internet safety&quot;, a commitment that Get Safe Online is successfully meeting.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60320w14.html_para8">
<a name="stpa_78">The first phase of the campaign involved a PR campaign to raise awareness of the initiative and the website. A roadshow of internet security experts was taken round the major cities stopping at UK Online centres, shopping centres, colleges and libraries as well as Age Concern centres. There was also a competition through Metro newspapers around the country. The most prolific support for the campaign has been through the sponsors themselves. For example eBay, with over 13 million UK users a month, has given exposure to Get Safe Online on its website which would have cost in excess of &#163;10 million to date.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60320w14.html_para9">
<a name="stpa_79">This kind of campaign activity through the current sponsors will continue and we intend for the campaign to run for two to three years. A further phase of activity is planned over the next few months which entails online advertising as well as PR activity. Importantly, the initiative is gaining momentum and cooperation across community organisations and local government. Many local councils have put a link to Get Safe Online to help their cooperation from community organisations such as the NCPTA (National Council for Parent Teachers Associations) which is sending out a &#039;Parent&#039;s Guide&#039; to all secondary schools which will include advice and information from Get Safe Online later this month. Work continues to recruit new sponsors and partners to the initiative which is essential to maintaining the progress of the campaign and we hope to be able to make some important announcements in the summer about future plans.

In deciding between the offences, prosecutors must take into account the manner of the driving and the circumstances in which the driving took place when deciding how far the driving departed from the required standard. To prove a charge of causing death by dangerous driving, the law requires the prosecution to show that the driving fell far below what would be expected of a competent and careful driver and it would be obvious to a competent and careful driver that driving in that way was dangerous.

 The exact causes of the illness affecting a number of children and adults in Chechnya remain unclear. There is insufficient verifiable information to make an independent assessment of the situation. Russian Press reports refer to 93 cases, mostly in schoolgirls from Shelkovsk but some also in Grozny and Urus Martan. They have displayed a variety of symptoms, particularly neurological, spasms and fits, and respiratory, breathing difficulties and nosebleeds. The Russian authorities have sent experts in toxicology and forensic psychiatry from Moscow to the region. They consider that those affected are suffering from a form of hysteria associated with the extreme and chronic stress of the Chechen conflict and its aftermath. Some non-governmental organisations in the region assess there is a toxic cause. We understand that the World Health Organisation (WHO) has experience of a similar incident involving Albanian schoolchildren in Macedonia in 2002. After investigating that incident they found no evidence of poisoning and concluded that a form of mass hysteria was a plausible explanation. The WHO has not been asked for assistance in this case but remains in contact with the Chechen authorities. We continue to monitor these cases closely.

 The Foreign and Commonwealth Office in London and our embassy in Tehran maintain contact with a wide range of Iranians in many different fields. We are seriously concerned about human rights and political freedoms in Iran. Ministers and officials raise our concerns frequently with the Iranian authorities. We also take action through the EU, and in United Nations fora. We maintain a dialogue with those inside and outside the Iranian Government who are working to support reform and the rule of law. As my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary said in a speech at the International Institute of Strategic Studies on 13 March,

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_64">We will not take sides in Iran&#039;s internal political debates&#151;these are for Iranians to resolve and they are perfectly capable of doing so themselves. Given their history, Iranians are understandably sensitive about any hint of outside interference. But this does not mean that we should stop standing up for principles of human rights and fundamental freedoms which we hold dear to ourselves and which so many Iranians aspire to: freedom of speech; transparent, genuinely democratic and accountable government; respect for the rights of minorities and women; an independent judiciary&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>

</p>


<p>
<a name="60320w23.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_135">Ministers and officials have no contact with an organisation proscribed under the Terrorism Act, the Mujahedin-e Khalq (MEK), which purports to be a democratic opposition movement, nor with the National Council for the Resistance of Iran, a group with which it has close links. The MEK has been responsible for numerous attacks resulting in many deaths. Its claims to be a democratic party are hard to square with a history of violence and its authoritarian nature, and it has virtually no support inside Iran.

<p><a name="st_235"><a name="60320w26.html_spnew0"><b> Ian Pearson: </b> 
 We strongly supported the visit to China by the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture in November 2005. We welcomed the preliminary assessment of the Special Rapporteur&#039;s visit in a UN press release on 2 December 2005, and look forward to publication of his full report in the near future. The press release can be found on the UN website at: http://www.unhchr.ch/huricane/huricane.nsf/0/677C 1943FAA14D67C12570 CB0034966D?opendocument. The Government agree with the Special Rapporteur&#039;s assessment that torture in China, though on the decline, particularly in urban areas, remains widespread and that this is increasingly recognised by Chinese officials. We hope the Chinese Government will consider carefully the Rapporteur&#039;s recommendations when they issue with a view to making a wholehearted effort to implement them.

A limited visa service was re-opened in June 2002, firstly for urgent cases. The service was then gradually re-opened to students, applicants for settlement visas and visitors who had previously travelled to the UK in the previous five years and complied with the terms of their visas. The last category to re-open in Pakistan was first time visitors under 30 in May 2004, but due to capacity constraints this category was closed in July 2004, with a lowered age restriction of 25 with the exception of family visits.

Essex, as is the case for other local authorities, is responsible for funding accommodation, maintenance and other expenses (e.g. travel and leisure costs). Once care leavers reach 18, they are then entitled to have access to the same mainstream arrangements for obtaining financial help as other young people. It is the personal adviser&#039;s role to assist them to access this help.

 Following the meeting in March 2004, the Department for Education and Skills has been leading on work across Government to counter homophobia in our schools. Work on tackling homophobic bullying is one strand of this. As recommended by the Practitioners Group on Behaviour and Discipline, the recent White Paper committed the Department to producing specific guidance for schools on countering homophobic bullying as part of a suite of materials on prejudice driven bullying. We recently hosted a scoping meeting, involving leading experts from the fields of both anti-bullying and anti-homophobia, along with the professional associations and representatives from local authorities. The advice will be published during anti bullying week 2006, and between now and then we will be further consulting schools, local authorities and children and young people to inform its development.

It collates, summarises and assesses both peer reviewed research material, from this country and abroad, and less formal work conducted by bodies active in this area.It also reports the views of a wide range of organisations, 28 in all, with an interest in this area to paint a picture of how the issues are currently perceived.

<p><a name="st_272"><a name="60320w31.html_spnew0"><b> Jacqui Smith  </b> 
<i>[holding answer 16 March 2006]:</i> We have given careful consideration, in consultation with our national education partners, to the additional resources that schools might require in the financial years 2005&#150;06 and 2006&#150;07 to implement guaranteed planning, preparation and assessment (PPA) time for allteachers. This included a survey of real schools including those with relatively low funding, small schools, and those in rural areas, to gain a better understanding of their starting points, how they planned to deliver PPA and the extent to which they could achieve this through the redeployment of existing resources and the additional resources required.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60320w31.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_180">In the light of this, we concluded that there would be an average additional cost pressure for nursery and primary schools of 0.8 per cent. to 1 per cent. per pupil in 2005&#150;06 and 0.7 per cent. per pupil in 2006&#150;07. We reflected these extra pressures by setting the minimum funding guarantee for primary and nursery schools for 2005&#150;06 at 5 per cent. per pupil, compared with 4 per cent. per pupil for secondary and special schools and at 4 per cent. per pupil in 2006&#150;07, compared with 3.4 per cent. per pupil for secondary and special schools.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60320w31.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_181">The minimum increases for schools have been backed by substantial headroom at local authority level in each year, which authorities can use to support schools with particular pressures arising from PPA, including very small schools. In 2005&#150;06, Gloucestershire received an increase in its Schools Formula Spending Share of 6.9 per cent. per pupil, and for 2006&#150;07 it will receive an increase in its allocation of the new Dedicated Schools Grant of 6.8 per cent. per pupil (compared with its budgeted spending in 2005&#150;06). These increases equal the national average increase in each year. It is for each local authority, in consultation with its Schools Forum, to decide on the distribution of funding between the schools in its area.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60320w31.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_182">Nothing in the review of staffing structure process compels schools to incur additional expenditure. Any changes to the staffing structure, and the timing of the implementation of such changes, are within schools&#039; control, provided that they are implemented by 31 December 2008.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60320w31.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_183">We have made no specific assessment of the impact of either the Schools Staffing Structure Review or PPA on headteachers1 workloads in small schools. However, we are aware that both the implementation of PPA time and the review of school staffing structures were major tasks for headteachers and school leaders to manage last year. Of course, headteachers who have a teaching timetable, which is most common in small schools, will themselves benefit from PPA time.




<br>&nbsp;<br><i>20 Mar 2006 : Column 107W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>


<p>
<a name="60320w31.html_para4">
Headteachers will also benefit from other elements of our workforce reform programme, such as dedicated headship time for headteachers (introduced in September 2005) and the provisions on work/life balance (effective from September 2003). We are very conscious of the need to bear down on headteacher workload and, in response to a School Teachers&#039; Review Body recommendation, have announced an independent study into the roles, responsibilities, structures and rewards systems for the leadership group.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60320w31.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_184">We provided all headteachers with a great deal of guidance to help them implement PPA and review their staffing structure. On PPA, national guidance has been issued by the National Remodelling Team, and that has been backed up by practical advice and support from a national network of local authority based remodelling advisers. On the staffing structure review, I refer the hon.

 Promoters of new schools may bring forward proposals at any time in response to local parental demand. Before publishing proposals they must consult widely. The decision whether or not proposals are approved is made locally. Decision makers must have regard to guidance from the Secretary of State when considering proposals for new schools. The guidance requires them to take into account a range of factors, including the effect on standards, views of interested parties and the extent to which the proposals address the need to promote community cohesion. In particular, decision makers are required to consider any sex discrimination issues in relation to proposals for a single sex school.

 We will continue with the wide range of measures being introduced under our five year strategy. Through these measures we will speed up decision making, introduce tighter border control and new visa regimes and increasingly apply fast track processes to determine straightforward cases. For example, our continuing success in reducing asylum intake will enable us to process older cases and the Points Based System will introduce a more efficient application process.

 The police can apply to a magistrate&#039;s court for a risk of sexual harm order in respect of any adult aged 18 or over who, on at least two occasions, has engaged in sexually explicit conduct or communication with a child or children. The defendant does not need to have a conviction for a sexual or any other offence but, by virtue of section 127 of the Magistrates Courts Act 1980, at least part of the behaviour causing concern must have taken place in the six months prior to the application being made.

 A comprehensive strategy for tackling football disorder was introduced in the wake of the serious disorder during Euro 2000. The football banning order law and enforcement arrangements are the cornerstone of that strategy and have proved highly effective in helping to reduce levels of English and Welsh football disorder. The impact of banning orders and the wider strategy is detailed in a Home Office report Football (Disorder) Act 2000: Report to Parliament, copies of which were placed in the House Library on 20 January 2006.

The Department for Work and Pensions provides low-income figures for lone parent and couple families in the UK to the EU. The Department has not carried out specific research on equivalent figures for EU or G8 countries.

<a name="stpa_23">International comparisons are important because the Government aspire to be among the very best performers in Europe on child poverty, competing with the record of countries such as Sweden and Denmark. A focus on income before housing costs; as adopted in our Spending Review 2004 target; supports this, as this is used across other European Union countries.

<p>
<a name="60320w39.html_para9">
<a name="stpa_24">&quot;Measuring child poverty&quot;, published in December 2003, compares findings with our European Union counterparts. It showed that the UK had the highest child poverty rate in Europe in 1999 (29 per cent.) but, according to latest data for 2003, we are now closer to the EU average (23 per cent.). European comparisons are made using data from the European Household Panel Study, and are not comparable with figures using the Family Resources Survey. Data from 2003 remains the most up to date as this was the last year that data was produced for the UK using this dataset. UK comparisons across Europe will be measured using the European Union Survey of Income and Living Conditions (EUSILC) from autumn 2005.

The report also showed that the UK has made more progress on reducing child poverty than any other country in the OECD in the years from 1991 to 2000.

<p><a name="st_22"><a name="60320w39.html_spnew5"><b> Margaret Hodge: </b> 
 The exact level of in and out of work support that a lone parent will receive is dependent on their circumstances and income, including child support and housing tenure. These vary considerably among lone parents.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60320w39.html_para13">
<a name="stpa_28">Since 1997 the Government have made a number of improvements to the tax and benefit system to ensure that work pays. We have developed an effective strategy for helping more lone parents make the transition from benefits and into work which combines child care assistance, financial support for those entering work and provision of work focused advice and support.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60320w39.html_para14">
<a name="stpa_29">In 1998 we introduced the national minimum wage, which currently stands at &#163;5.05 per hour for those aged 22 and over. The child and working tax credits introduced in April 2003 will help tackle child poverty and make work pay for all families, including lone parents.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60320w39.html_para15">
<a name="stpa_30">A lone parent with two children, moving into work on the national minimum wage, with child care costs of &#163;80 per week, will be financially better off by around &#163;56 per week. This could be increased by any child support maintenance received, as this is disregarded in full for tax credit purposes.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60320w39.html_para16">
<a name="stpa_31">Generally, a lone parent who is not in work can access all relevant benefits&#151; though what they qualify for will depend on individual circumstances. The large majority of lone parents on benefit claim income support, housing benefit and council tax benefit. They will also receive child benefit. Their individual circumstances may also allow them to claim certain premiums within their income support entitlement, such as the disabled child or carer premiums. Being in receipt of income support also entitles them to free school meals for their children and free prescriptions and eye tests.

Notes:<br>

Patient counts:<br>

Patient counts are based on the unique patient identifier Hospital Episode Statistics identification (HESID). This identifier is derived based on patient&#039;s date of birth, postcode, sex, local patient identifier and NHS number, using an agreed algorithm. Where data are incomplete, HESID might erroneously link episodes or fail to recognise episodes for the same patient. Care is therefore needed, especially where duplicate records persist in the data. The patient count cannot be summed across a table where patients may have episodes in more than one cell.<br>

All diagnoses count of patients:<br>

These figures represent a count of all patients where the diagnosis was mentioned in any of the 14 (seven prior to 2002&#150;03) diagnosis fields in a Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) record.<br>

Diagnosis (primary diagnosis):<br>

The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 14 (seven prior to 2002&#150;03) diagnosis fields in the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data set and provides the main reason why the patient was in hospital.<br>

Secondary diagnoses:<br>

As well as the primary diagnosis, there are up to 13 (six prior to 2002&#150;03) secondary diagnosis fields in HES that show other diagnoses relevant to the episode of care.<br>

Primary care trust (PCI) and strategic health authority (SHA) data quality PCT and SHA data was added to historic data-years in the HES database using 2002&#150;03 boundaries, as a one- off exercise in 2004. The quality of the data on PCT of treatment and SHA of treatment is poor in 1996&#150;97, 1997&#150;98 and 1998&#150;99, with over a third of all finished episodes having missing values in these years. Data quality of PCT of general practitioner (GP) practice and SHA of GP practice in 1997&#150;98 and 1998&#150;99 is also poor, with a high proportion missing values where practices changed or ceased to exist. There is less change in completeness of the residence-based fields over time, where the majority of unknown values are due to missing postcodes on birth episodes. Users of time series analysis including these years need to be aware of these issues in their interpretation of the data.<br>

Ungrossed data:<br>

Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).<br>

PCTs should apply the principles outlined in the aforementioned publication to consider each case on its merits or to develop local criteria for patient transport services use.

 The new general medical services contract provides for practice patient lists to be either open or closed to new registrations. The Department does not therefore hold information of the number of practices who are claiming to have lists which are open but full. However, we do recognise that some practices may face capacity pressures and don&#039;t accept new registrations although they are not formally closed. The recent White Paper commits us to improving the closed list arrangements so that there is clarity for patients on whether a practice is open for new registrations. We intend to work with the NHS Employers and the British Medical Association to deliver that commitment.

Notes:<br>

1. Patient counts<br>

Patient counts are based on the unique patient identifier Hospital Episode Statistic identification (HESID). This identifier is derived based on patient&#039;s date of birth, postcode, sex, local patient identifier and NHS number, using an agreed algorithm. Where data are incomplete, HESID might erroneously link episodes or fail to recognise episodes for the same patient. Care is therefore needed, especially where duplicate records persist in the data. The patient count cannot be summed across a table where patients may have episodes in more than one cell.<br>

2. All diagnoses count of patients<br>

These figures represent a count of all patients where the diagnosis was mentioned in any of the 14 (seven prior to 2002&#150;03) diagnosis fields in a Hospital Episode Statistic (HES) record.<br>

3. Diagnosis (primary diagnosis)<br>

The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 14 (seven prior to 2002&#150;03) diagnosis fields in the HES data set and provides the main reason why the patient was in hospital.<br>

4. Secondary diagnoses<br>

As well as the primary diagnosis, there are up to 13 (six prior to 2002&#150;03) secondary diagnosis fields in HES that show other diagnoses relevant to the episode of care.<br>

5. Primary care trust (PCT) and strategic health authority (SHA) data quality<br>

PCT and SHA data was added to historic data-years in the HES database using 2002&#150;03 boundaries, as a one-off exercise in 2004. The quality of the data on PCT of treatment and SHA of treatment is poor in 1996&#150;97, 1997&#150;98 and 1998&#150;99, with over a third of all finished episodes having missing values in these years. Data quality of PCT of general practitioner (GP) practice and SHA of GP practice in 1997&#150;98 and 1998&#150;99 is also poor, with a high proportion missing values where practices changed or ceased to exist. There is less change in completeness of the residence-based fields over time, where the majority of unknown values are due to missing postcodes on birth episodes. Users of time series analysis including these years need to be aware of these issues in their interpretation of the data.<br>

<p><a name="st_113"><a name="60320w49.html_spnew8"><b> Jane Kennedy  </b> 
<i>[holding answer 13 March 2006]:</i> Strategic health authorities (SHAs) are responsible for the financial management of the organisations within their area and for delivering overall financial balance across the SHA. Where a primary care trust (PCT) is overspending the SHA can agree to provide the organisation additional resources in the form of repayable planned support. The support should be agreed during the annual planning stage and should only be provided to overspending organisations on the basis that they deliver a plan to recover their financial position over an agreed period.

<a name="stpa_84">SHA have discretion in how they operate the system of planned support. The Department does not specify whether they should charge or pay interest to PCT. In addition, since the SHA can only provide additional resources to an overspending organisation where another organisation underspends, the system of planned support operates on the basis of local agreement.

<a name="stpa_85">In 2006&#150;07, the Department has instructed SHAs that there should be no more provision of planned support.
