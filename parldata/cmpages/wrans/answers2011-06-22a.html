There has been no change to this policy since the government's announcement in August 2010 of its plans to disband the Commission.

1. These statistics are based on Low Income Dynamics (LID) data sourced from the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS). This uses disposable household income, adjusted using modified McClements equivalisation factors for household size and composition, as an income measure as a proxy for standard of living.

<i>Notes:</i>
1. Caseloads are rounded to the nearest 100.
2. Figures are based on 5% sample data. All figures are subject to a degree of sampling variation.
3. Numbers marked “*” are based on very few sample cases and are subject to a high degree of sampling variation, therefore these figures should be used as a guide only.
4. Caseload figures have been uprated by using 5% proportions against 100% Work and Pensions Longitudinal Study data.
5. Percentages are shown to the nearest whole number.
6. Income based only category includes hardship cases.

 Entitlement to employment and support allowance (ESA) is based on an assessment of functional capability, not on medical condition or diagnosis. The medical condition recorded on a claim form does not therefore in itself confer entitlement to ESA. So, for example, a decision on entitlement for a customer claiming ESA on the basis of Parkinson's disease would be based on their ability to carry out the range of activities assessed by the Work Capability Assessment. It is also important to note that, where someone has more than one diagnosis or disabling condition, only the predominant one is currently recorded.</p>

               <a name="11062262000505"> From April 2012 onwards, it is proposed that claimants of contributory ESA in the Assessment phase or Work Related Activity Group will have their contributory benefit time-limited to 12 months. However, for those who leave contributory ESA as a result of the time limit, it is estimated that around 60%, or approximately 400,000 people, are expected to be fully or partially compensated by income-related ESA, so will retain entitlement to ESA.</p>

1. Claimant count figures represent an average point-in-time caseload for each financial year.
2. These figures do not take into account any effect from the Work Programme.
3. These figures include the effects of recent welfare reforms, such as the reassessment of incapacity benefit claimants, which have a lesser effect on those aged 16-24.
4. Figures are subject to a significant degree of uncertainty.

                     <i>Notes:</i>
1. These statistics are based on Households Below Average Income (HBAI) data sourced from the Family Resources Survey (FRS). This uses disposable household income, adjusted using modified OECD equivalisation factors for household size and composition, as an income measure as a proxy for standard of living.
2. All estimates are based on survey data and are therefore subject to uncertainty. Small differences should be treated with caution as these will be affected by sampling error and variability in non-response.
3. The reference period for Households Below Average Income figures are single financial years. Three survey years have been combined as regional single year estimates are subject to volatility.
4. Numbers of children in low-income households have been rounded to the nearest 100,000, while proportions have been rounded to the nearest percentage point.
5. These statistics are based on incomes Before Housing Costs.
 6. These statistics are publicly available in the Households Below Average Income Report on the DWP website:
http://statistics.dwp.gov.uk/asd/index.php?paqe=hbai
7. Each of the measures is defined as:
Relative poverty is defined as children living in households with less than 60% of contemporary median household income.
Low Income and Material Deprivation: percentage of children living in households in material deprivation and with less than 70% of contemporary median household income.

1. These statistics are based on households below average income (HBAI) data sourced from the Family Expenditure survey (FES). FES uses disposable household income, adjusted using modified OECD equivalisation factors for household size and composition, as an income measure as a proxy for standard of living.
2. All estimates are based on survey data and are therefore subject to uncertainty. Small differences should be treated with caution as these will be affected by sampling error and variability in non-response.
3. FES figures are for the United Kingdom. These are single calendar years for 1981, and 1987; two combined calendar years from 1988 to 1991.
4. Numbers of children in low-income households have been rounded to the nearest 100,000, while proportions have been rounded to the nearest percentage point.
5. These statistics are based on incomes before housing costs.
6. Relative poverty is defined as children living in households with less than 60% of contemporary median household income.
7. These statistics are publicly available in the households below average income report on the DWP website:

 The responsibility for the conduct and delivery of elections, including the purchasing of all necessary equipment and software to run the polls, rests with locally appointed returning officers. The Government do not, therefore, have a role in the administration of individual elections on the ground. The Government's role is to maintain the legislative framework within which elections are run and to provide returning officers with funding for UK parliamentary and European parliamentary elections. It is therefore not the Government's role to promote competition directly among companies which provide electoral services, although we ensure that returning officers are aware of the need for value for money judgments to be made when purchasing equipment or procuring services for the conduct of the elections from suppliers.</p>

 In line with the recommendations of the NHS Future Forum, the Government intend to bring forward amendments to the Health and Social Care Bill to provide a more direct duty on clinical commissioning groups and on the NHS Commissioning Board to obtain advice from a wide range of health professionals, including those with expertise in the protection and improvement of public health.</p>

The Department also intends to bring forward more specific proposals in response to the recent public health consultation on how to ensure that public health professionals, in partnership with NHS commissioners, play a key role in providing leadership to drive improvements in quality and patient outcomes and to reduce health inequalities.</p>

               <a name="11062262000843"> Under our proposed amendments to the Health and Social Care Bill, all clinical commissioning groups will have a governing body with decision-making powers. We do not intend to prescribe in detail the professional membership of governing bodies, but they will have to include at least one registered nurse and one doctor who is a secondary care specialist. The main function of the governing body will be to ensure that commissioning groups are run in a way that ensures effective stewardship of public resources and effective decision-making. This will include ensuring that the group obtains advice from the appropriate range of health professionals.</p>

 On 28 March 2011, High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), Valentin Inzko, used his executive powers to issue a decision temporarily suspending two decisions of the Central Election Commission relating to the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (FBiH) House of Peoples and to the election of the President and Vice-Presidents of the FBiH. This decision was taken following consultations with the Peace Implementation Council of which the United Kingdom is a member. The High Representative made clear that the decision was needed to enable the vital functions of government to continue without legal ambiguity pending an anticipated deliberation of the Federation Constitutional Court (although the relevant requests for legal review have since been withdrawn by the politicians concerned). The Government fully support the High Representative, including in this application of his executive powers.</p>

 Officials from our high commission in New Delhi made one of their regular visits to Indian-administered Kashmir last month. Indian- administered Kashmir is calmer compared to last summer when over 100 civilians died during violent protests. The improvement is in part due to actions taken by the security forces and the Indian Government since last year. Local elections have also enabled people to address grievances through the ballot box. The Indian Government have increased engagement with those in Srinagar through the appointment of three interlocutors to make recommendations for a political solution.</p>

We have discussed our obligations at NPT Review Conferences and Preparatory Committees, the Conference on Disarmament, the UN's Disarmament Commission and First Committee, in bilateral ministerial and senior official meetings, and via videoconference.

 The indicative maximum noise level of a wind farm at 350 metres (1,150 feet) is usually roughly comparable to the sound of leaves rustling in a gentle breeze. The method of assessing the noise impact of a wind farm locally is described in ‘The assessment and rating of noise from wind farms’, ETSU-R-97, by the Working Group on Noise from Wind Turbines for the Department of Trade and Industry. We have no plans to change the noise limits that ETSU-R-97 recommends, and will shortly publish a report which investigates matters arising in the consideration of noise impacts in the determination of wind farm planning applications in England.</p>

               <i>[holding answer 17 June 2011]:</i> It is a matter for individual higher education institutions (HEIs) to decide whether they wish to charge a student the maximum amount allowed for tuition in such circumstances. We would expect an HEI to make clear to the student the level of tuition charge that would apply if they enter in 2012/13 so that the student can take this into account in deciding whether to accept a deferred place.</p>

                     <sup>(1)</sup> For the purposes of their funding allocations, the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) treat entrants from the most disadvantaged 40% of neighbourhoods as ‘disadvantaged’:
http://www.hefce.ac.uk/widen/fund/
HEFCE uses two different groupings of areas to define disadvantage which are based on the historic levels of participation or qualification in higher education by the local population: one based on the participation rates of young (19 and under) people in higher education (HE) (which is used by HEFCE when looking at young full-time entrants); and one based on the proportion of adults in the area who hold HE qualifications (which is used by HEFCE when looking at part-time and mature full-time entrants). Because this table includes applicants and accepted applicants of all ages disadvantage is defined by the HE qualified adults measure.

 There is no general requirement in the United Kingdom or the European Union law for goods to bear marks indicating their origin, nor is there anything to prevent voluntary origin marking. However, where such marks are applied to goods, the consumer protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008 requires that these marks are not false or misleading. The regulations also prohibit traders from omitting material information which the average consumer needs, according to the context, to make an informed choice.</p>

We promote the visual security of data through our arrangements for information security within the office and our policy on remote working. We have issued guidance on working on documents, laptops and other mobile devices in public places and the risk of being overlooked. This includes urging staff to question whether they really need to take information out of the office and to obtain permission from a senior manager if this involves more sensitive information. This guidance is being given greater prominence in a forthcoming upgrade of our intranet pages, which will be promoted in a security awareness campaign.</p>

However, It is important to note that these data have been extracted from large administrative data systems generated by the courts and police forces. As a consequence, care should be taken to ensure data collection processes and their inevitable limitations are taken into account when those data are used.

                     <sup>(1 )</sup>The figures given in the table relate to persons for whom these offences were the principal offences for which they were dealt with. When a defendant has been found guilty of two or more offences it is the offence for which the heaviest penalty is imposed. Where the same disposal is imposed for two or more offences, the offence selected is the offence for which the statutory maximum penalty is the most severe.

However, it is important to note that these data have been extracted from large administrative data systems generated by the courts and police forces. As a consequence, care should be taken to ensure data collection processes and their inevitable limitations are taken into account when those data are used.
