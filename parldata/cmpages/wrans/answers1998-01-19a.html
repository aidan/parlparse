To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will amend the Building Regulations to comply with section 104 of the Water Industries Act 1991 to ensure that all sewers are built by developers to an adoptable standard. [22841]
<P>

<P>
<a name="80119w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 There are no plans to amend the Building Regulations to require that all sewers are built to a standard necessary for them to be adopted under an agreement made under section 104 of the Water Industry Act 1991. However, in 1986, the Department of the Environment in conjunction with the Welsh Office carried out a review of water and sewerage law and considered the automatic adoption of all new sewers undertakers. It was concluded that this could not be implemented as it would have involved vesting existing private sewers with the water authorities of the time and would have placed an undue financial burden on them and hence their customers.

<P>
<a name="80119w01.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 I regret that this information is not available in the format requested and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost. The accident reporting regime changed in 1996 when the Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations 1995 came into effect. In addition, accidents are recorded not by train route but by which company reported the accident. In the majority of cases, this is Railtrack, as infrastructure controller, even where Railtrack staff were not involved in the accident. Accidents are recorded against relevant Railtrack zones. The West Coast Main Line covers several such zones and some of the boundaries have changed since the creation of Railtrack in April 1994.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions how many local authorities are expected to be brought into liability for VAT by exceeding the 5 per cent. de minimis partial exemption limit; and how he intends that the additional cost to such authorities will be funded. [22992]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80119w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The provisional Local Government Revenue Finance Settlement for 1998-99 takes into account local authorities' VAT liability for their statutory responsibilities. The previous Government introduced a change in VAT partial exemption rules which affected VAT liability on local authorities' exempt business activities. This came into effect on 1 April 1997, in order to ensure that local authorities accurately account for VAT and are treated on a similar basis to the private sector. Local authorities calculate the extent to which they have exceeded the 5 per cent. limit on an annual basis, and must make an adjustment in the next VAT return after the year end. The effects of the change in VAT partial exemption rules will not therefore be known until 1998-99.
<P>

<a name="80119w01.html_para0">We expect councils to find the budget for any effects of this change from within their provision for 1998-99.

 The adoption of a voluntary code of practice aimed at improving the level of service to those customers who lose property in the course of a rail journey is currently being considered by the train operating companies who lease the majority of stations, and by Railtrack who manage the 14 major stations on the network. It is expected that it will come into operation in the spring.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what are the latest results of his Department's research into rain penetration in cavity walls. [24238]
<P>

<P>
<a name="80119w03.html_spnew1"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 On behalf of the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions the Building Research Establishment has undertaken research into water penetration in cavity walls filled with insulation.
<P>

<a name="80119w03.html_para1">As part of my Department's ongoing programme of research into rain penetration in cavity walls, I have, in consultation with my hon. Friends the Minister for London and Construction and the Minister for Local Government and Housing, asked for precautionary checks to be carried out on the condition of galvanised steel wire wall ties in a representative sample of homes with cavity walls filled with insulation. This follows the preliminary results of research which indicate that there is a possibility that the life expectancy of green coloured galvanised steel wire wall ties might be shortened when used in conjunction with Urea Formaldehyde foam cavity fill. The tests were undertaken on dwarf walls without the protective features found in real houses. I wish, therefore, to establish whether the effects indicated in the BRE research occur in real houses.
<P>

<a name="80119w03.html_para2">I want to stress that there is no conclusive evidence of a safety risk involving galvanised steel wire wall ties in cavity wall insulation. But it would be wrong if, as a result of the preliminary findings, we did not investigate quickly and thoroughly whether or not the possible problems with green coloured galvanised steel wire wall ties in some cavity fills were occurring in people's homes. This is a prudent, precautionary measure and I have asked that further research be carried out as soon as possible.
<P>

<a name="80119w03.html_para3">The expert, independent, advice I have received from the BRE is that, while it believes that its initial findings indicate the need for a wider study, it is strongly of the view that it would be premature to place any firm interpretation on its findings until it can be established whether they are representative of conditions in the UK housing stock.
<P>

<a name="80119w03.html_para4">While the number of homes containing galvanised wire wall ties with a green film, in cavity wall insulation, is a small portion of the housing stock, it is prudent to carry out these precautionary checks which will be extended to examine other forms of galvanised wire wall ties in cavity fill.
<P>

<a name="80119w03.html_para5">BRE's test results show:

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what is the Government's policy on the purchasing for use by Government departments and agencies of <i>(a)</i> Brazilian mahogany and <i>(b)</i> other endangered timber; how the policy is implemented and monitored; in what form the results of that monitoring are published; and if he will make a statement. [23847]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80119w03.html_spnew5"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 Decisions on the procurement of goods and services, including timber or related products, are the responsibility of individual Departments. Departments must have regard to the need to secure best value for the taxpayers' money, to EU and other international rules on procurement and to their strategies for environmentally friendly housekeeping. In pursuing these aims, Departments can be expected to seek timber from sustainable sources where practicable. My Department's <i>Green Guide for Buyers Part 1: Policy and Practice</i>, which I have commended to Green Ministers in other Departments, requires minimum use of virgin materials, and the Department seeks as far as possible to purchase wood only from sources verified as sustainable. Costa Rica and Bolivia have listed their populations of Brazilian Mahogany in Appendix III of CITES (the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species) and Brazil has consulted on a proposal to do the same. The importation of this species into the EU requires an export permit or a certificate from the country of origin. Importers are required to complete a notification in order to help monitoring of the levels of trade.

<P>
<a name="80119w05.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B>

<P>

<a name="80119w05.html_para5">Under certain circumstances, where animal test data are submitted to regulatory authorities, there may be statutory obligations to share this data with third parties.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80119w05.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 Two prosecutions have been initiated since 1987.

In the other instance, charges were brought in 1997. This case is still before the courts.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what changes will be required to the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 to comply with the terms of the Government's White Paper on Freedom of Information. [22958]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80119w05.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 The Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 is one of a number of Acts which contain statutory bars to the disclosure of information. Section 24 of the Act prevents the disclosure of information given in confidence. The Government have announced that they will be reviewing such statutory bars to decide whether they should remain or should be amended to bring them into line with the "substantial harm" and "public interest" tests proposed in the White Paper on Freedom of Information: "Your Right to Know" (Cm 3818). No decisions have yet been made concerning individual Acts.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make it his policy to increase substantially the penalties available for failure to adhere to the conditions laid down as part of project licences under the Animal (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. [22959]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80119w05.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 The available penalties are set out in the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. These include variation or revocation of licences (section 11); suspension of licences (section 13); and, upon conviction under section 22 of the Act, imprisonment or a fine. The maximum term of imprisonment is two years on conviction on indictment or six months on summary conviction. Variation of a licence may include changes to the authorities granted (such as removing authority to carry out certain protocols) or the addition of special conditions. We have no plans to change these provisions of the Act.
<P>

<a name="80119w05.html_para10">In addition to these penalties, administrative measures can be taken such as admonition, or a requirement that licensees attend a training course. The latter can be formalised by the variation of the licence by the addition of a special condition.
<P>

<a name="80119w05.html_para11">All infringements of the Act are reported to the Animal Procedures Committee which reviews the level of penalties imposed and advises on whether these were appropriate. It remains Home Office policy to impose penalties primarily to prevent recurrence of the infringement of the Act.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many animals bred or otherwise obtained for use in animal experimentation in 1996 were subsequently killed without being so used; and what this was as a percentage of animals used. [22951]

<P>

<a name="80119w05.html_para12">Types of animal which are not listed in Schedule 2 to the 1986 Act can be bred within non-designated establishments. Surplus animals can be humanely killed in such establishments without authority under the terms of the 1986 Act.
<P>

<a name="80119w05.html_para13">The Home Office cannot therefore collate, or even estimate, the number of animals bred for use in scientific procedures but which were killed without being used.
<P>

<a name="80119w05.html_para14">Changes to the Act would be needed if statistics of this nature were to be collected and there are no plans to make any such changes.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what steps he is taking <i>(a)</i> within the EU and <i>(b)</i> within the UN to discourage animal experimentation. [22953]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80119w05.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 The United Kingdom takes an active role with its partners in Europe to ensure the implementation of the provisions of European Directive 86/609/EEC on the approximation of laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the member states regarding the protection of animals used for experimental and other scientific purposes.
<P>

<a name="80119w05.html_para15">There is no forum within the United Nations for discussing the use of animals in scientific procedures. However, links with other countries (including a number of non-European Union countries) exist through the Council of Europe and the European Convention ETS123 for the Protection of Vertebrate Animals used for Experimental and other Scientific Purposes.
<P>

<a name="80119w05.html_para16">The Directive, the Convention and the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 require that animals be used only where this is justified and where alternative methods of achieving the objective of the programme of work are not available.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what research his Department has <i>(a)</i> commissioned and <i>(b)</i> evaluated concerning the reliability of the results derived from animal testing and their applicability in respect of humans. [22963]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80119w05.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 No research has been commissioned by the Home Office, but account is taken of species differences in the design of experiments, in the range of animal species used, and in the correlation of animal-based data with other experimental data. This includes, where appropriate, that produced in human trials.
<P>

<a name="80119w05.html_para17">The requirement to carry out safety tests using animals, the nature of the tests and the way the results are analysed and interpreted are the responsibility of other Government Departments and other international regulators, not the Home Office.

 The Government are concerned about the continued remand of boys to prison which is a long-standing issue which the last Government failed to resolve. This Government's policy is to move to a situation where it is no longer necessary to remand 15 and 16 years olds to prison. I set out the background in detail in my answer to the hon. Member for Hertsmere (Mr. Clappison) on 12 January 1998, <i>Official Report,</i> columns <i>64-66.</i> We have reviewed this whole difficult area and decided that the priority is to give the courts the right range of powers to remand juveniles to secure accommodation, and there are provisions within the Crime and Disorder Bill to achieve this. The proposals do not apply to 17 year olds who are treated as adults for remand purposes. There is no proposal to change the remand arrangements for this older age group.
<P>

<a name="80119w06.html_para0">We hope that the outcome of the current review of the secure juvenile estate and the work which the Prison Service is currently doing will enable us to end the practice of detaining juveniles with adults.

<a name="80119w06.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 There is no reliable estimate of the number of illegal firearms in this country. The primary purpose of the 1997 legislation, especially the banning of handguns, is to provide greater safeguards for the safety of the public, given that the shootings at Dunblane and Hungerford were committed using lawfully held weapons. In 1996, there were 294 incidents in which handguns were stolen or otherwise misappropriated so the ban will remove a significant supply of weapons for use in crime.

 We have discussed this issue with UK-based agencies working with Bulgarian orphanages.

We are funding a &#163;250,000 project with this aim, to be managed by the Save the Children Fund (UK). We have provided a total of &#163;359,000 to UK-based agencies and the Bulgarian Red Cross for relief programmes with vulnerable families and institutions and are supporting social homes and orphanages through small grants. We have also contributed about &#163;2 million to the European Union's Emergency Social Assistance and Humanitarian Office Programmes in Bulgaria.

Section 125 of the Employment Rights Act 1996 provides for special awards in cases of unfair dismissal for Trade Union activities and in cases where the employer has failed to comply with an order for reinstatement.

 A consultation paper, "Crown copyright in the Information Age", has been published today (Cm 3819). The Green Paper sets out a number of options for the future management of Crown copyright on which comments are invited by 31 March 1998. The Green Paper takes account of various representations received over the last year and meetings which officials have had with representatives of the UK Information Industries.
<P>

<P>

<a name="80119w10.html_para2">The Government look forward to receiving comments on the options and questions aired in the Green Paper. At the end of the consultation period, the Government will announce their conclusions. It is our clear intention, however, to place the management of Crown copyright on a simplified and sure footing which will serve the citizen and user of government-originated material well. The demands of the Information Age, with electronic delivery increasingly substituting for print on paper, requires a new approach. This Green Paper provides the basis for devising that approach.

 <i>[holding answer 22 December 1997]:</i> The Armed Forces require about 25,000 new recruits each year to maintain the trained manpower requirement, and to meet the annual rate of outflow both in terms of resignations and natural wastage. The numbers of personnel who left the Armed Forces under Premature Voluntary Release (PVR) terms in 1996-97, and the numbers recruited from civil life by Service that year, are shown in the table:

(7) The comparison figures for the Naval Service and RAF are, to an extent, exaggerated because of the Defence Cost Study redundancy programmes, resulting in a lowering of the trained requirement.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence, pursuant to his answer to the hon.

[22637]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80119w10.html_spnew9"><B> Dr. Reid: </B> 
 The three trawlers used for specific intelligence gathering operations in the mid-60s and early 1970s were MV Arctic Galliard, MV Lord Nelson and MV Invincible. All were owned by Hull-based companies, and almost certainly operated from that port. The MV Gaul was not involved in any such activity either before or at the time of her loss in 1974.
<P>

<a name="80119w10.html_para5">More generally, personnel did occasionally embark on trawlers, during which time they were encouraged to report back any opportunity sightings of interest, as indeed were the trawlermen themselves. While we can assume that this did not necessarily centre on Hull-based vessels, there are no records to indicate whether trawlers or trawlermen from other ports were involved.

 It has been the practice of successive Administrations not to release details of military assistance provided to other countries on the grounds that this information has been considered confidential between Governments, and that disclosure would risk damaging our international relations.

 The Army Prosecuting Authority operates under the general superintendence of the Attorney-General.

These tests are essentially the same as those applied by the Crown Prosecution Service. It is of course, quite proper for the APA to give consideration to any legal issue which arises in a given case, whatever the source that alerts him to it.<P>

<a name="80119w12.html_para0">Table 1 shows the number of animals weaned by the breeding unit at CBD, the number of animals issued from the unit and the number of animals culled by the Unit. This information is shown for the financial (not calendar) year. The numbers of animals (mice, rats, marmosets and Rhesus) issued represent those for scientific use at CBD and sales of surplus animals for scientific use at other establishments; the number of animals retained for replenishment of breeding stock is not shown in this table. Surplus pigs are sent to the local market; the figures do, however, include a small number kept for breeding at CBD. The number of animals weaned is not necessarily equal to the total of the number issued and the number of surplus stock culled in any one year. The discrepancies may be due to the occurrence of natural deaths or to the fact that animals, especially the Rhesus monkeys and marmosets, may not be issued until they are between 12 and 24 months old.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The number of rats and mice culled is high, but in line with commercial operation. This is due to stringent experimental requirements, such as the use of single sex or narrow weight ranges. However, with the exception of 1994-1995, no Rhesus monkeys or marmosets have been culled. The marmosets were culled due to a very low usage at CBD and an unexpected fall in demand elsewhere. Table 1 shows that the breeding of marmosets was, therefore, significantly reduced in subsequent years.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Alternatives must be fully considered when drawing up a project licence application. At CBD each project licence application is subjected to an internal peer group ethical review. The meeting is open to all members of staff, the details of the licence application are briefly presented and then the meeting is open to debate on both scientific and ethical concerns. One of the major aims is to ensure that the '3Rs' have been addressed, i.e., Reduction, Replacement and Refinement. The review can result in an application being completely rejected, held over subject to improvements being made or approved for submission to the Home Office.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The review procedure is in line with the outcome of a Home Office Supplementary Note 'Interim report on the review of operation of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986' dated 6 November 1997 which emphasises the requirement that applicants for new project licences must demonstrate that they have sought alternatives before the use of animals is proposed.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>With respect to initiatives since 1995, a new in vitro toxicology laboratory has been commissioned at CBD Porton. The use of in-vitro cell and tissue culture models allows innovative research to identify novel medical countermeasures and examine the potential hazards and the mechanism of action of chemical and non-chemical agents. Similar models are also used in research to investigate treatment regimes and prospective protective and decontaminating compounds for use in a chemical warfare environment.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The UK government participates, whenever possible, in collaborative research programmes which involve a sharing of data and, indeed, results from the UK research programme have been shared with other NATO members.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80119w13.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. George Robertson: </B> 
 The latest estimated procurement cost of the Eurofighter programme is &#163;42.8 billion, &#163;15.9 billion of which is the estimated cost to the UK. This is some 37 per cent. of the total. For the Production phase, UK work share will be approximately 37.5 per cent. This is based on the number of aircraft we are buying in relation to the other nations. Present plans are for each nation to be responsible for the maintenance of their respective aircraft and we therefore expect the majority of maintenance work on the RAF's aircraft to be conducted in the UK. Currently, there are about 6,000 high technology jobs sustained by the development phase of the Eurofighter programme in the UK. This figure is expected to rise to about 14,000 at the peak of production.

<a name="80119w15.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Banks: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend has a statutory duty to compile lists of buildings of special architectural or historic interest. English Heritage, his statutory advisers on listing, are currently undertaking a thematic study of military airfields and will be making recommendations to me later this year on buildings and structures at such sites which merit listing. Consent is required before any works can be undertaken to a listed building which would affect its special interest. In addition, the Defence of Britain Project, co-ordinated by the Council for British Archaeology, is compiling a record of 20th Century military sites and structures in the UK, although inclusion on the record will not attract any additional statutory protection.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80119w15.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Banks: </B> 
 The reply relates to England only. Government financial assistance for the repair of historic religious buildings in use is channelled principally via English Heritage's church and cathedral grant schemes. Funding for historic places of worship is also available from the Heritage Lottery Fund. In addition, my Department provides 70 per cent. of the funding of the Churches Conservation Trust, which preserves outstanding Anglican churches no longer in use for worship, and contributes (both directly and by way of

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will make a statement on the measures being taken by <i>(a)</i> the Valuation Office and <i>(b)</i> the Valuation Office in the Bristol area to reduce the avoidance of business rates on outdoor advertising sites. [22173]

<a name="80119w16.html_spnew0"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 Valuation Officers in England and Wales are responsible for including all rateable business uses in local rating lists and have been reviewing the position with outdoor advertising sites for some months. In the Bristol area, the review has been under way for some time similarly and a number of missing sites have been identified and will be assessed for rates by the Valuation Officer accordingly.

 <i>[holding answer 22 December 1997]:</i> At present, some social security benefits are taxable (including widow's benefit, retirement pension, jobseeker's allowance and incapacity benefit), while some are not (income-related benefits such as income support, housing benefit, council tax benefit, child benefit, disability living allowance/attendance allowance). In addition, incapacity benefit for all new cases since 1995 has been taxable.

It has been split to show each country within the EU, but for non-EU only 6 countries have been illustrated with the remainder grouped. This is in line with similar data that was produced in an article in the ONS publication <i>Economic Trends,</i> entitled 'Globalisation: Scope, Issues & Statistics'--Table 9 in No. 528 November 1997. That data was however based on agriculture, manufacturing and distribution rather than whole economy.

 The ONS recalculates weights for the constituent elements of the Retail Prices Index (RPI) at the start of each year using the latest available figures from the Family Expenditure Survey (FES). For example, from February 1998, the RPI weights will use information from the FES for the period July 1996 to June 1997. This allows the ONS to reflect the most up to date spending patterns available and to introduce new goods and services into the index.

 Goods imported into the UK normally bear VAT at the standard rate (17.5 per cent.). Under the terms of EC law introduced in 1995, certain works of art, antiques and collector's pieces imported into the UK are eligible until 30 June 1999 for an effective rate of VAT at importation of 2.5 per cent. After that date, the UK should increase the VAT rate to at least the normal minimum effective reduced rate of 5 per cent.
<P>

<a name="80119w17.html_para1">During 1998, the EC Commission is expected to review the effects of the relevant EC legislation on the competitiveness of the Community art markets compared to third countries' art markets.

 This Department works closely with the Department of Trade and Industry and the Ministry of Defence to ensure that the UK remains in full compliance with its obligations under the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), which the United Kingdom ratified in 1996, and to promote the universality and effective implementation of the Treaty. This involves coordinating and preparing positions for, and leading the UK Delegation at, the periodic Conferences of States Parties of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) in The Hague; and preparation for and attendance at the regular meetings of the OPCW's Executive Council.

In time the age of an increasing number of slaughtered animals will be known as a system of cattle passports, which record birth and death details, was introduced in Great Britain on 1 July 1996.

<a name="80119w22.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Laurence Robertson: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what assessment the European Commission has made of the advantages of banning beef exports from countries which have detected BSE in their cattle. [23360]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80119w22.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The European Commission has banned exports of beef from the UK, but has not banned exports from other Member States which have reported cases of BSE. The Commission takes advice on BSE related issues from the Scientific Steering Committee. Summaries of the proceedings of that Committee are published on the Internet at: http://europa.eu.int/en/comm/dg24/scientif/ ncomm0/index.html

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what consultations he has had, and with whom, concerning the adoption of a secondary button tag on cattle, and what decision he has made. [22988]
<P>

<P>
<a name="80119w22.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 Consultations have been held with the Joint Industry/Government Working Group on animal identification, with individual UK eartag manufacturers and the relevant services of the European Commission. Guidance will be provided to cattle keepers once a decision has been taken on which eartags will be approved for use in the UK for identifying cattle. In the meantime, all eartags on the current approved list can be used.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food if he plans to use the plastic secondary tag on cattle as a means of electronic identification. [23038]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80119w22.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 EU legislation on identification of cattle requires visual identification through the use of approved eartags and does not require compulsory electronic tagging of animals. However, there are no obstacles to preclude eartags being adapted to incorporate electronic devices and the Government welcome such initiatives by the Industry.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80119w23.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 Beef farmers in all EU Member States, including the UK, may apply for subsidies under two EU-funded headage Schemes. The Suckler Cow Premium (SCP) Scheme provides an annual payment in respect of female breeding animals, while the Beef Special Premium (BSP) Scheme provides either one or two payments in respect of each male animal fattened for slaughter. Automatic "extensification" payments are made under both schemes to claimants with stocking rates below set levels. Additional EU-funded SCP payments are made to producers in geographical areas within the Union, including Northern Ireland, which meet certain economic and agricultural criteria. Limited nationally funded SCP payments are also made in some Member States. A Deseasonalisation Premium, designed to encourage a more even pattern of slaughterings throughout the year, may also be paid to producers in Member States where concentration of slaughtering in a certain time frame has historically proved a problem. All EU producers in Less Favoured Areas may additionally claim under national schemes (part-EU funded) designed to offset the structural handicap they face. In the UK, payments are made per head of eligible breeding cow under the Hill Livestock Compensatory Allowances scheme.

The volume of imports allowed under these concessionary schemes amount to only 5 per cent. of total community production.
