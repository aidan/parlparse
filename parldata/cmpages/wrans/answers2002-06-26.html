<P>
<a name="20626w01.html_spnew0"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 The G8 leaders are meeting in Kananaskis today and tomorrow so it is too early to be able to comment on the outcome of discussion of the G8 Action Plan for Africa. The UK is putting forward specific proposals in the key areas of conflict, education, health, development assistance, debt and trade.

<P>
18. <a name="20626w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Clifton-Brown: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development if she will make a statement on the G8 summit in respect of international aid.  [62485]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20626w01.html_spnew1"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 The G8 Summit is addressing a number of issues of vital significance to developing countries. These include: conflict reduction; trade; debt relief; universal primary education; health, including affordable essential medicines; the effectiveness of development assistance; and support for Afghanistan. A G8 Action Plan for Africa is being drawn up, with the aim of responding to African countries' own efforts to pursue policies aimed at the elimination of poverty and reverse the economic marginalisation of their continent.
<P>

<a name="20626w01.html_para0">International aid in support of these initiatives should be available from the additional money promised by G8 countries, and the European Union, at the International Conference on Financing for Development in Monterrey last March. But G8 action in support of poverty elimination requires more than just additional aid. Significant progress also needs to be made in areas such as free-trade access and the reduction of G8 countries' agricultural subsidies. It is essential that G8 countries meet all the commitments they made at Monterrey.

 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development if she will make a statement on the provision of bilateral aid to Cuba.  [62475]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20626w01.html_spnew2"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 We do not have a bilateral aid programme to Cuba, we provide small scale support. The Scheme is appreciated by the Cuban authorities and has recently supported financial management training, export promotion environmental management and organic agriculture. Our share of the EC development programme is $2.6 million per annum which is drawn from the Department for International Development budget.

 This year, we plan to provide &#163;16 million to Ukraine, of which half will be through our direct programme and half as our contribution to multilateral agencies, particularly the European Commission Tacis programme. In Belarus, where our programme is limited due to poor government, we expect to provide &#163;0.8 million mostly as our share of the EC Tacis programmes.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20626w01.html_spnew4"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 The causes of food shortages in Southern Africa this year are drought and misgovernment. In Zimbabwe, which accounts for over half of the region's food aid requirements, economic mismanagement and grossly misorganised land reform have massively exacerbated the effects of the drought.
<P>

<a name="20626w01.html_para1">The World Food Programme will next week launch a regional appeal for food for Zimbabwe, Zambia, Malawi, Mozambique, Lesotho and Swaziland. They estimate that four million tons of cereal imports will be needed. 2.8 million to be provided by private sector and government imports, and 1.2 million tons through food aid will be distributed free.

<P>
13. <a name="20626w01.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Weir: </B>

<P>
<P>
<a name="20626w01.html_spnew5"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 We have allocated &#163;18.75 million in response to the World Food Programme regional appeal for six countries in southern Africa for immediate food purchases. This is part of an overall allocation of &#163;45 million through international organisations and NGOs for food and inputs for the next planting season. We will review our commitment as the relief programme proceeds.

 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development how her Department is working with the EU to reduce delays in delivering debt relief due under the HIPC initiative to poor countries.  [62478]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20626w01.html_spnew8"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 In 1999, the UK helped to secure, through the European Union, a pledge of 1 billion euros towards debt relief for the heavily indebted poor countries (HIPC), from the European Development Fund (EDF). This was to be provided in the form of 680 million euros for the HIPC trust fund and 320 million euros in debt relief for the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries' debts owed to the European Investment Bank (EIB). To date 650 million euros have been spent, with a further 300 million euros planned for disbursement this year.

<P>
17. <a name="20626w01.html_wqn9"><B> David Taylor: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development how her Department will ensure that poor countries which do not qualify for the opportunity of HIPC debt relief achieve sustainable debt funding.  [62484]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20626w01.html_spnew9"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 Countries that are not eligible for debt relief under the heavily indebted poor countries (HIPC) initiative can still achieve sustainable debt levels through the traditional debt relief mechanisms available. This includes a stock-of-debt operation under Naples terms (up to 67 per cent. cancellation of debt) by the Paris Club and comparable treatment by non-Paris Club official bilateral and commercial creditors. To qualify for HIPC relief, a country must be judged to have an unsustainable debt after the full application of traditional debt relief measures, and to have met the other HIPC requirements. It is therefore possible for countries, as in the case of the Comoros, the Gambia and Malawi, to be added to the list of HIPC countries, depending on their circumstances.

<P>

 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what steps she is taking to ensure that development funding for the Palestinian Authority is not used to support terrorism.  [62479]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20626w01.html_spnew12"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 Our bilateral development programme in the west bank and Gaza Strip is largely technical assistance, funded through, and managed by, a range of local and international organisations on behalf of Palestinian beneficiaries. Commissioner Patten has stressed that the Commission has investigated Israeli claims about European Commission (EC) support and found no evidence to corroborate the allegations that EC funds have been misused to finance terrorist activities; or for anything other than their original purpose. The EC attach strict conditionality to the budgetary assistance provided to the Palestinian Authority (PA). The conditions mainly reinforce the need for transparency of the PA's public finances, strengthening the prudent management of the budget, and encouraging progress on overall financial and administrative reform. We are satisfied that the EC, with the assistance of the IMF, is ensuring the conditions are met.

 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what steps she is taking to improve pharmaceutical provision in the developing world.  [62481]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20626w02.html_spnew0"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 The Government are committed to addressing the four key factors which are recognised by the World Health Organisation (WHO) as affecting the provision of pharmaceuticals in the developing world. These are sustainable financing, affordable pricing, reliable health and supply systems and the rational selection and use of existing drugs.
<P>

<a name="20626w02.html_para0">On sustainable financing, we have pledged $200 million over five years to the Global fund to fight AIDS, TB and malaria. The fund will support increased coverage of proven interventions for these diseases by providing developing countries with resources to purchase key commodities, and strengthen systems to procure and deliver them.
<P>

<a name="20626w02.html_para1">The Working Group on Access to Medicines, which I chair, is working with the pharmaceutical industry and foundations, developing countries, the World Health Organisation, the World Trade Organisation and the European Commission to bring about more affordable pricing. The Group will report to the Prime Minister after its final meeting in July.
<P>

<a name="20626w02.html_para2">We have committed over &#163;1 billion since 1997 to strengthening developing countries' health systems, building their capacity both to deliver medicines to the poor and to make effective choices about the selection and use of drugs.

 UK development assistance is delivered through international, non-Government and parastatal organisations. Some commodities provided through our HIV/AIDS and emergency medical supplies programmes are distributed through public health service outlets.

<P>
<a name="20626w02.html_spnew2"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 The UK's strategic objective is to make globalisation work for sustainable development, especially for the poorest. At the summit, the UK would like to build on other processes, including the Doha Development Agenda and Financing for Development conference in Monterrey, to focus the efforts of Governments, international institutions, business and civil society on delivering the sustainable development necessary to achieve the Millennium Development Goals. The summit is a critical opportunity to bring the development and environment movements together in a systematic attempt to both reduce poverty and pursue sustainable development. I also refer my right hon. Friend to the speech I gave on the summit in London on 20 June, a copy of which has been placed in the Library of the House.

 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what progress she has made since June 2001 towards meeting the UN target for percentage of gross domestic product devoted to international aid.  [62486]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20626w02.html_spnew3"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 In 2001, UK official development assistance was 0.32 per cent. of gross national income (GNI)&#151;up from 0.26 per cent. in 1997. The Government are committed to the target of raising development assistance to 0.7 per cent. of national income, and will significantly raise the amount of our development assistance and its share in national income, in the next spending round. This will be announced soon, and will cover the years up to 2005&#150;06.
<P>

<a name="20626w02.html_para3">The UK played a major role in securing the commitment by the European Union at the Financing for Development conference in Monterrey to raise its average official development assistance as a share of national income to 0.39 per cent. (from 0.32 per cent.) by 2006. This will mean an extra $7 billion of official development assistance per year from Europe.

 DFID has worked hard since 1997 to improve the overall effectiveness of EC development assistance in contributing to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals by improving its poverty focus and quality. There have been some steps in response 



<P>
<P><I>26 Jun 2002 : Column 874W</I><P>
to our efforts to reform EC development assistance. We are pressing the EC to pursue its reform efforts vigorously in order to implement the November 2000 EC Development Policy, which for the first time makes poverty reduction the central objective of EC development programmes. We are also working for agreement that a much greater share of EC aid should be allocated to low income countries where it will have the greatest impact on poverty reduction. In 2000, only 38 per cent. of EC aid was spent in low-income countries compared to 70 per cent. in 1990. Last year we secured a substantial increase in the external actions budget for Asia. This year we hope to see the budget share for Asia maintained and further increased where possible.

<P>

<a name="20626w03.html_para1">But this fate is not inevitable. Africa faces an enormous challenge in meeting the MDGs. But that challenge is not insurmountable. First, it requires that African nations commit to fundamental reform and a process of learning from one another. Second, it needs the developed world to alter the nature of its partnership with Africa, not just by increasing and improving aid but by tackling the whole range of policy constraints which affect Africa's development. NEPAD and the G8 can play a critical role in both.

 The Blue Badge scheme only applies to on-street parking. There is a wide variety of powers to tackle abuse available to local authorities, who are responsible for administering the Blue Badge scheme. It is an offence under section 47 of the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984 to park a vehicle which is not displaying a badge in a designated disabled person's parking bay.

 Although it is the responsibility of the station facility operators to ensure that their stations meet the requirement of the Disability Discrimination Act (DDA) 1995, the Strategic Rail Authority has said in its strategic plan that it will make available additional funding to ensure train operating companies are resourced, where necessary, to implement the requirements of the DDA on access to stations. Until the review of the Disabled People's Protection Policy for each train operator has been completed&#151;the SRA expects by the end of this year&#151;the full scope of the work required will not be known and priorities will then have to be applied to implementation.

 <i>[holding answer 25 June 2002]:</i> Implementation of the Strategic Rail Authority's plan will deliver increased frequency of suburban services and substantial investment in stations. Many stations in south London already receive high frequency services but more will be done to improve journeys and make better use of the established network in south London. Improvements will be delivered via franchise replacement, major projects such as the East London Line extension, and specific programmes for station improvements. The SRA is considering fares integration in London as part of its wider review of fares policy. It is also working with stakeholders to develop improved journey information and branding.

 The Director of Civil Nuclear Security, the security regulator for the UK civil nuclear industry, stated in paragraph 4 of his first annual report on the "State of Security in the Civil Nuclear Industry and the Effectiveness of Security Regulation" that it is essential that stringent security precautions are taken by the civil nuclear industry in view of the consequences that the misappropriation of nuclear material or a successful

 I cannot add to the information about the key planning document known as the design basis threat (DBT) which the Director of the Civil Nuclear Security referred to in his recent annual report on the "State of Security in the Civil Nuclear Industry and the Effectiveness of Security Regulation", placed in the Libraries of the House on 11 June 2002. The assessment is classified and no further details can be published. The Director of Civil Nuclear Security assures himself that a site operator's ability to protect against the DBT is adequate and is tested.

 Regarding the MOX fuel that was exported to Japan in 1999 to be returned to the UK, the Office for Civil Nuclear Security maintains regular contact with the Japanese Government and regulatory authorities, most recently in January this year to consult on security arrangements for the return shipment. They have not been in direct contact with authorities in the United States in this context; any business with the US Government is normally carried out through the embassy in Washington.

 The industry umbrella group, the Alliance Against Counterfeiting and Piracy, has lobbied for section 107A of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 to be brought into force. The specific investigatory tools to enforce the copyright offences that would be given to trading standards officers by section 107A would be in addition to the ones they have under related trade marks and trade descriptions laws. The delay in bringing section 107A into force arises from concerns about possible resource implications that we are seeking to resolve.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what steps are being taken to explain to UK electricity consumers the proportion of their energy costs due to the Renewables Obligation.  [64347]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20626w07.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 In the statutory consultation on the Renewables Obligation, published in August 2001, it was estimated that its introduction would result in a maximum increase in average electricity prices of just under 5 per cent. by 2010 in comparison with 1999 prices. Actual costs arising from the Obligation will depend on what suppliers actually pay for any additional renewable energy supplies or for Renewables Obligation Certificates (ROCs).
<P>

<a name="20626w07.html_para0">In a competitive electricity market, it is for individual electricity suppliers to determine the price of the electricity which they provide to consumers. In determining those prices, suppliers will have to take account of a wide range of influencing factors, including any arising from the Renewables Obligation.
<P>

<a name="20626w07.html_para1">The buy-out mechanism operates to ensure that any extra costs arising from the Obligation do not reach an unacceptable level. Recycling of buy-out receipts will provide an incentive to further investment in renewables&#151;thus helping suppliers to work towards reducing overall costs.

<P>
<a name="20626w07.html_wqn11"><B> Mrs. Curtis-Thomas: </B> 
To ask the Solicitor-General what criteria the HMCPSI uses to determine the quality of CPS casework.  [60209]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20626w07.html_spmin1"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 HM Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate assesses the quality of CPS casework by a careful evaluation of how the CPS performs its four key functions: the provision of pre-charge advice to the police; reviewing cases following the commencement of proceedings; preparing cases for court; and presenting cases in court.
<P>

<a name="20626w07.html_para7">Inspectors focus on a number of main themes under each of these functions. Under pre-charge advice and case review, inspectors assess whether the law, the tests set out in the Code for Crown Prosecutors, and charging standards agreed between the CPS and police nationally are all being correctly interpreted and applied; and whether all actions and decisions regarding cases are being taken at the right time. Inspectors pay particular attention to special categories of cases, including those involving racist incidents, child abuse and domestic violence cases.
<P>

<a name="20626w07.html_para8">The evaluation of case preparation is more process based. Inspectors consider how the CPS discharges its duties of disclosure, the timeliness of its source of material upon the defence and the court, how the CPS prepares cases for trial, file management and endorsements, and the effectiveness of specific processes such as the monitoring of custody time limits.
<P>

<a name="20626w07.html_para9">In relation to case presentation, inspectors assess whether prosecuting advocates have the appropriate skills to present cases fairly, thoroughly and firmly and to test defence cases rigorously, and whether they exercise these skills to enable courts to reach just decisions.
<P>
<P>
<a name="20626w07.html_wqn12"><B> Mrs. Curtis-Thomas: </B> 
To ask the Solicitor-General what action has been taken by the HMCPSI to ensure that scrutiny is consistent across the areas to provide objective assessment and comparisons between areas.  [60210]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20626w07.html_spmin2"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 HM Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate ensures that scrutiny is consistent across all areas by applying the same methodology in all its area inspections, but with a balanced approach that takes into account different practices and characteristics between the areas. Therefore, inspectors always examine key aspects of an area's performance, such as the application of the tests contained in the Code for Crown Prosecutors and the area's compliance with the duties of disclosure of unused material and the standard of advocacy. These findings are always published in a table of performance measures in the report, and compared with performance data of other CPS areas inspected to date. Key issues peculiar to the area are highlighted and discussed elsewhere in the report.
<P>

<a name="20626w07.html_para10">Assessing the quality of legal decision-making is difficult as decisions frequently turn on legal or evidential issues that are essentially matters of professional judgment. Inspectors therefore assess whether a decision or an action by a prosecutor was one which was properly open to a reasonable prosecutor having regard to the principles set out in the Code for Crown Prosecutors and other relevant guidance. The application of this objective test means that inspectors do not "disagree" with a 



<P>
<P><I>26 Jun 2002 : Column 896W</I><P>
decision unless it is wrong in principle, and not merely because an individual inspector may have come to a different conclusion.
<P>

<a name="20626w07.html_para11">The Inspectorate is not a large organisation, and guidance has been formulated, and training opportunities used, to help develop a uniformity of approach. Each inspection team consists of several inspectors. They will have worked on different areas and with different colleagues. This allows the exchange of ideas and opinions before conclusions are drawn, and so the risk of different standards being applied are minimised. Finally, the scrutiny given to the draft report by the relevant Group Director and the Chief Inspector, together with discussions about the emerging findings and the draft report with senior area managers, help to ensure a consistent approach and the fair and objective assessment of the performance of each area.

To ask the Solicitor-General if she will list the reports which have been produced by HMCPSI since the inception of the service for the DPP and the Law Officers.  [60212]<P>

<P>
<a name="20626w07.html_spmin3"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 HM Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate has carried out a total of 86 CPS branch and area inspections since 1997. A list appears at the conclusion of this answer.
<P>

<a name="20626w07.html_para12">47 branch reports and one report on a complete area (London) were published between 1997 and 1999 when the Crown Prosecution Service comprised 13 large areas with over 90 branches.
<P>

<a name="20626w07.html_para13">In April 1999 the CPS was reorganised into 42 areas and restructured in accordance with the recommendations of the Review of the CPS (the Glidewell report). Since that time, 37 area inspection reports have been published. The inspections of the remaining five areas are currently at different stages of completion and all reports should be published by September 2002.
<P>

<a name="20626w07.html_para14">HMCPS Inspectorate has also published nine thematic reports and has participated in six joint inspections.
<P>

<a name="20626w07.html_para15">The Chief Inspector for the time being of HMCPSI has, in addition, published four annual reports. Three were on a non-statutory basis. The inspectorate, which had previously been part of the CPS itself, was placed on an independent statutory basis on 11 October 2000 when the Crown Prosecution Service Act 2000 came into effect. The first statutory annual report was laid before Parliament on 2 May 2002.

 HM Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate has used one or more lay inspectors in each area inspection undertaken (save for one in which the lay inspector was unable to attend through illness). Lay inspectors observe and assess the efficiency and effectiveness of the Crown Prosecution Service through a process of observation, inspection and evaluation, primarily in relation to the service's dealings with the public and its ability to assess and interpret the public interest in its decision-making under the Code for Crown Prosecutors.
<P>

<a name="20626w07.html_para16">Lay inspectors help to:

<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>assess the extent to which the CPS undertakes the care and treatment of victims and witnesses;

<BR>
assess the extent to which prosecutors comply with the Code for Crown Prosecutors specifically in relation to the application of the public interest test;
<P>
<BR>
assess the effectiveness of the relationship between the CPS and the local community; and
<P>
<BR>
assess the effectiveness of the CPS in dealing with complaints.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="20626w07.html_para17">Lay inspectors bring the broad perspective of an informed member of the public to the CPS inspection process. They contribute to the inspection of CPS areas and assist in formulating recommendations to improve

performance where necessary. While lay inspectors are governed by strict rules of confidentiality in relation to individual cases, they play an important part in helping to promote people's awareness of the work undertaken by both the CPS itself and the Inspectorate.
<P>

<a name="20626w07.html_para18">Most lay inspectors have been nominated by:

the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux; and

<a name="20626w07.html_para20">In practice, lay inspectors will observe trials in both the magistrates courts and the Crown court and speak to prosecution witnesses when they have finished giving evidence; consider a number of complaints made to the CPS area; consider some files which have been the subject of contentious or borderline decisions, either to proceed or to discontinue the case, under the public interest test in Code for Crown Prosecutors; and, if possible, to join in some interviews both with CPS staff and local representatives of other organisations. Wherever possible, lay inspectors join in the evaluation of the performance of the area, contribute a short report on their observations and findings, and comment upon the draft report.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20626w07.html_spmin5"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 Every HM Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate Report contains the comments of inspectors on the discontinuance rate in the area inspected. The discontinuance rate is a comparative calculation of case outcomes in the magistrates courts collected by each CPS area.
<P>

<a name="20626w07.html_para22">The Inspectorate publishes in its area reports its assessment of whether decisions to discontinue cases examined during the inspection comply with the Code and compares this with the assessments made in all the areas inspected in the current cycle to date. Inspectors examine the timeliness of the decisions to discontinue, and analyse the reasons for discontinuance of cases and assess the quality of decision-making in a sample of cases, that is whether these decisions are taken in accordance with the law, the Code for Crown Prosecutors, and other relevant guidance.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20626w07.html_spmin7"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 Changes in inspection methodology following publication of the Report, Review and Evaluation of HMCPSI programme and methodology (2001) include:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a small reduction in the numbers of files requested from CPS areas for examination;

<a name="20626w07.html_para24">In the medium-longer term, the Inspectorate currently has working groups examining its methodology in relation to both casework and management and operational issues with a view to developing more focused and flexible arrangements for the next inspection cycle.

To ask the Solicitor-General if she will make a statement on, and explain the variation in, the annual budget allocated to staff training in each CPS area, with specific reference to <i>(a)</i> Warwickshire and <i>(b)</i> Northamptonshire, in 2001&#150;02.  [59349]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20626w07.html_spmin8"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 CPS areas allocate elements of their administration budgets to fund training courses on the basis of locally determined factors and priorities. The sums allocated, which were set out in my reply to the hon. Member on 6 March 2002, exclude the opportunity cost of backfilling front-line staff when attending courses, and also associated travel and subsistence costs. They also exclude the costs of national training initiatives funded centrally from within the CPS HQ allocation or from the allocations to the service's 10 service centres.
<P>

<a name="20626w07.html_para25">CPS Warwickshire, being the smallest area in the country, is proportionately resourced and elected to set its training budget to reflect only the costs of external courses and fees for admission to conferences. Other expenditure on training was subsumed within its allocation of administration costs. Apparent variations can be misleading and it is significant that in a recent inspection, HM Chief Inspector commended the area on its approach and delivery of training.
<P>

<a name="20626w07.html_para26">CPS Northampton has focused resources on leadership training building on its recent Investors in People accreditation and as part of its application to the Business Excellence Model, particularly to assist in its establishment of a co-located Criminal Justice Unit with the Northamptonshire police. The area's budget is also distorted by an additional 



<P>
<P><I>26 Jun 2002 : Column 901W</I><P>
allocation that the area bid for separately to undertake a specific project designed to improve advocacy skills. In the event, the project was deferred because the coincidence of its timing with other national training initiatives would have adversely affected operations. The area subsequently reduced its allocation to training accordingly.
<P>

<a name="20626w07.html_para27">Significant funding was set aside centrally for the delivery of a number of national training initiatives over the period which included legislative and procedural training on the implementation of the Human Rights Act; diversity and equality issues; advocacy training for higher court advocates and designated caseworkers; and, more recently, computer literacy training to complement the rollout of the CPS connect 42 infrastructure. Both Warwickshire and Northamptonshire benefited from this training. This funding, amounting to &#163;1.34 million in 1999&#150;2000; &#163;1.53 million in 2000&#150;01; and &#163;3.70 million in 2001&#150;02, cannot be directly associated with each of the 42 CPS area budgets.

 AWE plc, which manages AWE on behalf of the Ministry of Defence, has conducted a feasibility study into whether it would be cost-effective to undertake all operations at a single site. However, this is simply a feasibility study&#151;no decision has been made and no proposals exist to move to a single site, consequently there is no documentation pertaining to the closure of AWE Burghfield.

 The existing Royal Air Force refuelling fleet is made up of two aircraft types comprising 19 VC10s and six TriStars. On current plans, all the VC10s are due to go out of service by the end of this decade with the TriStars leaving service shortly afterwards. Precise dates can be amended as necessary to ensure a smooth transition to the new air-to-air refuelling capability to be provided by the future strategic tanker aircraft when it enters service.

 I presume that the hon. Member is referring to the future strategic tanker aircraft project for which the potential aircraft solutions are the Airbus A330 and the Boeing 767. We are evaluating the potential for the future strategic tanker aircraft capability to be provided via a PFI service based contract. Under such an arrangement costs will depend upon usage of the service. Based on our expected usage over the anticipated 27-year duration of the contract, we currently estimate the whole life cost of the capability to be around &#163;13 billion at outturn prices.

 I presume that the hon. Member is referring to the Future Strategic Tanker Aircraft project for which the potential aircraft solutions are the Airbus A330 and the Boeing 767. This prospective PFI project is currently in a competitive assessment phase and two consortia have submitted bids for the contract. I announced to the House on 17 June 2002 that commercial discussions with industry are taking longer than anticipated to complete. It is not yet possible to confirm when we will be in a position to announce the preferred contractor and move to financial close on the contract. We are working closely with industry to ensure that sound decisions are taken as quickly as possible. In the meantime, we have delayed the planned introduction of the PFI service until 2008. This will allow further time for these complex negotiations to be completed. The service is expected to be fully operational by 2012. We do not expect to achieve any overall cost saving as a result of the delay.

<P>
<a name="20626w08.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The Quinquennial Review of the Oil and Pipelines Agency (OPA) has started. The aim of the review is to examine how the OPA has performed against the Managing Agency Agreement instituted between the Ministry of Defence and the OPA, and to recommend whether there is any potential to improve the cost-effectiveness of its service to its customers.
<P>

<a name="20626w08.html_para0">The review will proceed in two phases. In the first phase a number of 'framework' issues will be examined, including whether its present position as a non- departmental public body (NDPB) is the most appropriate arrangement for delivery of the required services. It will also examine whether existing Government arrangements require adjustment. The report of this first phase of the review is expected in August 2002.
<P>

<a name="20626w08.html_para1">In the second phase, the review will address, in the light of the answers to the 'framework' issues examined in the first phase, a number of questions concerning the operational efficiency of the OPA, including the scope for Strategic Partnership and further streamlining of business processes both within the OPA and between the OPA and the Ministry of Defence. The report of the second phase of the review is expected in September 2002.
<P>

<a name="20626w08.html_para2">The review will be carried out by a small team, which will consult closely with the OPA management and other stakeholders, including the OPA's customers. The Ministry of Defence is interested also to hear the views of other organisations or individuals who would like to make a contribution to the review. Those wishing to do so should send their contributions to the OPA QQR Team, Room 24, DFG HQ, West Moors, Wimborne, Dorset BH21 6QS.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20626w11.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 17 June 2002]:</i> Payments throughout the EU under the Common Agricultural Policy totalled 40,465 million euro in the budget year ending in October 2000. 25,529 million euro of this was spent on direct subsidies to farmers, 4,176 million euro on rural development (outside objective 1 areas), and 10,654 million euro on market support measures. The remainder was spent on veterinary and phytosanitary measures, and various information programmes.
<P>

<a name="20626w11.html_para2">Almost all of the direct subsidies will have gone to farmers. They will also have received most of the rural development expenditure, although other businesses are eligible for certain programmes. For example, payments under the rural development measures that were implemented in England as the processing and marketing grant scheme are largely received by food processors, although processors of non-food crops are also eligible.
<P>

<a name="20626w11.html_para3">The 10,654 million euro the Community spent on market support aimed to keep EU commodity prices above those prevailing elsewhere. This included the cost of export refunds (5,646 million euro), and of various intervention programmes (5,008 million euro). The cost of providing for public storage of products withheld from the market under these programmes came to some 379 million euro (excluding purchasing or financing costs); the cost of private storage was 574 million euro. Although many of the market support payments will in the first instance have gone to businesses specialising in trading or storage, these programmes will indirectly have improved most farmers' incomes.

 Flood and coastal erosion risk management is a devolved responsibility. The bulk of spending on flood and coastal defence in England comes from central Government either through the ODPM's support to local authorities through standard spending assessments (SSAs) which are intended in part to fund local authority levies to the Environment Agency, or through capital grants (and local authority Supplementary Credit Approvals) from DEFRA direct to the flood and coastal defence operating authorities (Environment Agency, local authorities and Internal Drainage Boards). Additional expenditure is incurred by DEFRA, for example to pay for the Storm Tide Forecasting Service. The table shows expenditure for England only:

 <i>[holding answer 24 June 2002]:</i> It is important to consider the need for flood management measures within an overall strategy so as not to create problems elsewhere. The Environment Agency has commissioned consultants to prepare a strategy for the river Ouse catchment, covering flood problems at Lewes and other points in the valley. I understand that detailed checking of data and modelling work is being undertaken prior to the planned presentation of the strategy to the Sussex Flood Defence Committee in July prior to submission to DEFRA.

<a name="20626w12.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Peat is a major constituent of growing media used in gardening and commercial horticulture. It is well suited to a wide range of uses and comes from a variety of sources in the UK, the Republic of Ireland and the Baltic states.
<P>

<a name="20626w12.html_para1">The UK Biodiversity Action Plan commits the Government to undertake and promote research and development into sustainable alternatives to peat and provide advice on the development and marketing of peat alternatives.

<P>

<a name="20626w12.html_para2">There has already been some substitution of peat by other materials, such as coir and bark, with some degrees of success. We have been funding seminars for the ornamentals sector for some time to increase awareness of and to examine the potential for using reduced-peat and peat free alternatives and to encourage commercial growers and others to take them up where they are already available.

 Central Government Departments and their agencies are required as a matter of policy to actively seek to buy their timber and timber products from sustainable and legal sources, for example, those identified under independent certification schemes such as that operated by the Forest Stewardship Council.
<P>

<a name="20626w12.html_para7">My right hon. Friend the Minister for the Environment, (Mr. Meacher) has written to Green Ministers to explain that his Department has commissioned consultants to suggest guidance that will assist Government buyers to implement this policy. The consultants' report will address the issue of verifying claims made by contractors for the origin of timber supplied, including claims supported by certificates. The report is expected to be completed in the summer of 2002. In the meantime Departments have been given a model contract specification clause that requires suppliers to: (a) establish a chain of custody from the source of timber through to delivery of the final product, and (b) to provide documentary evidence and independent verification of the claims being made. The Forest Stewardship Council's certification scheme is identified as one way in which these requirements would be satisfied but the clause makes clear that suppliers may offer alternatives evidence of compliance.

<a name="20626w12.html_para8">To complement the Government's timber procurement policy we are pursuing a strategy of seeking to reach bi-lateral agreements with producing countries that would see the development of independently verified documentation to prove the legality of timber shipments to the UK.

 <i>[holding answer 19 June 2002]:</i> Phytophthoras are a group of microscopic fungal pathogens responsible for plant diseases in many parts of the world. While some cause severe damage, including death of trees, others are of little consequence.
<P>

<a name="20626w13.html_para0">The Phytophthora disease of alder is present in England, Scotland and Wales and is most active in the south-west and south-east of England. Surveys of the disease in 2000 and 2001 established that an estimated 600,000 trees were affected: around 12 to 14 per cent. of the alder population. Researchers at the Forestry Commission Research Agency (FCRA) have established that the cause of the disease is a new hybrid pathogen which is very damaging to alder. The putative parents cause little or no damage to alder but can be aggressive pathogens of other woody hosts.
<P>

<a name="20626w13.html_para1">In addition to the UK, the disease is present in 10 other European countries. Movement of infected plants has probably facilitated its rapid dissemination and infected stock may start new foci of infection when planted out. Research is continuing to further improve methods of managing the disease and diagnosing the pathogen. As with most Phytophthoras, control is difficult and eradication from already infected riparian habitats would be impossible. As this particular disease is so widespread, quarantine controls would be ineffective.
<P>

<a name="20626w13.html_para2">It is rare for willows to suffer from disease caused by species of Phytophthora and they do not appear to be susceptible to the new hybrid Phytophthora that causes disease of alder.

 <i>[holding answer 19 June 2002]:</i> DEFRA officials are in regular contact with their counterparts in the National Assembly for Wales Agriculture Department and the Scottish Executive Environment and Rural Affairs Department and together they seek to find a solution to any practical difficulties arising from the differences in the livestock movements controls.
<P>

<a name="20626w13.html_para3">The Government will not make decisions about possible changes to the current standstill rules until Ministers have seen the recommendations of the Royal Society and lessons learned inquiries. Those decisions will be taken in discussion with the devolved Administrations and with stakeholders.

<P>
<a name="20626w14.html_spnew2"><B> Margaret Beckett: </B> 
 Under the revised EU sheepmeat regime national envelopes were introduced to provide member states with an element of flexibility in how they support their sheep sectors; funds under the envelope can be used to provide extra support to producers, improve the marketing and production of sheepmeat and encourage more environmentally friendly farming practices. National envelopes can be implemented on a regional basis; this is being done in the United Kingdom.
<P>

<a name="20626w14.html_para2">In England, the national envelope is worth &#163;5.4 million in 2002. There is also a provision in the revised regime permitting member states, or parts of member states, to increase the size of the national envelope by reducing the basic rate of Sheep Annual Premium by up to one Euro. This could increase the size of the envelope in England by around &#163;5 million.
<P>

<a name="20626w14.html_para3">The Government issued a consultation letter in January seeking views on how the national envelope should be used in England. We have now considered the responses we received, and have reached decisions on the way forward.
<P>

<a name="20626w14.html_para4">The Government intend to make maximum use of the flexibility we negotiated at the Agriculture Council to switch support from subsidies per breeding ewe to support for restructuring and modernising the industry in line with the strategy set out in the Curry Commission Report. This means that, after a transitional year this year, we will by 2003 use the maximum available under the scheme to reduce sheep numbers in historically overgrazed areas by encouraging extensification in the uplands and to improve the quality and marketing of sheep.
<P>

<a name="20626w14.html_para5">For the transitional year of 2002, we intend to introduce a scheme to reduce sheep numbers in areas subject to historic overgrazing. Under the scheme the Government will purchase sheep quota from producers, who in return will be required to undertake to maintain lower stocking levels on the land in question. The scheme will operate by tender; in deciding which offers should be accepted we will take into account both price and other relevant factors such as the extent of historic overgrazing. The scheme will be open for applications in the autumn, and we hope that offers will be dealt with before the close of the next quota-trading period.
<P>

<a name="20626w14.html_para6">&#163;2 million will be allocated to the quota purchase scheme in 2002. The remains of the 2002 national envelope will be paid to producers as a top-up to Sheep Annual Premium payments; this will be worth some 46 pence per eligible animal.
<P>

<a name="20626w14.html_para7">For 2003, and in subsequent years, we intend to make full use of the opportunity in the new regulation to increase the size of the national envelope by reducing the rate of the Sheep Annual Premium. This will enable us to fund a range of schemes from the national envelope.
<P>

<a name="20626w14.html_para8">The quota purchase scheme will be retained in 2003 and beyond; the level of resources allocated to the scheme will be decided in the light of our experience this year, but we expect it to be at least &#163;1 million a year.
<P>

<a name="20626w14.html_para9">We are minded to introduce two further schemes in 2003: an upland Extensification Scheme and an Industry Development Scheme.
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the Upland Extensification Scheme will be linked to Hill Farming Allowances, and will pay additional sums, on a per hectare basis,

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>to producers in less favoured areas who stock sheep below certain stocking levels; there are likely to be different stocking criteria and payment rates for different categories of land;
<P>
<BR>
the Industry Development Scheme will seek to encourage producers to participate in existing initiatives intended to improve the marketing and quality of sheepmeat. The details of the scheme still need to be developed, but the intention is to pay producers, via an uplift in their Sheep Annual Premium payments, who participate in eligible schemes. These might include recognised assurance schemes; sire referencing and genetic improvement schemes; schemes linked to the National Scrapie Plan; recognised local-marketing initiatives.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="20626w14.html_para10">We will be consulting interested parties further on the details of these two schemes. We will also be considering, in the light of further views we receive, whether any further schemes should be introduced in 2003 or thereafter. Schemes will be operated by the RPA.
<P>

<a name="20626w14.html_para11">The Government believe that these schemes will make a major contribution towards addressing the problem of historic overgrazing in the uplands and improving the responsiveness of the sheep industry to the market. We recognise, however, that schemes funded from the national envelope can only form one element of the co-ordinated programme of measures needed to restore habitats damaged by historic overgrazing. We will be looking to English Nature to take appropriate action under the Countryside and Rights of Way Act, encouraging producers to make use of agri-environment schemes and considering what steps we can take, including use of the cross compliance rules where appropriate, to reduce stocking pressure on land in unfavourable environmental conditions.

<a name="20626w15.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 There are numerous reports of links between al-Qaeda and some groups fighting in Chechnya. Emir Khattab, the recently assassinated leader of the Arab mujaheddin in Chechnya, fought in Afghanistan and was reputedly a close friend of UBL. Shamil Basayev, an ethnic Chechen who shares UBL's extreme brand of Islam, underwent advanced combat training in a camp in Afghanistan. However, the nature of the al-Qaeda organisation makes it impossible accurately to assess the full extent of Chechen involvement.

Friend the Member for Livingston (Mr. Cook), the UK combined a global lobbying campaign for universal ratification of the UN Convention against Torture (at the time ratified by just over 50 per cent. of UN member states) with a number of practical measures, including the publication and distribution of 20,000 copies in seven languages of a handbook giving guidance on reporting instances of torture, financial support for the UN's work with torture victims and the secondment of a senior UK police officer to the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture.
<P>

<a name="20626w16.html_para1">Phase 3 will combine continued global lobbying with new practical steps. Since December 1998, 13 more countries have ratified the UN CAT. Our target is to secure another five ratifications by the end of 2003, bringing the total to 134 or 70 per cent. We will also be lobbying with EU partners for the adoption of the Draft Optional Protocol to the CAT. The Protocol is intended to help prevent torture by allowing both UN and independent national teams the right to inspect places of detention in signatory countries.

 Our plans for the modernisation of the licensing regimes were set out clearly in the White Paper "Time for Reform" (Cm.4696) published on 10 April 2000. We proposed that the current exemption from public entertainment that allows two musicians to perform live in premises licensed for the sale of alcohol should end. This is because one or two live musicians using powerful microphones and amplifiers can make more noise and so generate more nuisance for local residents than three without. Alcohol and public entertainment 



<P>
<P><I>26 Jun 2002 : Column 935W</I><P>
licensing will be integrated into a single scheme. This will remove at a stroke a considerable amount of existing red tape and reduce the licensing costs which currently deter many venues from providing live music and dancing. The reforms will be implemented by means of primary legislation to be brought forward as soon as parliamentary time permits.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20626w17.html_spnew6"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 Income-related benefits (income support, income-based jobseeker's allowance, housing benefit and council tax benefit) are payable to people in polygamous marriages where the relationship has been solemnised by a marriage ceremony in a country where polygamous marriages are permitted, and where the general conditions of entitlement are met.
<P>

<a name="20626w17.html_para3">The amount of benefit payable includes personal allowances for the male spouse and one partner at the appropriate couple rate and, for each other partner, the difference between the higher rate for a couple and the higher rate for a single person. In general there is no financial advantage to claiming for those in polygamous marriages. Having separate claims for a couple and for other members of the marriage would normally result in more benefit being paid. Benefit entitlement for any additional partners is restricted to an allowance which is less than the rate for single people.
<P>

<a name="20626w17.html_para4">In addition, any member of a polygamous marriage can claim a contributory or non-contributory social security benefit in his or her own right where he or she satisfies the relevant conditions of entitlement.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20626w17.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. McCartney: </B> 
 The "Pensioners' Income Series" publication contains guidance about how to interpret the information contained within it. In particular, it warns that great care should be taken when interpreting changes in income over short periods of time since random sampling fluctuations mean that estimates should be regarded as broad indications of trends only.
<P>

<a name="20626w17.html_para5">Table 12 of the "Pensioners' Incomes Series 2000&#150;01" contains estimates of the proportion of pensioner units with occupational pension income and the average amount for those in receipt from 1994&#150;95 to 2000&#150;01. It shows that 59 per cent. of recently retired pensioner units received income from occupational pensions in 2000&#150;01, lower than the corresponding estimate for 1999&#150;2000 of 64 per cent. Estimates for both singles and couples were lower in 2000&#150;01 than in 1999&#150;2000, but the drop was greatest for singles from 51 per cent. in 1999&#150;2000 to 44 per cent. in 2000&#150;01.
<P>

<a name="20626w17.html_para6">There are various possible explanations for these changes, including the possibility that they are due to random sampling fluctuation. More years of FRS data would be needed to confirm whether this is the case.
<P>

<a name="20626w17.html_para7">The "Pensioners' Income Series" publication warns that the time series of results based on the Family Resources Survey (FRS) 1994&#150;95 to 2000&#150;01 is too short to provide an accurate picture of detailed changes in pensioners' incomes over time. It also warns that estimates of proportions in receipt of occupational pension income should be treated with caution because they may be subject to under-reporting by respondents to the FRS.

 The Benefit Fraud Inspectorate's (BFI) report on Medway Unitary Authority was published today and copies of the report have been placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="20626w18.html_para0">Inspectors found that the council's previous good performance had been adversely affected by a number of factors including the move of staff to a central location, the loss of staff to a neighbouring authority and the introduction of a new IT system. This has led to a backlog of work. The council recognised these shortfalls and put in place proposals to tackle the backlog and address many of the other problems.
<P>

<a name="20626w18.html_para1">The report notes that the council needed to implement its stated aim to increase awareness of housing benefits. The council had run no take-up campaigns since 1999.
<P>

<a name="20626w18.html_para2">Inspectors found that most staff applied a high standard of scrutiny to claims, but limited management checking removed any means of identifying inconsistency and training needs.
<P>

<a name="20626w18.html_para3">There was a high level of accuracy in classifying overpayments but some improvements were needed in overpayment recovery.
<P>

<a name="20626w18.html_para4">Medway's fraud investigations unit is experienced and some good quality investigation work had been done.

 <i>(a)</i> The principle of judicial independence means that it is not open to the Lord Chancellor or his Department to entertain complaints about judicial decisions. However, as Head of the Judiciary, the Lord Chancellor does consider complaints about the personal conduct of individual judges and other judicial office holders and is able to reprimand or rebuke judges who have behaved inappropriately. In the most extreme cases the Lord Chancellor, with the consent of the Lord Chief Justice, can remove a judge below the level of the High Court from office.
<P>

<a name="20626w19.html_para4">No figures for complaints about judges' conduct are available for the period before August 1998, when the Lord Chancellor established a team of officials dedicated to make thorough inquiries on his behalf into all complaints about judicial conduct. Between August 1998 and 31 May 2002, the Lord Chancellor received 1,351 complaints which appeared to relate to judges' personal conduct. In 1,089 cases the complainant agreed that the Lord Chancellor could investigate the complaint by asking the judge for his or her comments. The Lord Chancellor then considered the complaint and the response, and informed the complainant of the judge's comments and his own conclusion. The great majority of these complaints were from disappointed litigants and were found to be without foundation. However, on 23 occasions, the Lord Chancellor thought it appropriate to rebuke or reprimand the judge concerned in relation to conduct.
<P>

<a name="20626w19.html_para5"><i>(b)</i> The Legal Services Commission was established by the Access to Justice Act 1999, and came into being on 1 April 2000 to replace the Legal Aid Board. Since that date 67 representations have been received (although some of these will relate to the old Legal Aid Board). Of these, 17 were from politicians and 50 from the public.
<P>

<a name="20626w19.html_para6">Overall figures on representations about the two bodies received by the Lord Chancellor's Department are unavailable for 1997. Since 1 January 1998, the Department has received 238 separate representations, relating to either the Legal Aid Board or the Legal Services Commission. Of these, 155 have come from members of the public, with the remaining 83 from MPs and peers.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what discussions he has had with the Scottish Executive in respect of providing for the education of the children of asylum seekers in Scotland.  [62414]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20626w20.html_spnew1"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 My officials and the Scottish Executive continue to discuss the provision of education for the children of asylum seekers in Accommodation centres proposed for Scotland.

<P>
<a name="20626w20.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Gerrard: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department which detention facilities in which asylum seekers are detained are defined as <i>(a)</i> short-term and <i>(b)</i> long-term; and what is the average length of time he estimates asylum seekers will be held in (i) short-term and (ii) long-term detention  [63462]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20626w20.html_spnew2"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 There are short-term holding facilities at Manchester, Dover, Cheriton, Felixstowe and Harwich. Detainees are held at these centres for no longer than five days, or no longer than seven days in cases where removal directions have been set.
<P>

<a name="20626w20.html_para1">The immigration removal centres at Campsfield House, Harmondsworth, Tinsley House, Dungavel House, Dover, Haslar, Lindholme and Yarl's Wood (which is closed at present) may be used to hold detainees for whatever period is necessary for the purpose for which detention was authorised. This period will vary from case to case.
<P>

<a name="20626w20.html_para2">In addition, Oakington Reception Centre is used to detain persons whose asylum claim is assessed to be straightforward and capable of being decided quickly. The fast-track asylum process at Oakington typically takes between seven to 10 days.
<P>
<P>
<a name="20626w20.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Gerrard: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what his policy is regarding <i>(a)</i> when and <i>(b)</i> for how long asylum seekers should be detained.  [63461]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20626w20.html_spnew3"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 Our policy regarding the use of detention was set out in the 1998 White Paper "Fairer, Faster, Firmer&#151;A Modern Approach to Immigration and Asylum" and the recent White Paper "Secure Borders, Safe Haven".
<P>

<a name="20626w20.html_para3">Detention will usually be appropriate to effect removal; initially to establish a person's identity or basis of claim; or where there is reasonable belief that a person will fail to comply with the conditions attached to the grant of temporary admission or release. In addition, persons whose asylum claims appear straightforward and capable of being decided quickly may be detained as part of the fast-track asylum process at Oakington Reception Centre.

<P>

<a name="20626w20.html_para4">Detention under the Immigration Act 1971 is not time limited. However, it is used sparingly and is kept to the minimum duration necessary for the purposes for which it was authorised.

<a name="20626w20.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Gerrard: </B>

<P>
<P>
<a name="20626w20.html_spnew4"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 The transfer of detainees between removal centres, for whatever reason, is kept to a minimum. However, a transfer may occur for reasons of security; for health care reasons, as not all centres have in-patient facilities; and, on occasion, for domestic or compassionate reasons, or to enable a detainee to be more easily visited by a representative. Transfers may also be arranged for operational reasons as a stage towards removal from the United Kingdom, or to create vacancies in a particular centre.

 The first induction centre opened in Dover on 21 January 2002. The National Asylum Support Service (NASS) does not keep separate figures showing the destination of those passing through the induction centres.
<P>

<a name="20626w20.html_para6">Applications for support from those in the induction centre are considered in the same way as any other. Only asylum seekers who request that accommodation be provided as part of an application for support are liable to be dispersed. Each application is considered on its individual merits. It is open to the asylum seeker to put forward reasons why they should either not be dispersed or should be sent to a particular area. Generally speaking NASS does not provide accommodation in London. Normally the only exceptions are where the asylum seeker has been accepted for treatment by the Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture or where the asylum seeker is transferring to the NASS system of support and has school age children who have been at school for over one year.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what information he has collated on the use of accommodation centres for asylum seekers in other EU countries on <i>(a)</i> decision times, <i>(b)</i> removal rates and <i>(c)</i> the welfare of applicants.  [62529]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20626w20.html_spnew10"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 The Home Office has looked at the use of accommodation centres for asylum seekers during visits to Belgium, Denmark and Sweden. As far as we are aware, none of these countries has systematically evaluated the use of accommodation centres for asylum seekers or carried out any comparison of the impact of accommodation centres on decision times and removal rates. There has been some analysis of the impact of accommodation centres on the welfare of applicants. Published sources include: Dutch Refugee Council (1997) "Asylum seekers&#151;don't let them just sit and wait: six months in a centre is the limit"; Danish Red Cross leaflet 2001 "Danish Red Cross and the Asylum Work"; Willigen, L. van and Mooren, G.T.M. (et al) (1993) "Study on the difficulties in the reception and care of children of refugees and asylum seekers in the Netherlands", in Willigen, L. van (ed) "Health Hazards of Organised Violence in Children", Pharos Foundation for Refugee Health Care, London.
<P>

<a name="20626w20.html_para9">In January 2002, the Home Office commissioned research to examine the reception policies and practice of four European countries (Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands and Germany). This includes an analysis of the impact of accommodation centres on: (1) application rates; (2) the speed of the determination process; (3) the facilitation of return and removals; and (4) integration.

The EU regulations are designed to support fair and open competition allowing British suppliers to compete for business with other members.

 <i>[holding answer 19 June 2002]:</i> A range of means are used to measure the effectiveness of Victim Support including two performance indicators. The first, which was established under the Victim's Charter in 1996, is that Victim Support should aim to contact victims within four working days of the necessary details being passed to them by the police. The second, established in 1999&#150;2000, was that Victim Support should, with Home Office funding, set up a witness support service in all magistrates courts by April 2002. This was substantially achieved by the due date.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20626w22.html_spnew1"><B> Beverley Hughes </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 21 June 2002]:</i> At present, there are no accurate data available on the size of the Sikh community in either the United Kingdom or England and Wales. Current estimates for the United Kingdom Sikh population range from 350,000 to 500,000.
<P>

<a name="20626w22.html_para0">Next February we hope to have a clearer picture. Demographic data about Sikhs in the United Kingdom&#151;and specifically England and Wales&#151;will be available for the first time from the results of the religious identity question in the 2001 Census.

<P>
<a name="20626w22.html_spnew3"><B> Beverley Hughes </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 24 June 2002]:</i> Information on decision times for individual types of general immigration applications is not available. Our aim is to decide straightforward applications within three weeks and this was achieved during the first half of 2001. Due to an exceptionally large increase in the number of immigration cases in the latter part of the year the turnaround time increased. This has now been reduced to four weeks and we are working to return performance to three weeks shortly.
<P>

<a name="20626w22.html_para2">Information on initial decisions is published quarterly. The next publication will cover the period up to June 2002, and will be available from 30 August 2002 on the Home Office Research Development and Statistics Directorate website at http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/ immigration1.html.

 <i>[holding answer 24 June 2002]:</i> The information on the Immigration and Nationality Directorate website reflects the current average length of time between the receipt of all postal immigration applications in Croydon and their initial consideration. In early March the average length of time quoted on the website was changed to six weeks. This was changed to five weeks at the beginning of May and to four weeks at the beginning of June. These changes reflect the improvement in initial processing times over recent months towards the target of three weeks.

Members' correspondence over the last 12 months is not recorded centrally and could be provided only at disproportionate cost.

<P>

<a name="20626w22.html_para3">We are however now developing measures to record and track all categories of public correspondence, including MP's correspondence. The Home Office Customer Communication Foundation project was suspended last November and has now been replaced by a short term/tactical Correspondence Tracking System (CTS) project to address the handling of correspondence and the provision of accurate management information. The project is due to begin on 1 July 2000 and will be rolled out for operational use during the autumn. IND's ministerial and treat official correspondence are both included in the intended scope of the project.
<P>

<a name="20626w22.html_para4">The Home Office's service delivery agreement for 2001&#150;04, which commits all directorates, including the IND to replying to 95 per cent. of public correspondence within 20 days by the end of 2001&#150;02, does not require that such correspondence also be acknowledged. However, it is IND's policy to acknowledge the receipt of all immigration, asylum, asylum support and citizenship applications either by the sending of a letter or the issue of a form. Other casework-related correspondence is not routinely acknowledged at present although we are considering the feasibility of acknowledging certain categories, when backlogs are reduced to a frictional level.

<a name="20626w23.html_para0">Other parts of the Department with specific operational responsibilities have their own regional organisational structures. Since April 2000, the Prison Service has operated an area manager structure that is based on the Government regions. Two regions are divided between two area managers: the south-east (one for Thames Valley, Hampshire and the Isle of Wight and one for Kent, Surrey and Sussex) and east midlands north (Lincolnshire, Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire, Derby and Nottingham) and south (Leicestershire and Northamptonshire, Leicester and Rutland). Previously area managers had been based in London. The National Probation Service regions mirror the Government office regions.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department which organisations which were in receipt of a grant from him in 1997&#150;98 no longer are; what the annual saving is; which organisations which were not in receipt of a grant in 1997&#150;98 now are; and what the annual cost of each is.

 I refer the hon. Member to the answer given by my right hon. Friend the Chief Secretary to the Treasury (Andrew Smith), on 17 June 2002, <i>Official Report,</i> column 136W.
<P>

<a name="20626w24.html_para0">The aggregate figure for Government grants to private organisations and individuals was &#163;28.6 billion in 2000&#150;01 (the last year for which full outturn data are available) compared with &#163;24.8 billion in 1997&#150;98. This excludes social security payments classified as grants in the national accounts and includes lottery grants.

<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what proportion of the annual budget for prisons in England is designated for <i>(a)</i> education and <i>(b)</i> health care.  [62287]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20626w24.html_spnew5"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 Figures are available for education expenditure in prisons in England and Wales only. In the financial year 2002&#150;03, the sum of &#163;70 million is planned to be spent on prisoner education, which is 3.1 per cent. of the overall departmental expenditure limit for the Prison Service.
<P>

<a name="20626w24.html_para2">Information is not held centrally in a way that allows expenditure on health care to be readily identified. Research conducted for "The Future Organisation of Prison Health Care" (published 9 March 1999) estimated that establishments spent &#163;85 million on prisoner health care in the financial year 1997&#150;98.

<a name="20626w24.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Andrew Turner: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what financial contribution he plans to make to the reconstruction of sewers and drains on the Isle of Wight prison estate to facilitate the <i>(a)</i> adoption of roads, drains and lighting, <i>(b)</i> implementation of planning permissions for new housing on the estate and <i>(c)</i> construction of new prison places which have been announced.  [62963]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20626w24.html_spnew6"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 The Prison Service has been seeking outline planning permission for residential development on 11 sites adjacent to former prison housing estates. Outline planning permission has been received on seven sites to date and are expected on a further two later this year. Two amended applications may be re-submitted in due course.
<P>

<a name="20626w24.html_para3">The future development schemes for the 11 sites include proposals to upgrade to adoptable standard a number of roads, street lights and drains leading to these 



<P>
<P><I>26 Jun 2002 : Column 968W</I><P>
sites, either by the Prison Service to facilitate a sale and maximise sale receipts, or by future owners under planning agreements.
<P>

<a name="20626w24.html_para4">Consideration is also being given to upgrading other roads, storm water drainage and street lighting not directly accessing future development sites. It is hoped this will be to a standard suitable for maintenance adoption by the local highways authority. There are a number of legal and technical issues to resolve before formal proposals are made. Progress is also dependent on obtaining further outline planning consents, with sustainable planning conditions and the relative strength of the property market during a future land sales programme. To date no decision has been taken as to the extent of the Prison Service's contribution.
<P>

<a name="20626w24.html_para5">It is not anticipated that it will be necessary to upgrade roads and drains within the estates as a result of the construction of the additional accommodation unit at Albany prison for which the Prison Service secured planning clearance in April 2002. In the event that it would be necessary to do so, this will be done in consultation with the Isle of Wight council. Should the Prison Service decide to proceed with a development on the site to the west of Parkhurst prison (for which it secured planning clearance for a 416-place prison in 1997), it would ensure that it was properly accessed and supplied with mains services.

 The Prison Service does not collect this information centrally and it could be provided only at disproportionate cost. All segregation cells in secure penal establishments are built to a category B type standard. After 1980 the standard provision for all segregation cells is mechanically ventilated or natural ventilation through grilles. Before 1980 segregation cells will have natural ventilation, unless they have since been refurbished with fixed windows and in these cases the provision will be mechanically ventilated systems or natural ventilation through grilles. Certain "short term holding" cells in segregation units within the prison estate have "forced (mechanical)" ventilation when this is required.

<P>
<a name="20626w24.html_spnew9"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 The Government are not aware that the European Union (EU) Directive on shellfish waters is directly inhibiting the possible adoption of existing roads and drains within the former prison housing estates.
<P>

<a name="20626w24.html_para6">There are currently seven development sites owned by the Prison Service, adjacent to these estates, with outline planning permission for residential developments. One of the standard planning conditions is to agree with the water company Southern Water proposals for the disposal and treatment of foul and storm water generated by future developments.

 The PIU waste study has commissioned some independent research to inform its work, mainly in the form of data gathering and specific contributions to the modelling of waste management options. A report on the role of new and emerging waste management technologies has also been commissioned, but contains commercially sensitive information and will remain confidential to the PIU. The intention is that the PIU waste study will be published.

Friend the Prime Minister on 20 July sets out how special advisers will be allocated to pay bands. Further details will be made available once the process of job evaluation is complete.

 Information about identifying those at risk of osteoporosis was included in the Department's "strategy to prevent fractures caused by osteoporosis", which was issued to all health authorities in 1998. This was based on the Royal College of Physicians' clinical guidelines for strategies to prevent and treat osteoporosis.
<P>

<a name="20626w25.html_para0">Osteoporosis has since been included in the Falls Standard of the national service framework for older people (NSF), which requires the local development of interventions and advice to prevent osteoporotic fracture. To support the NSF we have asked the National Institute of Clinical Excellence to develop clinical guidelines for the prevention, treatment and assessment of osteoporosis.

 The Department has never collected information separately on the numbers of behind-the-ear (BTE) or in-the-ear (ITE) hearing aids provided by the national health service. However, when the NHS issues hearing aids, the cost is borne by the NHS. I understand that the Department for Work and Pensions also issues hearing aids in some circumstances. That would be a matter for my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions.

1. Expenditure pre 2000&#150;01 is shown on a cash basis.<P>

2. Expenditure figures from 2000&#150;01 to 2002&#150;03 are on a Stage 1 Resource Budgeting basis. This was introduced in April 2001 and introduced accruals accounting, ie accounting for resources consumed against cash paid out.<P>

3. Expenditure figures from 2003&#150;04 to 2007&#150;08 are on a Stage 2 Resource Budgeting basis (to be introduced from April 2003) and include non-cash items such as capital charges and the cost of new provisions.<P>

4. Because of the introduction of Resource Budgeting Stages 1 and 2, the figures are not consistent across the whole period.<P>

<i>Notes:</i><P>

No planning figures are available for future years because local authorities set budgets once central Government allocations are announced, and decisions have been taken locally about council tax.<P>

However, following the 2002 Spending Review total personal social service resources (as allocated by central Government) are set to increase by on average 6 per cent. per annum in real terms over the next three years&#151;2003&#150;04 to 2005&#150;06. <P>
