<P>
<a name="01024w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Bercow: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what is his policy on the provision of temporary aid to UK businesses affected by the EU-USA banana trade dispute; and if he will make a statement.  [134210]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01024w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Byers: </B> 
 The way to alleviate this burden from all the companies facing possible US sanctions is to find a solution to the banana dispute that is satisfactory to all parties. It is precisely this that the Government have been working hard to achieve since the US first imposed retaliation last year.
<P>

<a name="01024w01.html_para0">While I fully sympathise with the plight of these companies, any suggestion of offering some form of direct compensation for lost business as a result of US actions poses considerable legal difficulties, under the terms of membership of the WTO.

<P>
<P>
<a name="01024w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Borrow: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what decisions he has reached on the future of the Patent Office in the light of the review announced by the Minister for Competitiveness on 27 April.  [134447]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01024w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Alan Johnson: </B> 
 The first stage of the Review of the Patent Office has now been completed. I am pleased to say that the Review found that the Office is now extremely customer focused and responsive. The quality of the Office's patent granting and other registration functions is well regarded and compares favourably with that of other intellectual property offices. The Patent Office has met or exceeded most of its performance objectives and targets. It has contributed to the achievement of wider Government objectives. Its standards of customer service are very high. It has achieved a Charter Mark three times, and IiP accreditation.
<P>

<a name="01024w01.html_para1">The Patent Office will continue as an Executive Agency of the DTI. There are significant concerns about privatising or contracting out in full what are largely judicial functions, where commercial drivers could lead to unhelpful pressures. The review found that Agency status was widely thought to have worked well.
<P>

<a name="01024w01.html_para2">We want the UK to play a key role in driving forward international policy on intellectual property--not just patents and trade marks but copyright too, where the Internet and digital uses are posing new challenges. We need to ensure that copyright can be protected and enforced on an international basis, while balancing both user and owner interests. We intend to strengthen the policy units, bringing in a range of expertise and widening the consultation mechanisms, so as to work in partnership with the different interests.




<P>

<P>

<a name="01024w01.html_para3">Getting a patent or trade mark is only part of the story for business. They also have to find a market for their invention and need to know how to defend their intellectual property rights. The Patent Office will in future be doing more to help them--linking up with the Small Business Service and the support for innovation the DTI provides. For example, we will be exploring what more needs to be done--using the web--to match inventors with business partners. The Patent Office will also be investigating how it might develop alternative dispute resolution with the interests of small business and private applicants in mind.
<P>

<a name="01024w01.html_para4">Trade is becoming increasingly international and patents need to reflect this. The UK can play a key role in developing the international systems to make them cheap, speedy and accessible. We want to see the expertise of national offices used to achieve this. We have a very well respected team of specialist examiners--we want to see them (and other national offices) being used to speed up and improve the international routes for granting patents. The UK route for patents could then become complementary to the international routes. The review recommended that UK fees should be adjusted to discourage duplication of work and to cover costs. We intend to consider, and consult as necessary, on the scope for changing the fee structure to achieve these objectives.
<P>

<a name="01024w01.html_para5">Our trade mark registration function is highly regarded and it is still needed alongside the EC trade mark and the international trade mark system. The review concluded that there was a good case for bringing greater consistency between the UK and EC systems by ceasing to refuse applications on the grounds of conflicting marks, but possibly notifying the applicant and trade mark owner of conflicts. We intend to consult on the options.
<P>

<a name="01024w01.html_para6">On designs, an EC regime is in prospect and we will consult on whether a UK system is still needed once that is in place.
<P>

<a name="01024w01.html_para7">We intend to ensure that the governance of the Patent Office reflects the need to provide a balance between producer interests, the innovation agenda and the interests of end-consumers, by including a range of external members on the Steering Board, which would discuss policy at a strategic level. We will also be considering whether a new name would better reflect the Office's role and aims. The Office will be working closely with Companies House and Nominet to ensure that, in so far as it would be helpful for companies, a unified application should be possible.
<P>

<a name="01024w01.html_para8">IT is a key strategic enabler for the Office. Advice from consultants showed that the current management, systems and equipment were appropriate and effective for business needs and offered value for money. They generally endorsed the Office's approach to new initiatives, while making some proposals which the Office will be taking forward. The Patent Office has already developed a highly rated website and is on track to have all services available electronically by the Government target of 2005.
<P>

<a name="01024w01.html_para9">The report of Stage 1 of the Review of the Patent Office has been placed in the Library of the House.
<P>

<a name="01024w01.html_para10">Stage 2 of the review has now started and is considering whether any changes should be made to the way in which the Patent Office operates, including its aims and objectives, targets and financial controls.

<a name="01024w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mrs. Humble: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry when he expects to receive the Annual report for the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service.  [134445]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01024w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Alan Johnson: </B>

<a name="01024w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Mitchell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if he will ask the Director General of Fair Trading to inquire into the proposed new distribution arrangement between W H Smith Retail and Tesco; and if he will assess what percentage of the wholesale market in the UK is held by each and the consequences of this for competition.  [133818]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01024w01.html_spnew3"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The Director General of Fair Trading is already aware of proposals to introduce new arrangements for the distribution of magazines and is monitoring the situation. It would be for the Director General to assess what impact these arrangements would have on competition.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry how many MAP testing centres there are in the UK; where they are; on what dates they opened; how many examinations were carried out at each centre; and how many persons are waiting to be examined at each centre.  [133985]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01024w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 As at 8 October 2000 Healthcall Services Ltd., the company contracted to carry out the full Medical Assessment Process, has 26 centres operational (Mountain Ash being counted as a double centre because it has two sets of equipment). Healthcall will shortly be opening two further centres in South Wales, a centre in Wrexham, a centre in Stirling and a second set of equipment is to be installed in Barnsley, bringing the total to 30.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry how many claims in respect of chronic bronchitis and emphysema have been settled under the MAP process; what the names are of the firms dealing with these claims and the numbers of claims settled in each case; and what the average value is of these claims.

 The Department is not yet able to make full and final offers in most cases as some elements of compensation (for example pension loss) have still to be agreed with the miners' solicitors. However, interim payments are made on all other heads of damages. So far we have processed over 1,300 claims post Medical Assessment Process (MAP). Half of these resulted in interim offers of compensation. The average value of accepted offer is just under &#163;3,500.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what was the outcome of the Telecommunications Council meeting held in Luxembourg on 3 October.  [134446]

<a name="01024w02.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 There was an orientation debate on the proposed Local Loop Unbundling Regulation. During the debate all member states stressed their commitment to the Regulation and a rapid timescale for its adoption. I strongly welcomed the Regulation as an enormously important issue for the development of e-commerce across the European Union, and confirmed the UK fully supported and would be fully compliant with it. The Presidency hopes that the Regulation will be adopted at the very latest at the next Telecommunications Council in December.
<P>

<a name="01024w02.html_para0">The Council adopted a Resolution calling for a more co-ordinated EU approach within ICANN (the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers). Welcoming this, the Commission now intends to establish a network of European expertise on internet naming and addressing issues.
<P>

<a name="01024w02.html_para1">The Commission gave a progress report on the creation of an .eu top level domain name, and it is expected that a Commission Proposal will follow in October. The Council also took note of a Presidency progress report on the programme to improve the exploitation of public sector information, facilitate access to venture capital and boost multilingual content on the internet. The Presidency hopes a Council Decision will be adopted in December. There was also a Presidency progress report on the state of discussions on the new measures under the 1999 Communications Review.
<P>

<a name="01024w02.html_para2">The Council also discussed the Commission's postal services proposal, the main provision of which is to reduce the area reserved for incumbent national postal operators (the 'reserved area') from deliveries weighing less than 350 grams to those under 50 grams. During discussions, member states were divided on whether the proposal offered an acceptable pace of liberalisation, with several member states calling for a target date for full liberalisation. The Presidency hope for agreement at the next Telecommunications Council in December.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs if he will list all the changes to sanctions regimes implemented by the United Kingdom since 28 July.  [134499]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01024w02.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 There have been changes to the following sanctions regimes.
<P>

<a name="01024w02.html_para3"><i>Federal Republic of Yugoslavia</i>
<P>

<a name="01024w02.html_para4">Following the election of Vojislav Kostunica as President of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY), European Union Foreign Ministers agreed at the General Affairs Council on 9 October to revise EU sanctions against the FRY.
<P>

<a name="01024w02.html_para5">The EU oil embargo and flight ban were lifted with effect from 9 October. Legislation implementing these measures in the Overseas Territories by means of a licensing requirement is being repealed.
<P>

<a name="01024w02.html_para6">EU financial sanctions and the visa ban will be revised. Restrictive measures against Milosevic and his associates will be maintained.




<P>
<P><I>24 Oct 2000 : Column: 108W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="01024w02.html_para7">The EU arms embargo and embargo on the supply to the FRY of equipment which might be used for internal repression or terrorism are unaffected. The UN arms embargo against the FRY and prohibition on the arming and training for terrorist activities there remain in force.
<P>

<a name="01024w02.html_para8"><i>Ethiopia and Eritrea</i>
<P>

<a name="01024w02.html_para9">UN Security Council resolution 1298 (2000), which was adopted on 17 May, imposed an arms embargo and a ban on the provision of related technical assistance and training in relation to Ethiopia and Eritrea. Since then, two further Security Council resolutions have been adopted which set out exemptions for demining and peacekeeping purposes.
<P>

<a name="01024w02.html_para10">UNSCR 1312 (2000) was adopted on 1 August and exempts the UN Mine Action Service (UNMAS) from the prohibitions imposed by UNSCR 1298. UNSCR 1320 (2000) was adopted on 15 September and allows equipment and other material, including technical assistance and training to be provided for demining within Ethiopia and Eritrea under the auspices of UNMAS. It also allows the sale and supply of arms and related material for the sole use of the United Nations in Ethiopia and Eritrea.
<P>

<a name="01024w02.html_para11"><i>Sierra Leone</i>
<P>

<a name="01024w02.html_para12">UNSCR 1306 (2000), which was adopted on 5 July, imposed a ban on the import of all rough diamonds from Sierra Leone.
<P>

<a name="01024w02.html_para13">The resolution provided for an exemption from the ban for diamonds controlled by the Government of Sierra Leone through a Certificate of Origin regime when the UN Sanctions Committee on Sierra Leone had reported to the Security Council that an effective regime was fully in operation.
<P>

<a name="01024w02.html_para14">The Committee Chairman reported to the President of the Security Council on 6 October that the Committee had no objection to the procedures to be implemented by the Government of Sierra Leone. Therefore, diamonds controlled through the Government's Certificate of Origin regime are now exempt from the prohibition on the import of all rough diamonds from Sierra Leone imposed by UNSCR 1306.

<a name="01024w02.html_para15">The review will concentrate on how well the successor regime is working and whether there are any further technical changes which can be made to improve its operation. Customs will be asking those businesses concerned in the intra-EU sales of excise goods what changes they would like to see. The review will also assess the effect of the abolition of intra-EU duty free sales on the Exchequer receipts of excise duty and VAT.

 The independent Animal Welfare Advisory Committee, chaired by Dr. Jeremy Lucke, has published its fourth annual report. The Committee was set up in 1996 specifically to keep under review the care and welfare arrangements of animals used in defence research. Copies of the report have been placed in the Library of the House.
<P>

<a name="01024w02.html_para16">The use of animals in defence research is concerned with providing the armed forces with safe and effective protection against hazards encountered while conducting their duties, and is kept to the absolute minimum.




<P>
<P><I>24 Oct 2000 : Column: 110W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="01024w02.html_para17">The Committee's Report highlights the work being done by the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency to ensure the welfare of all animals used for defence research purposes. The report provides assurances that all animals used in defence research programmes in the UK are regulated under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. The report also concludes that there is an effective ethical review process for the application of new licences which examines, among other issues, whether the use of animals can be avoided altogether in any new research procedures.
<P>

<a name="01024w02.html_para18">The Ministry of Defence continues to seek to find alternatives to the use of animals wherever possible. There is still much to be done in developing technologies that allow the use of animals in experiments to be further reduced. We welcome continuing scrutiny by the Animal Welfare Advisory Committee and aim to minimise the use of animals as far as possible, against the continuing requirement to research effective measures to counter the hazards faced by the armed forces in the conduct of their duties.

<a name="01024w03.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 A flaw has been found in pipework that forms part of the cooling system in some Trafalgar and Swiftsure class hunter-killer submarines. Initial indications are that this may have arisen from the original construction of this component. The repair of this flaw, if needed, is straightforward but, because of the stringent safety procedures that we employ for any work involving repairs to our nuclear submarines, the repair process will take some months. As responsible nuclear operators, we take even the slightest flaw to our submarines very seriously. It is for this reason that our deployed hunter-killer submarines are being brought alongside to be inspected. Until all inspections have been completed it is not possible to determine fully the requirement for repair work and operational implications but they will be significant. The submarines remain safe, and at no time has there been any risk to their crew or the general public. Vanguard Class Trident submarines, which are of a very different design, are not affected.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what status the roundabout to be built at Cophall as part of the A27 Polegate bypass will have; if the Order as made assumed that the A27 Folkington Link extension westwards would be built; and if he will make a statement.

<a name="01024w04.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 Cophall roundabout is being built as part of the A27 Polegate bypass on which construction commenced earlier this month. It is being constructed by virtue of a Side Roads Order under section 14 of the Highways Act 1980. During this phase the roundabout will be subject to a Trunking Order which, if made, would make maintenance the responsibility of the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions.
<P>

<a name="01024w04.html_para7">The Line Order for the scheme allowed for a westward extension of the new A27, the Folkington Link. The bypass scheme was designed to allow for grade separation and for the A27 to continue underneath the junction.
<P>

<a name="01024w04.html_para8">Proposals to extend the A27 westwards from Cophall roundabout were excluded from the Targeted Programme of Improvements announced in 1998 and are now being considered as part of the Southampton to Folkestone multi-modal study, which commenced in July this year. In view of this the roundabout design has been amended to remove the bridges which would have carried the roundabout over the extension. The roundabout will also be lowered by 1-2 metres on its south eastern side and the adjacent screening enhanced to lessen further the impact on nearby housing. Notwithstanding the layout changes made, the new design does not preclude a westward extension being built at a later date, should such a decision be made in the light of the outcome of the multi-modal study.

There are no TEN funds specifically set aside for inland waterways or ports and any bids for support from the TEN budget must compete against bids for support for road, rail, airport, and other transport infrastructure projects.

Between June 1999 and June 2000, despite increased demand, these initiatives have been successful in reducing by 7,292 (8.8 per cent.) the number of patients waiting more than 13 weeks for an outpatient appointment. The NHS is aiming to achieve further reductions by March 2001.

 Diamorphine, in the treatment of drug addiction, is used as part of a maintenance regime in a very small minority of patients, who are generally the most difficult cases. The Misuse of Drugs (Supply to Addicts) Regulations 1997 require that only medical practitioners who hold a special licence issued by the Home Secretary may prescribe, administer or supply diamorphine in the treatment of drug addiction; other practitioners must refer any addict who requires these drugs to a treatment centre.

<a name="01024w05.html_para3">Diamorphine is also used for analgesia in palliative care. General practitioners and other doctors may prescribe diamorphine for patients (including addicts) for relief of pain without a special licence.

 In 1998-99, National Health Service trusts had responsibility for collecting charges for hospital treatment following road traffic accidents under the provisions of sections 157 and 158 of the Road Traffic Act 1988. NHS trusts in England collected a total of &#163;19.6 million in that year. The system changed with the introduction of the Road Traffic (NHS Charges) Act 1999 which came into effect on 5 April 1999 and there is now a new centralised recovery system which is undertaken by the Compensation Recovery Unit (CRU). The CRU recovered &#163;26.6 million for NHS trusts in England in 1999-2000. However this sum does not represent total income to the NHS in that year. This is because income would have been received directly by trusts in the first part of the year as a carry-over from the old arrangements. We are unable to calculate the amounts carried over from the old system as this information is not collected centrally. The total amount collected for the first half of 2000-01 in England is &#163;30.3 million.

 Independent healthcare is currently regulated under the Registered Homes Act 1984. We recognise the deficiencies with the present system and that it has not kept pace with the developments in independent healthcare over the past two decades. The Government are therefore putting in place a new modern regulatory framework for the independent healthcare sector, through the Care Standards Act 2000. One of the main elements of the Act is to establish a new independent body, the National Care Standards Commission, which will regulate independent hospitals to proper modern standards. The Act will put in place a regulatory system that will ensure the delivery of quality services, proper accountability by the provider, and flexibility to allow the regulatory framework to respond to developments in the healthcare field.
