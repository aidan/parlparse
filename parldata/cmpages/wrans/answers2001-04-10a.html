To ask the Secretary of State for Wales what discussions <i>(a)</i> he and <i>(b)</i> staff in his Department had with officials of the National Assembly concerning possible outbreaks of foot and mouth disease, prior to 19 February; and if he will make a statement.  [154825]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10410w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Paul Murphy: </B> 
 I regularly meet the First Secretary to discuss a range of issues affecting Wales, including agricultural matters. My officials and officials within the Assembly are also in frequent contact about agricultural issues.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10410w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Paul Murphy: </B> 
 The Assembly is involved in the decisions being made on assistance for rural businesses affected by the consequences of foot and mouth disease. Any additional funding for the Assembly would be provided under the funding arrangements for the devolved Administrations, which were set out in the Statement of Funding Policy in July 2000.

<a name="10410w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Paul Murphy: </B> 
 I was aware, as were Assembly Ministers and officials, that sites across the UK were being sought for the second year of the Farm Scale Evaluations programme.
<P>

<a name="10410w01.html_para1">The decision on locations for the trials was taken by the Scientific Steering Committee for the programme, on the basis of advice from the Research Consortium and information about the availability of sites from the Supply Chain Initiative on Modified Agricultural Crops (SCIMAC).
<P>

<a name="10410w01.html_para2">DETR officials informed relevant officials about the three GM maize sites proposed for Wales once they had themselves been notified of the exact locations by SCIMAC. DETR then announced the sites on Tuesday

<P>
<a name="10410w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Peter Bottomley: </B> 
To ask the Solicitor-General if he will review the decisions taken by the Crown Prosecution Service following the fatal attack on Jay Abatan in Brighton in January 1999, following the findings of the review by Essex police into the handling of the case in Sussex.  [157143]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10410w01.html_spmin0"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 The aim of review by the Essex police into the fatal attack on Jay Abatan was to examine the conduct of the investigation by Sussex police officers. The review was commissioned by the Sussex police. The Crown Prosecution Service in Sussex has not yet received a copy of the review but remain willing to consider any findings relating to the way the CPS dealt with the prosecution of the case.
<P>

<a name="10410w01.html_para4">I explained in a detailed written answer on 24 May 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 528-31W, when responding to a question put down by the hon. Member, that the decisions made by the Sussex Crown Prosecution Service were entirely satisfactory, given the evidence produced by the initial police investigation. I am willing to reconsider that conclusion in the light of any findings of the review.
<P>

<a name="10410w01.html_para5">Sussex police have appointed a new investigation team. Consistent with this fresh start, the Chief Crown Prosecutor for CPS Sussex made arrangements for a senior lawyer from Hampshire Crown Prosecution Service to deal with any prosecution which may result from the new investigation.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if plastic plant pots are considered to be packaging for the purposes of the Producer Responsibility Obligation (Packaging Waste) Regulations 1997.  [157603]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10410w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Robert Ainsworth: </B> 
 A recent High Court ruling confirmed the interpretation of the Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) Regulations 1997 (as amended) that has been taken since the Regulations came into force in 1997. Where an empty plant pot is brought as a retail product, it is not packaging. Where a plant is bought in a pot and will be kept in the pot throughout its life, or where a pot is made of biodegradable material and will be planted in the garden with the plant, the pot is not regarded as packaging. However, where plants are bought in a plant pot or a seed or bedding tray and will be transplanted to the garden, such pots are packaging. This is because these pots are used to keep the plants in good condition throughout the sales process until replanting and contain the plants for the ease and convenience of the purchaser in handling and transporting them. As such, each pot constitutes a 'sales' unit at the time of purchase.

 I represented the United Kingdom at the Council, which was held in Luxembourg.
<P>

<a name="10410w02.html_para0">The Council opened with a policy debate on the Commission's second package of maritime safety issues. The Presidency presented a questionnaire focusing on the three elements in the package: improved ship monitoring, an additional compensation fund mechanism in cases of oil pollution, and the creation of a European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA). The Commission hoped for common positions at the June Council. I stressed the importance of considering these proposals in the context of the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) and of existing member state competence, an approach shared by most member states present.
<P>

<a name="10410w02.html_para1">On Galileo, the Council adopted an approach that established milestones for future significant decisions about the launch of the development (December 2001) and the deployment (December 2003) phases. I was one of a number of Ministers to speak in support of this approach, which is intended to ensure that the project is based on sound financial management and private sector financing, as required by successive conclusions of the European Council. The decision milestones are necessary if Galileo is to deliver tangible benefits to the public and provide the taxpayer with good value for money. I also argued for more work to be carried out this year to meet UK and other member states' concerns about costs, management arrangements, the definition of the services and attracting private finance. This work will help the Council make an informed decision in December about the future of the project.
<P>

<a name="10410w02.html_para2">The Council agreed a Resolution setting out priorities for further progress in integrating environmental issues into transport policy. The Commission said it would follow up many of these priorities in the forthcoming Common Transport Policy White Paper.
<P>

<a name="10410w02.html_para3">There was a progress report and policy debate on the draft regulation establishing a European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). The Presidency sought views on the key issues of which aircraft should be covered, the mechanism for appointment of the Executive Director, and inspections of member states and investigations of undertakings. I joined others in expressing the views that only member state registered aircraft should be covered, that the Executive Director should be appointed by the Agency's Administrative Board, and that EASA should have the powers of inspection and investigation. The Presidency concluded that discussion should continue in the Working Group, aiming for a common position as soon as practicable.
<P>

<a name="10410w02.html_para4">The Council agreed Conclusions urging member states to be in a position to ratify the Montreal Convention on air carrier liability by 31 December 2002. The Council also agreed a Decision for Community ratification of the Convention, to be deposited simultaneously with those of the member states. The Presidency hoped that a decision on a revision of Regulation 2027/97 would be taken in June.
<P>

<a name="10410w02.html_para5">The Commissioner reported on her recent visit to the United States to discuss ways to limit aircraft noise in future. She felt the exchange had been useful and further technical meetings had since been arranged.

<a name="10410w02.html_para6">The Commissioner also initiated a discussion on the state of the European airline industry, arguing that a Community mandate to negotiate with the US was a necessary precursor of airline consolidation.
<P>

<a name="10410w02.html_para7">The Presidency presented a framework for the Community to negotiate on aviation environmental issues, particularly aircraft noise, in the run-up to the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) General Assembly in September. This framework was agreed unanimously.
<P>

<a name="10410w02.html_para8">Pending the First Reading of the European Parliament there was political agreement on the text of a Regulation requiring third country lorry drivers to carry a certificate of legal employment. The UK maintained a parliamentary scrutiny reserve.

<P>

<a name="10410w02.html_para10">The Council debated a proposed amendment to the directive on weights and dimensions of heavy vehicles, requiring member states to accept the use of 15 metre buses. The Presidency presented a global compromise addressing delegations' outstanding concerns. At the end of the debate, the Presidency concluded that there was general political agreement, but that the text of a derogation for the UK (addressing our concerns at the out-swing of these vehicles) would be remitted to Coreper for further consideration.
<P>

<a name="10410w02.html_para11">The Council adopted Conclusions on the Commission's recent Recommendation on the maximum permitted blood alcohol level for drivers. The Conclusions underline the importance of progress on a range of drink drive measures including collaboration between member states.
<P>

<a name="10410w02.html_para12">The Council discussed a proposed amendment to the directive on compulsory use of safety belts and child restraint systems. The text under discussion attempted to solve outstanding concerns on the detailed requirements for young children to use adult seat belts in the absence of appropriate child restraints. A number of member states had concerns about the proposals. The UK was among those taking the view that it required further examination. The Presidency concluded that the Council could not reach agreement and remitted the text for further consideration at the technical level, hoping for a common position in June.
<P>

<a name="10410w02.html_para13">There was a progress report and policy debate on new proposals to update the procurement procedures for public transport services. The Commission hoped that the new regulations would be discussed in June.
<P>

<a name="10410w02.html_para14">There was a discussion over lunch of the draft directive on the harmonisation of weekend lorry bans. The Commission emphasised the importance of harmonising the periods during which member states may impose bans and stressed that the proposal applied only to new bans and to the transport Trans-European Network. Consultation would be required on the imposition of new bans. I joined a number of member states in supporting the proposal.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what plans he has to amend the Air Navigation Order to give effect to a national private pilot's licence; when he hopes to amend the ANO; and if he will permit flying hours undertaken by student pilots from 1 May to count towards the issue of an NPPL.  [157962]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10410w03.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Robert Ainsworth: </B> 
 The Civil Aviation Authority advises that detailed negotiations with industry representatives over proposals for a national private pilots licence are moving towards a satisfactory conclusion. Once agreement has been reached, there will follow the normal period of consultation and, subject to general agreement on the proposals, it is hoped to amend the ANO in order to give effect to a NPPL from the beginning of next year.
<P>

<a name="10410w03.html_para0">As regards previously accumulated flying hours, the NPPL is envisaged as being a "stand alone" licence, with no read across or equivalence to the Joint Aviation Requirements--Private Pilot's Licence. It will, in effect, exist in isolation of other ICAO compliant licences. Therefore, training to the NPPL syllabus will not be permitted prior to its coming into effect, and no credit will be granted for flying hours acquired under other training syllabuses.

 My answer dated 18 December 2000, <i>Official Report,</i> column 7W, provided details of Government funding to train operating companies (TOCs) in 1997-98, 1998-99 and 1999-2000. In addition, the Government paid freight grants of &#163;21 million, &#163;19 million and &#163;17 million respectively to freight operating companies (FOCs) in those years. That funding is not hypothecated to cover particular types of expenditure, so it cannot be directly identified as the source of payments made by TOCs and FOCs to Railtrack. For example, in addition to Government funding, TOCs receive income from Passenger Transport Executives, from fares paid for passenger services and from payments made for other services.

<a name="10410w03.html_para9">The main purpose of the proposed Regulations is to enable the Secretary of State to issue directions requiring the holders of waste management licences for specified landfill sites to accept and dispose of specified kinds of agricultural waste. These Regulations and the consequential directions are necessary to ensure that waste arising from the foot and mouth disease outbreak is disposed of effectively and in ways which ensure protection for the environment and human health.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions how many projects in Coventry, funded by his Department, are designed to improve levels of recycling.  [157860]<P>

<P>
<a name="10410w04.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The provision of recycling facilities is the responsibility of local authorities and in this case Coventry city council. Major extra funding for local authorities was announced in the Spending Review 2000. By 2003-04 revenue support will have risen by &#163;1.1 billion over 2000-01 provision, in the Environmental Protection and Cultural Services allocation, which includes waste. There will also be a &#163;140 million ring fenced fund for waste and recycling, and &#163;220 million for PFI waste schemes over the next three years.

<a name="10410w04.html_para0">Coventry may also benefit from projects over wider areas, but I am not aware of any projects funded by DETR which are specific to supporting recycling in Coventry.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10410w04.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 Under the Kyoto Protocol, the UK has agreed to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 12.5 per cent. relative to the 1990 level over the period 2008-12. The Government have recently published figures which show that in 1999 the UK's greenhouse gas emissions were 14.5 per cent. below 1990 levels. This represents a 6.5 per cent. reduction between 1998 and 1999.




<P>
<P><I>10 Apr 2001 : Column: 504W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="10410w04.html_para1">The Government have also published provisional estimates of carbon dioxide emissions in 2000. These show that emissions were 7.5 per cent. below 1990 levels in 2000, consistent with the general downward trend in emissions shown in the UK Climate Change Programme. However, emissions increased by about 2 per cent. between 1999 and 2000, mainly as a result of increased use of coal in power stations because of maintenance and repair at nuclear and Combined Cycle Gas Turbine power stations and higher gas prices towards the end of the year.
<P>

<a name="10410w04.html_para2">The UK Climate Change Programme, published in November 2000, sets out a range of policies and measures that could reduce the UK's greenhouse gas emissions to 23 per cent. below 1990 levels in 2010, significantly beyond the UK's target under the Kyoto Protocol.

 The increases announced by Virgin relate in the main to unregulated fares. Under the terms of its franchise, any increase in unregulated fares is a commercial matter for Virgin. However, in the light of recent disruption on the rail network, and the wish to attract more passengers to rail, the Government find Virgin's announcement regrettable. The Strategic Rail Authority will be meeting representatives from Virgin shortly to discuss the matter.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if he will make a statement about the conclusions of the Quinquennial Review of the National Weights and Measures Laboratory.  [158294]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10410w05.html_spnew7"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The first stage of the five-yearly Review of the National Weights and Measures Laboratory (NWML) has now been completed.
<P>

<a name="10410w05.html_para11">NWML will continue as an Executive Agency of the DTI.
<P>

<a name="10410w05.html_para12">NWML is a regulatory body. The current functions of NWML form a coherent group that benefits from being managed as a whole. Ministers have therefore decided not to proceed with the alternative option considered by the Review, that of transferring the bulk of NWML's work to NPL Management Ltd. (the company which runs the National Physical Laboratory under contract to the DTI) with a small policy unit kept in the DTI. This organisational separation of policy from operations would risk reducing the quality of the work, and has been criticised by interested parties. The present integrated structure is seen as a great strength of NWML.
<P>

<a name="10410w05.html_para13">As announced on 28 July 2000, <i>Official Report,</i> column 1095W, the reviewer recommended that the policy part of NWML should be taken back into the Department organisationally and that the operational part should be contractorised by merger with NPL, which is already contractorised. However, the Review Steering Board recommended that this option should not be proceeded with until a business plan for the merger could be prepared and until Ministers had assessed its value for money and feasibility.
<P>

<a name="10410w05.html_para14">I have now considered the business plan prepared by NPL Management Ltd. and have received further advice from the Review Steering Board. I have also had the benefit of representations made by many interested parties. I accept that the merger with NPL would result in financial savings to the Department, but they are relatively modest. However, I have come to the conclusion that the benefits to the Department, to the users of NWML's services, and to the UK, which arise from having NWML run as an integrated body outweigh these potential savings.
<P>

<a name="10410w05.html_para15">This announcement will appear on the DTI's website.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10410w06.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Alan Johnson: </B> 
 The Government have approved the Post Office's five-year Strategic Plan for 2001-06, endorsing the Board's view that this should be the basis on which management should drive the business forward. This is a five-year rolling Plan which is updated annually. The Plan represents a key element in the new arms-length relationship that the Government have established with the Post Office in fulfilment of the reforms described in the White Paper published in July 1999. The Post Office is continuing to build on last year's Plan. Nevertheless, it recognises that there remains much to do in an increasingly competitive marketplace.

<P>

<a name="10410w06.html_para0">The key features of the Strategic Plan are commercially confidential, and as such will not be published. In approving the Plan, the Government have maintained the medium term target for the Post Office to achieve a 13 per cent. return on capital employed for its operational business. This excludes the network of post offices and any non-operational interest arising from past surpluses. Return on capital employed is defined as profit before interest payable and tax, but after operating interest receivable, divided by operating capital employed.

<P>

 Detailed assessments for the four named countries have not been undertaken. The formal take-back schemes are relatively new and vary greatly in scope and approach to funding. Direct comparison is difficult. Switzerland (1998) and the Netherlands (1999, 2000) have both legislated for retailer take back but the Government are unaware of any formal assessments by the Swiss or Dutch Governments. Germany has developed a draft ordinance (1999) which is currently the subject of a review. Austria introduced a draft ordinance in 1994 covering only lamps and white goods. This is currently being reviewed by the Austrian authorities.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10410w06.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 The extent to which pyrolysis reduces the volume of waste to landfill depends very much on the pyrolysis technology employed. Some of these technologies produce a glass-like residue that can be used for road aggregate avoiding almost any landfill stream, some a lighter ash and some a charcoal-type material that can be quite bulky. However, I do wish to find ways of encouraging new technology that converts waste into renewable energy, after maximum recycling.

<a name="10410w06.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Alan Johnson: </B> 
 The Government do not set targets for the recruitment of engineers. However, we do listen carefully to employers when developing strategies to meet future skills needs in engineering. We also take account of statistical data and research reports from a wide variety of sources, including UCAS. The National Training Organisations (NTOs) also have a key role in providing detailed and accurate information on future skills issues across a range of sectors and we hope to see this role developed and enhanced as a result of the current consultation exercise aimed at strengthening the NTO Network.

 The EU's aims for a New Round of multilateral trade talks were set out ahead of the three Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) at Seattle in the General Affairs Council (GAC) Conclusions of 26 October 1999.

<a name="10410w08.html_para7">The EU is still seeking the launch of a comprehensive round of talks: we maintain that only a broad-based inclusive agenda can encompass priority issues for every WTO Member, increasing the incentive to tackle more difficult areas and so bringing greatest benefits to all.

 <i>[holding answer 9 April 2001]:</i> The in-service date set at the main approval point for ASRAAM was December 1998. Technical problems with the missile hardware and software, combined with a decision to alter the delivery programme to align better with the candidate aircraft, resulted in the approval of a revised in-service date of April 2001.
<P>

<a name="10410w08.html_para9">Matra BAE Dynamics (MBD), the prime contractor for ASRAAM, has not yet achieved the missile performance level required by the Ministry of Defence (MOD). The company has encountered a number of technical problems, which have caused some delay to the programme and mean that the in-service date of April 2001 will not be achieved. The MOD is not prepared to take delivery of any missiles until MBD can show that an acceptable standard can be met. However, we have made clear to the company the need to resolve the problems and to agree a revised programme to its entry into service. Until that time, Tornado F3, Harrier GR9 and Sea Harrier FA2 aircraft will continue to have an effective short-range air-to-air capability using Sidewinder missiles.

 The Alternative Landing Ships Logistic (ALSLs) are designed for the carriage and offload at sea of troops, their equipment and stores, including ammunition, directly into a potentially hostile environment. They represent an important element of the modernisation of the UK amphibious capability foreseen in the Strategic Defence Review.
<P>

<a name="10410w09.html_para15">The current Landing Ships Logistics (LSLs) are mostly over 30 years old and of decreasing utility. The four new ALSLs will each have double the Linear Metre capacity of an LSL, thus providing greater vehicle and equipment carriage to support the embarked troops. This represents a marked increase in our amphibious lift capability. The ALSLs will be able to offload troops more quickly, by sea and air simultaneously, at a safer distance, and in significantly worse sea conditions. They can also provide tactical logistics support to land forces, and are flexible ships which can undertake a wide variety of other military tasks.

 The Suez operation of 1956 is recognised by the "Near East" clasp to the General Service Medal. There are no plans to institute a medal for the earlier period of emergency from 1951 onwards. The then Under-Secretary of State for Defence, my hon. Friend the Member for Warley (Mr. Spellar), reviewed the matter in 1998 and found no evidence that he believed would enable him to persuade the Committee on the Grant of Honours, Decorations and Medals to overturn their policy of non-retrospection, or to revoke any of the decisions made at the time or following various Departmental reviews since 1990. No such evidence has subsequently come to light.

 A total of seven weeks of meetings are scheduled for the rest of this year in Geneva on a Protocol to strengthen the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC). The Protocol is an important arms control objective for the Untied Kingdom and Foreign Office Ministers have already addressed the BWC ad hoc group on two separate occasions to stress the need for a successful outcome to the negotiations. We are currently assessing the contents of the draft Protocol which was tabled by the Chair of the BWC ad hoc group (Ambassador Toth, Hungary) on 30 March, and also await first reactions for the other countries involved. We welcome the appearance of the text at this stage of the negotiations. We will consider ministerial attendance as negotiations proceed.

The UK has played a leading role throughout these negotiations as we have had responsibility for the section of the text on compliance measures--the core of the future Protocol. We welcome the appearance of the text and are currently assessing this overall content. A successful outcome by the time of the BWC Review Conference remains a possibility but will depend upon the reaction to the text from all countries involved over the coming months. An effective BWC Protocol remains an important arms control objective for the United Kingdom as it will help fill the last remaining gap in Treaty provisions designed to stem the proliferation of WMD.

With &#163;120 million of central Government and Lottery funding we will be providing a school sports co-ordinator in one in four secondary schools to work with local primary and special schools to improve sporting provision and physical education for children in the most deprived areas.

extended to everyone in December 2001. We have commissioned a taskforce which is currently considering the issues facing non-national museums in the regions.
<P>

<a name="10410w13.html_para17">We have made improvements in the way the Lottery is spent to ensure a fairer distribution. The introduction of the New Opportunities Fund for spending on health, education and the environment has made a real difference to communities everywhere. For instance it has invested &#163;120 million to support the People's Network, which will enable all 4,300 public libraries to offer free public internet access through UK online learning centres; and a further &#163;50 million to stimulate development of content to support the Network.
<P>

<a name="10410w13.html_para18">We have set up a Regional Cultural Consortium in each of the English regions outside London to champion culture and creativity, including heritage, sport and tourism, and to draw up regional cultural strategies identifying regional objectives and priorities.
<P>

<a name="10410w13.html_para19">We have published a Green Paper "Culture and Creativity: The Next Ten Years", setting out how individual creative talent can be given the support it needs from childhood to flourish; how artists and cultural institutions can be freed from bureaucratic controls; and how the freedom to explore and enjoy creativity and culture can be made available to all.
<P>

<a name="10410w13.html_para20">Through their commitment to public service broadcasting, the Government have helped to foster an environment in which a creative, commercially successful broadcasting industry provides a wide range of UK-made, high quality, original programmes catering for all viewers and listeners. We have ensured a secure funding base for the BBC and S4C, while giving them the freedom to develop commercial operations which complement and support their public service remit. We have made clear in the Communications White Paper that public service broadcasting will continue to have a key role to play in the digital future. The Government have introduced free television licences for people aged 75 or over from 1 November last year.
<P>

<a name="10410w13.html_para21">My Department sponsors the British Tourist Authority (BTA) which continues to promote Britain effectively as an attractive tourist destination for overseas visitors. The BTA's successful marketing activities are aimed at bringing benefits to all parts of the UK, including Chichester.

<a name="10410w13.html_para22">In delivering these initiatives we aim to make cultural and sporting activities inclusive ones, boosting participation and improving the quality of life for all.

<a name="10410w13.html_para24">According to the information supplied to us by the distributing bodies for the national lottery awards database, there have been 93 national lottery awards to Chichester totalling &#163;8,561,530.
<P>

<a name="10410w13.html_para25">Thirty-five Millennium Award Winners have been identified from Chichester and between them have received grants totalling &#163;80,834.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport if he will set out, with statistical information relating as directly as possible to the London borough of Southwark, the effects on the London borough of Southwark of his Department's policies and actions since May 2 1997.  [155981]<P>

<a name="10410w14.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Chris Smith </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 2 April 2001]:</i> Since May 1997 my Department has introduced and developed a variety of initiatives which will impact on my right hon. Friend's constituency which promote our objectives of access, excellence, education, and creativity and employment. We have published our strategies to take this forward in "Tomorrow's Tourism" and "A Sporting Future for All", which was recently followed up by "The Government's Plan for Sport". We have tackled the issue of social inclusion taking forward the recommendations of Policy Action Team 10 on Arts and Sport and developing social inclusion policies across all our areas which is recognised within the most recent progress report "Building on PAT10."
<P>

<a name="10410w14.html_para2">We have given more support to the cultural and sporting infrastructure. The Spending Review 2000 secured a doubling of the budget for sport and the largest ever increase for the arts: an increase of 80 per cent. from &#163;186 million in 1997-98 to &#163;336 million in 2003-04. In taking forward our aim to develop the educational 



<P>
<P><I>10 Apr 2001 : Column: 542W</I><P>
potential of culture and sport &#163;40 million has been allocated to developing Creative Partnerships; we have established through lottery funding, the &#163;30 million National Foundation for Youth Music; and secured an additional &#163;130 million for primary schools sports and arts facilities through the Space for Sport and the Arts programme. With &#163;120 million of central Government and Lottery funding we will be providing a school sports co-ordinator in one in four secondary schools to work with local primary and special schools to improve sporting provision and physical education for children in the most deprived areas. We have delivered free access to national museums for children and the over 60s and additional money will be provided to allow this to be extended to everyone in December 2001. We have commissioned a Task Force which is currently considering the issues facing non-national museums in the regions.
<P>

<a name="10410w14.html_para3">We have made improvements in the way the Lottery is spent to ensure a fairer distribution. The introduction of the New Opportunities Fund for spending on health, education and the environment has made a real difference to communities everywhere. For instance it has invested &#163;120 million to support the People's Network, which will enable all 4,300 public libraries to offer free public internet access through UK online learning centres; and a further &#163;50 million to stimulate development of content to support the Network.

<P>

<a name="10410w14.html_para6">Through their commitment to public service broadcasting, the Government have helped to foster an environment in which a creative, commercially successful broadcasting industry provides a wide range of UK-made, high quality, original programmes catering for all viewers and listeners. We have ensured a secure funding base for the BBC and S4C, while giving them the freedom to develop commercial operations which complement and support their public service remit. We have made clear in the Communications White Paper that public service broadcasting will continue to have a key role to play in the digital future. The Government have introduced free television licences for people aged 75 or over from 1 November last year.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what help has been given to those sports which have relied on tobacco sponsorship; and if he will make a statement.  [157315]<P>

<P>
<a name="10410w15.html_spnew0"><B> Kate Hoey </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 6 April 2001]:</i> Over the past two years, there has been extensive contact with the seven sports that sought assistance to make the transition from tobacco sponsorship. The taskforce of business and sponsorship has been there to make information available, offer advice to support the development of new marketing strategies, make initial contact with potential sponsors and offer professional advice on how the sports can start to position themselves in a changing marketplace.
<P>

<a name="10410w15.html_para0">The taskforce has now concluded the first phase of its work to identify the needs of the sports and ascertain how best it can assist them. Assistance with the replacement of existing contracts can most effectively be targeted in the 12 to 18 months before they lapse, which is the normal lead-in time for negotiating new sponsorship agreements. 



<P>
<P><I>10 Apr 2001 : Column: 545W</I><P>
I am in close touch with the seven sports affected and the taskforce has made clear to them that its assistance is still available as and when they require it.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport (1) if the Advisory Committee on historic wreck sites was consulted about the length of the licence granted to excavate the wreck site of the "Hanover"; and if he will make a statement;  [157425]
<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="10410w15.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Alan Howarth: </B> 
 In July 1997 the "Hanover" wreck site was the subject of an emergency designation under the Protection of Wrecks Act 1973. Mr. Colin Martin, who was working on the site at the time, immediately applied for leave for judicial review of the Designation Order. The terms of the licence were agreed as part of the settlement of the action. The Advisory Committee on Historic Wreck Sites was not formally consulted on the terms of the licence but they were kept informed of developments throughout. Decisions on the granting of licences are for the Secretary of State to make, consulting as he sees appropriate. There is no set time limit for licences granted under the Protection of Wrecks Act.

Over the last three years, buildings in Liverpool have attracted conservation grants from the Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) and English Heritage totalling &#163;43.4 million, of which &#163;42.8 million was for buildings in Liverpool Riverside. These figures include a grant of &#163;26.7 million from the HLF for development and refurbishment of the Liverpool Museum and Walker Art Gallery.

 The Horizon project to computerise all post office systems is nearing completion.

Ring fenced support has been allocated over the next three years to implement recommendations in the Performance and Innovation Unit report on modernisation of the Post Office network.
<P>

<a name="10410w16.html_para2">The Government fully recognise the pivotal role which the Post Office plays in communities across Scotland. A new &#163;2 million UK wide fund, which is available for the 2001-02 financial year to support initiatives to maintain or re-open post office facilities in areas where the traditional post office is closing, will help to strengthen the rural post office network in Scotland. All of these initiatives will ensure that we can build a post office network which goes from strength to strength.

<P>
<a name="10410w16.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Foulkes </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 26 March 2001]:</i> On health, a range of policies have been adopted since May 1997 to improve the NHS in Scotland. These measures include, for example, the abolition of the internal market and the commitment to substantial increases in expenditure on the NHS. All areas of Scotland, including Edinburgh and Edinburgh, South, benefit from these policies.
<P>

<a name="10410w16.html_para3">On education, between 1997 and 1999 there was a 10 per cent. reduction (from 63 to 57) in the number of primary school classes in Edinburgh, South with more than 30 pupils. Between 1996 and 1999, the number of teachers (full-time equivalent) employed in Edinburgh, South rose by 15 in primaries and by 12 in secondaries. The pupil-teacher ratio dropped from 21.5 to 19.7 in primaries and from 13.3 to 13.0 in secondaries over this period.
<P>

<a name="10410w16.html_para4">Between 1996 and 1999, the percentage of the S4 school roll gaining five or more Standard Grades at levels 1-4 in secondary schools in Edinburgh, South rose from around 61 per cent. to around 74 per cent.
<P>

<a name="10410w16.html_para5">Early in 1999, the City of Edinburgh council was awarded funding of &#163;600,000 over three years for a New Community schools project under phase 1 of the pilot programme. Four primary schools in Edinburgh, South are included in the project (Fernieside, Gilmerton, Moredun and St. John Vianney RC).
<P>

<a name="10410w16.html_para6">Also early in 1999, the City of Edinburgh council was awarded &#163;1.5 million over three years to implement an Education Action Plan to improve attainment in schools facing particular challenges.

<P>

<a name="10410w16.html_para15">I have decided to make two changes to the scheme set out in the White Paper in the light of comments received. Firstly, the legislation will include proposals for a new offence of 'trading in influence' which will apply to both the public and the private sectors. As the extension of the offence to the private sector is a new proposal I shall listen most carefully to the arguments on both sides when the Bill comes before the House. Secondly, the legislation will extend not only to England and Wales but to Northern Ireland as well.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what plans he has to ensure that employers do not unlawfully discriminate when using the statutory defence against prosecution under section 8 of the Asylum and Immigration Act 1996.  [158180]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10410w16.html_spnew6"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 Section 8 of the Asylum and Immigration Act 1996 ("the 1996 Act") allows for the prosecution of employers who knowingly employ individuals without permission to work in the United Kingdom. A statutory defence against prosecution is available which requires that the employer obtain a copy of a document showing that the individual is entitled to take work.
<P>

<a name="10410w16.html_para17">There were concerns that, in seeking to avail themselves of this defence, employers were unlawfully discriminating by making more checks on job applicants than the defence in Section 8 requires or by targeting checks on racial grounds. That is why we undertook, in the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999, to issue a Code of Practice to employers on how to avoid racial discrimination when seeking to apply the defence.
<P>

<a name="10410w16.html_para18">In the light of that commitment the Government have prepared a Code of Practice that sets out the responsibilities of employers under the Race Relations Act 1976 and the 1996 Act and describes how employers can use the statutory defence in a way that avoids racial discrimination. In preparing the draft Code of Practice and summary, we consulted the Commission for Racial Equality, the Equality Commission for Northern Ireland and a number of other organisations.
<P>

<a name="10410w16.html_para19">We propose that this Code of Practice should come into force on 2 May. We plan to distribute copies to interested organisations, together with a summary, which should ensure that all employers can easily understand their responsibilities in avoiding racial discrimination. A copy of the code of practice has been placed in the Library.

 I announced on 6 March 2001, <i>Official Report,</i> column 121W, that the scheme for regulating immigration advisers under part V of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 would be brought into force on 30 April 2001. I have now signed a commencement order to that effect. From that date, it will be a criminal offence to provide immigration advice or immigration services in the course of a business in breach of the requirements of the Act.
<P>

<a name="10410w17.html_para0">It has never been the Government's intention that Members of Parliament should be subject to the regulatory scheme. Our advice is that Members of both Houses of Parliament, Members of the European Parliament, Members of the devolved legislatures, local councillors, and their staff, are not subject to the regulatory scheme when providing immigration advice or services in connection with their parliamentary and constituency duties. Immigration advice and services given in other circumstances, however, may be subject to the scheme.

 The Home Office is working to build a safe, just and tolerant society in which the rights and responsibilities of individuals, families and communities are properly balanced, and the protection and security of the public are maintained. Detailed information on the impact of Home Office policies across the full range of responsibilities is set out in Home Office Annual Reports. A copy of the most recent report, Home Office Annual Report 2000-01, is available in the Library. Information on recorded crime and policing is also published. 'Recorded Crime England and Wales, 12 months to September 2000' and 'Police Service Strength England and Wales, 30 September 2000' can be found in the Library.

YOT preventative and early intervention referrals and services have increased significantly. These include: restorative conferences between victims and offenders; assessments and intervention in response to anti-social behaviour (to prevent the need for anti-social behaviour orders); assessments and enhanced services for looked after children at risk of re-offending; assessments and intervention for other high risk groups including young people involved in substance misuse and excluded from school.

[157121]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10410w19.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 No police strength figures were published in November 2000. The figures for 31 March first appeared in the Home Office Statistical Bulletin 'Police Service Personnel England and Wales as at 31 March 2000' published on 30 August 2000. A correction to the 31 March 2000 figures was made in the next police strength Bulletin (concerned with figures for 30 September 2000), which was first published on 14 December 2000. This correction was made because it was discovered there had been some double counting of the number of secondments to central services. This originated from the National Criminal Intelligence Service return being completed incorrectly. The overall police strength figures were revised downwards by 248 from 124,418 to 124,170.
<P>

<a name="10410w19.html_para0">The figures for 30 September 2000 which were published on 14 December 2000 were subsequently revised, and the Bulletin re-issued on 16 January 2001. There were no differences between the police figures for 31 March 2000 in these two Bulletins. The revisions made in the 16 January 2001 publication related to the figures for 30 September. There were two changes. First, the overall police strength figures were revised upwards by 451 officers because of undercounting by the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS). The number of officers seconded to Hertfordshire, Essex and Surrey had been deducted twice from the total number of officers.
<P>

<a name="10410w19.html_para1">Secondly, the MPS figure on minority ethnic officers on 30 September was corrected from 1,227 to 1,013 because the higher figure had included in the minority ethnic group some 214 officers classified as 'White Irish' or 'Other White'.

<a name="10410w19.html_para2">A further revision to the 30 September 2000 figures was made in the written answer given on 22 March 2001, <i>Official Report,</i> column 324W, to my hon.

<P>
<a name="10410w20.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The "locks for pensioners" scheme that we are funding in conjunction with the Department for Environment, Transport and the Region's Home Energy Efficiency Scheme enables certain low income pensioners in high crime areas to have their house checked for security and if necessary to have additional security features such as door and window locks fitted. The scheme has been running in England for eight months and, by the end of March, almost 47,000 houses had been surveyed of which 22,441 were found to require security upgrades. So far, 21,715 of these have been referred to the registered installers and for 10,778 houses, the security upgrades are known to have been completed. The true figure will, however, be significantly higher as there can be a delay of several weeks between the work being completed and confirmation of this fact being received by the two organisations managing the scheme.
<P>

<a name="10410w20.html_para1">The equivalent scheme started in Wales only in February and, as yet, there are no centrally held figures for the numbers of Welsh households that have had improved security fittings as a result.

<a name="10410w20.html_para2">We have also funded a number of projects that provide security upgrades to burglary victims or other vulnerable people under our Reducing Burglary Initiative. We do not, however, have central records of the numbers fitted or whether the recipients were pensioners.

 We have not, in the last 12 months, undertaken an assessment of the cost to public funds of dealing with domestic violence. We know that this cost is a significant one: the research study "Counting the costs; estimating the impact of domestic violence in the London Borough of Hackney" published by Crime Concern in 1998, estimated the total cost of providing services for the survivors of domestic violence in Greater London to be in the region of &#163;278 million per annum.

 No. The categorisation and allocation of prisoners is a matter for the Director General of the Prison Service. The Prison Service carries out the categorisation of prisoners according to a rigorous and objective assessment of the risk they present, and in accordance with established guidelines. These assessments are best carried out by those on the ground, but I can say that under the Prison Service Order on categorisation and allocation, a prisoner sentenced to more than 12 months for an offence of violence would not normally be regarded as suitable for category D (open conditions) on initial categorisation.

<P>
<a name="10410w22.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Blunkett: </B> 
 The targets for the Employment Service, which I am announcing today, build on the success of the agency in delivering the Government's welfare to work policies, working in close partnership with employers and others. These targets pave the way for the new agency, Jobcentre Plus, whose pathfinder offices will begin work in October. They give stronger emphasis than ever before to helping individuals facing particular difficulty in the labour market to move from unemployment and economic inactivity into sustainable employment. The highest priority will be given to helping people who have been economically inactive for long periods, including lone parents, to find work, and to capitalise on the opportunities created by the new generation of New Deals. For the first time, the Employment Service will have a target to measure its success in helping long term unemployed people not only to find work but to remain in work. I will also be introducing, from October, two new targets: to support ES's efforts to achieve parity of outcomes for ethnic minority clients by 2004, and to support the key role which ES will play in identifying and remedying shortfalls in the basic skills of unemployed people, to enhance their employability.
<P>

<a name="10410w22.html_para1">I commend this package of targets. They are challenging for the Employment Service to deliver. I believe that the job entry targets are very stretching. I am looking for improved levels of customer service to jobseekers and employers, together with consolidation of the improved performance against the Jobseeker's Allowance Labour Market Activity target. These targets cover a full year, but I propose to carry out a comprehensive consultation and review later in the year that will inform the setting of targets for the new Agency for people of working age, called Jobcentre Plus, for 2002-03.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Employment Service aims to make a major contribution to an efficient and flexible labour market, and to the Government's objectives of an increase in the effective supply of labour, and countering poverty and social exclusion by helping welfare recipients facing the most severe disadvantages to compete effectively for jobs. It does this by working closely with employers and with its private, voluntary and public sector partners to provide a quality service for all people without a job and to promote employment opportunities for all who can work. It aims to attract a diverse range of vacancies and to fill those vacancies quickly by matching the right people and skills with the right jobs. Its chief priority is to help individuals facing particular difficulty in the labour market to move from welfare and economic inactivity into sustainable employment. It does this through correct application of the Jobseeker's Allowance (JSA) regime, delivery of the New Deals, and provision of appropriate information, advice, training and support. The challenge and opportunity for the Employment Service, is to sustain continuous improvement in its services to jobseekers and employers and to make those services more accessible and relevant to customer needs, through effective use of modern technology and close working with a wide range of partners.</FONT></UL>

A more technical overview is given by the Commission's Economic Paper 138, published in November 1999 by K. McMorrow and W. Roeger, entitled "The economic consequences of ageing populations". Further information on these and related documents can be found on the European Union's "Europa" website.

<P>

<a name="10410w23.html_para6">The European Social Agenda sets out a framework and proposals to modernise European social policy over the next five years. Many of the proposals will contribute directly to the Lisbon strategic goal of becoming "The most competitive and dynamic knowledge based economy in the world", for example commitments to increasing employability through lifelong learning, and addressing skills shortages, particularly in ICT.
<P>

<a name="10410w23.html_para7">The initiative now lies with the Commission to bring forward individual proposals. The UK Government will continue to scrutinise each proposal as it is brought forward to ensure that it has a proper treaty base.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment if it is the policy of the Government that independent appeals tribunals under section 94(6) of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998 should inform appellants that their decisions are binding in law.  [157459]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10410w24.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Estelle Morris </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 9 April 2001]:</i> Paragraph 15 of Schedule 24 to the School Standards and Framework Act 1998 specifies what information an appeal panel must give to appellants when informing them of the panel's decision on their appeal for a school place. It does not require appeal panels to inform appellants that its decision is binding on the admission authority whose decision is the subject of the appeal.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what assessment he has made of the compatibility of his powers to overrule an independent appeals panel under section 94(6) of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998 with the United Kingdom's obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights.  [157460]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10410w24.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Estelle Morris </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 9 April 2001]:</i> Section 96 of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998 provides local education authorities with a power of last resort to direct the admission of children to a foundation school when those children have been refused admission to, or been excluded from, all schools within a reasonable distance. Upon a referral from the governing body concerned, section 97 of the 1998 Act empowers the Secretary of State to name an alternative school in the direction. The Colne Community School was the subject of the last direction proposed by the Essex local education authority and referred to the Secretary of State. In the event, a vacancy arose and the pupil was admitted without the need for a direction.
<P>

<a name="10410w24.html_para0">The Court of Appeal has held, in R <i>v.</i> Richmond LBC ex parte JC, that the requirements of Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights are not engaged in admission appeals, because admission appeals are determinative only of parents' preferences as to the school at which they wish education to be provided for their child, rather than any civil right of the child.

<P>
<a name="10410w24.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Jenkin: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what the policy of the Government is concerning overcrowded schools, with particular reference to the Colne Community School, Essex.  [157461]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10410w24.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Estelle Morris </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 9 April 2001]:</i> The School Standards and Framework Act 1998 requires each maintained school to have a 'standard number', which is the minimum number of pupils it must admit, if there is demand. This continues a principle established in the Education Reform Act 1988. Where an individual school chooses to have a higher 'admission number', that is the minimum number of pupils it must admit, where there is demand. Once an admission number has been set, the admission authority must respect that number, unless exceptional circumstances apply.
<P>

<a name="10410w24.html_para1">The Colne Community School, like all other maintained schools, can refuse applications for places once the standard number, or higher admission number, has been reached. But the 1998 Act makes sensible provision for local education authorities to place children in schools which have reached their standard number, or higher admission number, if all other schools within a reasonable distance have refused the child a place or where the child has been excluded from all other schools within a reasonable distance. The alternative would mean the pupil attending a school beyond a reasonable distance.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what steps he is taking to reduce administrative burdens in schools.  [157775]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10410w24.html_spnew3"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 The Government are fully committed to reducing administrative burdens in schools in order to allow teachers to concentrate on teaching and raising standards. Examples of our action to do so include:
<P>

<a name="10410w24.html_para2">We have guaranteed to cut by a third the number of documents, and by a half the number of pages, that the Government send automatically to schools during this school year--in the first two terms of this school year, we will have halved the paperwork we sent to schools, compared with the first two terms last year.
<P>

<a name="10410w24.html_para3">We have radically simplified this year's Standards Fund--we have replaced bidding, claiming and reporting with a single expenditure returns sheet; we have allowed schools to vire funds between almost all grant headings; we have allowed schools to carry funds over to the end of the school year; and we have introduced monitoring against existing targets.
<P>

<a name="10410w24.html_para4">We have placed model schemes of work on the DfEE website to underpin all National Curriculum subjects at Key Stages 1-3--they are entirely voluntary and teachers may adopt them or adapt them as they wish. These have now been joined by over 1,000 useful lesson plans and resources in a further effort to reduce paperwork and make the necessary lesson preparation as straightforward as possible.
<P>

<a name="10410w24.html_para5">We have developed new ICT resources, including the launch of:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) EASEA--a full electronic in-tray and document archiving service for head teachers, teachers and governors that now has 7,000 registered users</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>



<P>
</UL></FONT><P><I>10 Apr 2001 : Column: 578W</I><P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(b) TeacherNet--a single web page offering links to the full range of educational resources on the internet</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(c) an internet based "A-Z" of school leadership and management--an electronic encyclopaedia for heads with succinct, practical guidance on a wide range of topics, full search facilities, and links through to reference material on organisational and legal issues, and examples of good practice.</FONT></UL>
<P>

<a name="10410w24.html_para6">We have harnessed DfEE and Cabinet Office resources to simplify some of the paperwork that schools complete--the first results of this joint project are set out in the "Making a Difference: Reducing School Paperwork" report. This shows potential savings for a typical school of over 200 hours every year--equivalent to more than a month's work for one person; and across the school system 4.5 million hours could be saved annually.
<P>

<a name="10410w24.html_para7">We are reducing data collection and avoiding data request duplication. We have set up a high level group with head teacher representation to review all new and existing DfEE data collection. This approach has been extended to involve QCA, Ofsted and TTA. We are also developing a common set of data for schools that, from 2002, will be collected once only and shared electronically by all authorised parties and agencies.
<P>

<a name="10410w24.html_para8">Teacher workload is being reduced with 44,000 FTE extra non-administrative support staff, including teaching assistants and learning mentors, since 1997. Within this, we have provided funding to recruit and train an additional 20,000 FTE teaching assistants between 1999 and 2002.
<P>

<a name="10410w24.html_para9">We have introduced a &#163;35 million Technology Package to enable schools to invest in new computers for management and administration, provide training and install software to introduce a seamless system that will save the average school five days work per year.
<P>

<a name="10410w24.html_para10">We have reviewed Ofsted procedures. Ofsted inspections can be a source of pressure on teachers and we have taken steps to reduce that pressure through the reduced notice period; shorter 'light touch' inspections for the most effective schools; and extending the maximum interval between inspections to six years.
<P>

<a name="10410w24.html_para11">We have provided specific help for small schools. In 2000, we set up two grants within the Standards Fund to assist small schools and we have now merged these into a single Small Schools Fund. The Fund provides support for small schools to help them with the extra difficulties that administration and collaboration present. The Fund is worth &#163;80 million in 2001-02 and is guaranteed for at least three years.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what assessment he has made of the capacity of the community legal service to reduce <i>(a)</i> child poverty and <i>(b)</i> social exclusion; and how these policy aims were incorporated in the Legal Service Commission corporate plan for 2000 to 2004.

<a name="10410w25.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Lock: </B> 
 One of the key aims of the community legal service (CLS) is to help tackle social exclusion through improving access to legal advice, information and representation. This is reflected in the Lord Chancellor's Department's strategic objectives and public service agreement targets.
<P>

<a name="10410w25.html_para4">In order to measure how effectively the CLS is tackling social exclusion through meeting previously unmet need for legal help and information, we have commissioned the legal services research centre to undertake a major long-term research project to measure and characterise levels of legal need in England and Wales. It will be known as the national periodic survey and will be based on a survey of 4,500 households, and it should provide a reliable source of information on how well the CLS is achieving its aims. The national periodic survey will be complemented by the local needs surveys carried out by the CLS partnerships.
<P>

<a name="10410w25.html_para5">The Lord Chancellor's Department is also producing a paper in collaboration with the Law Centres Federation which will set out how the CLS is helping to tackle social exclusion and the future role it can play.

<a name="10410w25.html_para6">The Legal Services Commission's corporate plan for 2000 to 2004, includes a section on the CLS. The opening part of the section is concerned with the overall purpose and objectives of the CLS and it refers to the key aim of helping to reduce social exclusion.

The Legal Services Commission is working with the Law Centres Federation and the law centres to effect this change.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what assessment he has made of the recent OECD report on transitional financial assistance to the fishing industry.  [157237]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10410w27.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The report by OECD on the economic and policy implications of transition to responsible fisheries is a welcome examination of the challenges involved in adopting more sustainable fishing methods across the developed world. One finding is that direct financial assistance to fishing industries can be detrimental to long-term sustainability unless it is carefully targeted at restructuring and complementary to management controls. This is consistent with the UK Government's view and the &#163;22.5 million package of aid for the English industry which I announced on 2 April is designed with long-term environmental and economic sustainability in mind.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10410w27.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Mitchell: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food if he will make available transitional aid to allow the fishing industry the means to introduce conservation measures and meet short-term losses arising from their introduction.  [157240]<P>

 Grant is available under the EU fisheries scheme FIFG for the adoption of conservation measures, for example, selective fishing gear and diversification away from pressure stocks. This is a priority area of the funding I announced on 2 April. It is, however, not appropriate to compensate fishermen for conserving stocks from which they will attain long-term benefit.

 The "Saving Lives: Our Healthier Nation" White Paper published in July 1999 included a target to reduce the death rate from cancer in people under 75 by at least a fifth. Based on the assumption of steady improvement towards the target and the population characteristics present in 1997, it was estimated that achievement of the target would be associated with up to 100,000 lives saved over the period 1997 to 2010. Independent expert advice at this time suggested that 40 per cent. of the target reduction could come from improvements or extensions to screening programmes and better treatment, and 60 per cent. of the target reduction could be achieved through primary prevention such as reductions in smoking and improvements in fruit and vegetable consumption.

 Respite care is important because it helps older people and disabled people to live in the community, and it allows informal or family carers to have a break from caring. The extra resources which the Government have provided for the National Health Service and for social services mean that more people can benefit from respite care, in a domiciliary setting, in a residential care home or nursing home, or in hospital.

 We see an important role for the independent sector, working in partnership with the NHS and councils, in providing services and making best use of resources and facilities. A framework for closer partnership was set out in the Concordat between the National Health Service and the independent sector, "For the Benefit of Patients", signed on 31 October 2000. Intermediate care was one of three areas highlighted as a particular area for co-operation. Guidance issued earlier this year asked the NHS and councils to take into account the potential contribution of the voluntary and private sectors in providing intermediate care and, where appropriate, to develop services in partnership with independent providers. In order to help local health and social care partners to engage more effectively with the independent sector in the short term the Department has developed model contracts, available on the Department's website, as a basis for local contracts with independent providers.

 The Department has made no detailed assessment of the costs of beta interferon treatment in other countries.

For example: on 18 October, we launched the first NHS Direct information points. 16 are located in community pharmacies; on 12 December, we launched the hospital medicines management performance framework, to make the best clinical and cost effective use of medicines and pharmacists' skills in hospitals; on 21 December we published the Health and Social Care Bill, which includes measures relating to the establishment of local pharmaceutical services and the extension of prescribing rights to new groups of health professionals, including pharmacists; and on 12 March we invited bids for the sites to take part in a national medicines management collaborative programme, a key step towards our target that by 2004 all primary care groups and trusts will have schemes so that people get more help from pharmacists in using their medicines.

 The Kensington, Chelsea and Westminster health authority representative on the Paddington Regeneration Partnership from June 1998 to the present time has been Mr. Paul Mason. Mr. Mason is an assistant director and therefore not a board member of Kensington, Chelsea and Westminster health authority.

 For the financial year-end 2000-01, Barnsley health authority is expected to show an operational financial balance (OFB) underspend of &#163;500,000 against its revenue resource limit of &#163;173,646,000. This has been agreed and accepted by the Trent regional office of the National Health Service Executive and will be carried forward to be used in the financial year 2001-02.
<P>

<a name="10410w29.html_para5">Within the OFB surplus, there are a number of overspending budgets (including cost per case contracts, out of area placements for learning disability and continuing care), which are offset by underspending budgets, including community prescribing.
<P>

<a name="10410w29.html_para6">In terms of cash control, the health authority has exactly met its revenue and capital cash limits for the year.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what assessment he has made of the impact of the ban on pithing on the future of small abattoirs.  [142890]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10410w30.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Stuart </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 18 December 2000]:</i> I am advised on questions of food safety by the Food Standards Agency (FSA). The ban on pithing is a requirement of a recent European Union decision on specified risk material, which introduced new EU-wide rules for the protection of both human and animal health from the risks of BSE.
<P>

<a name="10410w30.html_para0">The FSA carried out a full public consultation on proposals to implement the pithing ban. All licensed red meat slaughterhouses were consulted. A number of the responses received raised concerns that many small abattoirs would be unable safely to slaughter animals without pithing unless structural changes to their premises were made and maintained that many of these would be unable to afford the costs of such changes.
<P>

<a name="10410w30.html_para1">The FSA agrees that changes in structure or equipment, as well as in working practices, may be needed to enable abattoirs to comply with a pithing ban without putting worker safety at risk. However, the FSA considers that alternatives to pithing should be available at reasonable cost in most cases and therefore sees no fundamental reason why the need to make such changes should affect the future of small abattoirs. Nevertheless the FSA is monitoring the introduction of the pithing ban in small abattoirs in order to ensure that any significant problems are reported and investigated.

 <i>[holding answer 30 January 2001]:</i> I am advised by the Food Standards Agency (FSA) that all checks for specified risk material (SRM) contamination rely on a careful visual inspection of carcase meat to ensure that the specified tissues have been fully removed. A visual check for SRM contamination is not possible once meat has been processed. Advice on the safety of imported beef and beef products was issued by the FSA on 22 December.

 The new meningitis C vaccine became available in autumn 1999 and was introduced into the routine childhood immunisation programme given at age two, three and four months in November 1999. A 'catch-up' campaign to offer vaccine to all those under the age of 18 years not covered by the routine programme was also undertaken from that date.

 We have no plans to introduce free dental treatment for all people over 75 years of age; we believe that it is a better use of limited resources to base help with charges for NHS dentistry on the individual's ability to pay, so ensuring help is focused on those who need it most. Pensioners who get Income Support pay nothing for their dental treatment and under the National Health Service low income scheme some are entitled to free treatment, while others, who are not entitled to full remission of charges, can get partial help.

 The existing exemptions from the single room rent will remain in force when the broader definition of the single room rent is implemented from July this year.

 It is not possible to quantify accurately the numbers of people who move on or off Housing Benefit solely because of changes to the benefit rules. There are many other factors including employment conditions which will influence whether a person claims benefit.
<P>

<a name="10410w33.html_para2">However, our approximate estimate is that about 25,000 fewer people are receiving Housing Benefit than if the single room rent had not been introduced. This represents an estimated reduction in Housing Benefit expenditure of &#163;65 million a year.

 In order to implement these changes as early and simply as possible, we have decided to retain the term "Single Room Rent". This will avoid, among other things, costly changes to computer software for local authorities and rent officers. Our objectives for the single room rent are to ensure that young people have access to accommodation so that they can concentrate on finding work, balanced against our aim of making sure that the benefit system does not provide out of work young adults with better housing than their working peers could afford. We made these objectives clear, including the option of broadening the definition of the single room rent, in our Housing Green Paper "Quality and Choice: A decent home for all" on which we consulted widely. Our response to the consultation said that we will proceed with broadening the definition so as to enable young people to access and maintain accommodation and to encourage landlords to rent to young people.
<P>

<a name="10410w33.html_para8">In addition to consulting the Local Authority Associations the draft legislation was seen by the Social Security Advisory Committee. I will arrange for a copy of the relevant correspondence to the Committee to be placed in the Library. The Committee did not request the formal referral of the regulations.

Friend the Secretary of State following public consultation exercises, but it is otherwise not under any duty to routinely inform my right hon.

<P>

<a name="10410w33.html_para10">In developing the proposal to broaden the definition of the single room rent we did not seek comprehensive written advice, but we had detailed discussions with officials from the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions, the Scottish Executive and the National Assembly for Wales, as well as the Rent Service and rent officers from Scotland and Wales. The new definition takes account of these discussions and is based on a sample analysis of rental data which shows that most young people tend to share accommodation. Comments on the draft legislation were sought from these interested parties. We have received further recent representations on our proposal from Barnardos, the Association of Housing Advisory services and the National Private Landlord and Tenant Working Group.

 This month, the lower capital limit in the income related benefits, such as Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit, for those over 60 increases from &#163;3,000 to &#163;6,000. In addition, the upper limit of &#163;8,000 in the Minimum Income Guarantee (MIG) and Jobseeker's Allowance for those over 60 rises to &#163;12,000. These changes to capital limits will better reward savers with low incomes and will benefit around half a million pensioners by &#163;5 a week, on average.

We have identified from the responses two main reasons for unsuccessful claims--too much income and/or too much capital. More pensioners will become entitled to MIG with this April's increases in the capital limits and with the introduction of Pension Credit we will abolish the capital limits and for the first time reward those with savings income.

<a name="10410w35.html_para2">The number of people who receive Disability Living Allowance continues to increase. Significant backlogs of work accrued in the processing of these benefits last year, because of the growing caseload and introduction of a new system of decision making and appeals. The Benefits Agency tackled the backlog as a priority and it has now been substantially cleared. The continuing high level of appeals outstanding reflects the increase in the numbers received following the introduction of the new procedures.

<BR>
It should be noted that while the statistics show the number of all types of complaints about the standard of service received, they also include cases in which dissatisfaction has been expressed with the outcome of benefit decisions which must be pursued through the decision making and appeals process.
<BR>
There was a steady increase in the figures throughout the period up to June 2000. This can be attributed to an increase in work on hand before and after the introduction of new decision making and appeals procedures. It is well-documented that changes to Disability Living Allowance procedures introduced in October 1999 led initially to a significant increase in the time taken to process each case. This created a temporary backlog of work, which resulted in an increase in the number of complaints. The backlog was tackled as a priority and has now been cleared with the result that the level of complaints have steadily decreased each month since July 2000.
<BR>
I hope this information is helpful.

<a name="10410w36.html_para6">Measures in our five Budgets so far will lift over 1.2 million children nationally out of poverty. These include record increases to Child Benefit, the introduction of the Working Families Tax Credit, increases in the income-related benefits, the minimum wage and tax changes.
<P>

<a name="10410w36.html_para7">Child Benefit will be worth &#163;15.50 a week for the eldest child and &#163;10.35 a week for other children from April 2001: nationally about 7 million families receive Child Benefit, and in Ribble Valley 11,475 families benefit.
<P>

<a name="10410w36.html_para8">We now have the lowest unemployment rate in 25 years. The New Deals have helped lone parents, the young unemployed, the long-term unemployed, the over 50s and partners of the unemployed to move from benefit into work. In the period since May 1997 the number of people claiming Jobseeker's Allowance nationally has reduced from 1,562,400 to 960,600; in Ribble Valley the number has reduced from 1,200 to under 500. Since May 1997 the number of lone parents who claim Income Support has decreased from 1,013,500 to 894,100 nationally; in Ribble Valley the number has increased from 500 to 600.
<P>

<a name="10410w36.html_para9">Older people are disproportionately affected by fuel poverty. So we have introduced Winter Fuel Payments to help with their heaviest fuel bill. This winter, the payment is &#163;200 for households who qualify. Around 19,500 older people in Ribble Valley have received a Winter Fuel Payment for this winter (2000-01).
<P>

<a name="10410w36.html_para10">To demonstrate our commitment to combating pensioner poverty, this year we will spend &#163;4.5 billion extra in real terms on pensioners. Some 18,800 pensioners in Ribble Valley will benefit from the substantial increases in the basic State Pension this April and next; this year's increase is &#163;5 a week for single pensioners and &#163;8 for couples. In addition we have introduced free TV licences for the over 75s of whom we estimate there are about 7,500 in Ribble Valley. 2,100 pensioner families in Ribble Valley are receiving the Minimum Income Guarantee, which we introduced in April 1999 to help our poorest pensioners. From April they will be at least &#163;15 a week, or &#163;800 a year, better off in real terms as a result of Government measures since 1997.
<P>

<a name="10410w36.html_para11">Other reforms in the pipeline include: the new Pension Credit in 2003 designed to ensure that pensioners benefit from their savings; the launch of Stakeholder Pensions in April this year; and the introduction of the State Second Pension in April 2002 both of which will help provide greater security for tomorrow's pensioners.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security how many occupational pension schemes were <i>(a)</i> opened, <i>(b)</i> closed and <i>(c)</i> wound-up in each year between 1979 and 2000.  [157073]<P>

<P>

 <i>[holding answer 9 April 2001]:</i> The information requested is in the table.




<P>
<P><I>10 Apr 2001 : Column: 624W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="10410w37.html_para0">Significant fluctuations in the number of occupational pension schemes opened, closed and wound up in any particular year largely take place in years when alterations were made to the pensions regulatory regime. For example, the Social Security Act 1986, which came into force in 1988, permitted contracting-out of the State Earnings Related Pension Scheme on a money purchase basis for the first time; the Pensions Act 1995, which came into force in 1997, contained measures to increase security for members of occupational pension schemes.
<P>

<a name="10410w37.html_para1">It is important to note that the increases and decreases in these figures do not necessarily reflect large alterations in the overall coverage of occupational pension schemes. For example, most of the schemes registered in the late 1980's and the vast majority of the schemes wound-up in the late 1990's were small schemes with few members.

<a name="10410w37.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>combating poverty and promoting security and independence in retirement for today's and tomorrow's pensioners.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="10410w37.html_para8">These goals are being pursued nationwide and our achievements are set out in our annual "Opportunity for all" reports. Our second report, "Opportunity for all--One year on: making a difference" (CM4865, September 2000) sets out what progress has been made in the past year, as well as highlighting what more needs to be done. Nationwide statistical information is necessarily more complete than data at a local authority level, but the following provides a comparative guide to the effect of the Department's policies and actions in Hampstead and Highgate since May 1997.
<P>

<a name="10410w37.html_para9">Measures in our five Budgets so far will lift over 1.2 million children nationally out of poverty. These include record increases to Child Benefit, the introduction of the Working Families Tax Credit, increases in the income-related benefits, the minimum wage and tax changes.
<P>

<a name="10410w37.html_para10">Child Benefit will be worth &#163;15.50 a week for the eldest child and &#163;10.35 a week for other children from April 2001: nationally about 7 million families receive Child Benefit, and in Hampstead and Highgate 8,565 families benefit.
<P>

<a name="10410w37.html_para11">We now have the lowest unemployment rate in 25 years. The New Deals have helped lone parents, the young unemployed, the long-term unemployed, the over 50s and partners of the unemployed to move from benefit into work. In the period since May 1997 the number of people claiming Jobseeker's Allowance nationally has reduced from 1,562,400 to 960,600; in Hampstead and Highgate the number has reduced from 4,600 to 2,500. Since May 1997 the number of lone parents who claim Income Support has decreased from 1,013,500 to 894,100 nationally and in Hampstead and Highgate from 2,500 to 2,100.
<P>

<a name="10410w37.html_para12">Older people are disproportionately affected by fuel poverty. So we have introduced Winter Fuel Payments to help with their heaviest fuel bill. This winter, the payment is &#163;200 for households who qualify. Around 13,700 older people in Hampstead and Highgate have received a Winter Fuel Payment for this winter (2000-2001).
<P>

<a name="10410w37.html_para13">To demonstrate our commitment to combating pensioner poverty, this year we will spend &#163;4.5 billion extra in real terms on pensioners. Some 12,100 pensioners in Hampstead and Highgate will benefit from the substantial increases in the basic State pension this April and next; this year's increase is &#163;5 a week for single pensioners and &#163;8 for couples. In addition we have introduced free TV licences for the over 75s of whom we estimate there are about 6,000 in Hampstead and Highgate. 3,000 pensioner families in Hampstead and Highgate are receiving the Minimum Income Guarantee, which we introduced in April 1999 to help our poorest pensioners. From April they will be at least &#163;15 a week, or &#163;800 a year, better off in real terms as a result of Government measures since 1997.




<P>
<P><I>10 Apr 2001 : Column: 627W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="10410w37.html_para14">Other reforms in the pipeline include: the new Pension Credit in 2003 designed to ensure that pensioners benefit from their savings; the launch of Stakeholder Pensions in April this year; and the introduction of the State Second Pension in April 2002 both of which will help provide greater security for tomorrow's pensioners.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security how many people in Hampstead and Highgate will benefit from the increase in Minimum Income Guarantee.  [158010]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10410w37.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 We estimate that over 2 million pensioners in Great Britain as a whole will benefit from this April's increases to the Minimum Income Guarantee rates and capital limits. As well as those pensioners who might be newly entitled in Hampstead and Highgate, some 3,000 pensioners who are currently entitled will benefit from the increase.

<P>
<a name="10410w38.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Winnick: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security, (1) pursuant to his answer of 5 April 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 260W, what is the average amount of time decision makers have been employed in the Benefits Agency prior to being appointed to that position;  [158007]
<P>
<UL>(2) how many decisions made by decision makers in the Benefits Agency have been reversed in <i>(a)</i> 1998, <i>(b)</i> 1999 and <i>(c)</i> 2000;  [157993]

(3) pursuant to his answer of 5 April 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 260W, how many decision makers in the Benefits Agency earn annually <i>(a)</i> between &#163;10 and &#163;12,000, <i>(b)</i> &#163;12 to &#163;15,000, <i>(c)</i> &#163;15 to &#163;18,000, <i>(d)</i> &#163;18 to &#163;25,000 and <i>(e)</i> more than &#163;25,000;  [158009]
<P>
(4) pursuant to his answer of 5 April 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 260W, what the procedure is whereby hon. Members may establish direct contact on behalf of constituents with a particular decision maker.  [157977]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10410w38.html_spnew0"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 Staff are not employed specifically as decision makers and are not separately identifiable. It is not therefore possible to establish how long staff have been employed in the Benefits Agency prior to undertaking work which involves an element of decision making or the number of decision makers in the pay ranges specified.
<P>

<a name="10410w38.html_para0">Following the introduction of the decision making and appeals (DMA) provisions during the period July to November 1999 the Benefits Agency has collected data about the numbers of decisions across the major benefits that are revised internally following reconsideration. From the introduction of the DMA provisions until the end of March 2000, approximately 38,000 decisions were revised. From April 2000 to the end of February 2001 approximately 102,000 decisions were revised. This includes decisions that were revised following a request from the customer and those decisions that were revised on the instigation of the decision maker.
<P>

<a name="10410w38.html_para1">There is no formal procedure in place specifically for hon. Members to establish direct contact with an individual decision maker.




<P>
<P><I>10 Apr 2001 : Column: 628W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="10410w38.html_para2">Individual decision makers will provide their name and a contact telephone number to customers when asked to do so. They will also include their name and contact number when issuing individual letters to customers. However, individual decision makers' names are not identified on Agency computer generated decision notices.
<P>

<a name="10410w38.html_para3">As the customer's representative, an hon. Member would be able to approach the individual decision maker, in the same way as any other representative, if they were of the view that it was appropriate to do so. However, as I stated in my written answer on 5 April 2001, <i>Official Report,</i> column 260W the accepted procedure has been for hon. Members to contact the Local Office Manager where a reply is required.

 Guidance was issued by the Cabinet Office to all Departments and agencies in October 1998 in order to raise awareness of the implications of equal pay legislation. The guidance was subsequently incorporated into the Civil Service Management Code which requires Departments and agencies to undertake periodic equal pay reviews.
<P>
