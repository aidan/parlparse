This is despite the unanimous demand from the UN Security Council and from the International Atomic Energy Agency that it stop doing so.

 We want speed camera enforcement to be highly visible and drivers to be made fully aware of the presence of cameras and the speed limit on the road. The Department&#146;s guidance on the use of speed cameras therefore already encourages that speed limit and camera warning signs should be co-located where permitted and practicable. Furthermore for fixed cameras the guidance encourages the speed limit sign and camera sign to be visible to the driver in the same view as the camera.</p>

 The Department for International Development (DFID) employs both home civil servants (HCS) and locally engaged staff (known as staff appointed in country or SAIC), who work in more than 60 overseas offices.

 DFID formed the Central Research Department (CRD) in 2003 to improve the management and delivery of its long-term research programmes. DFID&#146;s research is guided by a Research Funding Framework that sets out what DFID will fund and how. Programmes have clear thematic priorities (for example, climate adaptation) and emphasis is placed on measuring outcomes and impact. Research methods are assessed for rigour, particularly at the start of the programme and through regular reviews. These are usually led by eminent researchers.

<i> [holding answer 10 December 2007]:</i> Following the 2005 recommendations published by the Office of Fair Trading (OFT), the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) amended its guidance but did not require ticket face value and fees to be advertised. OFT complaint data from earlier this year suggest that this is not a particular problem for consumers. More recently, as a result of the implementation of the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive, the OFT has been working with the ASA Committee of Advertising Practice on reforms to its code of practice on non-broadcast media. The OFT views it as prudent to see the effect of the reformed code on advertising behaviour in the ticketing market before considering if further action is required.</p>

Base Value is the price placed on a property, assuming vacant possession, at the start of the contract.</p>

This is because estimates produced from the EFS combine information about ownership of durable goods provided by survey respondents, with London population estimates by age and sex, to produce estimates of the total number of people in London owning these goods. These population control totals are a measure of the number of people in London, but there are no control totals for the number of households. As a consequence, there is some year to year volatility in estimates of the numbers of households.</p>

As regards the number of households owning televisions, which one would expect to be changing much more slowly, most of the year to year movement in the figures is likely to be due to the sampling variability described above.</p>

 DTI&#146;s memorandum to the Trade and Industry Committee in February 2007 explained changes which were being made in the spring supplementary estimate. This included the fact that in 2006/07, the DTI faced a budget shortfall due to a number of factors including the funding of the British Energy rescue package from within the SR04 settlement, and clarification of the budgeting guidance in November 2005.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_542"><a name="71212w0015.htm_para5"><a name="07121322000176">The Department also had to face a number of unforeseen pressures that arose after the SR04 settlement had been made. These included the fall out from MG Rover, an increase in demand-led services, and the need to fund new cross-governmental priorities. Dealing with these pressures, left DTI without any significant flexibility to manage budgets and absorb new pressures.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_543"><a name="71212w0015.htm_para6"><a name="07121322000177">DTI sought to manage these pressures within its budget. The Department looked rigorously at all elements of non ring-fenced spend to identify efficiencies and flexibilities and as a result identified significant savings to be put towards pressures. These savings, however, were not sufficient to provide cover for the unavoidable pressures faced in 2006/07. This complex picture led to the use of unspent funds from the ring-fenced science budget in order to fund residual pressures which the Department was facing.</p>

 Stem cell research offers exciting opportunities to develop new therapies for a broad range of debilitating conditions, some of which are currently incurable (e.g. neurodegenerative disease).

 Vaccines, antivirals, antibiotics and facemasks are a key part of the Government response to pandemic influenza. The Government approach to the stockpiling and distribution of these countermeasures is covered in the &#147;National Framework for responding to an influenza pandemic&#148;, published on 22 November 2007. The lessons learned from Exercise Winter Willow have been published on the Cabinet Office website.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_588"><a name="71212w0019.htm_para5"><a name="07121326000363">Stockpiling of clinical countermeasures is essential to ensure the continuity of supply and that demand can be met. For example, there is already a stockpile of antivirals sufficient to treat the United Kingdom&#146;s population up to a clinical attack rate of 25 per cent. The Government are planning to double the stock of antivirals, to cover at least half the population. We will continue to keep the level of stock under review in light of the scientific evidence, as we develop our business case. The Government also has a stockpile of 3.3 million doses of H5N1 pre-pandemic vaccine for health care workers. The science underpinning the further development and potential use of pre-pandemic vaccine is cutting-edge and has just been reviewed by UK and international experts. We are actively considering their findings and the implications for our policy to inform future decisions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_589"><a name="71212w0019.htm_para6"><a name="07121326000364">The antivirals stockpile should be adequate to treat all those who fall ill in a pandemic of similar proportions to previous ones in the 20th century but we recognise that some prioritisation will be necessary if the attack or consumption rates are higher than anticipated. Antiviral prioritization has been considered with the Committee on Ethical Aspects of Pandemic Influenza, but final decisions can only be made when the pandemic emerges.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_590"><a name="71212w0019.htm_para7"><a name="07121326000365">To be effective, antiviral medicines need to be taken within 48 hours of the onset of symptom. A National Flu Line Service is being developed to enable timely distribution. On contacting the Flu Line Service, a clinical algorithm will be used to assess a caller&#146;s symptoms and determine whether or not they are eligible for antiviral treatment and/or need further care or treatment by a clinician. We are making use of and building upon normal delivery systems by asking NHS Direct, who already provide contact-centre based assessment and triage to callers, to lead on the development of the National Flu Line Service. We are engaging with other stakeholders on its development, including the NHS, independent contractors, and other existing contact centre services. Consultation on legal changes necessary to facilitate this system went out alongside the National Framework. The National Framework and its supporting guidance, will help trusts create effective local systems for coordinating the operational aspects of antiviral allocation with local partners prior to a pandemic occurring.</p>

employers to seek information on their obligations under health and safety legislation and to carry out local risk assessments to determine whether employees should be provided with facemasks. Stockpiling facemasks for use by the general public is not currently planned. Although the available medical evidence does not support the use of face masks in all settings, we recognise that the public may want to have access to face masks for their personal use. The Government will explore the approach that retailers are planning to adopt when stocking face masks for sale to the public.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_592"><a name="71212w0019.htm_para9"><a name="07121326000367">Exercise Winter Willow identified that there may be problems with managing the surge in demand for antibiotics. The range of antibiotics needed to treat bacterial complications arising from pandemic influenza has been identified and published in the form of Clinical Management Guidelines. Building on this, the Government plan to procure 14.7 million treatment courses of antibiotics to treat and prevent the complications arising from pandemic flu. That stockpile will enable us to give antibiotics to vulnerable symptomatic flu patients, such as those with chronic conditions and the elderly, in advance of the development of secondary complications, and to treat others in the community if they develop complications. The antibiotics will also be used in hospitals to treat the sickest patients and may reduce the length of hospitalisation. The procurement of both antivirals and antibiotics will be subject to emerging scientific evidence and to normal commercial procurement procedures to ensure that we purchase those products at the best price, and achieve value for money for the taxpayer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_593"><a name="71212w0019.htm_para10"><a name="07121326000368">This summer, Advance Purchase Agreements for pandemic specific vaccine were signed with GlaxoSmithKline and Baxter. These guarantee a supply of vaccine for the UK population as soon as the vaccine becomes available after the onset of the pandemic; decisions about vaccination strategies will only be made once the clinical impact of the disease becomes known. All decisions on prioritisation will take scientific and ethical issues fully into account.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_594"><a name="71212w0019.htm_para11"><a name="07121326000369">Public consultation and information is at the heart of the Government&#146;s planning. The Government will be testing the public's reactions to many issues in pandemic planning and decision-making and gauge the level of information on specific issues, including the use of clinical countermeasures. Work continues on the design of a public engagement programme to facilitate this process, with the active participation of the public.</p>

A more comprehensive public engagement programme, commencing in early 2008 will provide a detailed assessment of the public&#146;s understanding of the Government&#146;s assessment of pandemic risks and policies.</p>

These discussions in turn contributed to the updating of the &#145;National framework for responding to an influenza pandemic&#146; and the supporting guidance documents.

None of these premises have yet been confirmed to be free of the disease. However, in the case of bluetongue, restrictions are lifted on the premises after the veterinary inquiry, and only the area restrictions relating to the protection and surveillance zones remain in place. Cases of bluetongue currently remain contained to the east and south-eastern parts of England, but, since disease is transmitted by midges, there is no use in restricting the individual premises.</p>

 There are significant, potential risks associated with live bluetongue vaccines. Live vaccine strains can become more virulent than the field strain, produce new strains through re-assortment with the field strain and circulate in the midge vector. Live vaccines can also cause disease in some breeds of sheep (and potentially cattle), cannot be given to pregnant ewes (as they can cause foetal deformities), and can be a potential source of infection on mating and artificial insemination as the vaccine can be found in the semen of bulls and rams.</p>

increased from 85 million litres in 2005 to 95 million litres in 2006. These sales have been from imported sources. The UK currently has one fuel bioethanol production plant which opened this year. British Sugar's facility in Wissington processes sugar beet and has a capacity of around 70 million litres per annum. A number of companies are planning to build further plants which would use UK-grown crops such as wheat.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_690"><a name="71212w0031.htm_para11"><a name="07121329001140">It is unlikely that the production of biofuels has had a discernable effect on UK cereals prices to date. Current high prices are due to global factors, including two successive lower world wheat harvests, low global stocks and increased demand for cereals from the range of sectors including food, feed and fuel. Growing global demand for biofuels will put upward pressure on crop prices, but also increase the supply of crops in the future, leading to a stabilisation of the market. Analysis by the European Commission assessing the impact of the 10 per cent. by energy biofuel target for 2020 indicates that prices for agricultural raw materials in the EU would increase by 3 to 6 per cent. for cereals.</p>

 DEFRA&#146;s Marine and Fisheries Directorate was established on 1 April 2006. Business plans were published for 2006-07 and 2007-08, and copies are available in the House of Commons Library.

We have also secured amendments to the London and OSPAR conventions to allow carbon storage on the sea bed. This has the potential to be a significant means of ameliorating the effects of carbon emissions.</p>

 For foot and mouth disease, there are some remaining movement restrictions in some boroughs and districts in the south east. These restrictions also prevent exports of meat and meat products from the area. A decision was agreed by EU member states on 3 December to allow live animal exports, which will come into force later in December.

 As soon as we became aware that Pirbright was a potential source of the foot and mouth disease (FMD) outbreak we put in place a number of additional safeguards at the Pirbright site. We immediately asked the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) and Professor Spratt to carry out reviews of biosecurity and subsequently accepted all of the recommendations in their reports. Since then, stringent new biosecurity conditions have been applied to work on the Pirbright site, providing several independent layers of safety and ensuring that the process is contained. For example, the drainage system has been relined and tested. These measures will ensure the highest level of biosecurity at Pirbright.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_711"><a name="71212w0034.htm_para6"><a name="07121329001570">Additional measures have been implemented for the Institute of Animal Health, including tougher controls over access and on movement of people and vehicles, and an agreed protocol to prevent activities that could result in virus entering the drainage system.

<i> [holding answer 10 December 2007]:</i> Intervention buying of pigmeat is governed by the EU pigmeat regime which includes provision for limited private storage aid under certain market conditions. Applications for private storage aid were recently opened for the period from 29 October to 4 December. Uptake in the UK was very low compared to the rest of the EU.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_715"><a name="71212w0034.htm_para10"><a name="07121329001576">The vast majority of pig meat imports into the UK are from EU countries and are, therefore, protected by single market legislation. There are very few areas in which UK law goes beyond the requirements of the EU minimum standards. The principal remaining difference between UK and other member states pig welfare standards regards the use of sow stalls, where UK-type restrictions will not apply across the EU until 2013. World Trade Organisation rules currently do not allow us to restrict trade on animal welfare grounds.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_716"><a name="71212w0034.htm_para11"><a name="07121329001577">All consignments of meat imported into the UK from other EU member states and third countries must have been produced in accordance with the harmonised animal and public health rules laid down in European Community legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_717"><a name="71212w0034.htm_para12"><a name="07121329001578">The Trade Descriptions Act 1968 and the Food Safety Act 1990 govern the use of labelling including that for country of origin. Any labelling that provides information on the origin of meat must not mislead consumers. Where meat has been processed then, provided it is a substantial change, it is permissible to describe as its origin the country where that change took place. The Food Standards Agency (FSA) has lead responsibility for labelling and has issued guidance which suggests that if the absence of information might mislead consumers, then both the origin of the meat and the country where the processing takes place should be declared in order to facilitate informed consumer choice. The FSA also leads on engagement in the EUs Review of Food Labelling and DEFRA is liaising with them to ensure that concerns such as country sourcing are taken fully into account.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_718"><a name="71212w0034.htm_para13"><a name="07121329001579">We also welcome initiatives such as that of the British pig industry to develop a code of practice to help make consumers better informed about methods and origin of pigmeat production.</p>

<i> [holding answer 11 December 2007]</i>: At the annual meetings of the International Whaling Commission (IWC), the UK regularly co-sponsors resolutions calling on those countries which undertake lethal whaling operations for the ostensible purpose of scientific research to desist from these activities. We also participate in high-level diplomatic protests to the Japanese Government on this issue. In more general discussion on the future of the IWC, we have argued that the international convention for the regulation of whaling should be amended to close the loophole that renders such operations legal. Were such an amendment formally proposed, it would only take effect if all parties to the convention ratified it. This seems an unlikely outcome.</p>

However, academies are placing great emphasis on getting the basics right and improving behaviour in particular. Academies often inherit a large number of disengaged pupils and need to establish good behaviour in order to raise attainment. As the new ethos and behaviour policy are enforced in an academy's early days, the number of exclusions may rise, but it typically drops down as behaviour improves. This phenomenon is not unique to academies&#151;the same effect is often observed when a new head teacher transforms a struggling maintained school.</p>

 Since 1997, with the support of teachers and practitioners, we have achieved an unprecedented increase in school standards. And, in the context of raising school standards, we have also met the challenge of broadening equality of attainment for many under achieving groups. Our continued focus is to raise school standards and deliver a world class education system where every child, irrespective of gender, race, disability or background, receives the best possible education, personalised to their needs, aptitudes and aspirations.</p>

Additionally, targeted interventions to address disadvantage and promote equality, such as City Challenge, Aiming High, approaches to benefit boys&#146; attainment where they have been under achieving, attracting more girls into physics, addressing prejudice driven bullying and increased school funding for children from poor families, with special needs and/or with English as an additional language, will continue to support this effort.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_733"><a name="71212w0036.htm_para2"><a name="07121329001919">In addition to raising school standards we have made a number of far-reaching policy commitments to widen equality of opportunity for children. The cross-Government Every Child Matters programme will secure an expansion of early education, the development of Children&#146;s Centres and extended schools and the development of integrated multi-agency working to support children and young people with additional needs.</p>

these new courses to all young people in their area. Diplomas will be offered at Levels 1, 2 and 3, and will include Functional Skills, so that young people get a real grounding in basic English, maths and ICT as well as more subject specific knowledge. The entitlement to Diplomas is in addition to the existing National Curriculum offer, and will give young people much greater choice about what and where they study.</p>

A total of 600,000 UK children have been lifted out of relative poverty since 1998/99, (both before and after housing costs).

These comprise agreements aimed at narrowing the gap in educational achievement, raising educational attainment, improving children&#146;s health and well being, increasing the number of young people on the path to success, and improving the safeguarding of children. The Child Poverty Unit has also been set up to drive forward the Government&#146;s commitment to eradicate child poverty by bringing together policy and analytical civil servants from the Department for Work and Pensions and the Department for Children, Schools and Families.</p>

Price Base: Real terms at 2006-07 prices, based on GDP deflators as at 26.09.07<br>
2. Figures reflect relevant sub-blocks of Standard Spending Assessment/Education Formula Spending (EFS) settlements and exclude the pensions transfer to EFS and LSC.<br>
3. Total funding also includes all revenue grants in DCSF departmental expenditure limits relevant to pupils aged 3 to 19 and exclude education maintenance allowances (EMAs) and grants not allocated at LEA level. For those authorities in receipt of advance of grant under the transitional support arrangements for 2004-05, advance grant funding is included in the year of payment (2004-05). There will be a consequential reduction in DCSF grant for these LEAs in future years (either 2006-07 and 2007-08 or 2006-07 to 2008-09, depending on the terms on which the advance was given to the LEA).<br>

The pupil numbers used to convert &#163;m figures to &#163; per pupil are those underlying the SSA/EFS settlement calculations plus PLASC three year old maintained pupils and estimated 3 to 4 year-olds funded through state support in maintained and other educational institutions where these are not included in the SSA pupil numbers.<br>
5. Figures are rounded to the nearest &#163;.<br>
6. Some of the grant allocations have not been finalised. If these do change, the effect on the funding figures is expected to be minimal.<br>
7. Figures are in real terms at 2006-07 prices.<br>

 I have interpreted &#145;educational research&#146; to mean social research commissioned by the Department in all its guises since 1997. Until September 2004 social research funded from budgets other than the Department&#146;s central research budget was not monitored centrally; to gather that information now would incur disproportionate costs given the many changes to the structure of the Department over the years. The amounts recorded centrally as spent by the Department in each year since 1997 are as follows:</p>

 Since November 2007 the Department has commissioned external suppliers to undertake 75 research projects. The monthly breakdown of these follows. The Department does not hold information centrally about the research that is commissioned internally; to collect this now would incur disproportionate costs. The Department's analytical strategy, which is currently being updated to reflect the recent machinery of government changes, contains details of our high-level analytical priorities that are being addressed by both internally and externally commissioned work.</p>

 No formal assessment has been undertaken. It is for schools themselves to decide how to organise their timetables, including how much time to spend teaching each subject, working within National Curriculum requirements. To help schools plan for delivery of the new secondary curriculum, the National College of School Leadership and the Specialist Schools and Academies Trust are running joint regional events for secondary school leaders and curriculum planners on whole curriculum design, to help them think through the process of designing and timetabling a curriculum in their own schools.</p>

In September, my hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families announced &#163;11.5 million new funding over three years to support the teaching of financial education in schools. We are in the process of appointing a contractor to develop and implement a programme of support for schools in this area. The impact of this programme will be measured by independent evaluation, assessing outcomes through interaction with teachers, pupils and other key stakeholders. We will also use Ofsted evidence and research conducted by the Financial Services Authority to judge the effectiveness of our approach.</p>

 Academies are independent schools. One of their key features is the freedom to be innovative in the way they reward and retain staff, including their principals. However, we know that many academies base their pay and conditions on the School Teachers' Pay and Conditions Document (STPCD), which governs the pay of teachers and heads at maintained schools.</p>

 This Department is committed to supporting equality and diversity through the National Curriculum. The revised secondary curriculum for history, to be taught from September 2008, now includes compulsory study of the "British Empire and its impact on different people in Britain and overseas, pre-colonial civilisations, the nature and effects of the slave trade, and resistance and decolonisation". To mark the bicentenary of the abolition of the Slave Trade a new resource pack for teachers was developed by the Understanding Slavery Initiative as a key element of a national competition for schools, funded by the Government. In addition, the new Citizenship curriculum, aligned with the history curriculum, covers "Living together in Modern Britain", including themes on immigration, the Commonwealth, and links to the study of the British Empire in history. In line with the recommendations of Sir Keith Ajegbo&#146;s review of diversity, the new citizenship curriculum will ensure young people will develop a historical understanding of issues that have shaped contemporary life in the UK and the values we share.</p>

 In 2001, the Government extended the scope of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (DDA) to cover access to education. As a result disabled children, students and adults seeking access to education now have rights against discrimination under part 4 of the DDA.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_764"><a name="71212w0040.htm_para0"><a name="07121329002803">The discrimination duties schools have under part 4 of the DDA mean that they must not, without justification, treat disabled pupils or students less favourably than pupils who are not disabled, and they must make reasonable adjustments to ensure that disabled pupils and students are not put at a substantial disadvantage in comparison to those who are not disabled. Also, schools and local authorities (LAs) are under a duty to plan strategically to increase, over time, access for pupils with disabilities to schools. This duty includes planning to increase access to the school premises and to the curriculum, and providing written material in alternative formats to ensure accessibility.</p>

In addition, substantial capital funding&#151;a total of some &#163;800 million up to 2007-08 has been allocated to local authorities and schools through the Schools Access Initiative (SAI) and equivalent voluntary aided funding, which provides capital funding for projects to improve the accessibility of mainstream schools to disabled pupils. Further capital allocations totalling &#163;340 million will be made during the years 2008-09 to 2010-11.</p>

Because this is the first time that science has been the main focus of PISA, the OECD states on page 32 of its international report, &#147;PISA 2006: science competencies for tomorrow's world&#148;, that it is not possible for any country to compare science learning outcomes from PISA 2006 with those of earlier PISA assessments.</p>

 Since 1997 we have focused strongly on improving the quality of teaching at both primary and secondary levels through the Primary National Strategy and the Secondary National Strategy. They are our key levers to raise standards of teaching and learning in all four Key Stages, and it is through them that we provide a wealth of training, guidance and materials aimed at supporting teachers and improve the quality of teaching. We continue to invest in and offer a range of different ways of training to teach. Through all of this we support teachers in helping children make the fastest possible progress.</p>

This is evidenced by ever increasing standards in literacy and mathematics. In total over 375,000 more young people gained 5 or more good GCSEs over the period 1997-2006. Provisional results for 2007 show that 60.3 per cent. achieved 5 A*-C grades (an increase of 13.4 percentage points since 1997) and 45.7 per cent. achieved 5 A*-C GCSEs including English and maths (up 9.7 percentage points since 1997).

English and 77 per cent. did so in maths. In 1997 less than ? of 11-year-olds reached this level in either subject (63 per cent. in English and 62 per cent. in maths).</p>

We have also announced that the national Aimhigher programme, which runs a range of activities to raise aspirations and increase pupil attainment, will continue for another three years. The vast majority of schools and colleges in Newcastle have one or more Aimhigher-funded Progression Coaches' to provide tailored support to groups and individuals. Aimhigher in Newcastle is also looking at ways to raise awareness of vocational higher education options through Foundation Degree taster courses, and is raising the attainment of learners by investigating awards such as the Certificate of Personal Effectiveness.</p>

 Trade unions have a key role to play in promoting the development of learning and skills in the workplace. To help them do this more effectively we introduced the Union Learning Fund in 1998. This source of funding is helping trade unions use their influence with employers, employees and training providers to encourage greater take up of learning at work and boost their own capacity as learning organisations. Since 1998 annual expenditure on the Union Learning Fund has been as follows:</p>

 Annual average estimates of the numbers and proportion of people who are not in education, employment or training are available at a local level from the Annual Population Survey (APS). However, this information cannot be provided for the 18 to 24 age group for the Wirral, West constituency because the number in the sample is so small that ONS rules on protecting confidentiality do not permit disclosure.

The Government will provide an average real terms increase in funding for higher education of around 2.5 per cent. per annum to 2011, which means that in 2010-11 there will be over &#163;1.5 billion of additional funding compared with 2007-08, with funded student numbers rising to around 1.2 million by 2010-11&#151;50,000 more than now. Alongside this the Government support the Aimhigher Programme, which seeks to raise aspirations and motivation to enter higher education among young people who are from under-represented backgrounds. The programme was launched nationally in August 2004, is delivered through 45 area-based partnerships of schools, colleges and higher education institutions.</p>
