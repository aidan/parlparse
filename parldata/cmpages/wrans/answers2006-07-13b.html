 The House administration is taking several actions which are working towards the goals of improving ethnic-minority representation at senior levels and helping staff from all backgrounds to realise their full career potential. A corporate Senior Management Development Programme was introduced in 2005 to prepare managers for more senior positions. The first cohort of the programme has a number of ethnic minority staff participants. The Diversity Forum has as part of its action plan for 2006-07 the aim that talented staff from under-represented groups should actively be encouraged to develop their careers. A proposal will go to the House&#146;s Human Resources Group in 2007. On external recruitment, the House&#146;s job advertising policy requires that ethnicity of readership should be a priority in the placing of an advertisement. For fast-stream recruitment the House participates in the Cabinet Office&#146;s policy of targeting minorities, and specifically the House is involved in a fast-stream summer development programme which includes an open day aimed at ethnic minority applicants. The next open day is on 18 July.</p>

 There are no building regulations applying specifically in Milton Keynes.

However, the UK does not contribute to individual EU budget categories; it contributes to the entire EU budget.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what facilities there are at the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency for the return of original documents by secure delivery. [85163]</p>

 It should be emphasised that identity documents are required with applications for a first photocard driving licence only and where there are personal changes subsequently. As over 25 million drivers now have a photocard licence the requirement for identity documents is diminishing. In addition, arrangements are in place for digitised passports to be checked by the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) online with the Identity and Passport Service (IPS). Non digitised UK passports can be checked at Post Offices, with the same facility available at DVLA&#146;s 40 Local Offices, which can also check ED passports and those from certain designated countries where licence exchange agreements exist. All these facilities remove the need for submission of a passport to DVLA.</p>

The Judicial Studies Board publishes guidelines for the judiciary on the assessment of general damages based on decided cases following Heil <i> v.</i> Rankin.

 The Government remain committed to ensuring that the United Kingdom&#146;s export control system is as rigorous and effective as any in the world. This commitment is clearly reflected in the Export Control Act (2002), which was the first major legislative development in this area since 1939. We are continuing to take up the challenge of implementing these comprehensive new controls, some in areas which bring in activities not previously subject to control. On greater transparency, we have introduced quarterly reports (which are available on the Foreign and Commonwealth Office website at: http://www.fco.gov.uk/servlet/Front?page name=OpenMarket/Xcelerate/ShowPage&amp;c=Page &amp;cid=1089131553823, and provide detailed information on our export licensing decisions. The 2005 annual report on the UK&#146;s Strategic Export Controls will also be published in a new format later this month. These initiatives illustrate our commitment to maintain, and expand, the high standard of transparency and accountability in the area of export controls that we established with the launch of our first annual report  in 1997.</p>

 The Home Office has one advisory body concerned with animal health and welfare, the Animal Procedures Committee. The role of the Animal Procedures Committee is to advise the Home Secretary on matters concerned with the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 and his functions under it. In doing so, the Committee is required to have regard to the legitimate requirements of science and industry and to the protection of animals against avoidable suffering and unnecessary use in scientific procedures. The Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has lead responsibility for other aspects of animal health and welfare.</p>

ABCs, parenting contracts and demotion of tenancy are used to tackle perpetrators&#146; antisocial behaviour rather than a noise prosecution. It is not possible to ascertain the number of individual graffiti and fly-posting prosecutions because graffiti is recorded as criminal damage and fly-posting is recorded as an illegal display of advertisements. The penalty notice for disorder scheme was brought into effect in all police forces in England and Wales during 2004. Under the scheme the police are able to issue persons committing specified minor offences with a fixed penalty notice, including the offence of littering, which was added to the scheme on one November 2004.</p>

Data on prosecutions for 2005 will be available in the autumn .</p>

Furthermore, a change to Immigration Rules on 12 February 2006, enables Immigration Officers to carry out more robust checks on the identity of children passing through ports of entry. For example, the names of all non EU accompanied children will be recorded and, for visa nationals, the visas will carry details such as the child&#146;s photograph, whether the child should be accompanied or unaccompanied and, if accompanied, the person with whom they should be travelling.</p>

are breached, the offender is liable to be recalled to prison upon the recommendation of the probation officer in order to protect the public. Once the licence is revoked and the offender recalled, the police are notified, in order to ensure a swift return to custody. In addition, any offender subject to sex offender registration requirements is required to notify to the police a home address within three days of leaving prison, and to notify any subsequent change of address within three days of the change thereafter while still subject to registration. Failure to supply that information, or supplying false information, is an offence punishable by up to five years imprisonment. Registration requirements were strengthened recently by the Sexual Offences Act 2003.</p>

<i>  [holding answer 12 July 2006]:</i> The Medical Devices Regulations 2002, for which the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) acts as the regulatory authority on behalf of the Secretary of State, does not regulate the quantity of dentures imported from countries outside the European Union. They do, though, contain requirements for the safety and fitness for purpose of custom-made dental appliances which all manufacturers, wherever they are based, should ensure are met before placing their dentures on the United Kingdom market. Where the manufacturer is based outside the European Community they are also required under the regulations to appoint an authorised representative to register on their behalf with the member state competent authority where they have their registered place of business. MHRA conducts an annual programme of inspections of custom made appliance manufacturers and authorised representatives based in the UK, selected at random.</p>

 The Department has been reviewing the arrangements for the provision of chemical reagents (blood glucose testing strips), dressings, incontinence appliances and stoma appliances to primary and secondary care since October 2005.</p>

Interested parties includes patients, the national health service and manufacturers and suppliers. These parties were informed that the Department was seeking their comments on the proposed changes.

<p><a name="stpa_404"><a name="60713w0023.htm_para3"><a name="06071418000592">The second consultation stated that the Department believes that current reimbursement prices for some dressings and reagents may not represent value-for-money for either the NHS or taxpayers. Therefore, it proposed that a reduction in the reimbursement price through Part IX of the drug tariff should be made on some dressings and some reagents and sought views on this.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_405"><a name="60713w0023.htm_para4"><a name="06071418000593">The proposed reduction in the reimbursement price on some reagents was 15 per cent. In arriving at this, the Department believes that one of the clearest indications of value-for-money is the difference between reimbursement prices in primary care, and the prices at which these products are available in secondary care. The Department believes that a comparison between the sectors is appropriate, subject to a number of adjustments to reflect factors unique to each sector.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_406"><a name="60713w0023.htm_para5"><a name="06071418000594">These factors include differences in the underlying costs associated with supply of products to primary and secondary care. Packaging specifications, pack sizes, logistics costs and margins across the supply chain, amongst other things, have an affect on price, and were taken into account in the analysis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_407"><a name="60713w0023.htm_para6"><a name="06071418000595">The Department also took into account the claims that were made about the provision of &#145;free&#146; testing meters in primary care when comparing pricing between the two sectors.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_408"><a name="60713w0023.htm_para7"><a name="06071418000596">Overall, there is a difference of up to 35 per cent. between reimbursement prices in primary care and prices paid in secondary care. The size of difference cannot be reasonably explained by the factors outlined above.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_409"><a name="60713w0023.htm_para8"><a name="06071418000597">The Department's diabetes policy team&#151;which includes Dr Sue Roberts, national clinical director for diabetes&#151;has been kept informed throughout the process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_410"><a name="60713w0023.htm_para9"><a name="06071418000598">Until such time as the review has been completed, the Department is not in a position to comment on plans to ensure the availability of blood glucose testing strips.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_411"><a name="60713w0023.htm_para10"><a name="06071418000599">Regarding the publication of responses in full to the consultations on the &#147;arrangements for the provision of chemical reagents, dressings, incontinence appliances and stoma appliances to primary and secondary care&#148;, the Department considers that it is reasonable to withhold publication until a future date, pending the outcome of on-going discussions and further consultations on future arrangements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_412"><a name="60713w0023.htm_para11"><a name="06071418000600">Disclosure of the responses to the first consultation would be likely to influence or inhibit those responding to the further consultations and prevent the Department from obtaining fair and representative views from stakeholders.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_413"><a name="60713w0023.htm_para12"><a name="06071418000601">The Department considers that the public interest in disclosing the responses is outweighed by the public interest in withholding them. This is because although there is an inherent public interest in openness and accountability in Government, there is a greater public interest in ensuring that the Department's consultation process is effective and that the Department negotiates new arrangements that deliver fair prices for the NHS and reasonable returns for suppliers.</p>

Under the &#145;Fair Deal for Staff Pensions: Procurement of Bulk Transfer Arrangements and Related Issues&#146; guidance published by HM Treasury in June 2004, there is a requirement to transfer pension rights when employments are transferred to the private sector under public private partnerships/public finance initiatives and subsequent transfers for former public servants. Under arrangements agreed between a number of mainly public sector pension schemes to facilitate transfers, known as the public sector transfer club and administered by the civil service pensions division of the Cabinet Office, public service scheme members can also transfer accrued pension rights by way of the public sector transfer club.</p>

This is consistent with the Government&#146;s view that local authorities are best placed to take account of local circumstances in setting their priorities for spending.

They are the means by which the World Health Organization aims to prevent and control the international spread of disease in ways that are commensurate with the public health risks and which avoid unnecessary interference with international traffic and trade. The Government is working closely with the Association of Port Health Authorities, the HPA, the National Assembly for Wales, the Scottish Executive, the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety in Northern Ireland and other interested parties to consider how the International Health Regulations 2007 should be implemented in the United Kingdom.</p>
