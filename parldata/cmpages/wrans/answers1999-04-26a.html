<a name="90426w01.htm_wqn0"><B> Mr. Dismore: </B> 
To ask the Attorney-General if he will make a statement on his Department's policy when <i>(a)</i> conducting legal proceedings and <i>(b)</i> seeking legal advice as to the circumstances in which Queen's Counsel should be instructed; and for each of the last three years (i) on how many occasions his Department instructed Queen's Counsel and (ii) what was the total cost of instructing Queen's Counsel.  [81771]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90426w01.htm_spmin0"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 The Crown Prosecution Service, the Treasury Solicitor's Department, the Serious Fraud Office and the Legal Secretariat to the Law Officers predominantly use junior counsel when it is necessary to instruct counsel to provide legal advice or to conduct legal proceedings
<P>

<a name="90426w01.htm_para0">In civil cases, the two First Treasury Counsel are both junior counsel and they will advise and represent the Government without a Queen's Counsel in many of their important cases. In addition, the Attorney-General maintains four panels of junior counsel whom Departments are expected to use for the majority of the Government's civil litigation. The Attorney-General's approval, or mine, is required before a Queen's Counsel can be instructed to appear for any Department in civil litigation.
<P>

<a name="90426w01.htm_para1">A panel of Senior Treasury Counsel and Junior Treasury Counsel, who are all junior counsel, exists in London to provide advice in more significant criminal case work, and to handle the most serious and complex work at the Central Criminal Court. More generally, the Crown Prosecution Service maintains circuit-based lists of junior counsel to conduct almost all its criminal case work in the Crown Court in England and Wales. Outside London, Queen's Counsel are instructed in all contested murder cases, and occasionally in other very serious or complex case work prosecuted by the Crown Prosecution Service.
<P>

<a name="90426w01.htm_para2">Given the complexity and seriousness of its cases, the Serious Fraud Office usually instructs Queen's Counsel to advise and conduct its prosecutions.
<P>

<a name="90426w01.htm_para3">In determining the level of counsel to use, the Department will consider the individual circumstances of each case. It will take into account, inter alia, the importance and sensitivity of the case, the complexity of 



<P>
<P><I>26 Apr 1999 : Column: 2</I><P>
the law, the weight and complexity of the evidence, and the degree of experience and expertise required before deciding whether to instruct Queen's Counsel or junior counsel.
<P>

<a name="90426w01.htm_para4">However, records are not maintained in a form which would enable the number of occasions on which the Attorney-General's Department instructed Queen's Counsel in the last three years, and the cost of doing so, to be given without incurring disproportionate cost.

<a name="90426w01.htm_spnew3"><B> Dr. Reid: </B> 
 Railtrack's 1999 Network Management Statement, published on 25 March, announced their plans for investment in the network totalling some &#163;27 billion over the next ten years. That figure includes some &#163;11 billion of investment on enhancements to the network. Not all of that &#163;11 billion is Railtrack money: it includes proposed Government and other third-party funded schemes. Some &#163;6 billion of it is shown as being either new "partnership" schemes or new "contractor" schemes, both of which would appear to involve at least some public sector funding, but no breakdown of funding sources is given.

 Rules of engagement are considered and approved for specific operations. Their formulation varies according to the particular circumstances of an operation. The precise rules of engagement that govern the use of CR gas are thus approved on each occasion that its use is authorised. Rules of engagement for the use of CR are consistent with the provisions of the Chemical Weapons Convention, which explicitly permits the use of toxic chemicals for law enforcement purposes.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90426w02.htm_wqn3"><B> Mr. Hancock: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence for what reasons the Defence Estates Organisation was relaunched on 29 March.  [81630]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90426w02.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The Strategic Defence Review considered how it might improve the management of the defence estate. The review made a number of important recommendations over the Defence Estate Organisation's role. These were that the Chief Executive be made accountable to Ministers, for working with users to ensure the defence estate is managed efficiently and effectively as a whole to support the delivery of defence capability; that DEO should assume responsibility for all aspects of the disposal of surplus property programme and that the DEO should develop proposals for a new model for construction and procurement.
<P>

<a name="90426w02.htm_para3">This places an increased burden, and a greatly enhanced role, on an organisation created in 1995 and launched as an Agency in April 1997. Following a fundamental review, in which I have been closely involved, major changes are taking place in DE to enable it to take on these new tasks, placing it at the centre of my Department's estate management matters. Most significantly, the Agency will play a key role in carrying forward the Deputy Prime Minister's rethinking construction initiative, in which the MOD will play a major part.
<P>

<a name="90426w02.htm_para4">The programme I have endorsed will bring out major process changes that will focus the Agency on the services that it delivers to customers elsewhere in the MOD, in the process setting the Agency challenging objectives and outputs. This will provide the necessary impetus for initiatives on estate management to be developed and implemented across the MOD, with enhanced value for money from the Department's substantial investment in its estate, as a primary goal. Savings will undoubtedly accrue from this process, but at this early stage it would be imprudent to set a figure upon achievable levels. This will become more apparent as DE leads MOD through this transition period and will be reported to Parliament, year by year, as a series of targets and achievements.
<P>

<a name="90426w02.htm_para5">We attach great importance to sending out a strong message to the MOD, the industry and others across Government, and outside, that the nature of the Agency has changed. To this end it was believed appropriate to

<P>
<P>
<a name="90426w02.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. George Robertson: </B> 
 It is for the Chief Prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia in The Hague to seek indictments against individuals she believes have been responsible for serious violations of international humanitarian law during the Kosovo crisis. NATO's military campaign is explicitly designed to damage and disrupt the capability of the government in Belgrade to carry out repressive operations in Kosovo. Yugoslav decision-makers and commanders have been put on notice that their conduct is being scrutinised, and that information linking them to atrocities committed in Kosovo will be forwarded to the Tribunal.

[81580]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90426w02.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. George Robertson: </B> 
 Environmental considerations are taken fully into account when targeting decisions are made; and the United Kingdom will comply with its obligations under the First Geneva Protocol, including Article 55, which concerns the protection of the natural environment. It is not currently possible to undertake an assessment of the environmental impact of NATO air strikes or the actions of Yugoslav forces.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90426w02.htm_spnew6"><B> Mr. George Robertson: </B>

 My Department has now received the final report of the audit of the Gulf Veterans' Medical Assessment Programme (MAP) undertaken by the King's Fund Health Quality Service. I am pleased to report that the auditors were impressed with the organisation of the Medical Assessment Programme and the enthusiasm and commitment of the staff to the provision of a high-quality service. Nevertheless, the auditors also made a number of specific recommendations for improving the service and, because of the importance which we attach to the MAP, these have been accepted in full and work has already begun to implement them. The process of implementation is expected to be completed by November of this year. A copy of the report will be placed in the Library of the House and it will also be published on the Ministry of Defence Gulf Veterans' Illnesses website.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what requirements he places on <i>(a)</i> contractors and <i>(b)</i> sub-contractors regarding ISO 9002 certificates. [81642]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90426w03.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The requirement for Quality Management System certification is dependent on the nature of the contractual requirement. Where the requirement is for a product or service of a non-technical nature, and acceptability can be confirmed by a non-technical customer on receipt, no certification is required as a condition of contract. In all other cases, the Department's policy is to award contracts only to suppliers whose Quality Management System aligns with the appropriate ISO 9000 series standard. Prime contractors are responsible for the selection and management of sub-contractors.

However, responsibility for any contract rests with the individual Department concerned. Information for the Government as a whole is therefore not held centrally. However, 14 Government Departments have made information available about KPMG contracts to the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Mr. Ruffley), and the hon. Member for North Essex (Mr. Jenkin) in previous written answers.

 It is not possible to put a precise figure on the number of deaths sustained by the Kosovar Albanians as a result of President Milosevic's campaign of brutality, both before and after the NATO air campaign began. However, it is clear from eye witness accounts that these are likely to be considerable and a stain on humanity. We are of course providing relevant information on the brutality of Milosevic's forces to the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia.

In addition, the Winter Hill main transmitter, of which Pendle Forest is a relay, also provides a service into parts of the region.

<a name="90426w05.htm_spnew2"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 Since 24 March, the British Government has allocated &#163;20 million for the provision of humanitarian assistance for the refugees from Kosovo. This funding has been used to support the work of the United Nations, the Red Cross, and Non-Governmental Organisations. A detailed country-by-country breakdown of expenditure is not currently available--many of the programmes supported cover more than one country. We 



<P>
<P><I>26 Apr 1999 : Column: 16</I><P>
are currently considering, in concert with the International Financial Institutions and other key partners, the provision of broader macro-economic assistance to countries hosting the refugees. The EU has committed &#163;100 million to Macedonia and Albania. The UK share of the EU commitment is approximately &#163;15 million.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90426w05.htm_spnew3"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 We are not, of course, responsible for running the camps in Macedonia and Albania, but we obviously recognise the vital importance of providing adequate water, sanitation, electricity and other services to the refugee camps. Our military and civilian personnel have been actively involved in planning and establishing, and ensured adequate provision. Detailed information about the costs of providing these utilities is not currently available.

<P>
<P>

 There have been meetings in Brussels, Geneva, and London, over the last three weeks, to co-ordinate international action to provide humanitarian assistance for the refugees. In particular, an extraordinary meeting of the EU Humanitarian Aid Committee was called to discuss Kosovo on 9 April.

 We are not, of course, running the refugee camps in Macedonia or Albania, but our programme of assistance for the refugees includes funding for education projects. We have, for example, contributed &#163;300,000 to the Save the Children Fund appeal, which includes plans for non-formal educational activities in Macedonia and Albania.

 According to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the following countries or states have received refugees from Kosovo in recent weeks: Albania, Macedonia, Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Turkey, France, Poland, Israel, Norway, Belgium, Croatia, Germany, Iceland, Switzerland and Austria. The UK has agreed to UNHCR's request to grant temporary protection to Kosovar refugees--the first group are expected to arrive in the UK on 25 April.

<a name="90426w05.htm_spnew7"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 The UK has made a major contribution to trying to increase the effectiveness of the UN-lead on humanitarian effort. We are funding airlifts and the necessary logistical support to overcome the constraints on delivering international assistance to those in need. So far, we have funded 32 flights, a truck convoy in Albania, personnel, and aircraft handling equipment for Tirana and Skopje airports. Our offices in Tirana and Skopje are working with NATO and UNHCR to establish refugee centres in Albania and Macedonia. We are strengthening agency capacity through the provision of key personnel, and making cash grants to international agencies and NGOs.

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what assessment her Department has made of the medical needs of the refugees in Macedonia and Albania; and what provisions her Department has made to meet these needs.  [82159]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90426w05.htm_spnew8"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 We are in close touch with the World Health Organisation (WHO), who are taking the lead responsibility for the medical needs of the refugees. At present, the health status of refugees in both Macedonia and Albania is judged to be reasonably good, with no major epidemics, though recent arrivals have been in poorer condition as a result of spending several days on the road.
<P>

<a name="90426w05.htm_para0">We have placed health experts in our offices in Tirana and Skopje. We are also providing a public health expert for WHO in Tirana. We have funded the purchase and transportation of 14 WHO emergency health kits to Macedonia, and seven kits for Albania--these will cover the needs of 210,000 people for 3 months.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90426w05.htm_spnew9"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 Our overriding aim is to enable the refugees to return to their homes as soon as possible. We recognise, however, that the refugees will require continuing support for some time to come, and are planning accordingly. We have established field offices in Tirana and Skopje, with experts in areas such as health and camp planning, to identify and respond to needs, both immediate and long term. We are strengthening the capacity of the humanitarian agencies themselves through secondment of expert personnel; and a DFID liaison officer is working with General Reith, the Commander of the British forces in Albania, to maximise the effectiveness of the humanitarian assistance they can provide. We have also begun, with the US, Germany, France and Italy, the planning for refugee returns to Kosovo.

 <i>[holding answer 16 February 1999]:</i> Licences to export arms and other goods controlled for strategic reasons are issued by the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry. All relevant licence applications are circulated by DTI to other Departments with an interest. These include the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the Ministry of Defence and, since August 1997, the Department for International Development. Since August 1997, DFID has been consulted on 2,609 individual licence applications circulated to DFID by DTI. I am advised that views expressed by my Department fall under the description of "internal discussion and advice", the disclosure of which would, in this case, harm the frankness and candour of internal discussion.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security when the Accommodation and Office Services project authorised the PRIME contract in 1997; how many bidders were allowed, after the time limit had expired, to modify their bids; if the successful bidder's modified bid was significantly different from his original bid; and what assessment was made of the prospects for the successful bidder's first bid.  [81602]<P>

 Accommodation and Office Services (AOS) consists of post opening and post dispatch, messenger services, stationery, typing, secretarial, reprographics, fleet administration, switchboard, and shuttle bus services.
<P>

<a name="90426w06.htm_para0">These services, previously supplied to the Benefits Agency under 48 separate contracts and service level agreements, were tendered in eight large geographical lots. Invitations to tender for AOS were issued on 20 February 1998 to five bidders.
<P>

<a name="90426w06.htm_para1">The deadline for bids was 20 March 1998 and five bids were received within this deadline. No bids were received or accepted outside this deadline. The bids were valid for a period of 90 days from date of receipt.
<P>

<a name="90426w06.htm_para2">Owing to the complexity and range of the services, the evaluation of bids was not completed until after the 90-day period. This meant that bidders were able to reconsider their bids for specific, identified reasons. One bidder exercised their right to do so. Whilst all other bidders had the same opportunity, none did so.




<P>
<P><I>26 Apr 1999 : Column: 19</I><P>
There were two successful bidders for the services. Three lots were awarded to one bidder and two lots to the other; the remaining three lots were retained in-house on grounds of best value for money. Neither of the two successful bidders modified their bids.
<P>

<a name="90426w06.htm_para3">It would not be proper to comment on the hypothetical status of a bid at any stage of the evaluation process other than the final decision.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90426w06.htm_spnew2"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 All Departmental Procurement is conducted under Government Procurement Policy guidelines and in accordance with the EC Public Procurement Directives (the Directives). The Directives were developed to ensure that: all potential tenderers get the opportunity to bid; there are clear and common evaluation criteria (the criteria); and the criteria are applied to all suppliers with impartiality.
<P>

<a name="90426w06.htm_para4">Where the Directives apply, all contracts are advertised in the <i>Official Journal</i> of the European Community and the business is competitively tendered. Where the Directives do not apply, the rules of competitive tendering are nevertheless followed as this is recognised as best practice.
<P>

<a name="90426w06.htm_para5">The criterion adopted for evaluation of tenders for Government business is "the most economically advantageous". This is decided upon using value for money criteria, incorporating quality, delivery and price criteria. Recommendations by evaluation panels for award of contract are subject to scrutiny, validation and audit by independent tender boards.

 The Department has not provided any additional financial resources to the Independent Tribunal Service (ITS) specifically to handle appeals resulting from the Benefit Integrity Project.

 It is not possible for the Independent Tribunal Service (ITS) to give an expected date by which all appeals arising from the Benefit Integrity Project will have been heard, as these appeals are still being received by ITS.

 The action taken to reduce average clearance time for appeals arising from the Benefit Integrity Project (BIP) falls into two areas: the preparation of appeals submissions by the Benefits Agency and the processing of the appeal by the Independent Tribunal Service (ITS).
<P>

<a name="90426w06.htm_para7">The Independent Tribunal Service (ITS) does not separately measure clearance times for appeals arising from the Benefit Integrity Project and so the information cannot be provided in the format requested.
<P>

<a name="90426w06.htm_para8">Benefits Agency statistics indicate that the average clearance time for appeals arising from the Benefit Integrity Project since its commencement is 163.5 days, from receipt of the appeal in the Agency to determination of the appeal by the ITS.
<P>

<a name="90426w06.htm_para9">The Independent Tribunal Service (ITS) has raised awareness of BIP appeals among its staff and tribunal members and procedures are in place to expedite these appeals where necessary. ITS is committed to reducing waiting times for all appellants and has a clear strategy for this. An increase in average clearance times will be seen, however, as older cases are resolved although within this, individual appellants will be receiving an improved service. During the second half of 1999, we will introduce changes to the appeals process which are designed to streamline the process and provide a more efficient and speedier service.

That is why we have taken a fresh look at the provision of mental health services and produced a new strategy document entitled <i>Modernising Mental Health Services: safe, sound and supportive,</i> which was distributed to every Health Authority in December 1998, and backed it up with an additional investment of &#163;700 million over three years for better treatment and care. This new strategy makes clear the Government's commitment to ensuring that everyone with mental health problems is treated fairly, on the basis of need, in a manner which preserves their autonomy, and which promotes opportunity for choice, and this includes people from black and ethnic minority communities.

 The Government fund health and medical research in a number of ways. The Department funds research and development to support its work on policy development and evaluation in health and social care. The Department also manages the National Health Service research and development levy, which is used to support research and development of relevance to the National Health Service in hospitals, general practice and other health care settings, and to fund the NHS research and development programme. In addition, the Medical Research Council (MRC)--which receives most of its income via grant-in-aid from the office of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry--funds medical research as part of the Government's funding of the science and engineering base.
<P>

<a name="90426w08.htm_para1">Priorities for departmental research and development support for the development of policy are determined through discussion with policy colleagues, the Departmental Research Committee and Ministers. In the NHS R&D programme, priorities take account of widespread consultation with those using, delivering and managing services, within a framework overseen by the Central Research and Development Committee for the NHS. In all cases, priorities for our budgets reflect analysis of the burden of disease, potential benefits, and Government priorities, and take account of the responsibilities and work of other funders.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what factors underlie the decisions on which posts abroad operate a pre-sift system in dealing with applications for visit visas.  [81689]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90426w09.htm_spnew13"><B> Mr. Tony Lloyd: </B> 
 The decision to introduce a "sift" at any post can be taken only with the agreement of Migration and Visa Division. The factors taken into account will include overall numbers of applicants and the time each has to wait. Where a post experiences a large number of inadequately documented applications or visit visa applicants who have no connection with the UK or who are unclear about what they intend to do there, a "sift" may be introduced. The benefits of the "sift" procedure are that it prevents unnecessary work for the Entry Clearance Officer (ECO) and saves time, money and the disappointment of a refusal for the applicant. In addition, it shortens the waiting time for the well-prepared and well-supported applicant.
<P>

 We have expressed regret that India and Pakistan have chosen to conduct missile tests and continue to believe that restraint in developing nuclear weapons and delivery systems is in both countries' long-term interests.

<P>
<a name="90426w10.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Tony Lloyd: </B> 
 It is not the Government's practice to publish intelligence material. Given the exceptional circumstances in Kosovo, the decision was made to release classified information to the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, in order to assist the investigation. It would not be appropriate to make this classified information more widely available.

On the humanitarian side, our resolution draws together a range of measures which should make significant improvements to the humanitarian situation in Iraq, while remaining faithful to the Council's obligation to uphold its resolutions. Finally, the draft picks up the panel's recommendations on dealing with Iraq's continued failure to meet its obligations over Kuwaitis and others missing since 1991. Discussion of our draft continues in New York.

<a name="90426w10.htm_spnew6"><B> Mr. Tony Lloyd: </B> 
 British citizenship did not come into being until 1 January 1983. The Ilois ( who were at that time citizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies) left the Territory 30 years ago. We have to deal with the situation now; the vast majority of the Ilois are citizens of other sovereign states, (either Mauritius or the Seychelles), in addition to holding British Dependent Territory citizenship, and have been for a generation. This is in contrast to other British Dependent Territories citizens who are solely British.

 We remain in close contact with our main partners, including the United States, in furthering the common objective of achieving concrete improvements in the human rights situation in China. Along with our European Union partners, we voted against a Chinese no-action motion at the UNCHR on 23 April which sought to prevent a vote on the US-tabled resolution.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90426w10.htm_spnew9"><B> Mr. Fatchett: </B> 
 We believe, as do our European Union partners, that continued dialogue and co-operation with China on human rights is more likely to bring about concrete improvement than repeated UN resolutions, all of which have failed to be adopted in the past. This dialogue-based approach has made limited progress in some areas and we will be pressing China for further concrete steps. The General Affairs Council therefore decided on 22 March not to table or co-sponsor a resolution on China at this year's Commission on Human Rights.

<a name="90426w12.htm_spnew7"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The present situation remains serious for pig farmers, with prices still unstable and below the costs of production. Nevertheless, the average all-pigs price has shown a 26 per cent. improvement since its low point in January. European Commission figures indicate that current UK pig prices are 20 per cent. higher than the EU average, and higher than in any member state except Luxembourg. Whether the present gap between UK and EU prices will be sustainable is difficult to judge, but the fact that it exists at all is due, at least in part, to the emphasis on high animal welfare and other standards.
<P>

<a name="90426w12.htm_para4">In recent months, the Government have done an enormous amount of work to assist the British pig industry. This includes lobbying the Commission in Brussels to use the existing mechanisms of export refunds and private storage aid to their best effect, encouraging retailers, caterers and public procurement bodies to take account of quality and welfare factors when making their purchases, writing to all MPs and UK MEPs encouraging them to support the pig industry in its endeavours to meet consumer demands, and continuing to invest considerable sums of public money in pig related R&D.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90426w13.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 There are arrangements for MAFF Veterinary Officers to inspect quarantine premises four times a year. The inspections are carried out to check on compliance with the standards set with regard to the physical and disease security of the premises and also to check on compliance with the Voluntary Code of Practice for the Welfare of Dogs and Cats in Quarantine Premises in respect of those premises that have agreed to comply with the Code. Premises which do not comply with this Code can be removed from the published list of premises which do comply. The Animal Health (Amendment) Act 1998 gives Ministers powers to set welfare conditions in quarantine kennels on a statutory basis.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90426w13.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The Animal Health (Amendment) Act 1998 gives Ministers the power to make secondary legislation setting welfare conditions for animals kept in quarantine premises. The Government will hold a full public consultation involving all parties with an interest in the welfare of animals in quarantine, including quarantine kennels. It is at that stage that the position of individual kennels--who will have to comply with the legislation--will become clearer.

<a name="90426w13.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 In Great Britain, Articles 3 and 4 of Directive 64/433/EEC (as amended) have been implemented by means of the Fresh Meat (Hygiene and Inspection) Regulations 1995 (S.I.1995/539, as amended). At present, these Regulations are enforced in England by the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and in Scotland and Wales by the appropriate Secretary of State. In practical terms, enforcement of the Regulations in GB is carried out by the Meat Hygiene Service (an Executive Agency of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food).

<P><I>26 Apr 1999 : Column: 47</I><P>
the supervision of an Official Veterinary Surgeon. The level and frequency of veterinary supervision is set out in Article 9 of the Directive.
<P>

<a name="90426w13.htm_para0">Article 4 of the Directive provides a derogation from certain provisions in the case of certain small (low throughput) abattoirs and cutting plants. However, my Department's lawyers have confirmed that this derogation is in respect only of the structural requirements of the premises concerned and does not extend to the conditions applying to the hygienic operation of the premises or to the level and frequency of veterinary supervision required. Nevertheless, following representations from the industry, we have now asked the European Commission to give a view on the applicability of the specific veterinary supervision requirements to low-throughout premises.
<P>

<a name="90426w13.htm_para1">There are no derogations from the requirements of Chapter VIII of Annexe 1 of Directive 64/433/EEC (as amended) in the case of low-throughout abattoirs. The Directive requires all fresh meat intended for sale for human consumption to undergo post-mortem inspection in accordance with Annexe 1, Chapter VIII.

 Yes. This administrative provision, which provides for a composite invoice to be issued to an individual premises carrying out a number of functions (i.e. slaughtering, cutting or storing), is applied by the Meat Hygiene Service when invoicing plant operators for the costs of hygiene inspections.

 Costs vary, depending upon the number of schemes participated in.

Implementation of scrutiny recommendations, where possible, should now be saving the equivalent of &#163;6.5 million of farmers' time each

 In the 1998 calendar year, primary schools received three grants for reading books, averaging &#163;1,000 per grant. During the same period, secondary schools received two &#163;1,000 grants for reading books. Schools with less than 100 pupils received &#163;10 per capita for each grant allocation. These grants represent

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what steps he is taking to ensure that pupils at former grant maintained schools secure the same increases in funding per individual as those in other state schools in <i>(a)</i> Cumbria and <i>(b)</i> England.  [82183]<P>

 Grant-maintained schools have previously enjoyed preferential funding, whereas the Government are committed to fair funding for all schools, continuing the process of phasing out unfair funding which the previous Government began in 1995-96. For 1999-2000, we have guaranteed that grant-maintained schools will be funded at the same level per pupil in cash terms as they were in 1998-99. Many will be funded at a higher level than that, where LEAs pass on the extra resources we have obtained for education directly to their schools, as my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has urged them to do.

<a name="90426w15.htm_wqn0"><B> Mr. Willetts: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what proportion of all participants finding subsidised or unsubsidised work through the New Deal for Young People have found employment with <i>(a)</i> public sector employers and <i>(b)</i> private sector employers; and if he will make a statement on the relationship between these figures and Government targets.  [79824]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90426w15.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Andrew Smith: </B> 
 To the end of January 1999, 14,000 clients had entered Subsidised Employment. The split of the jobs was 12 private sector jobs for each public sector job.
<P>

<a name="90426w15.htm_para0">A comparable split cannot be provided for the 62,300 unsubsidised job starts as categorisation is available only by standard industrial classification, and then only for ES placings.
<P>

<a name="90426w15.htm_para1">We have not set targets for the numbers of young people placed in the public or private sector, but have indicated that we would not expect the proportion moving into public sector jobs to exceed the share of public sector jobs available for the work force as a whole.

<P>
<a name="90426w15.htm_spnew1"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 We have agreed a number of changes with HM Chief Inspector of Schools since 1 May 1997 to improve the quality, consistency and value for money of the school inspection system. Those changes are contributing to increased accountability of school inspectors and should enable teachers to approach inspections with greater confidence. The changes include a reduction in the notice given for inspections from two terms to 6-10 weeks and short inspections for the most effective schools. The changes were widely welcomed in consultation. I have asked the Chief Inspector, Chris Woodhead, to write to my hon. Friend with further details of the changes and to place a copy of his letter in the Library.

 <i>[holding answer 19 April 1999]:</i> Annual mileage data are collected only for drivers whose company cars are available for private use. According to the latest National Travel Survey, there were an estimated 925,000 company car drivers whose total mileage was at least 18,500 miles per annum. This compares to 675,000 company car drivers whose total annual mileage was less than 18,500 miles per annum.

 In May 1997, the number of HM Customs and Excise investigators based at Heathrow was 65.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will list the weekly family disposable income, after tax, national insurance, child benefit and maintenance payments are taken into account of (i) a lone parent with two children under 11 in receipt of maintenance payments of &#163;40 a week, (ii) a lone parent with two children under 11 not in receipt of maintenance payments, (iii) a single-earner married couple with two children under 11 and (iv) a two earner married couple with two children under 11 earning in each case <i>(a)</i> &#163;150 a week and <i>(b)</i> &#163;250 a week and where the incomes of the two-earner couple are split in the ratio 80:20.

 The available information, which shows weekly disposable (net) income after tax (including Child Benefit and Working Families Tax Credit), National Insurance Contributions and maintenance payments at the specified levels of earnings, is given in the table. The figures are shown for 1999-2000 and take account of all changes announced in the 1998 and 1999 Budgets which come into force in 1999-2000.
<P>

<a name="90426w15.htm_para3">From October 1999 the WFTC will provide help with child care costs. The child care tax credit will be worth 70 per cent. of eligible child care costs, subject to maximum child care costs of &#163;100 a week for families with one child and &#163;150 a week for families with two or more children.

Government White Paper of 1993 (Cm 2290) relating to the closure of census returns for England and Wales represents current Government policy.  [81791]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90426w16.htm_spnew7"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 The legislation covering the closure of census returns represents current Government policy. Census Returns form 1901 and 1911 are closed to the public for 100 years by virtue of Instrument 12 dated 1966 of the Public Records Act 1958. Censuses from 1921 onwards were taken under the terms of the Census Act 1920 as amended by the Census (Confidentiality) Act 1991 which gives protection to personal census information given by the public.

 Approximately 20 per cent. of all inquiries into 1996/97 self-assessment tax returns were taken up during January 1999. The Inland Revenue do not record the actual dates on which notices are posted to taxpayers and it is therefore not possible to say whether any notices dated before 31 January 1999 were sent on or after that day. However, notices are normally posted on the date which they bear.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90426w17.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Wills: </B> 
 As part of the on-going consultation process throughout the Structural Fund negotiations, the Government asked regions and local areas informally, in July 1998, for an indication of their priorities for Objective 2 eligibility. Over fifty local and regional partnership organisations provided information, as well as national bodies and interested Departments.
<P>

<a name="90426w17.htm_para5">Two broad conclusions emerged from the responses to the consultation exercise. First, for areas of real need to be targeted, the provisions covering Objective 2 in the Structural Funds regulation must be sufficiently flexible to encompass a wide variety of circumstances. Secondly, there was a degree of similarity in the broad priorities put forward, including employment and labour market measures, the degree of social cohesion, geographical issues, and measures of poverty.

 The UK population for Objective 2 is set by the safety net which maintains two-thirds of the existing Objective 2 and 5b coverage. Within the safety net, the Government will seek to target Objective 2 on the basis of need.
<P>

<a name="90426w17.htm_para6">A maximum of 18 per cent. of the European Union's population will be covered by the new Objective 2. The breakdown by strand for Objective 2 of 10 per cent. to industrial areas, 5 per cent. to rural, 2 per cent. to urban and 1 per cent. to fisheries is indicative at EU level, not Member State level.

 The main DTI programme for supporting companies is Regional Selective Assistance, under the Industrial Development Act 1982. The plant in Spennymoor is in a Development Area and is eligible to receive such assistance. The Hereford plant is not in an Assisted Area, and is therefore not eligible for support under the Regional Selective Assistance Scheme.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (1) what factors underlay the setting of a renewable energy target of 10 per cent;  [81783]

<P>
<a name="90426w18.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 The Government published a consultation paper "New and Renewable Energy--Prospects for the 21st Century" on 30 March 1999, which outlines the Government's policy. Key factors underlying that policy include putting the environment at the heart of their decision making. Climate change is recognised as one of the greatest environmental threats facing the world today. Prudent use of natural resources, including renewable energy sources, is one of the Government's objectives. Energy from renewable energy sources is clearly an important element in securing both the diversity and sustainability objectives and has the potential to be supplied on an increasing scale at competitive prices. In line with their Manifesto commitment to "a new and 



<P>
<P><I>26 Apr 1999 : Column: 67</I><P>
strong drive for new and renewable sources of energy", the Government are working towards a target of renewable energy providing 10 per cent. of UK electricity supplies as soon as possible. They hope to achieve this by 2010. It would require of the order of 3-4 GW (Declared Net Capacity) of new plant in addition to that already contracted to achieve that.
<P>

<a name="90426w18.htm_para0">The technologies expected to contribute by 2010 are wastes (municipal, industrial and agricultural), wind (onshore and offshore), hydro, landfill gas and energy crops. The proportions of each will depend upon a number of factors including the extent of technical development and future fuel prices.
<P>

<a name="90426w18.htm_para1">Other technologies such as photovoltaics have the potential to make major contributions to world energy needs in the longer term if their development continues and energy companies announce their intention of moving into this market on a significant scale.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90426w18.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 The UK, and the EU as a whole, have called for investment to be on the agenda of a future round of negotiations in the World Trade Organisation (WTO). Decisions on the content of that agenda will be taken at the WTO ministerial meeting in Seattle later this year. In the meantime, the UK is participating in the analytical work of the WTO Trade and Investment Working Group and the parallel work in the UNCTAD Expert Meetings on International Investment Agreements.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what assessment he has made of the impact on the clothing and textile industry of the proposed closure of the National Training Centre for Knitting Machine Mechanics and Technicians.  [81739]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90426w18.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 I assume that the National Training Centre referred to by my hon. Friend is the knitting facility at the North Warwickshire college in Hinckley, Leicestershire, which I understand has taken the decision to close its textile faculty based on the lack of support from the industry.
<P>

<a name="90426w18.htm_para2">News of closure is never welcome, particularly when the industry itself is under such pressure. However, there are many other educational institutions in the region who provide a high level of training in this area. DeMontfort, Derby and Nottingham Trent universities all offer various forms of technical training in knitting and a centre of excellence has been set up in North Nottinghamshire by West Notts College and New College Nottingham. The impact on the industry of the Hinckley closure is therefore likely to be negligible.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90426w18.htm_spnew6"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 For a number of reasons, including the situation in Kosovo, it is very difficult to estimate the numbers likely to claim asylum in the next year. The figure could be in the range of 52,000 to 62,000, if we take into account all the potential applicants from countries where there may be upheavals.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what estimate he has made of the number of asylum seekers, refused asylum by his Department, who have remained illegally in the United Kingdom over the last five years.  [80962]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90426w18.htm_spnew7"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 At the end of November 1998, the number of failed asylum seekers who had either not appealed against the refusal of asylum or who had exhausted their rights of appeal and who were the subject of port or enforcement action was estimated to be 24,000. This figure does not include applicants whose claims had been refused, but who were not yet subject to enforcement action.

 The number of police officers in each force is entirely a matter for local determination on the basis of available resources and spending priorities. In 1999-2000, police authority budgets in England and Wales will increase on average by 3.1 per cent. over last year. These increases, along with the 2 per cent. efficiency improvement targets that have been set, should be sufficient to maintain existing levels of service.

 Conditions in young offender institutions in England and Wales vary greatly between, and even within, some establishments. Some are of a high standard while others are in need of considerable improvement. The Government have demonstrated their commitment to improve conditions by, for example, the provision of an additional &#163;51 million over three years for the under-18 estate and its regimes, and through the inclusion of 12 young offender institutions in the welfare-to-work initiative.

which free checks could be provided for volunteers. Whilst we acknowledge the very valuable contribution volunteers make, we have concluded that it will not be practicable to provide any free checks from the Criminal Records Bureau for volunteers or for any other groups. We realise that this is unwelcome news, but providing free checks would prove an unsustainable burden on the public purse and may increase demand for certificates from the Bureau to an uncontrollable extent. In addition, we do not consider it would be fair to allow volunteers to have free certificates when there are other equally deserving groups such as school leavers, the unemployed and disabled people. The level of fees for certificates from the Bureau will be kept to the minimum necessary to recoup costs.

 There have been reports that some employers may be adopting discriminatory practices when seeking to secure a defence under section 8 of the Asylum and Immigration Act 1996. The Government share the concern of the Commission for Racial Equality and others at the substance of the reports, whilst recognising that such action may not be directly attributable to section 8.

 A proposed order was laid on 13 April.

There would be no requirement on operators to open at any particular time; it would be for them to judge whether or not to stay open and for how long.
<P>

<a name="90426w19.htm_para5">The legislation would allow licensing authorities to impose appropriate restrictions on opening hours where it is shown that later opening is likely to lead to nuisance or disturbance.

<a name="90426w20.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The Crime and Disorder Act 1998 required the local authority and police in every area to formulate, by 1 April 1999, a strategy for the reduction of crime and disorder over the next three years. Therefore, all local crime and disorder reduction partnerships--over 400 of them in England and Wales--should now have strategies in place and be starting to implement them.

 In discussions with Ministers on funding issues, police authorities have recognised that the allocation of resources and the deployment of officers within the force area are matters for determination locally 



<P>
<P><I>26 Apr 1999 : Column: 74</I><P>
within the overall budget. Police authority budgets are set to increase on average by 3.1 per cent. in 1999/2000. In addition, local authorities can make grants to police authorities for additional policing services in particular neighbourhoods.
<P>

<a name="90426w20.htm_para0">In addition, we recently announced the shortlist of the first eleven targeted policing projects under the crime reduction programme. These projects are worth about &#163;5 million in total out of the &#163;32 million which will be made available for targeted policing over the next three years as part of the programme. Ministers recognise the importance of ensuring that deprived and disadvantaged neighbourhoods are amongst those who benefit from these and other crime reduction initiatives.

<P>
<a name="90426w20.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The Annual Audit Commission report on Police Performance, published in January, found that there is no direct link between increased spending and improved performance in police forces. The report also showed that success in detecting crime does not depend solely on the numbers of police officers available.
<P>

<a name="90426w20.htm_para1">Partnerships between the police and other agencies, targeted policing, better use of information technology, and the efficient and effective use of available resources all have an important part to play in improving police performance.

 The provisions relating to anti-social behaviour orders came into effect on 1 April 1999. It is therefore too early to know what use local crime and disorder partnerships will make of them.

 Payment offers have been made on all, but around 250 claims, mainly under Option C of the compensation schemes, cannot yet be fully processed. This is principally because the required evidence of value of the surrendered guns and ancillary equipment has not yet been provided. There are around 2,600 outstanding offers of payment, mainly where the claimant has not yet responded, or where the amount of the offer is in dispute. It is not possible to give a firm date for the completion of all payments, as this depends in part on the claimant's response to the payment offer.

 Under the provisions of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 the decision is final. It is not open to Ministers to comment on the merits of the decision or the reasoning behind it. The decision was reached taking account of all relevant considerations, one of which was the Inspector's recommendation.
<P>

<a name="90426w22.htm_para5">The conclusions reached by a planning inspector, following a public inquiry, are put to the Welsh Office as recommendations not reasons. The decision is final whether taken directly by the Secretary of State or under delegated powers.
<P>

<a name="90426w22.htm_para6">I am satisfied that the handling and determination of this application was carried out having proper regard to all relevant requirements including the Town and Country Planning (Inquiries Procedure) Rules 1992. It is not open to the Department to rescind the decision.
<P>

<a name="90426w22.htm_para7">I had no conversations with Ministerial colleagues on this application. The inspector's recommendations were available to me alongside advice from officials.
