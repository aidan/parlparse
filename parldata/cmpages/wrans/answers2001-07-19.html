To ask the Secretary of State for International Development if she will make a statement on the work of her Department in improving access to justice in Nigeria.  [6346]<P>

<P>
<a name="10719w01.html_spnew0"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 I have this month approved a &#163;30 million programme to support Nigerian Government efforts, at both federal and state level, to enable poor people to obtain rapid and fair justice. This involves the whole justice system&#151;courts, police, prisons, legal aid, and traditional and informal mediation. We plan to implement this programme particularly in the four states in which our programmes are focused. These are Benue, Ekiti, Jigawa and a state in the south-east yet to be selected. Jigawa State announced last August that it will apply Shari'a criminal law. We will ensure that the assistance programme is taken forward in all four states in ways that uphold international human rights standards.

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development if she will make a statement on her Department's assistance to <i>(a)</i> Botswana and <i>(b)</i> Namibia.  [4279]<P>

<P>
<a name="10719w01.html_spnew1"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 In Botswana, DFID is supporting programmes in rural livelihoods, education and HIV/AIDS. In Namibia, DFID is supporting programmes in rural livelihoods, education and health. In the financial year 2000&#150;01, DFID provided around &#163;2.5 million of assistance directly to Botswana and &#163;2.6 million to Namibia in addition to our contributions through multilateral agencies.
<P>

<a name="10719w01.html_para0">Over the next few years, DFID will be subsuming its bilateral programmes in Botswana and Namibia within a more regional approach to poverty elimination.

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development when KPMG sent letters to <i>(a)</i> Carlisle Holdings and <i>(b)</i> Sonisa during its study commissioned by her Department to review the regulation of offshore financial services in Belize and the effect of tax exemptions on pro-poor programmes; if she will place copies of these letters in the Library; and if she will make a statement.  [4058]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10719w01.html_spnew4"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 I understand that KPMG wrote to Carlisle Holdings on 25 August in response to their letters of 10 and 18 August 2000. I am not aware of any KPMG correspondence with Sonisa. The correspondence is private to the parties concerned.

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what progress she plans to make with the process of debt relief at the G8 Summit in Genoa.  [2291]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10719w01.html_spnew5"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 To date, 23 countries have qualified for exceptional debt relief under the Enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative. Relief totalling more than $53 billion will be provided to these countries, reducing their debts by more than two-thirds on average, and freeing up resources for spending on poverty reduction. At the G8 summit in Genoa, we will be urging our partners to push forward with implementation of the HIPC initiative, so that more countries will qualify for relief. However, making substantial progress will be difficult, as many of the remaining HIPC countries are affected by conflict.
<P>

<a name="10719w01.html_para1">Debt relief is only one part of what will be required by developed and developing countries alike if poverty is to be reduced and the International Development targets set for 2015 to be met. The Italian Government, which hold the Presidency of the G8 in 2001, have already issued a paper to be discussed at the Genoa summit entitled "Beyond Debt Relief"&#151;which sets out some of the other key areas in which progress needs to be made: trade reform, generating investment and improving the quantity and quality of spending on health and education. These are all important issues for poverty reduction which can be taken forward effectively at international level through the G8 forum.

 Further appointments to the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission will be made as soon as possible, and by the end of the summer.

 The Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission's powers and duties are set out in section 69 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998. Under sub-section 69(2) of that Act, the Commission is required to make recommendations to the Secretary of State about how its effectiveness might be improved; the adequacy and effectiveness of the functions conferred on it; and the adequacy and effectiveness of the provisions of that part of the Act relating to the Commission. The Secretary of State received these recommendations in March of this year and they are currently under consideration. The Secretary of State will respond formally in due course.

 The provisions in the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 which created categories of racially motivated offences were not extended to Northern Ireland. The Public Order (Northern Ireland) Order 1987, however, makes provision for a range of offences of stirring up hatred or arousing fear on religious or racial grounds. In response to approaches that have been made in recent months, it is our intention to conduct a consultation exercise later this year to consider how best to legislate in Northern Ireland against race crime.

 Some information is already available on sentencing trends according to gender.

<a name="10719w03.html_para1">The first awards to the national governing bodies under the Potential and Start programmes were made in January 2000. Funding for Cricket has been agreed but the programmes have yet to be implemented; Tennis does not receive lottery funding support from Sport England (the Lawn Tennis Association administers its own sports development programme); and Rugby has been offered funding of &#163;8 million over 8 years, but the governing body has yet to accept the award.

<a name="10719w03.html_para2">As the programmes for cricket and rugby have not started, no evaluation has taken place. However, both sports have identified a performer development model to reflect the transition of the athletes through the Start and Potential Programmes. It is too early to measure the success of these programmes, but I am confident that the lottery investment will enable our talented athletes to achieve success at the highest level.

<a name="10719w05.html_spnew1"><B> Nigel Griffiths: </B> 
 I am today publishing tables setting out the payment performance of Government Departments and their Agencies in the financial year 2000&#150;01. The publication of these tables is part of our commitment to tackle late payment and improve the UK's payment culture. We are determined that the public sector should lead by example.
<P>

<a name="10719w05.html_para0">Government Departments and Agencies are required to pay all valid invoices within 30 days, or other agreed credit period. The tables show that, overall, Government Departments and their Agencies paid 96.80 per cent. of bills within the agreed credit period.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10719w05.html_wqn2"><B> Helen Southworth: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry when the outcome of the first stage of the quinquennial review of the six grant-awarding research councils will be announced; and what its principal recommendations are.  [5978]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10719w05.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 I am today able to announce the outcome of the first stage of the quinquennial review of the six grant-awarding Research Councils. I shall be placing a copy of the stage 1 report in the Libraries of both Houses.
<P>

<a name="10719w05.html_para1">Quinquennial reviews of Non-Departmental Public Bodies (NDPBs) are a key part of our programme to modernise Government. The Government are committed to achieving better public services that are of higher quality and are more responsive to the needs of the people who use them. Regular NDPB reviews are an important element in ensuring that we have in place the right structures to deliver the Government's agenda effectively and to provide a strong focus on improving future performance. Under Cabinet Office guidance (31 January 2000), such reviews should be conducted in two stages.
<P>

<a name="10719w05.html_para2">The terms of reference for this review set the following objectives:
<P>

<a name="10719w05.html_para3"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the first stage would examine the role and organisation of the Research Councils, by reference to their Charters and missions, and evidence of past practice. It would set the detailed terms of reference for the second stage;

<P>
<BR>
the second stage would examine the efficiency and effectiveness of the Councils' operations and look for further opportunities for improving performance.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="10719w05.html_para4">The principal recommendation of stage 1 is that the Research Councils should continue to be executive NDPBs. The review concluded that:
<P>

<a name="10719w05.html_para5"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the Councils are a necessary mechanism for the delivery of Government policy for scientific research and postgraduate training;
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="10719w05.html_para6"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the Councils individually and collectively are an important source of independent scientific advice to Government;
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="10719w05.html_para7"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the Councils' existing individual missions provide an effective focus for their communities;
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="10719w05.html_para8"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>none of the alternative organisational models would offer equivalent benefits to the UK Science and Engineering Base at the present time;
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="10719w05.html_para9"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the Councils have made considerable progress in adopting new ways of working to generate efficiency savings, demonstrate value for money and maximise spending on science;
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="10719w05.html_para10"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>NDPB status remains the most appropriate organisational model for maintaining the Haldane principle, ensuring effective accountability for public funds and engaging the scientific communities.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="10719w05.html_para11">Stage 2 of the Review will now examine four broad themes, which were identified following the extensive stage 1 consultation. These are: mission, structure and governance; relations between the Research Councils and their clients; priority-setting and decision-making; the Councils' management and internal processes. Working groups, whose members will include a wide range of stakeholders, will be considering these areas, and there has been also been a second written consultation.
<P>

<a name="10719w05.html_para12">I welcome these recommendations, and I am grateful to the members of the steering group for their work on this review.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if the regional development agencies have prepared annual reports and accounts for 2000&#150;01; and if she will make a statement.  [5977]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10719w05.html_spnew3"><B> Alan Johnson: </B> 
 The Regional Development Agencies' annual reports and accounts for 2000&#150;01 have been published today. Copies have been placed in the Library. These cover the period from 1 April 2000 through to 31 March 2001. The Government welcome the continued progress made by Agencies in improving the economic regeneration, skills and competitiveness of the regions.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10719w05.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Don Foster: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry which of the Regional Development Agencies have published an action plan as part of their corporate/business plan for 2001&#150;02 setting out how they propose to develop their evaluation and performance monitoring framework; and how many of those action plans contain a commitment to consulting the general public on the content of the frameworks.  [4608]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10719w05.html_spnew4"><B> Alan Johnson: </B> 
 Each Regional Development Agency (RDA) has produced an action plan as part of the corporate planning process for 2001&#150;02 setting out how they propose to develop their evaluation and performance monitoring framework. RDAs are required to publish an abridged version of their corporate plan, but whether or not this includes the action plan is at their discretion. 



<P>
<P><I>19 Jul 2001 : Column: 325W</I><P>
RDAs were not required to consult the general public on the content of the frameworks, although several RDAs are developing and refining their frameworks in consultation with regional partners.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what the definition is of trading links contained in her Department's document, 'Your Britain, Your Europe, Your North West'.  [4324]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10719w05.html_spnew5"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 Companies with "trading links" means those in the North West which are associated with the export of goods and services to other EU member states.

<a name="10719w05.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Andrew Turner: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry for how many jobs in the North West membership of the single market is crucial according to her Department's document, "Your Britain, Your Europe, Your North West".  [4325]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10719w05.html_spnew6"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 Membership of the Single Market makes the UK, including the North West, attractive to inward investment from across the world. As the document states this investment has amounted to &#163;5.5 billion over the last ten years helping to create or safeguard over 100,000 jobs.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10719w05.html_spnew7"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 Although gender breakdown of beneficiaries of European Social Fund projects is recorded and monitored, this is not in sufficient detail to show how many women have entered the construction industry as a consequence of European funding.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10719w06.html_spnew0"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 &#163;20 million was allocated from the European Regional Development Fund for the redevelopment of Manchester City Centre. Of this, &#163;1.79 million was directly allocated to the Exchange Square project. &#163;4.4 million was allocated to 'public realm' improvements in the City Centre, which included work on the public areas surrounding the Arndale Centre.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10719w06.html_spnew1"><B> Alan Johnson: </B> 
 The European Commission approved the UK areas eligible for regional state aid in July 2000; these were then implemented through the Assisted Areas Order 2000. The European Commission approval lasts until the end of 2006; the Government are not planning to review the assisted areas until it is necessary to develop proposals for the subsequent period. At that stage they will consult interested bodies on the selection of areas, including the Scottish Executive and others in Scotland.

 <i>[holding answer 17 July 2001]:</i> The number of additional telecommunications masts that will be needed for the effective development of third generation mobile communications will depend on commercial decisions by the network operators on how they configure and roll out their networks.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10719w06.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 Published statistics on renewable energy relate to the United Kingdom as a whole, as do published electricity generation statistics. In 2000, 2.8 per cent. of the electricity generated in the United Kingdom was from renewables.




<P>
<P><I>19 Jul 2001 : Column: 327W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="10719w06.html_para2">Estimates by my Department show that in England about 1&#189; per cent. of the electricity generated came from renewable resources in 2000, while in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland the proportions were about 8&#190; per cent, 3&#188; per cent. and 1&#189; per cent., respectively. The percentages are higher in Scotland and Wales because large scale hydro generation (which accounts for almost half of generation from renewables) is concentrated there. In the United Kingdom as a whole, if large scale hydro generation is excluded, about 1&#189; per cent. of electricity was generated from renewable sources in 2000. On this basis the proportions in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland were 1&#189; per cent, &#189; per cent, 2 per cent. and 1&#189; per cent, respectively.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what information, prior to Independent Insurance going into liquidation, was provided to <i>(a)</i> her Department and <i>(b)</i> the FSA relating to the French regulator's review of the company's French branch; and when this information was provided.

 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="10719w06.html_para6">The French regulator, the Commission de Contr&#244;le des Assurances (CCA), first wrote to the FSA expressing their concerns about the French insurance subsidiary of the Independent Insurance Group on 11 January 2001. This company was a sister company of the UK-supervised insurer, representing about 5 per cent. of group premium income, and was subject to French supervision. The FSA, following discussions with the UK company, and having received copies of the company's own detailed responses to the French authorities, replied to the CCA in March 2001. In that letter, the FSA noted its understanding that the group had provided additional financing to the French subsidiary. The FSA subsequently had a number of further contacts with the CCA including a visit to their offices in Paris, provided financial information about the financial position of the UK company, and kept the CCA informed of events in the period leading to the company's closure.

 Since its launch in October 1994, the agency has positioned itself as the market leader in the disposal sales of surplus equipment and goods in the public sector. The key targets, which have been set for the chief executive of the Disposal Services Agency for this financial year, are aimed at securing disposal receipts from the sale of surplus capital assets and inventory items from both the Ministry of Defence and a range of public sector organisations. The chief executive of the agency has been set the following key targets for the financial year 2001&#150;02.

<P>
<a name="10719w07.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Martyn Jones: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what assessment he has made of Iraq's capability to use ballistic missile technology to target surface-to-air missiles.  [4040]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10719w07.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 Since December 1998, the Iraqi integrated air defence system has been engaged in a systematic campaign to shoot down coalition aircraft patrolling the no-fly zones. There have been over 1,800 direct threats from a range of Iraqi air defence assets, including surface-to-air missiles and anti-aircraft artillery. Coalition aircraft are authorised to respond in self-defence only against air defence targets, and have done so on some 270 occasions.
<P>

<a name="10719w07.html_para0">Over the past two and a half years, the Iraqis have evolved a range of novel tactics, aimed at maximising the threat to the coalition while minimising the risk of being targeted by a self-defence response. In particular, we assess that Iraqi surface-to-air missiles have been launched without the support of their fire control radars, in order to hide the position of the firing unit (thereby reducing its vulnerability).
<P>

<a name="10719w07.html_para1">Missiles launched in this way receive no guidance information during flight and are much less likely to hit a target in comparison to a conventionally guided missile. The corollary is that there is also an enhanced risk, as with Iraq's indiscriminate use of surface-to-surface rockets in this role, of damage to civilian facilities when the missiles return to earth. Although surface-to-air missiles operated in this way follow an unguided, ballistic trajectory, there is no evidence that Iraq has employed ballistic missile technology to guide these surface-to-air missiles.

sector has much potential benefit to defence; and to inform and assist the defence industry's own diversification planning. Until 1 July 2001, the DDA was part of the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency (DERA), the annual reports of which cover the activities of the DDA. The most recent report is the DERA annual report 1999&#150;2000 published by The Stationery Office in July 2000 and which has sections on such issues as "Exploiting DERA's Technology" and "Defence Diversification and Regional Development" that deal with the DDA's activities. Following the DERA public-private partnership and the formation of the new company QinetiQ on 1 July 2001, the DDA has been brought into MOD head office. We are examining how best to report on its activities in future alongside our consideration of the formation of a Defence Diversification Council, which I have already announced our intention to establish once we have experience of how the DDA will operate in practice under the new structure. I will make a further announcement in due course.

<P>
<a name="10719w08.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Work is in hand in the Ministry of Defence on the implementation of the Defence Training Review which my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence announced to the House in March. A number of areas have been identified where rationalisation on a single site appears feasible, and scoping studies are taking place on these. These studies are examining, in the first instance, options for providing the training at MOD sites. These will serve as benchmarks, or Public Sector Comparators, against which a wider range of options can be considered. Wider options include potential partnerships with the private sector, and private sector providers are being encouraged to propose innovative solutions. These might involve establishing training establishments on completely new sites. The selection, therefore, of a benchmark site does not imply that the MOD has taken a decision to continue training on that site.
<P>

<a name="10719w08.html_para6">The sites being examined for these benchmarks or Public Sector Comparators are RAF Cosford for aeronautical engineering training; the Defence School of Transport at Leconfield for logistic training; Defence Intelligence and Security Centre at Chicksands for security, intelligence, language and photography training; the Royal School of Signals at Blandford for communications and information systems training; RAF Halton for joint personnel administration and police training and HMS Sultan for electro-mechanical engineering training. There will be implications for other sites at which elements of this training are carried out, but because work is at an early stage these cannot be quantified.
<P>

<a name="10719w08.html_para7">In parallel with the work on the Defence Training Review, the Royal Navy has been conducting a comprehensive review of the remainder of its training estate. It is now proposed to concentrate naval shore training over the next 10 years at the Britannia Royal Naval College Dartmouth, HMS Raleigh in the Plymouth area, and HMS Collingwood in Gosport. This will permit 



<P>
<P><I>19 Jul 2001 : Column: 335W</I><P>
the delivery of more cost-effective training and improve operational capability. It will include the creation of an Integrated Maritime Warfare School at HMS Collingwood, which will deliver all maritime warfare training in a single site. As part of this programme, HMS Dryad in the Portsmouth area will become surplus to requirements and close by no later than 2011, although vigorous efforts will be made to advance this date to maximise the operational and financial benefits, and it is intended that substantial elements of the establishment will progressively transfer to HMS Collingwood over the next few years. Changes are also planned at HMS Excellent in Portsmouth, which has been announced as the future site for key elements of the Royal Navy's Fleet Headquarters.
<P>

<a name="10719w08.html_para8">Detailed proposals for all the above measures will be subject to normal consultative procedures at the appropriate time.

 The current estimate of the total acquisition cost of the Trident programme, with payments already made expressed at the prices and exchange rates actually incurred and future spend at the current financial year exchange rate (the hybrid estimate), is now &#163;9,764 million. Leaving aside the effects of price inflation and exchange rate variation (+&#163;7 million), there has been a real cost increase of &#163;12 million. Expenditure on the Trident acquisition programme to 30 September 2000 represented some 98 per cent. of the total estimate. If all expenditure, past and projected, is brought up to this current year's economic conditions (the non-hybrid estimate) the estimate is &#163;13,662 million.
<P>

<a name="10719w09.html_para0">The programme continues to show an overall reduction in real terms on its original 1982 estimate. This reduction, including the savings resulting from the decision to process missiles at the United States facility at Kings Bay, Georgia, now stands at over &#163;3.9 billion at current prices.
<P>

<a name="10719w09.html_para1">The proportion of the estimate for work undertaken in the United Kingdom is around 70 per cent.

<P>
<a name="10719w09.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. David: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what progress has been made on the Bowman project; and if he will make a statement.  [5986]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10719w09.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The Bowman project will provide the armed forces with a modern, highly capable tactical combat radio communications system to replace Clansman which has been in service since the mid-1970s. It will provide secure, reliable communications to our land forces and selected elements of the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force. The system will also implement a tactical internet and provide automatic position location, navigation and reporting.
<P>

<a name="10719w09.html_para3">Last summer, in the light of major problems with the programme, the competition for the Bowman combat radio was re-launched. Following careful analysis of the bids submitted by Thales, TRW and CDC, I have decided that CDC, a subsidiary of General Dynamics already operating in the UK, should be selected as the preferred supplier of this system.
<P>

<a name="10719w09.html_para4">Our priority has been to deliver a successful solution that fills the capability gap at the earliest opportunity. CDC has offered a solution that fully meets the military requirement and represents the best value for money. I am confident that it will meet our demanding timetable for getting this vital equipment into service with the armed forces. It is based on the development of a proven system, and includes best of class radios and a very efficient approach to fielding and support. Its bid is the clear winner of the competition.
<P>

<a name="10719w09.html_para5">The Ministry of Defence and CDC will now work together on the programme to bring Bowman into service. We aim to be in a position to let the contract in late summer this year, in support of an In-Service Date in early 2004. The contract is valued at around &#163;1.8 billion. It will cover both the supply of the Bowman system and the first five years of support up to the year 2009.
<P>

<a name="10719w09.html_para6">CDC's solution will provide employment opportunities in the UK in a broad range of system areas, including design, development, manufacture and project management. Ninety per cent. of the work content of the CDC bid will be UK-based&#151;the highest proportion of any of the three bids. Around 1,600 jobs will be secured across the UK, including 400 new high-technology and support posts at the company's headquarters, which CDC plan to establish in south Wales. The company has also earmarked south Wales for a new Army Communications Technology research and development centre, which will be staffed by around 65 leading scientists. Other regions will benefit too. We expect sub-contract work to secure over 100 jobs in Scotland, over 300 jobs in south-west England, and around 75 jobs in the south-east centred on Hastings. Major UK sub-contractors include Alvis and GKN-Westlands.
<P>

<a name="10719w09.html_para7">This month will also see the first deliveries, ahead of schedule, of the Personal Role Radios, a new capability which was separated from the main Bowman requirement in 1999 in order to ensure early delivery to the front line. These radios will provide short range communications for dismounted infantry, and will transform their operations.

 Immigration detainees may be handcuffed, if this is assessed in a particular case to be necessary for reasons of security and control, while being escorted from their place of detention to another location.

<P>
<a name="10719w09.html_spnew11"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 The detention under Immigration Act powers of any individual, whether an asylum seeker or not, has to be justified on the basis of the particular circumstances of the individual concerned and there is a general presumption in favour of granting temporary admission or temporary release. In any case where detention is considered necessary a range of factors must be taken into account before the detention is authorised.
<P>

<a name="10719w09.html_para17">One of these factors is whether the individual concerned has a history of torture. Evidence of such a history would weigh heavily against detention and, in any case where there is independent evidence of torture, the person concerned would not normally be considered suitable for detention.

section 65 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999. He confirmed that people appealing against immigration decisions made before 2 October 2000 cannot benefit from this appeal right which is not retrospective. But they could make a separate human rights claim and would have the opportunity to appeal except in those instances where the human rights issue had already been considered by the appellate authority or the courts, or there had been findings of fact at an earlier appeal which mean the human rights claim is bound to fail.
<P>

<a name="10719w10.html_para6">However, it has been decided that the exception should not apply to people who had an appeal pending or could have lodged appeals in time to the immigration appeals authority on 2 October 2000. If they make a human rights claim and it is rejected they will be able to make an allegation and we will then give them an opportunity to appeal to the immigration appeals authority.

 The Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis informs me that the practice in relation to calls made by Superintendent Dizaei (prior to 2 October 2000, when Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 came into force) was that all calls on the Metropolitan police service telephone network were recorded. Those which related to his role as National Black Police Association Legal Adviser were not transcribed and not passed to the team that is investigating his conduct.

<P>
<a name="10719w11.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The chair of the Metropolitan Police Authority (MPA) informs me that the Authority is dealing with the allegations against Mr. Blair and Mr. Hayman in accordance with Regulation 7 of the Police (Conduct) (Senior Officers) Regulations 1999. A specialist adviser, who has sought clarification of the misconduct alleged by the National Black Police Association (NBPA), is tasked to report back to a sub-committee of the MPA on all three officers, as soon as possible, following the completion of his inquiries.

 The only provision in the Terrorism Act 2000 not brought into force on or before 19 February 2001 by any of the three commencement orders signed by my predecessor is section 100 in Part VII of the Act. This concerns the making of a code of practice for silent video recordings in Northern Ireland of those detained under the Act. Section 100 has not been brought into force because an order under paragraph 3 of schedule 8 to the Act has been made introducing video recording with sound in Northern Ireland with effect from 19 February. No order has been made prescribing the kind of information to be provided by passenger carriers about passengers, crew and vehicles travelling in the common travel area (paragraph 17 (4) of Schedule 7). Discussions continue about how the power to collect information is to be used and the kind of information to be collected.

 The objective of the Passport Service, when setting fees, is to break even after contribution to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office for non-fee bearing consular services. Fee levels should be set to ensure that the Passport Service breaks even in any given year.

 The forecast for income from the Passport Service is &#163;135.4 million in 2001&#150;02 and &#163;156.8 million in 2002&#150;03, an increase of just under 16 per cent. It is important to note that this increase does not simply reflect a potential general fee increase but also an increase in revenue as a result of the planned introduction of Tiered Application Services, for which applicants would choose to pay a fee premium to guarantee faster delivery times. It is intended to introduce these services during the final quarter of 2001&#150;02 and this has been assumed in forecast revenue assumptions.

 The guidance on the safety of converting vehicles to use autogas is contained within UK legislation. The Motor Vehicles (Authorisation of Special Types) (Amendment) (No. 2) Order 1998 (Statutory Instrument 1998 No. 2884) provides the technical standards for the use of compressed natural gas and Regulation 94 of the Road Vehicles (Construction and Use) Regulations 1986 (Statutory Instrument 1986 No. 1078) provides the technical standards for the use of liquefied petroleum gas.

 The licensing of private hire vehicles is a matter for local licensing authorities (district/borough councils, unitary authorities or Transport for London).

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions what criteria are applied in defining the Government's standard regions for England.  [5101]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10719w14.html_spnew11"><B> Dr. Whitehead: </B> 
 The 'standard English regions' emerged from local government reorganisation in 1974 and resulted in the creation of eight regions which were used by a large number of Government Departments (though not all) for planning purposes, and became the standard regions for statistical purposes. These boundaries often continue to be termed standard regions.
<P>

<a name="10719w14.html_para4">In 1994, the creation of the Government Offices (GOs) resulted in a new delineation of regions within England, (now generally referred to as GO boundaries). These reflected the boundaries of the then Regional Boards and the regional organisations of the (then) Departments of Transport and Environment. The GO regions are also of a more equally distributed population size than the standard regions.
<P>

<a name="10719w14.html_para5">The existing GO boundaries have now become increasingly well-established, reflecting the Government's commitment, in the "Modernising Government" White Paper, that, where possible, all Government bodies should align with GO boundaries.

[5099]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10719w14.html_spnew15"><B> Dr. Whitehead: </B> 
 As at 31 May 1997, Hampshire and the Isle of Wight were part of the South West and Wessex Regional Health Authority, which also included the counties of Dorset and Wiltshire. This changed in April 1999, when Hampshire and the Isle of Wight were aligned with the South East Regional Health Authority. On 31 May 1997, the Environment Agency's south and west region, based largely on the GO south-west region, included a small part of Hampshire and the Isle of Wight. That remains the case. For all other Government purposes, as far as we can ascertain, Hampshire and the Isle of Wight were, on 31 May 1997, included in the GO south-east region with the counties of Kent, Surrey, East and West Sussex, Berkshire, Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10719w15.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The Rating (Former Agricultural Premises and Rural Shops) Act 2001, which received Royal Assent on 11 May will be brought into effect in England on 15 August. From this date all new small scale non-agricultural businesses on farms with rateable values of up to &#163;6,000, whether or not operated by the farmer, will receive up to 5 years' mandatory 50 per cent. rate relief. Also from this date most small village food shops will qualify for 50 per cent. mandatory rate relief under the existing village shop rate relief scheme.
<P>

<a name="10719w15.html_para0">The new relief will lower the start-up costs for small non-agricultural businesses located on what had been agricultural land and buildings. This will enable farmers to diversify either directly by starting new businesses themselves, or indirectly, through the sale or leasing of former agricultural premises.
<P>

<a name="10719w15.html_para1">By extending the existing village shop rate relief to most other food shops, vital support will be given to more village businesses that provide essential services to the community.
<P>

<a name="10719w15.html_para2">The introduction of these reliefs fulfils Government commitments made in the Action Plan for Farming, the Local Government Finance Green Paper and the Rural White Paper.

<P>

<a name="10719w15.html_para3">I am very pleased to report that the inspectorate has had another successful year, against a background of rising workloads, coupled with tighter targets for handling appeals. It has met all but one of the timeliness targets set for its work in England and Wales. The high standard of service to local authorities on development plan inquiries has been maintained with targets being exceeded. This has helped to create a greater certainty for all involved in the planning process as more of England and Wales is covered by up to date development plans.

<P>

<a name="10719w15.html_para4">Financially, the inspectorate has continued to seek greater efficiency in working practices, with major investment in business systems and an ongoing commitment to electronic service delivery. Once again expenditure has been contained very closely within budget, reflecting achievement of demanding Treasury efficiency targets. The agreement of a second successive three-year funding deal with DTLR has also introduced greater certainty into the business planning process, enabling a more strategic approach to the challenging years ahead.
<P>

<a name="10719w15.html_para5">Customer surveys continue to show that the inspectorate's decisions are widely respected. In spite of rising workloads, the quality and efficiency targets were achieved.

<P>
<a name="10719w15.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 Work on the six original regional air service studies proposed in the 1998 Transport White Paper was completed last year. Since then a second phase of work has been under way to co-ordinate these part 1 studies and audit them for consistency. This has involved reviewing air traffic forecasts for each airport under a range of national scenarios, examining catchments and route development in more detail, carrying out a more in-depth appraisal of options and integrating this work with the findings from a range of other UK-wide strategic studies. This part 2 work, known as the RASCO study, is nearing completion, but the emerging findings have highlighted a number of key strategic issues on which further work is needed. This is necessary to ensure that the regional air service consultation documents, which we hope to publish around the turn of the year, will provide a full and robust basis for public consultation.
<P>

<a name="10719w15.html_para6">Two part 3 studies, one covering the midlands of England and the other the lowlands of Scotland, have therefore been commissioned to examine important long-term runway capacity. This work is programmed for completion before the end of the year and will be published shortly thereafter, along with the part 1 and 2 studies to help inform the regional air service consultation process.

However, it has been able to provide information on the average length of service of all those employees who left the company over each of the last five years. It has also provided information on the average number of years' service of staff currently still employed by London Underground.

<a name="10719w15.html_para22">The Government do not set specific safety related targets. London Underground operates services under the terms of the railways safety case approved by the Health and Safety Executive. The executive now has a double lock on safety. Before the tube modernisation plans can proceed, the executive must accept, firstly, London Underground's safety plans and, secondly, its revised safety plans to reflect the role of the private sector bidders.

By the end of March 2002, a total of &#163;2.781 billion of grant will have been provided to London Transport since April 1997, of which &#163;2.399 billion will have been internally allocated to London Underground.

 The Government's plans for the London Underground will deliver &#163;13 billion of investment over the first 15 years, giving London the 21st century underground that it deserves. The contracts to deliver this investment remain under negotiation. However, London Underground estimate that in the first year of the contracts, approximately 50 per cent. of investment spending will be on train systems including rolling stock and signalling. A further 25 per cent. of investment expenditure will be on infrastructure, including track and civil assets. The remaining 25 per cent. will be on stations, delivering the improvements that passengers consider important: making sure the lifts and escalators work; installing CCTV to improve passenger security; tackling congestion at the busiest stations; providing step-free access; and improving the quality and cleanliness of stations.

It has provided the information in the tables as shown on train delays of over two minutes due to passenger illness, split by line and by period. London Underground does not hold data in this format prior to Period 7 (broadly September) in 1999. To collate previous information would incur disproportionate cost.

<P>
<a name="10719w15.html_spnew17"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 This is an operational matter for London Underground, which informs me that it does not gather information on ticket office performance in the format requested. It measures "the percentage of customers in a ticket queue for three minutes or more". This information is available by line, but it is not possible to break it down for the 253 stations operated by London Underground. The table sets out the average percentage of customers in a ticket queue for three minutes or more for each of the years requested.

<a name="10719w15.html_para26">It should be noted that over this period as a whole the pressures on the Underground network have risen substantially, with some 200 million extra passenger journeys undertaken last year compared to 1994&#150;95.
<P>

<a name="10719w15.html_para27">Various measures are being taken as part of the Prestige PFI scheme to improve ticketing services. New multifare ticket machines have been installed across the network. These machines take credit and debit cards and are expected to help speed up ticket purchase time significantly. New ticket office machines and accounting systems are being installed which will help ticket office staff process transactions more swiftly. And by September 2001 50 new Queuebuster machines will be in place at key stations, selling a variety of tickets including weekly travelcards.

 My Department does not compile data that would enable comparisons to be made on a consistent basis between the performance of either major underground systems or integrated light rail systems in major cities. However, the data and research which my Department has examined or commissioned have shown that light rail schemes and associated integrated transport policies can play a significant role in improving the attractiveness and quality of public transport and increasing its usage.

 The Government recognise the difficulties that manufacturers are experiencing because of the slowdown in the world economy and the weakness of the euro. No country can ever insulate itself from world economic events. The Government's primary economic task is to create the right conditions of macro-economic stability within which all businesses, including manufacturers, can develop their potential; the Government keep all taxes under review and the changes to the tax system are considered as part of the normal Budget process, taking into account implications for the UK's international competitiveness.

 The Government have put in place a comprehensive programme to monitor and evaluate the Working Families Tax Credit. The Working Families Tax Credit is part of a wider package of measures designed to make work pay and thereby help to provide employment opportunity for all. These measures also include the introduction of the National Minimum Wage, the 10p starting rate of tax, and changes to employee and employer National Insurance Contributions. Independent estimates, which are consistent with those produced by the Treasury, suggest that these measures will lead to an increase in the labour supply of second earners.

 The French regulator, the Commission de Contr&#244;le des Assurances (CCA), first wrote to the FSA expressing their concerns about the French insurance subsidiary of the Independent Insurance Group on 11 January 2001. This company was a sister company of the UK-supervised insurer, representing about 5 per cent of group premium income, and was subject to French supervision. The FSA, following discussions with the UK company, and having received copies of the company's own detailed responses to the French authorities, replied to the CCA in March 2001. In that letter, the FSA noted its understanding that the group had provided additional financing to the French subsidiary. The FSA subsequently had a number of further contacts with the CCA including a visit to their offices in Paris, provided financial information about the financial position of the UK company, and kept the CCA informed of events in the period leading to the company's closure.

The FSA has published details of how it will exercise these powers, and has set out its policy on publishing the sanctions which it has imposed, in its Enforcement Manual.

<P>
<a name="10719w20.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Sustainable rural development is one of the key objectives of my new Department. We will be preparing a sustainable development strategy that will look both at the promotion of sustainable food chains within the United Kingdom and promoting sustainability within the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy. This will involve the transfer of resources from market support measures&#151;so-called first pillar policies&#151;to the second pillar of the Common Agricultural Policy as the key mechanism for delivering environmental, economic and social policy goals in rural areas and for facilitating restructuring of the agricultural industry.
<P>

<a name="10719w20.html_para5">We have already said that we will be setting up an Independent Commission to advise on how we can assist the development of a sustainable, competitive and diverse farming and food sector within a thriving rural economy which advances environmental health and animal welfare goals. An announcement on this will be made shortly.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10719w20.html_spnew9"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 The Department does not have statistics on job losses in the agricultural sector in Cumbria resulting from foot and mouth disease. We are, however, planning to organise a telephone survey of a sample of farmers who have been directly or indirectly affected by foot and mouth disease. It is proposed that questions relating to the employment effects of the outbreak will be included in this survey.
<P>

<a name="10719w20.html_para6">It is too early to make a full assessment of the number of jobs lost as a result of the foot and mouth outbreak, and for many businesses the worst impacts are likely to occur over the autumn and winter period. However, the Insolvency Service has identified that about 33 businesses have cited foot and mouth disease as the reason for closure since 12 April and anticipate that this figure will rise. Evidence on labour market impact in most of the areas which are seriously affected suggests that foot and mouth disease has slowed the rate at which unemployment is falling, through an effect on both job losses and recruitment. Local survey evidence suggests that the tourism industry in the worst affected areas has suffered a large loss of trade in the past four months, 



<P>
<P><I>19 Jul 2001 : Column: 388W</I><P>

[45]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10719w20.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Animal Health Act 1981 provides the powers to require the slaughter of any animals affected with foot and mouth disease, or suspected of being infected. It also sets the rate of compensation. The Department took a number of steps to inform farmers of the policies being pursued to eradicate foot and mouth, including letters, the provision of information via the internet and the establishment of a helpline. Veterinary staff and other DEFRA staff in disease control centres throughout the country are available to provide any explanation required by the owner of an infected premises. Owners of infected premises will have the range of movement and other restrictions explained to them.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="10719w20.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 With conventional foot and mouth disease vaccines which meet international criteria of safety and potency and following the routine, two-dose primary course of vaccination, there should be no likelihood of vaccinated animals becoming clinically infected with a closely related strain within the same virus serotype for approximately 12 months. This is dependent on vaccination being part of an overall control programme, which includes movement restrictions.

 Detailed guidance is currently being drafted in respect of cleansing and the disinfection of milking parlours.

 Central records of infected premises do not specify whether they have a milking parlour.

<a name="10719w20.html_wqn17"><B> David Maclean: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment she has made that vaccinated animals can act as virus carriers of foot and mouth disease.  [2578]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10719w20.html_spnew17"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 I am guided on this matter by the expert veterinary and scientific advice received, which is that once vaccinated animals are fully protected they should not develop clinical foot and mouth disease. However, the virus can replicate even in animals immune against the development of clinical disease, if they are exposed to infection. A proportion of such animals can become persistently infected while never developing clinical disease. These are so-called "carriers". Virus replication in carrier animals is confined to the oro-pharynx (throat) and occurs only in ruminants (cattle, sheep and goats). Pigs do not become carriers.
<P>

<a name="10719w20.html_para10">Expert scientific advice is that spread from vaccinated carrier animals is an extremely rare event; the amount of virus excreted is many orders of magnitude less than that expected by animals during the acute phase of disease or 



<P>
<P><I>19 Jul 2001 : Column: 390W</I><P>
during the sub-clinical incubation period. To minimise the risks further, movement restrictions would be applied to all vaccinated animals for 12 months. Any risk of spread of foot and mouth disease from vaccinated carrier animals is considered to be extremely remote. However, it can be one reason to prohibit the export of animals and animal products from countries which practise vaccination to those which do not and which are free of the disease.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10719w20.html_wqn18"><B> David Maclean: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment the Government have made of the risk of infection of foot and mouth via the wild animal population, with particular reference to deer, hedgehogs and rats.  [2556]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10719w20.html_spnew18"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Our current veterinary risk assessment concludes that infected deer could transmit foot and mouth disease to susceptible livestock during the clinical stages of the disease. However the risk of wild deer playing any significant part in the spread of the disease is assessed as very low and feral deer are unlikely to represent a longer term risk. During the current outbreak over 60 deer have been examined for foot and mouth disease with negative results, and we have no evidence of deer playing any part in the spread of disease.
<P>

<a name="10719w20.html_para11">Hedgehogs are susceptible to foot and mouth disease but do not appear to have played any part in the spread of the disease. Rats are not susceptible to foot and mouth disease but may have a role in spreading the disease indirectly. For this reason an intensive programme of rodent control is carried out on infected premises.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment she has made of the use of real-time video in undertaking veterinary surveillance of animal herds to detect clinical signs of foot and mouth.  [3558]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10719w20.html_spnew19"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 No formal assessment has been made but experience has shown that the disease, especially in sheep, may be difficult to detect even by close physical examination by a veterinary inspector. Real-time video is therefore not considered to be a practical proposition.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs how many farmers in <i>(a)</i> Cumbria and <i>(b)</i> England entered their sheep for the welfare disposal scheme when it was fixed at &#163;45 per head; and how many were (i) not collected and (ii) pending collection when the price was dropped to &#163;30 per head.  [3557]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10719w20.html_spnew20"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Livestock Welfare Disposal Scheme (LWDS) was introduced to provide a means of resolving serious animal welfare problems arising directly from the FMD movement restrictions. Payments made under the scheme are to alleviate welfare problems, and are not a form of compensation. The payment rates were changed on 30 April in the light of evidence that applicants were using the scheme as an alternative market, despite the introduction of various schemes to allow livestock movements from 23 April.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10719w20.html_spnew23"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Vaccination against foot and mouth disease is covered by the provisions of Council Directive 85/511/EEC, which requires member states to prohibit vaccination. This has been implemented through the Foot- and-Mouth Disease (Control of Vaccination) (England) Regulations 2001.
<P>

<a name="10719w20.html_para13">However, the Directive also provides for limited recourse to emergency vaccination, in accordance with plans which must be authorised by the European Commission, working through the European Union's Standing Veterinary Committee. Any Commission Decision to permit vaccination would be implemented in the UK by Regulations made under the European Communities Act 1972.
<P>

<a name="10719w20.html_para14">During the early stage of the current outbreak, two Commission Decisions were adopted which permitted vaccination in parts of the UK in limited circumstances. In the event, these were not put into effect. The use of vaccination against foot and mouth disease is under continuous review, in the light of changing circumstances and knowledge about the disease outbreak.

payment of livestock compensation to farmers whose animals have been slaughtered in the foot and mouth crisis; and if she will pay interest from the date of stock loss.  [2175]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10719w20.html_spnew24"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 I recognise that there have been delays in payment of compensation to some farmers whose animals have been slaughtered in the foot and mouth outbreak, and that at the peak period of April and May these delays could be extensive. However, delays are reducing and new claims should be paid within three weeks of the receipt of correct documents. Ministers are considering whether the payment of interest on delayed compensation payments would be justified. Standard valuations were introduced on 22 March which could help to reduce the time taken between diagnosis of disease and payment of compensation. However, this facility has only been used by a minority of farmers.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10719w20.html_spnew25"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Veterinary instructions in place before the start of the outbreak required that animals in which disease was confirmed should be slaughtered with all practical speed and that those animals showing clinical signs should be slaughtered immediately on confirmation.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10719w20.html_spnew29"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State announced on 21 June 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 166, that she had asked me to look urgently at revoking remaining blanket closures of rights of way imposed by local authorities in England. Letters were sent to local authorities the next day explaining the Government's proposals in more detail and inviting them to make representations if they considered they could justify retaining blanket closures beyond 20 July.
<P>

<a name="10719w20.html_para16">I have now considered carefully the representations received. I have agreed that blanket closures may remain in place for the time being in Cumbria and in parts of Devon, Lancashire, Durham, Gloucestershire and Herefordshire. I have also allowed Somerset to retain partial blanket closure until 27 July, and agreed with north Yorkshire their proposals for temporarily retaining closures in parts of the county. In granting these exemptions we have recognised the logistical difficulties which revocation would pose for a few authorities, particularly those hardest hit by foot and mouth disease.
<P>

<a name="10719w20.html_para17">With the exception of the authorities mentioned above, all remaining closures under article 35B will be lifted from midnight on Friday 20 July. At midnight the following Friday, 27 July, any remaining closures under article 35A (which allowed authorities to close individual paths outside Infected Areas without ministerial consent) will be revoked.
<P>

<a name="10719w20.html_para18">These actions will ensure that public rights of way are closed only where this is justified. The Department's guidance and veterinary risk assessment issued on 23 May makes it clear that, except within 3 km Protection Zones around infected premises, paths may safely be re-opened. We expect authorities to continue to re-open paths where this can be done safely, in line with the guidance. We shall review the position no later than early September.
<P>

<a name="10719w20.html_para19">Lifting blanket closures does not mean that all paths will be open. Local authorities retain power to close individual paths, though outside Infected Areas this requires the Department's consent. All such closures must be signed at entrances to the path. Authorities should use their power to close paths selectively, in the areas affected by revocation and elsewhere, only where justified on disease control grounds in line with the Department's guidance. Where paths within Protection Zones are 



<P>
<P><I>19 Jul 2001 : Column: 394W</I><P>
affected by the lifting of a blanket closure, authorities should arrange for their selective re-closure where appropriate.
<P>

<a name="10719w20.html_para20">People using paths should take sensible precautions to reduce even further any risk of spreading the disease. These are set out in the codes for path users accompanying the guidance to local authorities of 23 May. Authorities should publicise these precautions, particularly the need to stay off farmland if people have recently handled farm animals and to avoid going near, touching or feeding livestock.
<P>

<a name="10719w20.html_para21">The Government's decision to open footpaths to walkers is entirely consistent with our strong advice to farmers to observe tight bio-security and reflects very different risks. The risks of footpath users transmitting the disease are tiny, particularly when compared with those posed by farmers and others who handle livestock.
<P>

<a name="10719w20.html_para22">Foot and mouth disease remains a serious problem in a few areas and we continue to do all that is necessary to contain and eradicate it. But in most of England there is no case for wholesale closures. Keeping footpaths closed hurts the rural economy and prevents people enjoying the countryside. We have received strong representations in favour of our approach from those engaged in tourism and other rural businesses&#151;including farmers who have diversified their activities&#151;because of the extent to which their income has been devastated by the consequences of the outbreak. Revoking unnecessary closures now means the vast majority of our countryside will be open for the summer holidays and people will know where they can walk, cycle or ride.

<a name="10719w20.html_para24">Foreign veterinary assistance has been provided in two ways. Governments have loaned state veterinarians to the Department. Terms and conditions were agreed with the relevant authorities in each country prior to the vets travelling to GB. Their salaries continue to be paid by the authorities in their own country.
<P>

<a name="10719w20.html_para25">Other foreign vets have also been appointed as Temporary Veterinary Inspectors (TVIs). TVIs are paid a daily rate, which is claimed retrospectively. The necessary details to allow payment of moneys due is requested at the time of appointment.

<P>
<P>

 We have no plans to exempt horticulturalists from the abstraction licensing system. The draft Water Bill published last November proposed that trickle irrigation be brought into the licensing system. The system will be revised by a Water Bill when parliamentary time permits.




<P>
<P><I>19 Jul 2001 : Column: 396W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="10719w21.html_para0">However, it was proposed in the draft Water Bill that the standard threshold above which an abstraction licence is required should be raised to 20 cubic metres per day. The draft Bill also proposed that the Environment Agency should have the power to set different thresholds in specified areas. So horticulturalists will be exempt if they abstract less than the relevant threshold amount in any area.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10719w21.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 16 July 2001]:</i> Operational responsibility for flood defence rests with local operating authorities, such as the Environment Agency, and other bodies, such as the Highway's Agency insofar as highways are concerned. I understand that the Environment Agency has undertaken a pre-feasibility study of the flooding problems at Robertsbridge, including hydraulic modelling and investigation of suggestions that the bypass may have an impact. The Environment Agency's current view is that the bypass does not impede floodwaters and that there is no need to enlarge the culverts under the bypass.

 <i>[holding answer 16 July 2001]:</i> The Department has contingency arrangements for response to emergencies affecting its policy responsibilities. These are subject to annual review and report to Ministers. After an emergency or exercise, a lessons learned review is carried out and revisions implemented to arrangements where required. It has not been the practice to make individual plans public because of the inclusion of personal telephone numbers. However we have an overarching plan which sets out the principal requirements for departmental emergency response plans. This is currently being expanded to incorporate the responsibilities of the new Department and the lessons learned from recent emergencies. Once completed I will place a copy in the Library.

<P>
<a name="10719w21.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 I met representatives of the fishing industry immediately prior to the Fisheries Council on 18 June which discussed recovery plans. Industry representatives from the UK and other member states have attended a series of consultation meetings with the Commission as the stock recovery plans have been developed. The UK industry in particular has made a key contribution to this work. In view of the advice from the International Council for the Exploration of the Seas, the United Kingdom is fully convinced of the need to develop recovery programmes for North sea cod, west of Scotland cod, and Irish sea cod as well as for northern hake.

 <i>[holding answer 13 July 2001]:</i> I have made no such estimates. However estimates prepared by the Soil Association (in their Organic Food and Farming Report 2000) indicate that the farm gate value of UK organic produce was around &#163;67 million in 1999&#150;2000 and that the retail value of all organic produce sold in the UK in the same period was just over &#163;605 million.
<P>

<a name="10719w22.html_para0">We very much welcome the expansion of organic farming and we have done much to assist it. In particular, we have made substantial cash injections into the sector in aid for conversion to organic farming for which there is an ongoing commitment under the England Rural Development Programme. We do not favour setting arbitrary targets for the conversion of land to organic farming or for the producing of organic food.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills why the number of vacancies for <i>(a)</i> mathematics and <i>(b)</i> information technology teachers changed between 1997 and 2000.  [5370]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10719w22.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 The additional funding of &#163;350 per pupil in real terms that the Government provided for schools in England between 1997&#150;98 and 2000&#150;01 allowed more teaching posts to be created. Although the total number of teacher vacancies rose by 867 between January 1997 and January 2000, the number of full-time equivalent regular teachers also rose, by almost 5,500. Between January 2000 and January 2001, there was a further increase of over 5,500 in teacher numbers. Data on how many of these additional posts were in mathematics and information technology are not collected centrally.
<P>

<a name="10719w22.html_para1">Since January 2000, new Government funding for teacher training bursaries, Golden Hello incentives and the Graduate Teacher Programme have been introduced to encourage more new teachers into the profession, especially in secondary shortage subjects like mathematics and information technology.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10719w22.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 Between 1997&#150;98 and 2001&#150;01, funding per pupil rose in real terms by &#163;550 in London and the south-east. These extra resources allowed more teaching posts to be funded. The number of teacher vacancies in London and the south-east rose by 480 between January 1997 and January 2000. In the same period, the number of full-time equivalent regular teachers employed in the region rose by 2,168.

 In the financial year 1998&#150;99, grant-maintained (GM) schools in Surrey received recurrent funding from the former Funding Agency for 



<P>
<P><I>19 Jul 2001 : Column: 402W</I><P>
Schools (FAS) amounting on average to &#163;1,810 per pupil in the case of primary schools and &#163;2,410 per pupil in the case of secondary schools. For the financial year 2001&#150;02, the most closely comparable figures currently available in respect of these schools are &#163;2,060 per pupil and &#163;2,660 per pupil respectively. All figures have been calculated to the nearest &#163;10 on the basis of pupil numbers from the Annual Schools Census for January 1998 and January 2001.
<P>

<a name="10719w22.html_para2">The calculations for 1998&#150;99 are based on financial information supplied to the Department by FAS. The figures include annual maintenance grant together with special purpose grants for development, nursery education, premises insurance, primary support and the purchase of books, but not other special purpose grants or capital grants. Most GM schools' annual maintenance grant included an element to compensate the schools for their inability to reclaim VAT: appropriate adjustments have been made to reflect this.
<P>

<a name="10719w22.html_para3">The calculations for 2001&#150;02 are based on information from the budget statement published by the local education authority under section 52 of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998, supplemented and updated (in the case of specific grants) by information separately provided by the LEA. The figures include the schools' budget shares (including School Standards Grant and transitional funding); Standards Fund resources devolved to the schools (but excluding capital grants, and other grants relating to school security and the National Grid for Learning); and Infant Class Size grants devolved to schools otherwise than through their budget shares.
<P>

<a name="10719w22.html_para4">In 1998&#150;99, under arrangements specific to the GM sector, the GM schools received formula capital allocations from FAS amounting on average to &#163;46 per pupil (primary) and &#163;31 per pupil (secondary). Under the NDS devolved formula capital arrangements which apply to all schools, the Surrey ex-GM schools' allocations for 2001&#150;02 amount on average to &#163;37 per pupil (primary) and &#163;28 per pupil (secondary); all these figures are rounded to the nearest pound.
<P>

<a name="10719w22.html_para5">Blenheim School has been excluded from the calculations because its funding levels are significantly affected by the school's recent establishment. The calculations also exclude Nonsuch High School for Girls, which is situated in Surrey but maintained by the London Borough of Sutton.

<a name="10719w23.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 Since 1997 the percentage of children with statements of special educational need has increased from 2.9 per cent. in January 1997 to 3.1 per cent. in January 2001. This continues an increase from earlier years: for example, the proportion of statemented pupils was 2.6 per cent. in 1995. We believe that these increases reflect improved early identification measures, and improved procedures, in particular the introduction of the Special Educational Needs Code of Practice on the Identification and Assessment of Special Needs in 1994.

 <i>[holding answer 11 July 2001]:</i> The number of students enrolled in FE colleges and on further education provision in other institutions in 1999&#150;2000 was 4,274,000. This compares with a peak of 4,463,000 in 1996&#150;97, when inappropriate franchising arrangements, some of which gave rise to provision of dubious worth, had caused the participation figures to increase sharply and unsustainably. We are committed to increasing real participation in further education and we are providing real terms increases in further education funding to achieve this.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what plans she has to ensure that all documents that school governing bodies are required to consider are written in plain English.  [4774]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10719w24.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 All documents sent to governing bodies by the DfES, and the former DfEE, either bear the 'Crystal Mark' awarded by the Plain English Commission, or are produced to communication standards based on plain English principles. The Department has no direct control over the many communications for school governors prepared by local education authorities but has urged them to adopt the same principles and to keep such communications to a minimum.

 0.7 per cent. of half days were missed in English schools in 1999&#150;2000 as a result of unauthorised absence. Pupil absence data for England are collected by school year, and are published during the following autumn term by DfES in the National Pupil Absence Tables and in School Performance Tables.

<a name="10719w24.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 The professional code of practice is a matter for the General Teaching Council (GTC). Paragraph 5 relates to the way teachers support children in their care, by providing an environment of tolerance and respect that allows all children to flourish irrespective of their home circumstances. Children come from diverse backgrounds and it is important that teachers protect them from antisocial behaviour such as name calling or bullying. The GTC has published its current draft widely, sending it to all registered teachers and their responses, including those relating to paragraph 5, will be considered by the GTC's Council in due course.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10719w24.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 A local education exclusion officer has no powers to overrule an exclusion, whatever the circumstances. The officer's role is to give advice on the appropriateness of the exclusion. The LEA can make a statement to the school's Discipline Committee considering whether or not to uphold an exclusion, for example about how other schools in the authority have responded to similar incidents.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what her timetable is for extending free nursery places to all three-year-olds in <i>(a)</i> Staffordshire and <i>(b)</i> England.  [4983]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10719w24.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 Our commitment is to provide every three-year-old, whose parents want one, with a free nursery education place by September 2004. In March 2001, around 55 per cent. of three-year-olds in England had access to a free part-time nursery education place. We are currently on target to provide 66 per cent. of all three-year-olds with a free place by March 2002.
<P>

<a name="10719w24.html_para3">Staffordshire local education authority estimates that around 35 per cent. of three-year-olds have access to a free nursery education place in their area. The access to free nursery education is influenced by the level of provision that the local authority makes available in its own area, as well as the places funded directly by Government. The allocation made by Government, through the Nursery Education Grant, is made on the basis of social disadvantage.

 There have been no changes to the national funding arrangements for post-16 transport. My officials have not, therefore, had discussions with religious organisations. I understand that Northumberland LEA is considering changes to the support that it provides for transport locally and is consulting on these changes. It is for each LEA to determine the level of support that it makes in relation to local needs, and to have regard to parents' religious preferences.

 A range of quality assurance mechanisms is being used successfully by local authorities to raise standards. These include: Investors in People, Charter Mark and the Excellence Model. Some local authorities have also developed their own models. The revised LEA Code of Practice, which came into effect in February 2001, contains a non-statutory Annexe setting out the standards that local authorities should adhere to in their communications with schools.

 Yes. We shall shortly lay regulations (The Welfare Reform and Pensions (Persons Abroad: Benefits for Widows and Widowers) (Consequential Amendments) Regulations 2001) amending the 1975 Persons Abroad regulations that restore the long established arrangements in the Widows Benefit scheme. These changes come into effect from 20 August 2001. Until then the few cases arising where the current Bereavement Benefit rules are not as we intended them to be from the outset in April this year will be dealt with in line with our original intention and the expenditure will be met by an extra-statutory arrangement.

<a name="10719w27.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Nicholas Winterton: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions when the age limit on women in receipt of retirement state pension and able to claim invalid care allowance was reduced to 60 years; for what reasons this change was made; and if he will make a statement.  [4112]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10719w27.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. McCartney: </B> 
 From the introduction of Invalid Care Allowance in 1976 until 1994 the age limit for claiming the benefit was "pensionable age", which was 65 for men and 60 for women. On 28 October 1994 the maximum age at which Invalid Care Allowance could be claimed was changed from "pensionable age" to "age 65" in order to provide equality of treatment for both men and women. A woman can, therefore, claim Invalid Care Allowance between the ages of 60 and 65 while receiving State Retirement Pension.
<P>

<a name="10719w27.html_para4">Retirement Pension and Invalid Care Allowance are both intended to help maintain income to avoid duplicate provision; however, the payment of the pension may extinguish or reduce the payment of the Invalid Care Allowance. On 3 October 2000 we announced that carers aged 65 and over would also be allowed to claim Invalid Care Allowance and this will be introduced as soon as possible.

 In its conclusions of 22 January 2001, the EU General Affairs Council welcomed the free and fair conditions in which the legislative elections in Serbia in December 2000 had been held. Their outcome confirmed the determination of the people of Serbia to continue the consolidation of democracy in their country. It was decided that restrictive measures should therefore be confined to the former President of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Mr. Slobodan Milosevic, his family, and persons indicated by the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia.

 The Government's strategy of encouraging and supporting China's closer integration in the international system was endorsed by the Foreign Affairs Committee in its report of November 2000 (HC 574-I). We believe that the most effective way for helping to bring about long-term and positive change in China is through engagement. At the same time, we criticise China where necessary, including over its human rights record.

We also took account of the need for additional investment in the personal social services settlement for 2001&#150;02 to 2003&#150;04 to enable councils to contribute an appropriate share to the expansion and integration of these services.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what steps he is taking to ensure that the quality of prosthetic services available to patients in the UK are of at least an equal standard to those available in <i>(a)</i> the rest of Europe and <i>(b)</i> in North America.  [5364]<P>

<a name="10719w31.html_spnew3"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 Prosthetic services have moved from providing a "limb fitting service" to an "amputee rehabilitation service". Disablement service centres (DSCs) now treat users in a more holistic manner. This has resulted in the development of a whole package of care and has given more involvement to occupational therapists, physiotherapists and counsellors in the service. The United Kingdom is at the forefront of this multi-professional approach.

<a name="10719w31.html_para4">Many DSCs prescribe state of the art components. The UK was the first country in the world to develop and

<P><I>19 Jul 2001 : Column: 433W</I><P>
adopt an intelligent prosthesis. Another important feature of the UK service is that product prescription is impartial, based on clinical need, whereas in some countries commercial considerations are taken into account.
<P>

<a name="10719w31.html_para5">The delivery of prosthetic services around the world is far more fragmented than in the UK. For example England delivers prosthetic services from 33 DSCs which means that the service benefits from the concentration of expertise and economies of scale.
<P>

<a name="10719w31.html_para6">The UK prosthetic service is well structured, provides good value for money and delivers a coherent service.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will list the PFI contracts entered into since 1997, indicating <i>(a)</i> the value of the PFI, <i>(b)</i> the name of the successful contractor, <i>(c)</i> those PFIs which have benefited from refinancing arrangements, <i>(d)</i> the value of the benefit accrued to the company concerned and <i>(e)</i> the extent of the clawback.

 There follows a list of major private finance initiatives contracts which have been signed since May 1997; the capital value of the contract; and the names of the leading contractors and facilities management firms who make up the successful consortia.

 The Department reviews all private finance initiative projects over &#163;1 million in value through the Business Case approval system. To be approved, the Business Case must clearly demonstrate that, overall, the private finance option is better value for money when compared to the publicly funded alternative, the Public Sector Comparator, and that it provides improved facilities for the national health service. NHS trusts are required to monitor performance throughout the lifetime of the PFI contract.

<a name="10719w32.html_para1">NSFs which have already been published are: Mental Health NSF, September 1999; Coronary Heart Disease NSF, March 2000; and Older People NSF, March 2001.
<P>

<a name="10719w32.html_para2">The next NSF due to be published in 2001 is the Diabetes NSF. We have announced further NSFs on Renal Services, Children's Services, and Long Term Conditions.
<P>

<a name="10719w32.html_para3">CHI will publish details of the broad scope and timing of each review once this has been agreed.
<P>

<a name="10719w32.html_para4">CHI and the Audit Commission have already undertaken a review of the implementation of the Calman-Hine/Cameron reports on commissioning cancer services in England and Wales. The report is expected in the autumn.
<P>

<a name="10719w32.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Burstow: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health what assessment his Department has made of the implications of the National Service Framework for Older People set out in paragraph 29, page 141 of the NSF; and what plans his Department has to analyse the impact of them.  [4873]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10719w32.html_spnew4"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 A general assessment of implications for wider areas of education and training was provided within the National Service Framework (NSF) for Older People. A more detailed assessment and analysis to ensure achievement of the NSF milestones will be undertaken nationally by the National Workforce Development Board, informed by the Care Group Workforce Team for older people to be established shortly, and working with education and training bodies. Regional directors of workforce development and local workforce development confederations working with local education and training organisations will play a local role.

 <i>[holding answer 18 July 2001]:</i> The controls assurance framework requires all national health service trusts to identify the risks associated with the safe and secure handling of medicines and develop and implement procedures to ensure the minimisation of risk. These procedures would cover drugs which would be hazardous if given by the wrong route, for example, injected intrathecally rather than intravenously.

 The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) has recently received an application for research from the Centre for Genome Research in Edinburgh. I understand that this centre has an established research team which has already held licences for embryo and stem cell research.
<P>

<a name="10719w33.html_para0">The application proposes to establish stem cell lines from spare embryos, with a view to depositing the resulting cells in the Medical Research Council stem cell bank, to improve understanding of the growth and survival of pre-implantation human embryos, thereby benefiting in-vitro fertilisation treatment programmes. The proposed programme will also examine the potential for cell replacement and tissue repair therapies for a range of serious diseases.
<P>

<a name="10719w33.html_para1">Embryo research in the United Kingdom is subject to the most comprehensive regulation. As with all applications for research involving embryos, this application will be subject to detailed consideration by the HFEA to ensure that it meets the strict requirements of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990. Before deciding on the application, the HFEA requires full details of the project and Research Ethics Committee approval. The application must also explain the project's objectives, protocols and why the use of embryos is necessary for the research.
<P>

<a name="10719w33.html_para2">This application will require specific justification for the extraction of stem cells and will be subject to peer review on its merits. It will also require details of patient information and consent forms specifying the purpose of the research and all possible uses of the cells lines derived from it. If approved, the project will be closely monitored by the HFEA to ensure that it continues to meet the conditions laid down by the 1990 Act and any conditions imposed by the authority.

The NHS Purchasing and Supply Agency monitors the performance of the contracts that it awards by holding regular meetings with the NHS trusts and the agencies involved to monitor whether the NHS is receiving value for money. The NHS Purchasing and Supply Agency inserts a clause in these contracts that allows it to carry out an audit of the contracted agencies.

 As at 31 March 2000 (the latest date for which data are available), an average of 8.5 per cent. of people in England aged 65 years and over were in receipt of community-based social services provided or commissioned by local authorities.
<P>

<a name="10719w34.html_para3">In 1999&#150;2000, the latest year for which information is available, it is estimated that 21 per cent. of people aged 65 and over were receiving care from the district nursing service, 2 per cent. from health visitors and 2 per cent. from the community psychiatric nursing service. Contact with the community learning disability service for this age group was negligible. We do not hold data centrally on the proportion of people aged 65 and over who receive primary care-based services.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department when he expects to announce a timetable for implementation of the Freedom of Information Act 2000.  [5088]
<P>
<UL><P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10719w35.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Wills: </B> 
 The Freedom of Information Act received Royal Assent on the 30 November 2000 and so has to be fully implemented by 30 November 2005. However, the Government are firmly committed to implementation of the Act before this deadline which we set for ourselves.
<P>

<a name="10719w35.html_para5">As of yet, there is no timetable for implementation within this deadline but the Lord Chancellor will be under a statutory duty to report to Parliament on progress towards implementation by 30 November this year. Before a timetable for implementation of the Act can be announced, there are consultations which need to be completed with the Information Commissioner, most notably with regard to the work needing to be done on publication schemes.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10719w35.html_wqn7"><B> Tony Wright: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department (1) how many bodies subject to the open government code of practice have indicated that they could not fully implement the Freedom of Information Act 2000 by July 2002;  [5086]
<P>
<UL>(2) if the Information Commissioner has indicated that she would be unable to discharge her responsibilities under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 in relation to bodies subject to the open government code of practice by July 2002.  [5087]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10719w35.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Wills: </B> 
 It is not a question of bodies or the Information Commissioner expressing doubts as to meeting any particular date for implementation, but simply that no one can be certain, as yet, as to when all of the preparatory work towards implementation of the Act will be completed.
<P>

<a name="10719w35.html_para6">My officials are currently in consultation with the Information Commissioner and public authorities, including the several hundred currently covered by the code of practice on access to Government information, in order to determine how soon it is practicable for them to be able to implement the Freedom of Information Act 2000.
<P>

<a name="10719w35.html_para7">One of the major issues which has to be resolved before a definitive date for implementation of the Act can be set is the obligation on all public authorities to produce and maintain a publication scheme setting out what information they are proactively making available.
<P>

<a name="10719w35.html_para8">Before public authorities can make a definitive judgment as to when they can have their publication schemes ready, and hence when the Information Commissioner will be able to devise a timeframe for approval of the schemes, the Commissioner has to decide what she expects from the content of the schemes. To this end, the Commissioner arranged a conference, held in Manchester on 17 July 2001, to discuss the content and format of publication schemes.
<P>

<a name="10719w35.html_para9">In addition there are five bodies taking part in a pilot publication scheme programme in conjunction with the Commissioner, as she announced on the 16 July 2001. 



<P>
<P><I>19 Jul 2001 : Column: 450W</I><P>
These bodies are the Ministry of Defence, the Department for International Development, the Health and Safety Executive, the Medicines Control Agency and the Public Record Office. The pilot programme should be completed by the end of this year.

<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="10719w35.html_para17">The provisions set out in section 87(2) of the Act came into force on 30 January 2001. These relate primarily to the creation of the post of the Information Commissioner.
<P>

<a name="10719w35.html_para18">Certain provisions relating to the amendment of the Data Protection Act, as provided for by the Freedom of Information Act 2000, were brought into force on 14 May by a Commencement Order in Statutory Instrument 2001 No. 1637, made on 30 April 2001.
<P>

<a name="10719w35.html_para19">All other provisions of the Act are not yet in force. The Act must be fully implemented by 30 November 2005 and, as yet, there is no other timetable than this outer date. However, the Government are committed to bringing the Act into force before this deadline and to ensuring that the time taken to ensure that implementation is a success will be used well.
<P>

<a name="10719w35.html_para20">Some powers contained in the Act will need to be exercised before the Act comes into force, for example the Codes of Practice to be made under sections 45 and 46 of the Act will need to be agreed.
<P>

<a name="10719w35.html_para21">Others, such as the ability to amend Schedule 1, contained in section 4, or the ability to amend or repeal statutory bars to disclosure, contained in section 75, are on-going processes. These will have to be exercised regularly when, for example, new non-departmental public bodies are created, or decisions are taken that specified statutory bars could be amended or repealed.
<P>

<a name="10719w35.html_para22">Powers, such as that to provide for environmental information regulations in relation to the Aarhus Convention, contained in section 74, will only need to be exercised once or very infrequently.
<P>

<a name="10719w35.html_para23">Discussions are under way on the terms of those Orders or regulations which need to be made before the Act can be fully implemented. Drafts of the two Codes of Practice have been circulated for public consultation.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10719w36.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Wills: </B> 
 The Government have submitted to Parliament an Explanatory Memorandum in response to the European Commission's working document, "Mutual Recognition of Decisions on Parental Responsibility". This was deposited on 20 June and copies of it have been placed in the House of Commons Library. It did not contain a substantive response on issues of policy because the Commission's document did not seek views, and the Commission intends to propose a draft Regulation on this subject in early September. The Government will submit an Explanatory Memorandum on this proposal in the autumn; this will deal with the policy issues raised in that proposal, although a final view on these will only be taken after proper consultation with the judiciary and legal practitioners.

<P>
<a name="10719w36.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Wills: </B> 
 I am pleased to announce the publication of "Towards Effective Enforcement", a Green Paper on the structure and regulation of enforcement and a single piece of bailiff law. It explores options for the regulation of all enforcement agents.
<P>

<a name="10719w36.html_para0">The paper discusses what legal powers are needed to allow agents to do the job properly and proposes principles for the fees for enforcement and costs of regulation. It also examines the possibilities of improving access to information and making better use of information through clear, precise and limited powers.
<P>

<a name="10719w36.html_para1">The primary purpose of the Green Paper is to look at how best to achieve a fundamental improvement in warrant enforcement by opening up to public consultation a range of options and ideas for the future regulation of enforcement agents in England and Wales. Copies have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses.
<P>

<a name="10719w36.html_para2">A White Paper will be published in early 2002 setting out proposals for legislation in the light of this public consultation. It will also cover revised procedures for attachment of earnings, garnishee orders and charging orders arising from Phase One of the Review. At that stage it ought to be possible to develop a practical structure for warrant enforcement service delivery.

<a name="10719w37.html_wqn0"><B> Geraint Davies: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister if he will make a statement on the performance of the main Departments and agencies against the six service standards for central Government over the last financial year.  [6177]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10719w37.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Leslie: </B> 
 I have arranged for a report on the performance of the main Departments and agencies to be placed in the Libraries of the House.
<P>

<a name="10719w37.html_para0">In most cases, Departments' performance in responding to correspondence from the public has continued to improve and there have been some particularly encouraging performances leading to a considerable narrowing in the range of performance. In particular, for the first time, all Departments and agencies have answered at least 70 per cent. of correspondence within their published target. But there is no room for complacency, which is why we have introduced targets for improvements in most Departments' Service Delivery Agreements. The performance of the main Departments and agencies is summarised in the table.
<P>

<a name="10719w37.html_para1">Against the other standards, the report shows that performance and standards are generally in line with public expectations. Visitors to public offices are usually seen within 10 minutes of their appointment, and most visitors without an appointment are seen within the designated standards. All Departments have at least one telephone inquiry point, and calls are usually answered promptly. Use of the internet is increasing rapidly and all the main Departments dealing with the public have websites, publicise their complaints procedure on-line and are able to accept e-mailed inquiries. The report also shows some of the innovative ways in which Departments and agencies are consulting their users and making their services more responsive to users' needs.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10719w37.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Leslie: </B> 
 No such representations have been made directly to the Deputy Prime Minister; earlier representations about practice in conducting written consultations, especially the time allowed for responses, led to the publication in November 2000 of the Code of Practice on written consultation. The Code sets out minimum standards for consultation documents, and more generally promotes techniques of effective public involvement. It applies to all public national consultation documents issued from 1 January 2001. In response to views expressed during the passing of the Regulatory Reform Act 2001, supplementary guidance has also been issued to Departments by the Cabinet Office in respect of consultation documents under the Act.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10719w37.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Leslie: </B> 
 The provisions regulating the rights of servants of the Crown to become candidates at elections are set out in the Servants of the Crown (Parliamentary, European Parliamentary and Northern Ireland Assembly Candidature) Order 1987. This Order, as amended by the Servants of the Crown (Parliamentary, European Parliamentary and Northern Ireland Assembly Candidature) Order 1999, specifies that the servants of the Crown to whom it applies must not issue an address to electors or in any other manner publicly announce themselves or allow themselves to be publicly announced as candidates or prospective candidates for election to Parliament. There are no plans to review these provisions.

<P>
<a name="10719w37.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Leslie: </B> 
 This Government have reduced the number of quangos (or non-departmental public bodies to use the official classification) by around 10 per cent. since 1997. This means that numbers now stand at their lowest level for over 20 years. Individual NDPBs are subject to regular review and we continue to work hard to ensure that the overall number of quangos is kept to a minimum.

<P>
<a name="10719w37.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Leslie: </B> 
 All Government Departments and agencies are required to produce a regulatory impact assessment (RIA) for proposed regulations that could impact on business, charities or the voluntary sector.
<P>

<a name="10719w37.html_para2">An RIA may not be required in certain, strictly defined, circumstances. For example, where the proposal imposes no or negligible additional costs or savings; or where statutory fees are increased by a predetermined formula, such as the rate of inflation. Departments must be

 I assume my hon. Friend is referring to the British-Irish Council, which brings together the British and Irish Governments, the devolved Administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, and the authorities in Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man.
<P>

<a name="10719w38.html_para0">At their meeting in London in October 2000, Environment Ministers of the British-Irish Council agreed that the environment was of vital importance to all of their Administrations.

[4401]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10719w38.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Leslie: </B> 
 The work of individual special advisers will vary from Department to Department according to the relevant Ministers' requirements. Section (iv) of Schedule 1 to Part 1 of the current model contract for special advisers describes the duties special advisers may be required to undertake. These include for example checking facts and research findings, such as information provided by officials costing policy options.
