<a name="11026w01.html_para0">The contractor has had to carry out a number of tasks during the defects period. After the original contractor for the courtyard stone (which included the water feature) went into liquidation, there was some delay to the work but during the summer the inadequate chemical dosing pumps were replaced and the spread of algae has been stopped. A leak in the tank under the stone table is now awaiting repair. Discussions are taking place with the company that has taken over the business to arrange for all the outstanding snags to be put right under the terms of the contract.

<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what measures he has put in place to protect his Department's and armed services personnel from mail that may be contaminated with chemical or biological weapons.  [10601]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11026w02.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 In common with other Government Departments, the Ministry of Defence has for many years had guidance in place on how to recognise and deal with suspect letters and parcels containing explosive devices. In the wake of current events in the United States, the Cabinet Office has prepared additional guidance on the handling of suspect CB-contaminated mail. This guidance has been widely disseminated within MOD to civilian and service personnel. The potential threat, and the guidance and other precautionary measures required, are being kept under constant review, and full account is being taken of the developing situation in the United States.

<P>
<a name="11026w02.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Jenkin: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what the fully trained and operational requirement is for <i>(a)</i> RAF pilots to fly Sea Harriers and <i>(b)</i> Fleet Air Arm pilots to fly Harrier GR7; and how many there are at present in each case.  [10598]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11026w02.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Joint Force Harrier (JFH) operates Harrier GR7 flown by RAF pilots and Sea Harrier FA2 flown by RN pilots. GR7 is a ground attack aircraft, whereas FA2 is predominantly air defence. Each complements the other so that JFH has a rounded operational capability. Both RN and RAF aircrew are capable of operating from aircraft carriers in their own aircraft type, and both work closely together when embarked in carriers and when ashore. There is, though, no operational requirement for pilots of one Harrier aircraft type to fly the other. If there was a requirement for GR7 pilots to fly the FA2 or vice versa this could be achieved once operational conversion training had been completed. However, there exists an RAF/RN-wide pilot exchange programme which shares operational experience by providing flying tours with the other service. On this programme, currently there are <i>(a)</i> two RAF pilots flying the Sea Harrier, both from the Tornado F3, and <i>(b)</i> one RN (but non-Sea Harrier) pilot training to fly the Tornado GR4.

provision of &#163;4,033 million for the logistic support of the armed forces.

We would expect the DLO expenditure to be within the Estimates provision at the year end.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11026w02.html_spnew4"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 As at 31 August, 4,111 awards of disablement pension had been made to Gulf War Veterans, although of these, only 1,038 were awarded for Gulf-related illnesses.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence, pursuant to his answer of 22 October 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 4W, on the Apache helicopter programme, <i>(a)</i> how many personnel are being trained in the US, <i>(b)</i> what training is being provided and <i>(c)</i> what the cost is to the defence budget.  [10483]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11026w02.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Sixteen army helicopter pilots are undergoing what is known as conversion training in the US at a cost of &#163;3.15 million. This training, including the use of simulators, will qualify them to fly the US Apache AH-64A model; they will then undertake a short conversion in the UK to the UK's Apache AH Mk1 model. The cost of this US training is being met from liquidated damages the Department has received from its training contractor and from existing funds that would otherwise have been paid to that contractor for training courses which it cannot yet produce (as a result of the delay to the Full Mission Simulator).

 The Army's light-armoured vehicle capability will be provided within the Future Rapid Effects System (FRES). The exact components of FRES have yet to be decided, but it is likely to include such platforms as an armoured personnel carrier, guided weapons platform, command vehicle, reconnaissance platform, ambulance and repair and recovery vehicle. FRES will draw heavily on a number of technologies developed through the TRACER programme.

<a name="11026w03.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 Combined heat and power continues to play an important role in the UK's climate change programme. The UK's current installed CHP capacity of around 4,700 MWe is estimated to save around 4 million tonnes of carbon equivalent (MtC) per year. The carbon savings from increased use of CHP are reflected within those for a range of other policies within the programme, particularly the climate change levy, climate change agreements and community heating.

 We support the development of short rotation coppice and miscanthus for energy production through the Energy Crops Scheme. This is one of the integrated set of measures in the England Rural Development Programme and the scheme makes &#163;29 million of funding available to farmers over seven years. In addition we promote the use of forest material, for example through planting grants under the Woodland Grant Scheme and the Farm Woodland Premium Scheme, and woodland maintenance grants under the WGS. Market opportunities are key to future uptake and we are working closely with Government Departments and other bodies to develop power generation, combined heat and power and heat markets in order to increase the use of biomass.

The Energy Efficiency Best Practice programme offers best practice advice and support to organisations in the private and public sectors, in turn helping them to reduce their electricity consumption.
<P>

<a name="11026w03.html_para11">Combined heat and power is one example of a high energy efficiency technology which almost doubles the overall efficiency of fuel utilisation and can help business reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions.

The Carbon Trust will develop programmes to support new and emerging low-carbon technologies. It will also take on management of the Government's Energy Efficiency Best Practice programme and the Enhanced Capital Allowance scheme that provides a fiscal incentive to businesses to improve energy efficiency.

<a name="11026w04.html_para13">The Government published their strategy for more sustainable construction, "Building a Better Quality of Life", in April 2000. Last week we published a review of progress 'Building a better quality of life&#151;a strategy for more sustainable construction: Report on Progress 20001', which is available on the DTI website at www.dti.gov.uk/ construction/sustain/sustainableconstruction.htm
<P>

<a name="11026w04.html_para14">One of the priorities identified in the strategy is the need to minimise the impact on the consumption of natural resources through the reduction in waste. The re-use and recycling of waste, often as building materials, is encouraged through a number of economic instruments such as the landfill tax, the forthcoming aggregates levy and the climate change levy. These measures promote the use of reconstituted building materials in construction by encouraging the minimisation of waste going to landfill and reducing the demand for primary aggregates.
<P>

<a name="11026w04.html_para15">My Department also commissions research&#151;much of it in collaboration with the industry&#151;into the re-use and recycling of waste materials in construction.

<a name="11026w04.html_para16">A survey of chicken on retail sale in the United Kingdom conducted this year on behalf of the Food Standards Agency (FSA) found 50 per cent. of retailed chickens were positive for campylobacter. Preliminary results of the survey can be found on the FSA's website (www.foodstandards.gov.uk/news/chicken.htm). The identification of the campylobacter serotypes will not be complete until spring 2002.

<a name="11026w05.html_para0">Food products from the European Union, which are freely distributed within the Community, are not subject to any special checks within the United Kingdom. Foods imported from the EU are subject to the same controls and enforcement activity as UK produced food. Where problems are known, checks can be made on EU goods in transit (including at the border) and at destination. Where foods produced within the EU are found to be in breach of EU law, the Community and "competent authority" in the producer's member state is informed via the rapid alert or single liaison arrangements of the Official Control of Foodstuffs Additional Measures Directive (93/99/EEC).

<a name="11026w05.html_para3">In addition, while Structural Funds are not allocated on the basis of deprivation, eligibility for the urban strand of Objective 2 of the European Structural Funds in 2000&#150;06 was in part designated using the 1998 Index of Local Deprivation (the predecessor of the 2000 IMD). Areas eligible for the Structural Funds used this index as one of a series of indicators (e.g. unemployment rate, industrial decline, etc) in designating Objective 2 status. Also within the Structural Fund Programmes, the IMD was used to target resources to meet the needs of the most needy communities in urban and rural area.
<P>

<a name="11026w05.html_para4">Some DTI programmes take account of factors which are associated with deprivation: for example, the Regional Innovation Fund of &#163;54 million allocated to RDAs in 2001&#150;02 took account of unemployment, GDP and R&D spending.
<P>

<a name="11026w05.html_para5">From April 2002, the RDAs will be funded through a single pot, which will take account of the IMD as well as related factors such as labour market indicators. The figure shown here for 2002&#150;03 is for the roughly 28 per cent. of the &#163;2,550 million single pot which depends directly on the IMD.

 The Liberalisation of Trade in Services Committee, a committee of International Financial Services, London (an independent member-based organisation funded by UK-based financial and related services firms), was established in 1982 as a means for the Government to consult the private sector on international trade in services. Over the past 12 months the committee has met twice at chairman/CEO level and four times at working level. Officials from the Treasury, DTI and FCO have attended as observers. Members of the Committee, one of several private sector bodies that have made representations to my Department calling for liberalisation in this area, also met my noble Friend the Minister for Trade and Investment in early September.

 There is no separate finance for national health service patients travelling to European Union countries for treatment. The E112 scheme allows NHS patients to travel abroad specifically to receive treatment in European Economic Area countries on the same conditions as the host country's own insured people, subject to a prior authorisation regime. There were 1,100 such authorisations in 2000. There is no set annual budget for this scheme.

<P>
<P><I>26 Oct 2001 : Column: 425W</I><P>
1996 the company has recovered those costs, and other costs, through access charges paid by passenger train operating companies (TOCs) and freight operating companies (FOCs). So, although no grant was paid direct to the company between 1996&#150;97 and 2000&#150;01, the company's profitability in those years was contingent on public money. Some 90 per cent. of its income is paid to it in access charges by TOCs and FOCs, most of which are supported by public money.

 We announced on 21 March 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 250W, our intention to abolish the present system of local authority capital controls. The new system will permit authorities to borrow without prior Government approval. Each authority will decide how much to borrow, taking account of the revenue resources it can afford to make available to service debt, and acting in accordance with a professional code being developed by the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy. This increased flexibility to invest in their communities will allow authorities to deliver better value for money over the whole range of services, including housing. There is no proposal to remove the present prohibition on the mortgaging of local authority capital assets. The potential seizure of the property by a creditor would threaten the delivery of essential services. Loans are secured on all the revenues of the authority and that will remain the position. Legislation will be introduced as soon as parliamentary time allows.

 According to the US Committee for Refugees, there were approximately 465,000 Sudanese refugees or asylum seekers at the end of 2000. Approximately 200,000 Sudanese refugees were recorded in Uganda, 70,000 in Ethiopia, 70,000 in the Democratic Republic of Congo, 55,000 in Kenya, 35,000 in Central African Republic, 20,000 in Chad, and some 12,000 in Egypt.

 Many British and other NGOs are performing outstanding humanitarian work in Sudan with strong political and financial support from HMG. We work closely with Operation Lifeline Sudan, North and South, and with the UN, ICRC and NGOs over access for humanitarian operations in Sudan. We regularly urge the Government of Sudan to stop denying access for humanitarian operations. We urge both the Government and the SPLM to improve the conditions within which humanitarian organisations work. We also aim to expand their access by visiting areas not usually accessible. For example our Ambassador in Khartoum visited Blue Nile state last month, the first diplomat to do so for some three years. Local UNICEF representatives said that his visit would help them gain access and establish a new office in that state.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11026w10.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 We regularly discuss freedom of religion with the Government of Sudan and lobby on individual cases of abuses. Sharia law is by and large not imposed on mainly Christian areas such as south Sudan, although there are federal laws which infringe on religious freedom (eg Islamic banking system). The situation is worse for Christians in predominantly Muslim areas, such as around Khartoum, where they face implementation of Islamic punishments. We have maintained strong pressure on the Government of Sudan to change their policies in this respect and there has been limited progress over the last year and a half. We are also actively promoting inter-religious dialogue between religious leaders in Sudan and the UK.

 "The Informal Economy&#151;A Report by Lord Grabiner QC" (published March 2000), proposed that we test the use of advertising as a tool for changing public attitudes towards benefit fraud. We responded by piloting the Targeting Fraud advertising campaign in the north-west. Expenditure on this was &#163;2.2 million spanning the financial years 1999&#150;2000 and 2000&#150;01. The success of the pilot campaign led to the launch of the national Targeting Fraud campaign.

 People already claiming Incapacity Benefit in a Jobcentre Plus or work focused interview area are unaffected by the regulations. The only people to be affected are those making new or repeat claims. In these cases, people eligible for the New Deal for Disabled People (NDDP) will normally be given information about NDDP and details of local Job Brokers at their work focused interview. If they wish to take part in NDDP further support will be provided by their chosen Job Broker.

 Customs and Excise Law Enforcement comprises a Detection function of over 3,000 officers, an Investigation function of just under 2,000 officers and an Intelligence function of more than 1,000 officers. These officers are located at ports, airports, inland locations and in flexible national teams which can be deployed to any location. In addition there are just over 1,500 officers employed on the control of imported/exported goods covering all major ports and airports. Customs constantly review resource deployment in the light of risk and results. It is not Customs policy to identify actual staffing resources at individual locations as this may assist criminals in identifying Customs' operational methods and would enable them to bypass Customs' controls.

 This information is not readily available. Moreover, coverage of the block grant arrangements has changed over the period since 1979, which makes comparisons over this period difficult. However, information on Scottish public expenditure back to 1995&#150;96 was published in Chapter 8 of Public Expenditure Statistical Analyses in April 2001.

<a name="11026w14.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The establishment of the Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) has long been recognised as a complex and challenging project. This was acknowledged in the report of the Home Affairs Committee published on 28 March, which also perceived that the crucial consideration should be to ensure that the service that the CRB will provide is both robust and effective, rather than aim for a particular date to begin operating.

<a name="11026w14.html_para3">The registration process began on 1 May. The target date for commencing the issue of Standard and Enhanced Disclosures has been kept under review as the project has progressed. Latterly, the target date was November. But, in the light of an independent review, it has been decided to add two further stages prior to the commencement of live operations. These will enable the CRB's disclosure service to be rigorously tested in a simulated operational environment, in order to provide added confidence in the bureau's state of preparedness to begin delivering a high standard of service.

 This Government have increased total spending on education in the UK by over &#163;12 billion (33 per cent.) since taking office. Of the amounts which are relevant to schools and colleges 79 per cent. of the total expenditure is currently devolved to schools and colleges in England. The figures for other countries are a matter for the devolved Administrations.

<P>
<a name="11026w16.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Timms </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 23 October 2001]:</i> The White Paper: "Schools: achieving success" sets out our commitment to physical education and school sport. We have pledged that all children will be entitled to two hours of high quality PE and school sport, within and beyond the curriculum. To help deliver this, we have 333 School Sport Co-ordinators (of a total of 1,000) in place who are working to increase the quality and quantity of after-school sport and inter-school competition in their areas and to enhance links between the schools and their communities. &#163;150 million has been committed to rebuild primary school sports and arts facilities, and a further &#163;581 million will be used to improve both primary and secondary schools sports facilities in every local education authority.
<P>

<a name="11026w16.html_para1">Sport is the most popular after-school activity among pupils at Key Stages 2 and 3 (over a third of pupils involved at KS2, a quarter at KS3), and the second most frequent at Key Stage 4. &#163;160 million is available through the New Opportunities Fund and nearly &#163;70 million through the Standards Fund this year for study support projects, with a further &#163;75 million available in 2002&#150;03.
<P>

<a name="11026w16.html_para2">We are looking at ways in which we can build on these initiatives to increase the support we give to PE and school sport within and outside the curriculum.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills if she will make a statement on the discussions that have taken place between Department officials, Surrey county council and Blenheim high school in Epsom about funding the future expansion of the school.  [8830]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11026w16.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 Following the decision to end grant maintained status, and after consultation with external partners, transitional regulations were put in place to fund capital work at grant maintained schools where obligations had been entered into or decisions taken by the Funding Agency for Schools or the Secretary of State before 1 September 1999. These transitional regulations enabled the Department to meet outstanding commitments for capital funding approved before this date.
<P>

<a name="11026w16.html_para3">Officials visited Blenheim high school in Epsom with a representative from Surrey local education authority on 1 August 2001. It was agreed that any shortfall in accommodation needed to implement the proposals published by the Funding Agency for Schools for the establishment of the school could be funded under the transitional regulations. Surrey local education authority has now provided details of its view of the shortfall and a proposal to address this. The proposal is currently being considered by the Department.
<P>

<a name="11026w16.html_para4">In addition to the possible shortfall in funding by the Funding Agency for Schools, proposed further future expansion of the school is the subject of an application for additional places made by Surrey local education authority in the current schools capital allocation round. Decisions will be announced by the Department in December 2001.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11026w16.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 Approximately 800,000 pupils in England receive free transport to and from school every day; that is virtually 100 per cent. take up by those entitled. This is provided by local education authorities either contracting dedicated school buses, or by providing pupils with travel passes that enable them to use scheduled public transport.
<P>

<a name="11026w16.html_para5">Free transport is always necessary for a pupil of compulsory school age who attends the nearest suitable school if it is beyond statutory walking distance. Statutory walking distances are two miles for pupils aged under eight and three miles for those aged eight and over. LEAs may help in other cases if they wish, but it is for each authority to decide whether or not to do so.
<P>

<a name="11026w16.html_para6">These arrangements have been in place for many years and we have no plans to change them.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11026w16.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 We very much recognise the benefit of counselling for pupils facing specific difficulties, although we have not issued guidance to head teachers and governors on the provision of counselling services in schools. Schools can contact their local education authority for information about local services.
<P>

<a name="11026w16.html_para7">The Department's latest guidance on mental health mentioned school-based counselling, and highlighting the importance of pupils' emotional well-being is a key aspect of the national healthy school standard. In addition, learning mentors and Connexions personal advisers in schools look at young people's concerns, work with them to identify solutions, and where necessary access specialist help to allow them to overcome barriers to learning.
<P>

<a name="11026w16.html_para8">We recognise that recent international events may have caused pupils to become anxious or frightened. We are currently finalising new guidance which will advise schools to look for signs of stress or unease in children and, where appropriate, arrange counselling with a suitably qualified person.

<P>
<a name="11026w17.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 Our independent/state school partnerships programme promotes collaborative working between the independent and maintained school sectors. Over 150 projects, involving over 500 schools and 50,000 pupils, have received a total of &#163;3 million since 1998. Each project is different and individual projects have covered most areas of the curriculum and included a wide range of different schools. Some projects encourage schools to share facilities. An external evaluation of the programme by Leeds University school of education in 1999 found that it was achieving its objectives and contributing to raising standards in a cost-effective way.

 <i>[holding answer 19 October 2001]:</i> The Department has no record of any special school notifying it that they are under immediate threat of closure.
<P>

<a name="11026w18.html_para0">Under arrangements introduced in the School Standards and Framework Act 1998, decisions on statutory proposals for the reorganisation of special schools are now a matter for each local education authority's school organisation committee. However, the Department often does receive representations from schools, parents and others when local education authorities are considering special school reorganisations.

 In January 2001, local authorities reported that there were 4,980 vacancies for full-time teachers in the maintained schools sector in England.
<P>

<a name="11026w18.html_para1">Responses to a sample survey of schools conducted by my Department in September 2001 indicated that there were about 2,000 vacancies in maintained nursery, primary and secondary schools in England, the comparable January figure was 4,700.

 Lord Moser's 1999 report, "A Fresh Start", notes that perhaps as many as 7 million people (roughly one in five adults) in England have difficulties with functional literacy and numeracy. These adults have a wide range of needs, varying from those who cannot read and write or perform the simplest calculations, to those who simply need to brush up rusty skills. We are commissioning a new survey next year to provide an up-to-date assessment of the scale of basic skills need in England.
<P>

<a name="11026w19.html_para0">The Government have recognised the vital importance to individuals and the economy of improving adult basic skills. The national strategy for improving adult literacy and numeracy skills, "Skills for Life", was launched in March this year by the Prime Minister. Our target is to improve the literacy and numeracy skills of 750,000 adults by 2004.
