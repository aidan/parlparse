 The new Supervisory Care Policy for Defence Individual Training Establishments was published as a Defence Information Notice in March 2006 (2006DIN06-049). The policy mandates the determination of a Supervisory Care Directive, underpinned by a Unit Commander's Risk Assessment. The Supervisory Care Directive clearly articulates a Unit Commander's commitment to the care of trainees. It highlights areas where detailed care responsibilities are required, and cross-refers to other policies where appropriate. The Unit Commander's Risk Assessment takes account of the particular factors of the environment, the trainee population and the type of training being undertaken at each training establishment. The new policy mandates that minimum levels of supervision are determined from the Unit Commander's Risk Assessment and must be articulated against the relevant serials during the working day, out of hours, weekend and leave periods. Implementation of the new Supervisory Care Policy is subject to evaluation by the MOD HQ Defence Individual Training Capability (DITC) team in order to establish whether relevant policies have been correctly interpreted and successfully implemented.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_426"><a name="60627w0004.htm_para3"><a name="06062748000091">In addition to the RTFO the Chancellor has announced that, subject to European Union State Aid approval, the Government will introduce a 100 per cent. first year capital allowance for the cleanest biofuels production facilities. This should help support innovation and help develop the lowest-carbon biofuels production methods.</p>

 It is for individual harbour authorities to determine whether they require a Harbour Revision Order (HRO) to gain powers to conduct operations within their harbours. We have received no applications for an HRO from an English or Welsh harbour authority specifically to enable ship to ship transfers of oil or other chemicals. In the case of harbours in Scotland applications would be made to the Scottish Executive.</p>

 On the basis of four months' experience of compulsory helmet wearing in 1973, it was estimated that around 200 fatal and serious casualties would be saved per annum. Because helmet wearing is now so long established in the UK, it is no longer possible to calculate further effects on road safety: there is no non-helmet wearing group with which to compare.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_427"><a name="60627w0004.htm_para4"><a name="06062748000096">However, US researchers are able to compare helmeted and unhelmeted riders as some states do not have helmet laws. Comparisons have concluded that the use of a safety helmet is the single critical factor in the prevention and reduction of head injury, with unhelmeted riders being 2.4 times as likely to sustain head injuries as helmeted riders.</p>

<p><a name="st_136"><a name="06062748000259"><a name="60627w0005.htm_spnew0"><a name="06062748001555"><b>Dr. Ladyman:</b>
 Although the circumstances of the incidents on 17 March 2004 and 9 June 2006 were significantly different, lessons learnt from incidents such as that in 2004 have enabled the Highways Agency to better manage the recent event. The nature of the earlier incident enabled traffic to pass safely the site of the accident; the more recent one resulted in fire and damage to infrastructure which prevented this from taking place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_429"><a name="60627w0005.htm_para0"><a name="06062748000260">Since 2004 the Highways Agency has improved capability for the evacuation of the motorway through detailed and tested joint operating procedures with the local emergency services in the event of a major incident. It has also developed detailed incident management procedures such as the capability to implement rearward relief; the process by which trapped vehicles are turned on the carriageway and returned to the previous exit. These procedures include the support and welfare of motorists where they cannot be assisted from the site.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_430"><a name="60627w0005.htm_para1"><a name="06062748000261">The period since the 2004 incident has seen significant developments in the Highways Agency&#146;s capability to minimise congestion caused by incidents. The introduction of Regional Control Centres as part of the Traffic Officer Service and the commencement of the National Traffic Control Centre provide an ability to divert traffic away from an incident through strategic signing, and around an incident through tactical signing and direction.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_431"><a name="60627w0005.htm_para2"><a name="06062748000262">The Highways Agency has substantially strengthened its ability to detect and respond to incidents and reduce the resulting congestion. The Traffic Officer Service on the M25 and other motorways is enabling significantly increased resources to be more quickly available at the scene to support the management of the incidents. Traffic officers worked well with emergency services on 9 June to minimise the duration of the incident and quickly restore the motorway to a safe condition. The emergency procedures were implemented and motorists received both welfare and medical assistance as necessary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_432"><a name="60627w0005.htm_para3"><a name="06062748000263">The Highways Agency has continued to develop its Incident Support Unit service on the M25 and, following its successful contribution to incident management on the M25, implemented similar services on most of the strategic road network. In addition Regional Control Centres are proactively monitoring the road network quickly to detect incidents and improve communication between responders with the aim of reducing the clearance time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_433"><a name="60627w0005.htm_para4"><a name="06062748000264">All major incidents are reviewed soon afterwards jointly by the Highways Agency and emergency services to identify lessons to be learnt in dealing with future incidents. There is an ongoing programme to continually develop incident management capability including innovations such as central reserve screens to prevent visual distraction of motorists on adjacent carriageways and specialist equipment to support the clear-up operation.</p>

 DFID's aid programme to Afghanistan (&#163;102 million in 2006-07) supports three of the Afghan Government's own objectives, as set out in their Interim National Development Strategy: (i) Building effective state institutions; (ii) improving economic management and the effectiveness of aid to Afghanistan; and (iii) improving the livelihoods of rural poor. These are the key steps needed in Afghanistan to generate a self-sustaining state with the capacity to meet basic social needs and start the process of reducing poverty.</p>

This covers recurrent costs such as salaries for teachers and health workers. This is the support the Afghan Government wants, and is the best chance for building effective state institutions that will last and are able to deliver basic services across the country.</p>

The National Solidarity Programme (NSP) for example, helps local communities to identify their own needs and provides the means to meet them. Often this includes the provision of basic service infrastructure such as schools and health centres.</p>

 There is considerable evidence, originating mainly from North America, to support the effectiveness of offending behaviour programmes in reducing re-offending (McGuire, 2002; Pearson et. al., 2002; Lipton, et. al., 1998). However, UK research examining the effectiveness of the Enhanced Thinking Skills programme in prisons has produced mixed results. An evaluation of the programme before it was accredited found that reconviction fell considerably after treatment (Friendship et. al., 2002). Further studies since accreditation have found no differences in reconvictions between programme participants and matched comparison groups (Falshaw et. al., 2003; Cann et. al., 2003). These findings might be explained by differences in programme delivery and implementation or research design limitations. The current Home Office research programme includes further research on the effectiveness of offending behaviour programmes based on more effective and rigorous research designs.</p>

 Generally, anyone who resists or wilfully obstructs a constable in the exercise of his duty is guilty of an offence under section 89(2), Police Act 1996.

 The Fire and Rescue Services Act 2004 has been in operation for less than two years, and the benefits of the move to prevention based fire and rescue services are already evident.

England, by comparison to the previous year, there has been a 21 per cent. fall in deaths in accidental dwelling fires. The number of fires to which the fire and rescue service were called fell by 25 per cent. Within the primary fires category, there was a fall of 7 per cent. in the total number of building fires including a 10 per cent. decrease in non-domestic building fires (i.e. commercial premises, schools, etc.). Deliberate primary fires fell by 20 per cent. That is a tribute to the way our fire and rescue services have exercised their duties and powers under the Act.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_494"><a name="60627w0012.htm_para4"><a name="06062748001225">The Government have received representations about charging by fire and rescue services for non-fire-fighting related work; operation of Integrated Risk Management Planning (IRMP) under the National Framework; and about the 24 hour delay on powers on entry to domestic premises for fire investigation purposes. On charging, the matters for which fire and rescue authorities may charge are set out in The Fire and Rescue Services (England) Order 2004. We keep that under review and will consult on any changes that we propose. For the National Framework we have recognised that it can assist fire and rescue services in forward planning if the framework has a longer life than one year. We have therefore introduced a two-year Framework for 2006-08 following consultation with the Fire and Rescue Service. Finally on fire investigation, the powers available to the fire and rescue authorities are at least equivalent to those available to the police. Nonetheless, we are considering the points made in conjunction with the Arson Control Forum.</p>

<i> [holding answer 26 June 2006]: </i>With effect from April 2006, funding has been channelled to local authorities through the Dedicated Schools Grant (DSG) to fund educational provision for children aged up to 16 in all types of settings. This includes private, voluntary and independent settings delivering the free nursery education entitlement. The DSG provides the total funding to local authorities. It is then up to the local authority to decide how best to apply the total funding across different settings and age groups.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_537"><a name="60627w0015.htm_para10"><a name="0606289000213">The level of funding provided to local authorities for under fives is determined by the number of full-time equivalent pupils in the authority, multiplied by the DSG &#147;guaranteed unit of funding&#148;. The number of full time equivalent pupils for under fives in PVI settings are calculated according to their age and the number of sessions they complete. The Department consulted widely on the Dedicated Schools Grant between February and May 2005, and on the method of its distribution over summer 2005. The Department will be reviewing various aspects of the funding arrangements over the conning months.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_538"><a name="60627w0015.htm_para11"><a name="0606289000214">Local authorities are best placed to determine the most effective use of resources at local level and have discretion over the rate at which they fund settings for delivery of early years provision. However, the &#147;Code of Practice on the Provision of Free Nursery Education Places for Three and Four Year-Olds&#148;&#151;a copy of which has been placed in the Library&#151;strongly encourages local authorities to fund provision delivered in different sectors on an equal basis, taking into account local need and circumstances.</p>

<i> [holding answer 26 June 2006]: </i>The recent Department of Health White Paper, &#147;Our Health, Our Care, Our Say: a new direction for community services&#148; encouraged the delivery of health visitor and midwifery through Sure Start Children&#146;s Centres. We have been working closely with the Department of Health to ensure consistent messages to local authorities and PCTs. Health visitors and midwives, whether based in a Sure Start Centre or operating some sessions from it, will provide ante-natal and post-natal support to families of young children in the area. The precise way in which these services are organised is a matter for an individual local authority to determine, working with their local primary care trust and other health sector partners.</p>

 National health service trusts are paid for the provision of care services commissioned from them by primary care trusts (PCTs). The great majority of funding allocated to PCTs is not hypothecated for specific purposes.

Spending on modern information technology is vital to getting the best out of NHS staff and equipment, and makes them more effective quicker than any other investment. The NHS already spends about &#163;1.2 billion each year on IT, and the Department has have always made it clear that it expects NHS trusts to follow the recommendations in the 2002 Wanless report to increase this over time. Monitoring progress towards achieving this is part of the Department's regular performance management arrangements for the NHS. It has therefore always been recognised that some national programme implementation costs, for example, on training and local hardware upgrades, will be borne locally over the programme's 10-year life.</p>

 Prime responsibility for implementing information technology support for social services lies with individual local authorities. However, with a view to delivering the aim of achieving appropriate integration of health and social care information systems in England by 2010 the Department&#146;s NHS Connecting for Health agency has undertaken a number of national initiatives to support local action. These include the establishment in 2005 of the electronic social care record board (ESCRB). The board has responsibility for overseeing national implementation of the electronic: social care record and ensuring consistency of its implementation by local authorities with social services responsibilities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_589"><a name="60627w0020.htm_para1"><a name="0606289000761">The board engages with the work of the national health service national programme for information technology to enable sharing of information across traditional boundaries. The board is providing advice and guidance, and will establish national standards for the electronic exchange of information between health, education and social care agencies in support of implementation of the electronic social care record, whilst recognising the independence of local authorities. It will ensure appropriate links are made with NHS electronic patient records and children's electronic information systems.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_590"><a name="60627w0020.htm_para2"><a name="0606289000762">Under the auspices of the ESCRB, a study has been commissioned into the options for national implementation of the electronic single assessment process for older people. This is a prime example of shared activity between health and social care. Consultation has been undertaken with health, social care and supplier representatives, and a report is due later this year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_591"><a name="60627w0020.htm_para3"><a name="0606289000763">A variety of information systems and tools are now available to support this process. There have been successful local deployments of such systems by national programme suppliers notably in the programme's North East and Eastern clusters. They are subject to the same strict access controls as apply to national programme-delivered patient healthcare records, requiring the use by social workers of a smartcard with identification and a pass code, which can only be obtained upon verification of identity and through a formal user registration process. These systems have demonstrated the value of the technology and its potential to support the rapid development of integrated multi-agency working across all client groups.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_592"><a name="60627w0020.htm_para4"><a name="0606289000764">In addition, allocations of the &#163;25 million capital expenditure grant recently paid to local authorities by the Department for improving information management made specific reference to the single assessment process in the expectation that the grant will be used to facilitate integration of social care information in the implementation of the NHS care records service.</p>

 The UK is spending &#163;270 million over three years in support of the Afghan National Drug Control Strategy&#151;including, from 2006, some &#163;25-30 million per annum in Helmand province. Of the total &#163;270 million, approximately 50 per cent. will be channelled into efforts to strengthen and diversify legal rural livelihoods, and much of the remainder devoted to building capacity within the Afghan counter narcotics law enforcement and criminal justice agencies responsible for bringing traffickers to justice. However, UK resources will not, on their own, be sufficient to bring about a sustained reduction in the amount of land under poppy cultivation. As a partner nation for counter narcotics, the UK is therefore working hard to ensure that international assistance is targeted in line with the priorities set out in the National Drug Control Strategy. We have supported the establishment of a Counter Narcotics Trust Fund, to which a number of partners including the US and the EC are now contributing, for this purpose.</p>

However, sustainable drug elimination strategies take time, particularly when the challenges are as severe as they are in Afghanistan. After last year's decline, this year's cultivation figures are unlikely to decrease further as consolidated progress in areas where governance, security and access to livelihoods have improved is still being outpaced by increased planting in the more lawless south, including Helmand province. Our deployment to Helmand is part of the broader international support for the reconstruction effort, which is vital to the success of the Government of Afghanistan's counter narcotics campaign and to the sustained reduction in the cultivation, production and trafficking of opium poppy.</p>

Government is unable to extend its authority to their areas of operation. There is growing evidence of links. At the tactical level, there are some ad hoc links between the Taliban and traffickers where their specific interests coincide. Recently, there has been evidence that the Taliban are encouraging Afghan farmers to grow opium poppy and in the south, including Helmand, the Taliban have encouraged farmers to resist Government eradication efforts. It is unclear how much the Taliban use drug money to facilitate their operations. There are some signs of contacts at the strategic level. We continue to assess the links closely, particularly as the UK presence in the south consolidates. We support Afghan efforts to disrupt any linkages.</p>

 Serious allegations have been made concerning mistreatment of Mr. Al Habashi. As  the former Foreign Secretary, my right hon. Friend the Member for Blackburn (Mr. Straw) made clear, Mr. Al Habashi was interviewed once by a member of the UK Security Service while he was in detention in Karachi in 2002. The Security Service had no role in his capture or in his transfer from Pakistan. The Intelligence and Security Committee report &#147;Handling of Detainees  by UK Intelligence Personnel in Afghanistan, Guantanamo Bay and Iraq&#148; of March 2005 gave details of the guidance under which such interviews were conducted, and the service officer did not observe any abuse and no instances of abuse were reported to him by Mr. Al Habashi.</p>

 There are indications that some militia groups are now operating in the border area inside Eastern Chad, while others continue to mount attacks from inside Darfur.

The UK law enforcement and criminal justice budget for 2006-07 is over &#163;20 million. Within Afghanistan, the UK, as key partner nation, has helped to establish the counter narcotics police of Afghanistan (CNPA)&#151;the lead national drugs law enforcement agency, with its headquarters in Kabul and seven provincial offices&#151;through training, mentoring and equipping the force. The UK also co-ordinates the mentoring of senior officers within the CNPA and has contributed &#163;1.5 million to the Afghan Law and Order Trust Fund which supports salaries and purchases of equipment for the CNPA. Additionally, the UK has assisted the establishment of a Counter Narcotics Criminal Justice Task Force, and is providing mentoring on prosecution and investigation. The UK is also helping to strengthen the borders of Afghanistan through contributions to border management assistance in Tajikistan, Iran and Pakistan.</p>

We would also hope to spend over &#163;4m on the A5 on a mix of overtaking lanes and resurfacing schemes. At this stage it is not possible to predict future spend on a year by year basis, as this will depend on the availability of funding during any given year. In addition, the Tullyvar scheme is being improved and upgraded under the Roads Service&#146;s Public Private Partnership 2 Project and being delivered using a Design Build Finance and Operate contract.</p>

I should first of all advise that Roads Service has good working relations with both the National Roads Authority (NRA) and the Department for Transport in the Republic of Ireland, through the Cross Border Roads Steering Group meetings that are co-chaired by both Chief Executives. Through meetings of this group, information on the programmes of development of the cross border routes in both jurisdictions is shared and compatible strategies for improvement are agreed.</p>
</ul><a name="60627w0024.htm_brev9"><a name="06062810001368"><ul><p class="tabletext">Roads Service&#146;s and the NRA&#146;s plans for major works at present include proposals to upgrade the existing single carriageway sections of the A5/N2 route between Derry and Ardee, through the construction of widened carriageway to &#147;2 + 1&#148; layouts and thus provide guaranteed overtaking opportunities and improve safety on the route. The relatively low traffic flows on the route do not merit the levels of investment needed to upgrade the route to dual carriageway standard when considered in the context of the need to also upgrade other key routes within the current budget levels.</p>

 There is no target ratio for dentists per head of population. The aim is to ensure an adequate level of dental provision both in terms of availability and accessibility.

 The establishment of the five new health and social care trusts, as with the other Review of Public Administration proposals, is intended to result in net savings. The resources released will be used to further improve the provision of front line services to the people of Northern Ireland. It is not possible at this stage to calculate precisely the level of net savings because detailed management arrangements have yet to be determined. At this initial stage, however, it is anticipated that the new Trusts will be expected to save in the order of &#163;20 million per annum in administration costs. This will require a one off investment of approximately  &#163;40 million, consisting largely of early leaving payments.</p>

 I shall shortly be consulting on a reform of sexual offences legislation and shall include a proposal to amend the law to give a statutory definition of &#145;capacity&#146; in rape cases. This bears on the law on consent and can be an important aspect of a court's consideration of an allegation of rape. In addition the Public Prosecution Service has trained all its prosecutors in the use of &#145;special measure&#146; provisions which are designed to assist victims and vulnerable or intimidated witnesses to give best evidence. Further training is planned in relation to sexual offence cases. The sexual violence strategy currently being developed for consultation will also make an important contribution to the effectiveness of the immediate support available from the health authorities and the police to victims of rape and sexual assault.</p>

Depending on the size of its contribution to the IFF, the UK could reach the equivalent of the 0.7 per cent. target as early as 2008-09.
