<p><a name="40526w01.html_wqn0"><b> Mr. Liddell-Grainger: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what help is given to the Exmoor area to secure the highest possible payments in respect of EU funding for farmers.  [161881]</p>








<p><a name="40526w01.html_spnew0"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 EU co-financed funds are available under the England Rural Development Programme across England, including the Exmoor area. Schemes under this programme help farmers and foresters to become more competitive, diverse, flexible and environmentally responsible as well as providing help to rural communities to adapt and develop. Exmoor is a designated Environmentally Sensitive Area (ESA) and the Exmoor area was paid a total of &#163;5.4&nbsp;million under this scheme in 2003, a significant proportion of which was co-financed by the EU.

<p><a name="40526w01.html_wqn1"><b> Mr. Dalyell: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what steps she is taking to protect the Anton Dohrn and Rosemary Bank Seamounts.  [166924]</p>








<p><a name="40526w01.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Bradshaw  </b> 
<i>[holding answer 17&nbsp;May 2004]:</i> Seamounts are not one of the habitats listed on Annex I to the Habitats Seamounts Directive for which Special Areas of Conservation (SAC) can be designated. However, seamounts can support habitats such as reefs, which are listed on Annex I. At present, there is little biological information about these two areas, and therefore there is insufficient information to be able to assess whether they meet the site selection criteria for SAC.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40526w01.html_para0">
Seamounts are one of the habitats on the initial list of threatened and/or declining habitats and species agreed by Ministers in June 2003 under OSPAR (The Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic) Annex V. Work is progressing during 2004 to identify and agree among contracting parties to OSPAR appropriate management measures (which may include marine protected areas) for a selection of the habitats and species on this list.

<a name="40526w01.html_sbhd2"><h3 align=center>Bovine Tuberculosis</h3>





<p><a name="40526w01.html_wqn2"><b> Mr. Cameron: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs when the Government will set a timetable for coming to a conclusion about the issue of TB in badgers; and if she will make a statement.  [174207]</p>







<br>&nbsp;<br><i>26 May 2004 : Column 1622W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>





<p><a name="40526w01.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 The question of what to do about a wildlife reservoir of bovine tuberculosis is a complex one. The Government are determined to base its future TB policy on sound scientific evidence. The Randomised Badger Culling Trial (RBCT), due to be completed in 2006, should help decide whether culling badgers can form part of a cost-effective, sustainable and practical TB control policy.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40526w01.html_para1">
On 9&nbsp;February, Defra launched a consultation on the key principles on which a new long-term strategy for tackling bovine TB will be developed. This consultation asks questions on a wide-range of issues, including how the Government can establish targets, balance costs, benefits and risks, work in partnership with all the key interest groups and how policy can be developed in the light of emerging scientific evidence. That will include evidence from the ongoing RBCT and elsewhere (including the Four Areas badger culling trial in the Republic of Ireland, when published).
</p>


<p>
<a name="40526w01.html_para2">
On 6&nbsp;April, Defra announced the publication of a report from an independent scientific panel chaired by Professor Charles Godfray FRS. The report reviewed the progress of the RBCT and associated Defra research, as part of a wider review of Defra&#039;s science. The Government are giving careful consideration to the complex recommendations of the report, and the review&#039;s conclusions will inform Defra&#039;s wider review of TB strategy. Defra has extended the deadline for the public consultation on the TB Strategy review until 4&nbsp;June, to allow sufficient time for this report to be assimilated and commented on.

<a name="40526w01.html_sbhd3"><h3 align=center>Barnet Council</h3>





<p><a name="40526w01.html_wqn3"><b> Mr. Dismore: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will make a statement on the decision of Barnet council to terminate its LA21 partnership scheme.  [173929]</p>








<p><a name="40526w01.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 The Government want to see sustainable development become a mainstream issue for local authorities, their partners, and local communities. We believe that the most effective way to achieve this is to build upon the experience of partnership working and community engagement gained through Local Agenda 21 (LA21) and subsume LA21 strategies within statutory community strategies. These are required, by law, to promote sustainable development. Many councils have already done this, and we encourage others to follow suit. It is for authorities to decide whether to have additional plans or a dedicated partnership to support the delivery of sustainable outcomes, but we would expect them to ensure these are in place if LA21 is to end.
</p>






<a name="40526w01.html_sbhd4"><h3 align=center>Endangered Species</h3>





<p><a name="40526w01.html_wqn4"><b> John Mann: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs when she plans to bring forward secondary legislation to implement section 307 (Enforcement of Legislation on endangered species) of the Criminal Justice Act 2003.  [175236]</p>








<p><a name="40526w01.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Morley </b> 
<i>[holding answer 24&nbsp;May 2004]:</i> Securing these Criminal Justice Act provisions was a major step forward. New secondary legislation will give effect to the provisions to strengthen police powers and to provide for tougher penalties.




<br>&nbsp;<br><i>26 May 2004 : Column 1623W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>


<p>
<a name="40526w01.html_para3">

<p><a name="40526w01.html_wqn5"><b> Mr. Cameron: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs when she expects the Fallen Stock Company to be up and running; and if she will make a statement.  [174205]</p>








<p><a name="40526w01.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 The National Fallen Stock Company has been up and running for some months now. It announced its proposals for a National Fallen Stock Scheme to start autumn this year on 13&nbsp;May. Further details are available on the Defra website at http://www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/by-prods/default.htm

<a name="40526w01.html_sbhd6"><h3 align=center>Farm Subsidies</h3>





<p><a name="40526w01.html_wqn6"><b> Andrew George: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what EU rules apply to Common Agricultural Policy funds held by member states which choose to <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;place a ceiling on payments to larger farm holdings and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;taper support payments to farm holdings degressively according to size; and what constraints this places upon the member state in respect of the impact of the redistribution of funds otherwise withheld.  [172485]</p>








<p><a name="40526w01.html_spnew6"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 There are no such EU rules.
</p>






<a name="40526w01.html_sbhd7"><h3 align=center>Greenhouse Gas</h3>





<p><a name="40526w01.html_wqn7"><b> Mr. Chaytor: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what steps she will take to ensure that the EU involves developing countries in future allocations of greenhouse gas emissions on an equitable per capita basis.  [174043]</p>








<p><a name="40526w01.html_spnew7"><b> Mr. Morley </b> 
<i>[holding answer 20&nbsp;May 2004]:</i> The UK has had initial discussions on future action with a number of developing countries, both at official and ministerial level. For any future climate regime to be effective, it must be as inclusive as possible, and must certainly cover the main developing countries. We are committed to ensuring that developing countries are included in the early stages of the discussions on future action, not only to ensure that the outcome is acceptable to the largest emitting developing countries and we achieve as near universal acceptance as possible, but also to ensure that equity concerns are addressed.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40526w01.html_para4">
We will continue to engage with developing countries at all levels, both through the formal channels that exist in the UNFCCC and through informal channels. We are currently considering how to build on this dialogue and stimulate further discussion.

<p><a name="40526w01.html_wqn8"><b> Mr. Tyler: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs when the report on the Survey of Health and Pesticide Exposure, being carried out by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and funded by her Department, is due to be published.  [174664]</p>







<br>&nbsp;<br><i>26 May 2004 : Column 1624W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>





<p><a name="40526w01.html_spnew8"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 Last July the Organophosphate Information Network informed Defra of its concerns over the conduct of the clinical phase of the study. The Department took these concerns seriously and decided to commission an independent audit of this phase of the study. On the recommendation of the Association of British Neurologists, Professor Kerry Mills from King&#039;s College Hospital London, was asked to carry out the audit. Professor Mills&#039; prior commitments and correspondence between the physicians involved, resulted in the audit being started on 19&nbsp;April this year. This process may take six months to complete.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40526w01.html_para5">
During the past few days my Department has asked both the hon. Member for North Cornwall and Mrs. Elizabeth Sigmund, the Chair of the Organophosphate Information Network (OPIN), for their opinions on this matter. Following this consultation, I have decided that an interim report should be published pending the completion of the audit.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what monitoring takes place to ensure that seasonal fruit pickers are not paid below the minimum wage.  [175442]</p>








<p><a name="40526w02.html_spnew0"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 Seasonal fruit pickers are entitled to be paid at least the appropriate Agricultural Minimum Wage set by the Agricultural Wages Board for England and Wales, for each hour they work. Payment of the Agricultural Minimum Wage is enforced by Defra officials of behalf of the Secretary of State. Enforcement activity is complaint led and workers can register a complaint about their pay by telephoning the Defra Agricultural Wages Team on 0845 0000 134.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport whether the mobile phones and walkie-talkie communications units issued to emergency personnel who would be called upon to deal with a terrorist incident on the London Underground have the capability to work underground.  [175081]</p>








<p><a name="40526w02.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 British Transport Police (BTP) are responsible for policing on London Underground and would be amongst the first to respond to a terrorist incident on the Underground network. BTP officers have two hand-held radios, one for below ground and one for above.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40526w02.html_para1">
Metropolitan Police radios work on two thirds of the London Underground network. In responding to a terrorist incident, or other emergency, on the Underground, the Metropolitan Police would work closely with BTP, and most of its responsibility would be at the surface. In the event that Metropolitan Police 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>26 May 2004 : Column 1625W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
officers were required to operate on the sections of the Underground network where their radios do not work, they would be able to communicate from below ground through BTP&#039;s radios. They would also receive communications support from London Underground staff.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40526w02.html_para2">
London Fire Brigade officers carry hand-held radios that work on the London Underground by means of fixed extension aerials in place in all deep level Underground stations. If required to work underground in environments where such fixed aerials are not installed, London Fire Brigade officers are able to deploy portable cable aerials enabling the radios to operate underground.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what plans there are to provide training for all public transport workers in case of a serious emergency. [174680]</p>








<p><a name="40526w02.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 This is primarily a matter for each operator. London Underground, the rail and bus industries have already circulated advice to all front line staff. In addition, the Department requires London Underground to have contingency plans to deal with situations that could effect the security of its operations. These must be accessible at all times to staff at stations, so that they are fully aware of what to do in such situations, and be exercised regularly. We have made similar recommendations to all Train Operating Companies.

<p><a name="40526w02.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 Fuel costs represent only 6.5&nbsp;per cent. of total local bus operating costs, after account is taken of support given by means of Bus Service Operators Grant, and it is not expected that recent changes in world oil prices will of themselves have a significant impact on service levels. We will however continue to monitor trends in overall bus industry costs.

<p><a name="40526w03.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 At 21&nbsp;May 2004, the Department for Transport had answered 3,052 written questions tabled since 18&nbsp;May 2003.

</p>



<p>(2) what assessment he has made of the performance of train operating companies to date on revising and implementing new Disabled People&#039;s Protection Policies in line with the Strategic Rail Authority&#039;s Code of Practice on Train and Station Services for Disabled Passengers and Guidance on Disabled People&#039;s Protection Policies; [175685]

<p><a name="40526w03.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 It is the responsibility of each train operator to comply with the requirements of Section 21 of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995. All operators have been required by the Strategic Rail Authority (SRA) to review their Disabled People&#039;s Protection Policy (DPPP). As part of the review each train operator has undertaken access audits of the facilities it operates. Train operators have a commitment to meet the services, standards and guidance defined in the SRA&#039;s Code of Practice when refurbishing rolling stock, providing new or enhanced facilities at stations and for the provision of services at stations and on trains. All train operators either have a revised DPPP approved by the SRA or are seeking such approval. Twenty Train Operating Company Disabled People&#039;s Protection Policies have been approved to date. Each revised DPPP places an obligation on the operator to provide a &#039;reasonable alternative means&#039; of making a journey accessible to disabled passengers where physical barriers preclude them from doing so.

Most recently, on 20&nbsp;May the Foreign Secretary discussed the need to support the NATO mission in Afghanistan with the Spanish Foreign Minister. EU member states provide around three-quarters of the troops in the International Security Assistance Force and this is likely to increase later this year. In addition, the UK and Germany lead Provincial Reconstruction Teams in northern Afghanistan, to which EU partners and other nations contribute personnel.

During these meetings, the ICRC briefed on the general humanitarian situation in Iraq and reminded us of our international humanitarian law obligations concerning detainees. Our records do not indicate that any specific oral or written concerns about coalition forces were passed to the FCO in 2003. As is standard practice, they would have been passed in the first instance to the authorities directly responsible for the treatment of detainees. I have no reason to doubt that the UK military authorities responsible for detainees in Iraq took appropriate action in response to any ICRC concerns. As my hon. Friend the Minister of State for the Armed Forces (Mr. Ingram) made clear in the House on 13&nbsp;May, HMG co-operates fully with the ICRC. It is offered full access to the detention facilities that we operate and each concern that it brings to our attention is treated very seriously and investigated fully.

I anticipate that special schools will continue to play a vital role in supporting pupils with significant and complex needs, in accordance with parental wishes and professional advice, and that they are likely to develop their role further in the future in the provision of specialist advice and support to mainstream schools.

In the course of this audit programme almost 20 surveys were conducted at sites here in Northern Ireland during 2001 and 2002, mainly at schools and two at hospitals. Measurement of emissions in every case showed these to be hundreds and sometimes thousands of times below the ICNIRP guidelines.

<i>[holding answer 24&nbsp;May 2004]:</i> The majority of the computers used within the core Home Office are supplied as part of a managed service by Sirius (the Home Office&#039;s IT supplier) and as such are not assets owned by the Authority. Although Sirius are contractually obliged to ensure the erasure of any Home Office data held on their assets, the responsibility for the disposal of obsolete or surplus assets belonging to Sirius lies solely with them.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will list the costs of early retirement of police officers for each force in England and Wales in 2003&#150;04.  [173568]</p>








<p><a name="40526w10.html_spnew6"><b> Ms Blears </b> 
<i>[holding answer 13&nbsp;May 2004]:</i> The information is not centrally available in the form requested. The cost of early retirement on ill-health grounds is mitigated to an extent by the fact that the retired officer will normally be replaced, either directly or indirectly, by a recruit on a lower salary who can perform all the ordinary duties of a member of the force. A broad indicator of the cost to forces in any year is the aggregate of the cash lump sums they pay to officers retiring on ill health grounds. Based on the estimated number of ill-health retirements for 2003&#150;04 published by the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy the Government Actuary&#039;s Department estimate that the total cost of ill-health pension lump sums in England and Wales is about &#163;50&nbsp;million.

<p><a name="40526w10.html_spnew7"><b> Caroline Flint: </b> 
 We do not think it right to do so, thus making more widely available details of the methods of conversion identified so far. The Forensic Science Service identified a number of different ways in which such revolvers and pistols were used with ammunition other than air cartridges. These varied considerably in their effectiveness and ease of conversion and with one exception were not specific to one particular model. Having discussed the problem with the manufacturers of the air cartridge system and an independent engineer it was concluded that the main problem was with the air cartridge system itself which could not be modified to remove the danger.

Notes:<br>

1. Impact of Emissions Trading Scheme is on gas costs as users of gas will need to hold emission allowances. Not all business users of gas are covered by the EU ETS and those that are will receive an initial free allocation of allowances that will largely cover their projected emissions.<br>

2. Estimates for renewables include the impact of the Non-Fossil Fuel Obligation, which has already impacted on electricity prices.<br>

3. Average impact from Energy Efficiency Commitments. For those benefiting from energy efficiency measures, bills should fall. It is estimated that the average annual on-going financial gain for consumers benefiting from measures in the 2005&#150;08 period, in lower energy bills or increased comfort, would be around &#163;15 a year for the lifetime of the measures. The annual benefit from cavity wall insulation in a standard three bedroom house is likely to be &#163;80 to &#163;100.<br>

4. Impact of Climate Change Levy estimated for those with a Climate Change Agreement who receive an 80&nbsp;per cent. reduction in the rate of levy and for those without a CCA who pay the full levy. Impact of emissions trading based on a price of &#8364;5 per tonne of carbon dioxide.<br>

<p><a name="40526w14.html_spnew2"><b> Ms Hewitt: </b>

However, our White Paper, &quot;Fairness for All&quot; has given a commitment to maintain levels of grant funding for local equality work for the foreseeable future.

The Commission will be subject to the same government accounting framework as other non-departmental public bodies, including those processes for making grants.

 The Commission for Equality and Human Rights will provide the opportunity to achieve the more joined-up approach to equality and human rights that business, and especially small business, has called for strongly.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40526w14.html_para4">
The White Paper, &quot;Fairness for All&quot;, makes clear that it will be essential for the CEHR to respond to the specific needs of small businesses and liaise effectively with small business advisers. In developing these effective measures, the CEHR will consult and work closely with small business on all key areas of its work to recognise and address their specific needs.

Evidence shows that small businesses&#039; information needs are often different from those of large organisations, which centre on basic information on

The CEHR&#039;s services will need to support these advisers and intermediaries and enable the provision of joined-up information that small business wants.

<a name="40526w14.html_para7">
The CEHR will respond to the preferred ways of working of small business. It will be expected to work with and through other existing bodies such as regional development agencies, the Small Business Service, business representative organisations and sector-based professional bodies.

The Government will continue to express their strong commitment to ensuring liaison between existing small business advisers and the CEHR throughout the White Paper consultation period and beyond.

<p><a name="40526w15.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Sutcliffe: </b> 
 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State is aware of the concerns of independent and small format retailers about consolidation in the convenience sector. However, the independent competition authorities are responsible under the Enterprise Act 2002 for decision-making in merger cases against an explicit competition test, and parties with concerns about the effects of mergers in this sector are encouraged to contact the Office of Fair Trading to put forward their views. Ministers have no role in this process, and my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has not, therefore, met with those in the convenience sector to discuss any concerns.

 While there are some carbon emissions associated with the construction of wind farms and their associated infrastructure these are very small compared to the carbon emissions saved by the wind farm over its lifetime of operation. Wind Energy Fact Sheet 14, which can be found on the DTI website (www.dti.gov.uk/energy/renewables/publications/pdfs/windfs14.pdf) provides further information on the life cycle emissions from wind farms relative to fossil fuel electricity generating technologies.

Notes:<br>

1.&nbsp;Time waited statistics from hospital episode statistics (HES) are not the same as the published waiting list statistics. HES provides counts and time waited for all patients admitted to hospital within a given period whereas the published waiting list statistics count 



those waiting for treatment on a specific date and how long they have been on the waiting list. Also, HES calculates the time waited as the difference between the admission and decision to admit dates. Unlike published waiting list statistics, this is not adjusted for self-deferrals or periods of medical/social suspension.<br>

2.&nbsp;The main operation is the first recorded operation in the HES data set and is usually the most resource intensive procedure performed during the episode. It is appropriate to use main operation when looking at admission details e.g. time waited, but the figures for &quot;all operations count of episodes&quot; give a more complete count of episodes with an operation.<br>

Notes:<br>

1. A finished in-year admission is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider, excluding admissions beginning before 1&nbsp;April at the start of the data-year.

3. Time waited statistics from hospital episode statistics (HES) are not the same as the published waiting list statistics. HES provides counts and time waited for all patients admitted to hospital within a given period, whereas the published waiting list statistics count those waiting for treatment on a specific date and how long they have been on the waiting list. Also, HES calculates the time waited as the difference between the admission and decision to admit dates. Unlike published waiting list statistics, this is not adjusted for self-deferrals or periods of medical/social suspension.<br>

4. Figures are grossed for both coverage and missing/invalid clinical data, except for 2001&#150;02 and 2002&#150;03, which are not yet adjusted for shortfalls.<br>

 Around 32&nbsp;per cent. of pensioners aged over 80 years pay income tax. This estimate is based upon the 2001&#150;02 Survey of Personal Incomes and ONS 2001 and 2002 mid year population estimates.

 To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will extend the VAT Refund Scheme to include private museums that hold national designated collections, for the purpose of recovering VAT on expenditure incurred in National Lottery-funded projects.  [174972]</p>








<p><a name="40526w25.html_spnew2"><b> John Healey: </b> 
 Like any other business, private museums can recover VAT incurred on buying goods and services providing those purchases relate to their taxable business activities. This would be the case where a museum is providing museum entry where admission charges are taxable at the standard rate of VAT.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40526w25.html_para0">
Under the normal VAT rules provided for in the European Sixth VAT Directive, VAT incurred on goods and services relating to non-business activities, such as providing free entry to museums, cannot be recovered. This is also the case where VAT is incurred on exempt business activities, such as providing museum entry where no VAT is applied to admission charges under the VAT exemption for cultural bodies. The source of such an organisation&#039;s funding cannot be used to determine its VAT position.

<p>
<a name="40526w25.html_para1">
However, since September 2001, the Government have provided a refund scheme that allows the main national museums and galleries which do not charge for admission to recover VAT they incur on related purchases. This scheme removes the obstacle VAT was creating to the delivery of our 1997 manifesto commitment that there should be free access to the main national museums and galleries.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40526w25.html_para2">
That commitment has been an outstanding success. In this year&#039;s Budget, the Chancellor announced that, building on that success and on the recommendation of the Goodison Review, we are considering in the context of the forthcoming Spending Review extending the free access commitment for the main national museums and galleries, and the VAT refund scheme that has helped to deliver it, to university museums.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40526w25.html_para3">
For bodies in receipt of National Lottery funding, irrecoverable VAT can be included as eligible project expenditure for lottery support. By funding this cost, the Heritage Lottery Fund&#039;s grant assessment process ensures that lottery-funded projects are not disadvantaged if they incur VAT on their expenditure. Any VAT recovered under a refund scheme should, therefore, be excluded from any grant awarded by the Heritage Lottery Fund.

However latest Households Below Average Income (HBAI) figures show that we have made good progress in tackling pensioner poverty. Two thirds fewer pensioners&#151;1.8&nbsp;million older people&#151;were in absolute low income in 2002&#150;03 compared with 1996&#150;97.

Our strategy is to seek to maintain and support the major contribution made by the private pension sector in enabling pensioners to share in increased economic well being, and to target state resources on improving the position of the poorest relative to rising national prosperity. Since the introduction of pension credit the poorest third of pensioner households will be &#163;1,750 a year (&#163;33 per week) better off in 2004&#150;05, compared with the 1997 system.

 Spelthorne borough council was paid &#163;144,762 specifically for council tax benefit administration costs in 2003&#150;04. However, this does not include the extra funding for administering this scheme that has arisen due to the increase caseloads following the introduction of the new tax credit and pension credit schemes.
