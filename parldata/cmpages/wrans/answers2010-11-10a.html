 With regards to what assessment has been made on the use of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) as a road fuel, I refer the hon. Member to the answer given in response to the hon. Member for Glasgow South (Mr Harris) by the Secretary of State for Transport on 8 November 2010, <i> Official Report</i>, column 108W.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_386"><a name="101110w0001.htm_para16"><a name="10111049000151">No specific assessments have been undertaken to estimate the contribution of the use of LPG as a domestic fuel to meeting air quality requirements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_387"><a name="101110w0001.htm_para17"><a name="10111049000152">Indicatively, LPG is used domestically as a cost-effective alternative to coal or gasoil predominately in rural areas, which are not connected to the gas grid. Emission calculations using the 2008 UK inventory for the domestic sector emissions, found switching from LPG to either gasoil or burning oil has a negligible effect across all pollutants, with very small increases in emissions of SO2, CO and NOx. These calculations also showed that switching to coal from LPG would increase emissions for the majority of pollutants. If all the domestic energy produced using LPG was completely substituted by coal, increases in UK emissions would be observed; 4% for PM10, 3% for PM2.5, 3% for CO, 2% for SO2 and 1% for VOC with a negligible effect on other pollutants.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_388"><a name="101110w0001.htm_para18"><a name="10111049000153">The majority of domestic LPG use takes place in rural areas where areas of exceedences of the limit values stipulated in legislation do not occur. The pollutants which are monitored as part of the Gothenburg Protocol and the National Emissions Ceiling Directive which the UK needs to reduce in order to meet its emissions ceiling are much lower when LPG is used compared to coal. However, the domestic sector is a small contributor.</p>

<i> [holding answer 9 November 2010]:</i><i> </i>The recycling rate of the commercial and industrial sector in England was 42% in 2002-03, when the last statistical survey of the sector was undertaken. We are currently undertaking a comparable survey, with the interim results to be published on 10 November 2010, and the final results scheduled for release in December 2010. This will give us an up-to-date picture of how much commercial waste is recycled. The review of waste policy, announced by the Secretary of State on 15 June, will consider how we can remove some of the barriers to recycling, particularly for small and medium-sized businesses, and how we can make it easier for businesses to recycle.

The information available under RIDDOR includes three categories of severity of injury: fatal injuries, defined major injuries and other injuries to workers leading to more than three days absence (over-3-day). There are two categories of severity for members of the public: fatal and non-fatal injuries that cause a person to be taken from the site of the accident to hospital. Only physical injuries resulting from acts of violence suffered by people at work are reportable as a defined injury under RIDDOR. Physical injuries resulting from acts of violence suffered by members of the public are not reportable.<br>
3. Teachers are identified using Standard Occupational Classification (SOC). This system is used in UK official statistics for classifying workers by the type of job they are engaged in. The latest version is SOC2000, which has been used in HSE statistics since planning year 2002/03. Prior to this SOC90 was used.<br>

 We remain concerned for the Baha'i community in Iran. I met the Iranian ambassador on 20 September to discuss this and a range of other human rights issues. I made it clear that the UK remains extremely concerned by the sentencing of the seven Baha'i leaders to 20 years imprisonment, which we understand has now been reduced to 10 years. As my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary said in his statement of 11 August 2010, these sentences are unacceptable. Both the UK and the international community deplore the victimisation of the Baha'i faith by the Iranian state. We will continue to remind Iran of the international commitments it has freely signed up to, and urge the Iranian Government to cease its harassment of the Baha'i minority, and to respect the rights of all minority groups.</p>

 The onus is on individual fire and rescue authorities to consider strategies to mitigate the effect of increased levels of traffic, which research has shown to be the main factor accounting for increased response times. That will include liaising with partners such as local authorities and the Highways Agency, and applying locally appropriate measures such as green wave traffic light systems, GPS and improved local knowledge of fire crews, and use of secondary fire vehicles and reduced response to low risk incidents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_493"><a name="101110w0002.htm_para44"><a name="10111060000415">Response target-setting is a matter for individual fire and rescue authorities under Integrated Risk Management Planning (IRMP), according to local requirements and circumstances, and is not something that central government should direct or determine. The government has no plans to reintroduce national standards for fire and rescue service response times. Decisions made by local politicians and practitioners according to local circumstances will be more effective than blanket requirements across the country.</p>

1. The original source for these estimates is the Family Resources Survey. The income measures used to derive the estimates employ the same methodology as the Department for Work and Pensions publication 'Households Below Average Income' (HBAI) series, which uses disposable household income, adjusted (or "equivalised") for household size and composition, as an income measure as a proxy for standard of living.<br>
2. Small differences should be treated with caution as these will be affected by sampling error and variability in non-response.<br>
3. Three sample years have been combined as regional single year estimates are subject to volatility.<br>
4. The figures are based on OECD equivalisation factors.<br>
5. Median household incomes are more commonly used in analysis as these are less affected by outliers.<br>
6. Incomes are presented in 2008-09 prices and have been rounded to the nearest pound sterling.<br>

 The Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) published service standards (PSS) are that 90% of enhanced CRB checks are issued within 28 days. The CRB received 326,401 in the month of September 2010. Of these 238,402 (87% against the 90% PSS) were processed within the PSS and 88,359 were issued outside the PSS by one day or more.</p>

The CRB has set up improvement plans with those forces that have been having problems meeting the demand for certificates. This is aimed at maintaining a steady output of applications on the system while also reducing the number of outstanding cases that have been with police forces for more than 25 days.</p>

 The primary role of the Apprenticeship Ambassadors Network (AAN) is to promote greater employer engagement with apprenticeships. I welcome the contribution which the AAN gives to the apprenticeship programme, both as our eyes and ears in respect of the quality of apprenticeships and the delivery system; and as ambassadors to encourage others to offer apprenticeships.</p>

 The Medical Research Council (MRC) has funded basic research into transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) including Creutzfeldt Jakob disease (CJD) since the late 1970s.

As this research is still ongoing, it is too early to report on outcomes. MRC welcomes proposals in all areas of TSE research and particularly in the development of new diagnostic tests and therapeutics. In addition, MRC encourages TSE research that may also inform on the basic mechanisms of other neurodegenerative disorders.</p>

We will consult students and university organisations on the details. We will look to increase the leverage of Government funding by getting matched contributions from universities. Our current preference is for universities to offer scholarships to targeted students-including the principal beneficiaries of the pupil premium-that would mean at least their first year is free.

<i> [holding answer 8 November 2010]:</i><i> </i>The Government are committed to the progressive nature of the repayment system. It is therefore important that those on the highest incomes post graduation are not able unfairly to buy themselves out of this progressive system by paying off their loans early. We will consult on potential early repayment mechanisms-similar to those paid by people who pre-pay their mortgages. These mechanisms would need to ensure that graduates on modest incomes who strive to pay off their loans early through regular payments are not penalised. For example, a 5% levy might be charged on additional repayments each year over a specified amount such as £1,000 or £3,000. Alternatively, those on higher incomes (eg over £60,000) who made an additional repayment could be required to pay a 5% levy on this sum. We will consult with students, universities, higher education bodies and other experts.</p>

We will continue our efforts to prevent insurgents harming civilians and to develop the capacity of Afghan security forces to protect the population.</p>
