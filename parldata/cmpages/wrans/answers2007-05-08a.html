 A scheme acceptable to the Department for Social Development on this site has not yet been arrived at. Consultants, employed by the Department, are currently evaluating and appraising options for the site and consequently it is difficult to give an accurate estimate of the cost of the eventual scheme. Given the size and complexity of the site, indicative estimates at this stage would suggest the total cost could be up to &#163;180 million. The design and build costs for the scheme will be met by the private sector.</p>

An integral part of the process is an assessment of the &#145;demand&#146; and &#145;difficulty&#146; of crossing the road at the location concerned. The initial part of our assessment process uses the number of pedestrians (the initial demand factor) and the volume of traffic (the initial difficulty factor) to give an indication of the potential &#145;conflict&#146; at a site. The assessment of the need for a crossing is then supplemented using a scorecard, which assigns scores to various other &#145;demand&#146; and &#145;difficulty&#146; factors, including collision history at the site. This policy is designed to assess the need and to prioritise locations &#147;where pedestrians encounter difficulties in crossing the road due to the high volumes of vehicular traffic. This is applied consistently and impartially when assessing all requests in Northern Ireland, so that available funding can be directed at those sites with the greatest need.</p>

 20 mph zones are required to have traffic calming within their perimeter and are self-enforcing. Part time 20 mph speed limits tend to cover a single road only. The choice of which option to use is a matter for individual local traffic authorities.</p>

 There are currently no cetaceans being kept in captivity in the UK, and other than for purposes of rehabilitation, there have not been any kept since the early 1990s. While it is not illegal to keep cetaceans in this country, the Zoo Licensing Act 1981 (as amended) aims to ensure that, should cetaceans be kept at an establishment for exhibition to the public, the establishment is licensed and the animals kept in accordance with strict standards relating to their health and welfare requirements. Those standards are set out in the Secretary of State&#146;s Standards of Modern Zoo Practice and its supplement on the keeping of cetaceans in captivity.

<i> Notes</i>:<br>
1. Dairy/beef cows are any cows or heifers that have calved including cull cows. Dairy and beef herd replacements are not included nor are cattle intended for slaughter.<br>
2. Some holdings may have both dairy and beef cows and will therefore be included in the holding counts of both categories.<br>
3. Estimates have been made for holdings not responding or not selected for the survey.<br>

 The Hampton Review recommended the consolidation of DEFRA inspection and enforcement functions into seven thematic regulators, with one of those regulators being a new Executive Agency for Animal Health and Welfare, with the State Veterinary Service (SVS) at its core. DEFRA Ministers subsequently determined to merge the Dairy Hygiene Inspectorate, the Egg Marketing Inspectorate, and the Wildlife Licensing and Registration Service with SVS to create such a body. The Dairy Hygiene Inspectorate joined SVS in October 2006, and the Egg Marketing Inspectorate and WLRS joined on 1 April 2007. The new enlarged agency was then re-named to Animal Health.</p>

 The document &#147;From Here to Sustainability: The Learning and Skills Council&#146;s Strategy for Sustainable Development&#148;, requires the LSC, FE colleges and other providers to take action in four key areas: positioning the sector (leadership and management); buildings and estates; curriculum (teaching and learning); and community and business. Progress is monitored by the Sustainable Development Implementation and Delivery Group, which involves college principals, sustainable development specialists, higher education representatives and national and regional bodies including Ofsted, a regional development agency and a sector skills council.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_523"><a name="70508w0012.htm_para0"><a name="07050831004208">Examples of progress to date include: capital proposals from colleges now have to address sustainable development and ensure that they meet the criteria for excellent Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM) ratings. An online set of resources designed to support providers on each of the four themes of the strategy will be launched by the LSC in autumn 2007. Research evidence shows that over half the providers responding to an independent study had a policy for sustainable development and many more are carrying out audits of resource use. The same study showed that 70 per cent. of respondents have embedded sustainable development into their teaching and learning programmes. The LSC is working with partners such as sector skills councils to ensure that sustainable development is embedded in the processes that determine the content of the curriculum, and the training and development of college staff. Approximately three-quarters of providers in the independent study had programmes for learner volunteering in place. Respondents had also developed networks to promote sustainable development and were sharing facilities with local groups. The LSC sponsored Green Gown Awards celebrate and share the best examples of leadership and progress in environmental sustainability.</p>

 The Tri-Service Medical Entry guidelines, which govern entry in to the Army, state that the basic form of attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) frequently resolves with time, so recruitment may be permitted if the candidate has been free from symptoms and off all medication (including Methylphenidate drugs) for more than three years prior to application. If the basic condition is complicated with violent and/or delinquent behaviour then such candidates would normally be graded as medically unfit for enlistment as current evidence indicates that this form of the condition is much less likely to improve with time.</p>

In December 2006, the Government announced in the White Paper, "The Future of the United Kingdom's Nuclear Deterrent" (Cm 6994), that the UK will be reducing further the number of operationally available warheads to fewer than 160.

 The North West Development Agency (NWDA) has not given any direct funding to the Royal Lancashire Agricultural Society. However, the NWDA made a financial contribution to the Royal Lancashire Show in 2003-04 through the Rural Development Programme of the Lancashire Rural Recovery Partnership. The programme provided a grant of &#163;32,578 towards marketing costs for the Show; the staging of a Lancashire produce event; and supporting elements of additional infrastructure. Since then the NWDA has provided &#163;1,255,000 to the Lancashire and Blackpool Tourist Board (LBTB) for the year 2006-07. From this, the Tourist Board granted &#163;3,000 towards the staging of the 2006 Royal Lancashire Show, on the grounds that the Show would serve to raise the profile of the LBTB and the Lancashire Rural Tourism Initiative. The NWDA&#146;s Strategy for Tourism in England&#146;s North West identifies the Show as one of a number of events of national and international significance that take place across the region. The Show has also been identified for support in the Lancashire and Blackpool Visitor Economy Strategy 2006-16, because of its potential for further development of the visitor economy. Lancashire and Blackpool Tourist Board has delegated authority to invest in those projects which it believes will raise its profile. The Royal Lancashire Agricultural Society agreed to publicise Lancashire and Blackpool Tourist Board by promoting their logo and mentioning the Tourist Board in press releases. No funding was granted, indirectly or directly, to the Royal Lancashire Society prior to 2003.</p>

 We remain concerned about the plight of Dr. Oscar Elias Biscet and other political prisoners in Cuba. We are particularly worried about political prisoners such as Dr. Biscet who are reported to be suffering poor health, yet are not provided with adequate medical treatment. The UK considers Dr. Biscet&#146;s imprisonment to be a violation of his civil and political freedoms. At the time of Dr. Biscet&#146;s detention, the UK and EU condemned these violations and called for the immediate release of all political prisoners in Cuba.</p>

On 30 April 2007, the Minister for Trade, Investment and Foreign Affairs (Mr. McCartney) expressed concern about political prisoners and other human rights issues during a meeting with Cuban Deputy Minister for Foreign Trade, Antonio Carricarte.</p>

 Ketamine is used in medical and veterinary practice as an anaesthetic. Between 1997 and 2003 there were increasing reports of ketamine misuse, particularly in nightclubs. Consuming ketamine has the effect of detaching users from reality and therefore unable to maintain personal safety.</p>

 Primary care trusts (PCTs) and predecessor organisations have responsibility for managing delivery of services provided by general practitioners (GPs), including the adequacy of their practice premises.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_724"><a name="70508w0029.htm_para17"><a name="0705095000490">Since 1997, there has been a 60 per cent. increase in investment in GP premises. Part of this was through the NHS Plan targets to refurbish or replace up to 3,000 GP premises and create 500 primary care centres.  <br>

<notus-date day="8" month="5" year="2007" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>8 May 2007 : Column 140W</b><br>
These targets were achieved through the replacement or refurbishment of 2,848 GP premises and 510 primary care centres. An extended target of 625 primary care centres by December 2006 was met with 674 created and we expect to have 750 by the end of 2008.</p>

The LIFT programme has contributed to this progress and has proven to be a tremendous success.

<p><a name="stpa_727"><a name="70508w0029.htm_para20"><a name="0705095000493">Judgments for some of those standards are subjective which by their very nature may lead to some PCTs reporting higher levels of premises that do not meet minimum standards than other PCTs with similar premises. Being below minimum standards does not mean the buildings are in a dangerous condition. Rather, that the premises may judged by PCTs as not having for example, full and adequate access to and within premises for disabled people. How individual PCTs make this judgment can result in variations in the percentage of premises deemed in not satisfying minimum standards.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_728"><a name="70508w0029.htm_para21"><a name="0705095000494">This is not because of a lack of intent by GPs practices and their PCTs to provide modern facilities but because, for example, the building is too small to incorporate changes with a general lack of suitable, alternative locations to develop new premises. These are historic problems particularly and modernisation of GP premises on this scale required in 1997 inevitably take time to achieve but the good progress made will continue.</p>

The campaign was aimed at key groups such as employers, the media and young people; as well as the public in general, to help raise awareness of mental health issues and put an end to stigma and discrimination. This campaign came to an end on 31 March 2004. We believe the campaign has been a positive presence but do not have direct evidence of any impact on health indicators.</p>

It is therefore impossible to separate out these strands when it comes to assessing the overall effectiveness of the work. Teenage pregnancy rates are falling. Between the 1998 baseline year and 2004 (the latest year for which data are available) the under-18 conception rate has fallen by 11.1 per cent. and the under-16 rate has fallen by 15.2 per cent.

<p><a name="stpa_759"><a name="70508w0030.htm_para30"><a name="0705095000602">In addition there were some significant shifts in attitudes to STIs throughout the life of the campaign in particular in terms of potential risk (The risk of getting an STI has increased by 11 per cent.) and in terms of protection (It doesn't matter how many partners someone has as long as they&#146;re careful i.e. use a condom has increased by 9 per cent.)</p>

<p><a name="stpa_766"><a name="70508w0030.htm_para37"><a name="0705095000609">The Government&#146;s strategy has helped reduce smoking rates in England from 28 per cent. in 1998 to 24 per cent. in terms of 2005 populations, the latest year for which figures are available, meaning around 1.6 million fewer smokers in England. These are the lowest smoking rates in England on record and indicate that the Government are on track to meet the PSA target of 21 per cent. or lower smoking prevalence in 2010.</p>

This resulted in changes to our corporate identity, which cost &#163;92,751 to implement. A summary of the research report will be placed in the House.</p>

1. The pensioner benefit figures include expenditure on state pension, bereavement benefits for pensioners, pension credit and winter fuel payments.  2. The figures are expenditure across Great Britain and have been rounded to the nearest million pounds.  3. Total expenditure on pension benefits is taken from the provisional outturn for 2006-07 as published at Budget 2007.  4. The breakdown of pension credit expenditure between groups is based on the estimated proportions in 2006-07, consistent with Budget 2007 forecasts, projected forward from Departmental Administrative Sources.  5. The breakdown of winter fuel payment expenditure between age groups is based on a 100 per cent. sample of administrative records in 2005-06. Full payments have been broken down by family type using estimated proportions taken from Family Resources Survey 2005-06. Half payments are paid only to couples.<br>
 6. For pension credit and winter fuel payments a couple is defined as two people who are married or cohabiting. For state pension and, bereavement benefits for pensioners, the definition of a couple is people who are married. Single people are all those who are not married (including those who may be widowed or divorced). The classification of marital status is based on an indicator on the dataset which has some known reliability issues and so may not be entirely accurate.  7. Expenditure on couples has been allocated to age groups according to the age of the partner actually receiving each payment; except for pension credit, where the expenditure cannot be allocated to individual partners, so the age of the elder partner is used.  8. The expenditure for men aged 60-64 are for pension credit and winter fuel payments only. State pension is paid only to men over state pension age, i.e. aged 65 years and over. Only bereavement benefits paid to those over state pension age are included.  <i> Source:</i><br>

 It is Government policy to meet demand for UK coinage. This minimises the risk that the public or businesses might find themselves short of coins, which in turn might restrict economic activity. The Treasury pays for the production of UK circulating coins while the Exchequer receives all seignorage. Overall, this generates a net inflow of capital for the public purse. Fluctuations in demand for UK coinage can occur for a variety of reasons and it is not normally possible to quantify the impact of any one specific factor.</p>

 The UK is a member of the World Customs Organisation, with full voting rights, and takes an active part in negotiations. The EU is not a full member&#151;it has observer status&#151;but may choose to adopt WCO agreements and conventions should it wish to do so (and as it has done, for example, with the Harmonised Commodity Description and Coding System (HS)). Any agreement or convention made by the WCO and not subject to Community competence only takes effect in UK law once it has been ratified and then enacted by Parliament: the UK may choose whether to ratify or not. Where agreements do fall under Community competence, the UK is bound to apply them where they are adopted and contained in Community legal instruments.</p>
