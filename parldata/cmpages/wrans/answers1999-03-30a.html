<P>
<a name="90330w01.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. George Robertson: </B> 
 The Joint Rapid Reaction Forces (JRRF) concept builds on the Joint Rapid Deployment Force to provide a pool of highly capable force elements, maintained at high and very high readiness and trained to undertake short notice force projection operations of all kinds. We plan to have this larger, much improved and more balanced capability in place by October 2001. The forces that are needed to meet the JRRF requirement have already been identified and an initial operational capability will be achieved on 1 April 1999.
<P>

<a name="90330w01.htm_para0">The Joint Force Headquarters, which is co-located at Northwood with the Permanent Joint Headquarters in peacetime, will be expanded to enable it to command two simultaneous operations. It will be provided with a dedicated signals squadron drawn from 30 Signal Regiment based at Bramcote in Warwickshire.
<P>

<a name="90330w01.htm_para1">The authority of the Chief of Joint Operations, based at Northwood, will be increased and he will assume greater responsibility for Joint training, standards and exercises. To assist him in this task, a new 2* post, that of Chief of Joint Force Operational Readiness and Training (CJFORT) will be created from 1 April 1999.

Of two reported incidents in 1998, one resulted in the successful prosecution of the Captain of a fishing vessel.

 We are our EU partners are considering our positions for this year's Commission on Human Rights, which runs until the end of April.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90330w02.htm_spnew10"><B> Mr. Fatchett: </B> 
 The human rights situation in Algeria continues to cause us concern. In its latest report, the Working Group on Enforced Disappearances of the United Nations Economic and Social Council lists 731 cases of disappearances in Algeria since 1991. Only 11 have been addressed by the Algerian government to the Working Group's satisfaction. Over the same period there have also been numerous allegations of extra- judicial executions and torture by the Algerian security forces.
<P>

<a name="90330w02.htm_para3">It is fair to say that the number of new disappearances cited by the UN in the last 12 months is well down on previous years. But this is no substitute for independent investigations into all cases. We continue to urge the Algerian Government to allow independent UN Special Rapporteurs free access to the country to investigate all alleged human rights violations, as they are obliged to do under the UN Charter.

 Our long-standing relations with Yemen have been strained by recent incidents of kidnap involving British tourists, one of which resulted in the death of three British nationals, and by the arrest in Yemen of eight British nationals on terrorist-related charges. We are determined not to allow these set backs to cloud otherwise friendly relations. The Prime Minister wrote to Prime Minister Iriyani again on 24 March to help maintain dialogue at the most senior level, and to press our concerns about serious shortcomings in the legal process in the trial of the British nationals in Aden.

 My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary announced on 2 March 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, columns <i>854-901</i>, a new UK commitment of &#163;10 million to promote stability in Sierra Leone. The objectives are to help the West African Peacekeeping Forces, ECOMOG,

<P><I>30 Mar 1999 : Column: 567</I><P>
push back the rebels; to encourage the rebels to lay down their arms and return to civilian life; and to create a professional and democratically accountable Sierra Leone Army.
<P>

<a name="90330w03.htm_para0">Access to this new &#163;10 million package of assistance is conditional upon matching pledges of support from other international donors. I am pleased to report that we have now received the full amount of &#163;10 million in matching donations as a response to our lead in the promotion of lasting peace in Sierra Leone.

<a name="90330w03.htm_para4">As a condition for proceeding with this programme, we have sought and secured assurances from President Kabbah that he will pursue a twin track--diplomatic and military--approach to obtaining a lasting political peace; that recruitment for the new Sierra Leone Army will take place without ethnic discrimination; that children will not be used by the Sierra Leone Armed Forces or the Civil Defence Force; and that equipment supplied by the UK to the Government of Sierra Leone will be used only in accordance with international human rights standards and international humanitarian law.

The United Nations Arms Embargo (Amendment) (Sierra Leone) Order 1998 implements the United Nations Arms Embargo on Sierra Leone in the UK. Applications for licences under the Order in Council relating to the sale or supply of arms and related material to the Government of Sierra Leone or ECOMOG or the UN are considered on a case- by-case basis.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90330w04.htm_wqn0"><B> Mr. Nicholas Winterton: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what steps were taken by his Department to revise European Union policy to protect the United Kingdom's trading relationship with Caribbean countries within World Trade Organisation rules during the period of the United Kingdom presidency.  [79096]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90330w04.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 The UK's trading relationship with the Caribbean forms part of the wider EU relationship with the ACP countries (sub-Saharan Africa, the Caribbean and Pacific) enshrined in the Lome Convention. This provides a framework for trade, aid and political relations with the ACP. Under Lome, ACPs have open access to the EU market for industrial goods and for a wide range of agricultural products.
<P>

<a name="90330w04.htm_para0">The current (fourth) Lome Convention expires in 2000. A negotiating mandate for a new Convention was adopted under the UK Presidency at the General Affairs Council (GAC) on 29 June 1998. The Commission's draft mandate suggested that these new arrangements, after a 5-year roll-over of current arrangements to 2005, should be in the form of Free Trade Areas between the EU and groups (yet to be defined) of ACP countries. In response to the concerns of the UK and some other member states, the mandate as agreed by the Council commits us to examine the position of those ACPs not able to join in FTAs, in order to provide a new framework for trade which will offer them equivalent access to the EU market 



<P>
<P><I>30 Mar 1999 : Column: 570</I><P>
as at present under Lome. Whatever the final balance of arrangements, the EU will of course have to ensure that they are compatible with WTO rules.
<P>

<a name="90330w04.htm_para1">Those ACP countries who are unable or unwilling to enter into FTA negotiations will still be eligible for the EU Generalised System of Preferences scheme which offers entry into the EU market with reduced import tariffs. However, these provisions are not as generous as Lome and the ACP have expressed concern that they will lose their market access. The UK as Presidency worked hard to ensure a mandate which clearly indicated that the ACP would retain equivalent market access under the GSP and that GSP terms would need to be improved during the review of the scheme in 2004.
<P>

<a name="90330w04.htm_para2">We believe that these revisions reflect the interests of the Caribbean and our other Lome partners.

<a name="90330w04.htm_wqn3"><B> Mr. Nigel Jones: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what assessment he has made of the effect on British companies and information technology users of the legislation introduced in the United States of America limiting the liability and damages that can be awarded in millennium bug-related cases.  [78871]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90330w04.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Wills: </B> 
 The so-called 'Good Samaritan' legislation in the United States of America, which provides companies with limited liability protection for certain statements regarding Year 2000 compliance, is designed to stimulate public disclosure of those companies' millennium bug preparations. It has been suggested that this limited protection may lead companies and individuals to seek redress in overseas countries such as the UK. My Department has considered this issue and concluded that there is no substantive evidence to suggest that UK companies will as a result be exposed to a greater risk of litigation. I believe that, in practice, the 'Good Samaritan' legislation has to date provided no protection for US companies in lawsuits about the Bug.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if he will assess the advantages and disadvantages of introducing legislation to limit the liability and damages that can be awarded in millennium bug-related cases.  [78870]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90330w04.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Wills: </B> 
 This issue has been addressed within my Department in consideration of preparations for the millennium. It is possible that the introduction of limitations of this type would encourage companies to divulge additional information on their state of readiness, but this could unreasonably limit the availability of existing remedies available to consumers under, for example, the Sale of Goods Act 1979. The issue of disclosure in the UK is being addressed by Action 2000's Pledge 2000, whereby companies can make declarations of intent confirming their commitment to exchange information to allow others in their supply chains to prepare for the Year 2000, and to using dispute resolution outside the courts wherever possible. I believe that, on balance, the case for further legislation of this type has not been made.

 Over the past year, the Government have been undertaking a fundamental review of ECGD's financing support for UK exports, including the FREF arrangements which have been scheduled to expire on 31 March 1999. The review has included a formal consultation process and follow-up work involving ECGD, Treasury and Bank of England officials as well as representatives from the UK exporting community. A number of options are being evaluated. More time is needed to complete the review and for ECGD to negotiate with the banks an appropriate successor to the current scheme. The current arrangements are, therefore, being rolled forward for a further 6 months.

<UL>(2) what targets he has established for the generation of electricity from renewable sources.  [79086]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90330w05.htm_spnew7"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 I have today published a consultation paper "New and Renewable Energy--Prospects for the 21st Century" which reports on the outcome of the Government's review of new and renewable energy policy.
<P>

<a name="90330w05.htm_para6">The Renewables Review paper demonstrates that there is tremendous potential for renewables to become a fully competitive part of UK energy supply. Renewables make an important contribution to secure, sustainable and diverse energy supplies in the UK. They are an essential element of a cost-effective climate change programme and will help the Government meet their environmental objectives at the least cost to the customer. Renewables play a vital role in enabling the UK to meet its environmental targets of reducing greenhouse gases by 12.5% by 2012, and the goal of reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 20% by 2010.
<P>

<a name="90330w05.htm_para7">The document shows that producing 10% of UK electricity from renewables appears to be feasible. The Government intend working towards a target of renewable energy providing 10% of UK electricity supplies, cost effectively, as soon as possible. I want to achieve this by 2010. However, this should not be seen as an end in itself, but a step forward on the road to making renewables a strong, world-beating industry.
<P>

<a name="90330w05.htm_para8">There are already considerable benefits of the renewables industry. The UK industry employs 3,500 people. Through creating an export drive, and by further developing the industry and the UK market, up to 45,000 jobs could be created.
<P>

<a name="90330w05.htm_para9">The Non-Fossil Fuel Obligation (NFFO) has already provided over &#163;600 million of support for renewables. Support for renewables under NFFO will accelerate in the first decade of the next century and could rise to around &#163;150 million a year. NFFO has played a major part in stimulating the industry and bringing down the costs of renewables. As a result of NFFO, an industry of some 700 organisations has been developed. This is why the Government want to see how NFFO can evolve, and to see how it can help the industry to thrive even more.
<P>

<a name="90330w05.htm_para10">The review document therefore presents options for possible ways to support renewables while they are reaching market prices. It looks at both the costs and benefits of moving towards a greater use of renewables. In particular, it looks at options for a revised NFFO in the competitive energy markets of the future.




<P>
<P><I>30 Mar 1999 : Column: 578</I><P>

<P>

<a name="90330w05.htm_para11">In addition, the Government have provided an increased budget for DTI's New and Renewable Energy Support Programme. They have allocated &#163;43.5 million over the next three years for R&D to help achieve its aim.
<P>

<a name="90330w05.htm_para12">The Government are pressing ahead with reform--electricity liberalisation, for instance, is giving consumers the ability to choose their electricity supplier--including green electricity. Suppliers are now offering green tariffs and the Government hope consumers will take up this opportunity to stimulate growth in renewables.
<P>

<a name="90330w05.htm_para13">Solar energy also has real potential in the longer term. This is why the Government have recently asked for industry's involvement in taking forward three major new photovoltaic initiatives. In addition, last year I switched on the first solar panel system for a British school, as part of the Government's Foresight Scolar programme. I believe that such schemes can play a valuable part in the development of the UK renewables industry.
<P>

<a name="90330w05.htm_para14">This report identifies key issues and challenges which the Government and industry would need to pursue. Issues examined in the paper include: planning arrangements; opportunities for developing energy crops; and arrangements to ensure that embedded generators--those directly connected to local distribution systems, often the case with renewables producers--receive a fair price for their electricity. It seeks views on the issues raised to enable the Government to frame their future policy.
<P>

<a name="90330w05.htm_para15">I look forward to receiving those views, and plan to make a further announcement about the way forward in due course. The Government are committed to encouraging sustainable development, to ensure a better quality of life for all.

This will avoid the circularity of the COI providing the Royal Household with the funds to purchase specialist services partly from itself. Communications and information expenditure will be separately identifiable in the Report of the merged grant-in-aid prepared by the Royal Household, copies of which the Secretary of State will place annually in the Libraries of both Houses of Parliament. As now, the Memorandum of Understanding will make clear that the Department does not have any responsibility for the functions and engagements undertaken by The Queen and Members of the Royal Family or for the Royal Household's decisions on the content of the communications and information provided from the grant-in-aid.

<P>
<a name="90330w06.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Prescott: </B> 
 I have today appointed David Begg as Chair and Sir Trevor Chinn as Vice-Chair of the new Commission for Integrated Transport. The selection process for the other members of the Commission is still under way, but I hope to be able to announce the complete composition of the Commission by May. It will then begin its work of building on the consensus established around last year's Transport White Paper.
<P>

<a name="90330w06.htm_para0">David Begg, who was prominent in advising the Government during the preparation of the White Paper, has established a reputation for action in tackling Edinburgh's transport problems, and has the dynamism and commitment to make the Commission an influential voice in realising the objectives of the White Paper. Sir Trevor, who is Chairman of the motor services group Lex, will support Professor Begg by bringing an understanding of people's attitudes to transport, including the views of motorists.
<P>

<a name="90330w06.htm_para1">I am delighted that Professor Begg and Sir Trevor have agreed to work together to lead the Commission. The Commission's success in helping put integrated transport into practice will depend on it having the authority and energy to press transport policy forward. It will need to bring with it all those involved in providing transport services and all of us affected by its impacts. Professor Begg and Sir Trevor, coming from different backgrounds but sharing the same goal of a better, more sustainable transport system, are the right combination to ensure the Commission makes a real difference. Together they constitute a balanced team who look forward to establishing an effective Commission and adding real value to the transport debate.

<a name="90330w07.htm_spnew0"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 It is an offence, under section 36 of the Road Traffic Act 1988 and by virtue of the Traffic Signs Regulations 1994, to proceed beyond any stop line as shown in diagram 1001 in those Regulations and placed in conjunction with light signals when the red signal is showing. At junctions where an advance stop line for cyclists is provided Rule 154 of the current Highway Code instructs motorists that they must wait behind the first white line reached.

 <i>[holding answer 29 March 1999]:</i> The environmental impact of the Government's programme of reform of the electricity market is discussed in Annex H of the White Paper 'Conclusions of the Review of Energy Sources for Power Generation and Government response to fourth and fifth Reports from the Trade and Industry Committee' (Cm 4071). This makes clear that the new policy does not aim to achieve any particular outcome on fuel mix. The Government have therefore not sought to provide a quantification of the effect of the policy on CO <sub>2</sub>  emissions or fuel mix relative to what would have occurred in its absence. The Department of Trade and Industry is currently developing a set of scenarios on future CO <sub>2</sub>  emissions from energy use in the United Kingdom. These scenarios will take the new policy on fuels for electricity generation into account and will be

 On 1 March 1999 Ministers announced their guidance to the Director General of Water Services on the programmes of investment in environmental and water quality improvements by water and sewerage companies that he should assume in setting their price limits for the period 2000-01 to 2004-05. While the setting of price limits is the responsibility of the Director, the required investment programme of some &#163;8 billion of quality improvements over five years should allow room for significant price reductions in 2000-01. The Director will announce his provisional determinations of price limits in July.

<a name="90330w08.htm_spnew1"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 Goods vehicles with a maximum laden weight exceeding 7.5 tonnes are already banned from the outside lane of motorways with three or more lanes. We do not believe that a further restriction to the inner lane is justified for road safety reasons. It would cause a queue to form in the inner lane, moving at the speed of the slowest. Journey times are often a significant factor for hauliers, and drivers might be tempted to divert from motorways to less suitable roads through towns where accident rates are higher and there are more vulnerable road users, such as pedestrians and cyclists.

Our aim must be to reduce the rate of workplace accidents and ill-health still further, crucially by working with all stakeholders to demonstrate that a healthy, well protected workforce is not only right, but is good for business and good for society.
<P>

<a name="90330w08.htm_para2">I will launch a public consultation document, jointly with the Health and Safety Commission, in the summer to open up a debate on this important issue.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions when he proposes to publish revised planning guidance for opencast coal mining.  [79770]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90330w08.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 We have published revised Mineral Planning Guidance on Coal Mining and Colliery Spoil Disposal today. This meets the major concerns expressed in the 10 Point Plan for Opencast Coal issued before the General Election and firmly puts the interests of protecting the environment and local communities first.
<P>

<a name="90330w08.htm_para3">The revised guidance takes account of our pre-election commitments, the final conclusions of the Energy review published in October 1998 and the responses to the draft guidance issued for public consultation in October 1998.
<P>

<a name="90330w08.htm_para4">The guidance will ensure that planning permission for opencast coal mining is only given where the development is environmentally acceptable or provides over-riding local or community benefits. If neither of these requirements is met, there should be a presumption against opencast coal.

All donations by landfill site operators through the scheme are voluntary, although they can receive landfill tax credits of 90 per cent. against their donations.

 I received representations on this subject during a recent meeting with the Chairman of the National Council of Hotels Associations. The matter has also been raised with me by tourism business people during visits to various parts of England. The Government have no current plans to amend the "six-person test" for non-domestic rates, although matters such as these are kept under review.

In addition, the North West has benefited from Watson Steel of Bolton winning the contract to provide the steel for the structure of the Dome.

<P>
<a name="90330w09.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Aghalane Bridge was destroyed in an explosion on 21 November 1972 by a person or persons unknown, but believed to have been a Loyalist paramilitary group.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90330w09.htm_wqn2"><B> Mr. Maginnis: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what is the projected cost for the reconstruction of the Aghalane Bridge; what proportion of the bridge is in Northern Ireland; and what are the respective shares of the total cost of reinstatement to be borne by British and Irish Republic public funds.  [78274]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90330w09.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The projected cost of the contract for the reconstruction of Aghalane Bridge is expected to be &#163;862,000. The British Government are bearing the full cost of the reconstructed bridge and have received &#163;500,000 grant aid from the European Regional Development Fund, Special Support Programme for Peace and Reconciliation.
<P>

<a name="90330w09.htm_para0">In addition to the projected cost of &#163;862,000, the scheme to reconstruct the bridge has attracted additional costs arising out from the geotechnical investigation, consultant's fees and laboratory charges, which are estimated to amount to &#163;45,000. These costs have been included as part of the road-works for the northern approach to the bridge.
<P>

<a name="90330w09.htm_para1">The reconstructed bridge is 30 metres long, 15 metres of which is on the Northern Ireland side of the border.

extent approach works in the Irish Republic have been <i>(a)</i> managed, <i>(b)</i> paid for and <i>(c)</i> subsidised by the Department of the Environment (NI).  [78273]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90330w09.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 DEO(NI) Roads Service has been involved only in the construction of the Northern approach to the bridge, including such work on the Southern side of the Woodford River as was necessary to construct the bridge. To date, the cost of these roadworks is estimated to be &#163;1,930,720, including a projected expenditure of &#163;292,152 in the coming financial year. In addition to the construction costs, this estimate includes the cost of geotechnical investigations, consultant's fees and laboratory charges, as well as an allowance for land acquisition and landscaping.

 RUC records indicate that one terrorist incident took place in that immediate area, the murder of Thomas (part-time UDR) and Emily Bullock at their home at Killynick on 21 September 1972. The Northern Ireland Office did receive claims, which I understand were later withdrawn.

 Beef is a vital part of the livestock industry in Wales and my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Wales has taken a number of measures to promote quality beef produced by our farmers. A Welsh Agri-Food Action Plan for the Lamb and Beef sector, drawn up by the industry, was launched on 8 March with the support of the Welsh Office and the WDA.

 It is not possible to provide the information requested, as there is no generally recognised definition of a spree offender.

<a name="90330w11.htm_para13">The Government's definition of a persistent young offender is: a young person aged 10-17 who has been sentenced by any criminal court in the United Kingdom on three or more separate occasions for one or more recordable offence, and within three years of the last sentencing occasion is subsequently arrested or has information against him for a further recordable offence.In this context, "recordable" means the class of offences that must be recorded on the Police National Computer. This class of offences is generally broader than the "standard list". This means that the percentages quoted above relate to a category of persistent young offenders that is more restrictive than the Government definition. It should also be noted that it is not possible to determine the percentage of convictions and cautions accounted for by this group.

 It is not possible to present a full picture of the offences committed by young people aged 10 to 17 because much crime is not reported and not all reported crime is cleared up. The best indicator we have of youth crime is the number of young people known to have been involved in offending, that is, who have been cautioned by the police for, or convicted by the courts of, a crime.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, pursuant to his answer of 24 March 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>237</i>, what is the minimum possible tariff to be served by a person serving a life sentence following a conviction for murder.  [79084]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90330w12.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 The tariff is set by the Secretary of State following consideration of advice from the judiciary on the punitive period necessary to satisfy the requirements of retribution and general deferrence. Tariff length varies according to the circumstances of the particular offence and there is no minimum period. However, tariffs of less than eight years for murder would be set only in exceptional circumstances.

 The Operation Lancet inquiry into allegations of police corruption in Cleveland is being supervised by the Police Complaints Authority (PCA), and it is for the PCA to monitor the progress of the inquiry. The length of the investigation is a matter for the investigating officer and the PCA. I have not discussed the inquiry with the PCA. It would not be appropriate for me to comment on criminal or disciplinary investigations, including Operation Lancet, not least because my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary has a role in the disciplinary process as the appellate authority, and my right hon. Friend may in the future be called upon in that capacity to consider any disciplinary appeals from offenders arising from this inquiry.
<P>

<a name="90330w12.htm_para0">No police officers have been charged with offences as a result of Operation Lancet inquiry to date, but the inquiry is continuing and I understand that a number of possible criminal and disciplinary matters are still under investigation. There has been close consultation with the

<P>
<a name="90330w12.htm_spnew8"><B> Kate Hoey: </B> 
 The document entitled "Review of Football-related Legislation" set out 29 proposals for discussion on measures to help to prevent and minimise football hooliganism at designated football matches in England and Wales and overseas.
<P>

<a name="90330w12.htm_para7">The consultation period ended on 27 January and some 50 responses were received from organisations and individuals. The overwhelming response to the measures was supportive. Respondents to the document as a whole recognised the need for measures to be introduced to deal with the loopholes in the present legislation. They also indicated strong support for those proposals aimed at dealing with measures to help to prevent those convicted of football-related offences from attending designated football matches. I am placing a summary of the responses in the Library.
<P>

<a name="90330w12.htm_para8">The response to the public consultation exercise has been made known to the hon. Member for West Chelmsford (Mr. Burns) whose Bill, the Football (Offences and Disorder) Bill, is due for its Second Reading on 16 April.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90330w13.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 We have received representations from a number of voluntary organisations, including the Scout Association, about charging for checks from the Criminal Records Bureau. We considered very carefully whether there was any way in which free checks could be provided for volunteers. While we acknowledge the valuable contribution volunteers make, we have concluded that it 



<P>
<P><I>30 Mar 1999 : Column: 609</I><P>
would not be practicable to provide any free checks from the Criminal Records Bureau for volunteers or for any other groups.
<P>

<a name="90330w13.htm_para0">We realise that this is unwelcome news, but providing free checks would prove an unsustainable burden on the public purse and may increase demand for certificates from the bureau to an uncontrollable extent. In addition, we do not consider it would be fair to allow volunteers to have free certificates when there are other equally deserving groups, such as the unemployed or the disabled. The cost of the fees for certificates from the bureau will be kept to the minimum necessary to recoup costs.

[79508]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90330w13.htm_spnew2"><B> Kate Hoey: </B> 
 The Government place considerable importance on there being effective community consultation on policing matters. Police and Community Consultative Groups (PCGGs) play a major role in this process, as I emphasised in the debate on section 17 of the Greater London Authority Bill in Standing Committee A on 16 March 1999, <i>Official Report,</i> columns 1276-82. PCCGs are not statutory bodies--but they are the primary means by which many police authorities choose to discharge their duty to obtain the views of local people.
<P>

<a name="90330w13.htm_para3">When the Metropolitan Police Authority (MPA) is created, it will take on the duty, currently held by the Metropolitan police Commissioner, of obtaining the views of people in the Metropolitan police district. It will be for the MPA to decide how best to discharge this duty, just as police authorities elsewhere in England and Wales must decide how best to obtain the views of people in their area. If the MPA considers that PCCGs are working well, we have every reason to believe that it will want to retain them.

<a name="90330w13.htm_para4">Section 1A of the Fatal Accidents Act 1996 provides for bereavement damages to be claimed by the parents of unmarried children who are under the age of 18. This applies to both parents where the child was legitimate, and to the mother only in the case of an illegitimate child. This is an area which we keep regularly under review. The Law Commission considered bereavement damages in its consultation paper "Claims for Wrongful Death" (Consultation Paper No. 148) and hopes to produce its report later this year. The Government will consider the Law Commission's recommendations carefully when they are received.

In any event the doctrine of the separation of powers is well understood by the judiciary as a whole.

This confirmed that Scottish census returns would not be made available until 100 years after the census to which they relate, and that only in exceptional circumstances could closed census returns be accessed.

<a name="90330w17.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Bayley: </B> 
 The report of the National Carers' Strategy is an important document for all Government Departments. As an employer we recognise the importance of personnel policies which meet the needs of our staff, a number of whom have caring responsibilities for elderly, sick or disabled relatives. Without such policies, it would be difficult to recruit and retain the best people and significant numbers of our staff would be unable to achieve their full potential. It is clearly in our business interests to ensure that our workforce is committed and contented and this means that we must take account of caring commitments. Our policies have developed and are still developing in line with the changing requirements of staff whilst taking account of the National Carers Strategy.
<P>

<a name="90330w17.htm_para0">All of the Department's business units have recently been involved in reviews of their childcare and family friendly policies. One of the outcomes of this assessment is that there is a need to communicate our strategy for staff with caring responsibilities more effectively. Consequently the Benefits Agency issued a booklet, "Work and Family" to all its staff in November and DSS HQ are intending to do the same.
<P>

<a name="90330w17.htm_para1">Where staff are involved in designing and implementing policy initiatives and commitments, such as the Single Work Focused Gateway and the State Second Pension, we are already taking steps to ensure that they will receive the appropriate information and training to support the Strategy's main objectives.

<a name="90330w17.htm_para3">The information is not available for the years 2010 and 2020. Previous estimates of the number of pensioners receiving Income Support in these years have been made using the Department's PENSIM model. These estimates can only give a broad indication of the likely order of magnitude of figures so far into the future, and are heavily rounded. Reliable estimates of sub-groups of this caseload and therefore of the proportion of pensioners aged 65 to 69 who are receiving Income Support are not available.

1. Figures are given to the nearest 10,000 pensioner benefit units, although they are not necessarily accurate to that degree. Figures of less than 5,000 pensioners are denoted by '*'.<P>

2. Figures may not sum to row or column totals due to rounding.<P>

3. Figures should be treated with caution since taxpaying status is not directly measured by the Family Resources Survey, but has been imputed using a model based on policies announced up to and including the 1998 Budget statement.<P>

4. Pensioner benefit units are defined as single people aged 60 and over and couples (married or cohabiting) where at least one partner is aged over State pension age (65 and over, for men, 60 and over for women). Couples are allocated to age bands according to the age of the older partner.<P>

5. Tax paying pensioner benefit units are defined as those where at least one individual in the benefit unit is modelled as liable to income tax.<P>

2. It is likely that the upper threshold of &#163;18,500 contained in the Green Paper will be revised upwards following consultation to reflect the policy intention that higher earners should get broadly the same entitlement from phase 1 of State Second Pension as from SERPS.<P>

3. The hypothetical individual in this example is assumed to; begin work at 16 years old in 2002, work for 49 years until retirement, earn the specified amounts in 1998 earnings terms throughout their working life.<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security what assessment he has made of the level of non-pension saving among those in the &#163;9,000-&#163;18,500 earnings range who are not currently members of an occupational or personal pension scheme.  [78866]<P>

 Data drawn from the 1997-98 Family Resources Survey (GB) suggest that, of those earning between &#163;9,000 and &#163;18,500 in 1997-98 and who, at that time, were not a member of an occupational or personal pension scheme, 40 per cent. had no non-pension saving.

 The information is not available in the format requested. However, in the financial year 1997-98, a total of 9,053 Social Fund loan applications were refused purely because the applicant had reached the loan limit of &#163;1,000. This represents around 1 per cent. of all loan refusals.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90330w18.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 No. It is expected that the earnings used for calculating rebates for stakeholder pension schemes will be the same as for other contracted-out pension schemes. Such earnings do not currently include any payment of Family Credit and will not include payments of Working Families Tax Credit when it is introduced.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90330w19.htm_spnew4"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 This question cannot be answered in the form in which it has been tabled. Education SSAs have a wider coverage than funding which can be allocated to schools. They have to cover costs such as home-to-school transport, school meals, and some central costs which cannot be delegated to schools, such as the LEA contribution to the Standards Fund. In addition, 



<P>
<P><I>30 Mar 1999 : Column: 631</I><P>
pupils are counted at different dates for the purposes of calculating education SSAs and allocating school funding respectively.

<P>
<a name="90330w19.htm_spnew5"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 No "like-for like" data exist on total expenditure in Derbyshire on education over the last five years from all public sources of funds. The following table sets out Derbyshire's overall education spending, net of specific grants, in each of the last five years but it is not possible to adjust the figures for each year to take account of local government reorganisation and changes in local authority functions, such as the reform of inter-authority recoupment or the nursery voucher scheme, to give a true picture. Since we took office, some &#163;18 million has been supported through the Standards Fund programme in Derbyshire and the authority has 



<P>
<P><I>30 Mar 1999 : Column: 632</I><P>
received capital allocations of some &#163;18 million. There has been an underlying increase in Derbyshire's education SSA for 1999-2000 of &#163;15.6 million or 6.1 per cent.

<a name="90330w20.htm_spnew0"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 This question cannot be answered in the form in which it has been tabled. Expenditure and income for the school meal service will inevitably vary according to the proportion of children entitled to free school meals and of children attending grant-maintained schools in the area of each Local Education Authority.

 Since New Deal Pathfinders were introduced in January 1998, unemployment amongst the

eligible group has fallen by 35 per cent. compared with a fall of 4 per cent. for those not eligible.
<P>

<a name="90330w20.htm_para0">The youth labour market is very dynamic and so some people would have left the claimant count without the help provided by New Deal. Nevertheless, initial evidence comparing Pathfinder with non-Pathfinder areas suggests that the New Deal has increased the flows of young people out of unemployment and the flow into jobs. The impact of New Deal is being addressed through a comprehensive evaluation programme. All final reports from the evaluation will be published and copies placed in the Library.

 The programme announced by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State on 22 March 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 21-22 to raise standards in inner cities applies in the first instance in six target areas only. The lessons learnt during the "Excellence in Cities" programme will in time benefit all schools. Watford schools already benefit from our national policies to raise standards and from the significant additional investment which the Government are making in the education system.

 In last year's Budget statement my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced an additional &#163;50 million investment in the New Deal Gateway, of which &#163;10 million was allocated to enhance specialist provision to help with such problems as homelessness and drug or alcohol dependency. More recently New Deal personal advisers have been reminded of the need to make full use of the help available from partner organisations, including specialist agencies. We are also currently developing more effective ways of assessing at an early stage in the Gateway whether young people are in particular need of specialist help.
<P>

<a name="90330w22.htm_para0">I will shortly be inviting New Deal partnerships to submit proposals for innovative approaches to delivering New Deal locally which we might support from our new Innovation Fund. My right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced additional resources for the Fund in this year's Budget. One of the priority areas for support will be proposals to implement recommendations from the New Deal Task Force report, "Meeting the needs of disadvantaged young people". I hope that some partnerships will come forward with proposals to implement and test out the report's recommendation that specialist agencies could provide effective case- management for young people with particularly severe problems during their time on New Deal.

<a name="90330w22.htm_spnew2"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 Mortality rates in some groups of young men are cause for concern. In those aged 30-34, specifically, there has been a progressive increase in rates since 1986 associated, for instance, with increased deaths from suicides, drug and alcohol abuse and infectious diseases (e.g. AIDS). These offset reductions in deaths from other causes (e.g. accidents, cancer and heart disease). The "Independent Inquiry into Inequalities in Health" highlighted, for example, suicide rates in young men and some action has already been taken. Reducing health inequalities is a key aim of our health strategy and the forthcoming "Our Healthier Nation" White Paper will focus on relevant conditions.

<P>
<a name="90330w22.htm_spnew7"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The investing in dentistry (IID) initiative, which we launched in September 1997, and the personal dental services (PDS) scheme, which we announced on 1 January 1998, can both help to improve access to national health service dentistry. IID provides grants to enable dentists to expand existing practices and set up new ones in those areas of the country where the provision of NHS dental services is inadequate and oral health inequalities are most acute. PDS encourages health authorities to work with dentists to develop a variety of new arrangements to improve access to NHS dentistry.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90330w22.htm_spnew9"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 Investing in dentistry has been extremely effective. We have approved over &#163;8 million of grants which will enable around 650,000 people to receive access to national health service dentistry. All dentists receiving grants will be monitored by their health authority to ensure that the conditions of the grant are met; if the dentist does not meet the commitment to provide NHS dentistry to the number of people specified, the grant can be reclaimed in whole or in part.

The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists aim to complete their third, and final, set of evidence-based clinical guidelines on infertility this autumn and these will indicate the circumstances in which infertility treatment can be most clinically effective. We can then move towards fairer access to national health service infertility services, where those most able to benefit from such treatment receive it.

 Funds for specific services or aspects of treatment provided by the national health service are not separately identified either nationally or within individual health authority or NHS trust allocations. The pressures on renal services were identified during the comprehensive spending review process and were taken into account when calculating the final settlement for the NHS. However, it is for individual HAs to decide the resources which should be devoted to the provision of renal services in the context of local priorities and needs. The "National Priorities Guidance 1999/2000-2001/02" makes it clear that this is an area where HAs are expected to secure improvements.

<a name="90330w24.htm_para1">Information about the cost of treatment classified by disease is not routinely collected locally, hence there is no collation of such data centrally. However, approximately 6.3 per cent. of national health service hospital expenditure is on cancer.
<P>

<a name="90330w24.htm_para2">The Government fund health and medical research in a number of ways. The Department funds research and development to support its work on policy development and evaluation in health and social care. The Department also manages the national health service research and development levy, which is used to support research and development of relevance to the national health service in hospitals, general practice and other health care settings, and to fund the NHS research and development programme. In addition, the Medical Research Council (MRC), which receives most of its income via grant-in-aid from the Office of Science and Technology in the Department of Trade and Industry, funds medical research as part of the Government's funding of the science and engineering base.
<P>

<a name="90330w24.htm_para3">Management of much of the research supported by the NHS research and development levy is devolved, and details of expenditure at project level are not collected routinely by the Department. During 1997-98, the Department invested the following amount on directly commissioned research: &#163;187,000 on lung cancer; &#163;29,000 on prostate cancer; &#163;832,000 on breast cancer and &#163;197,000 on bowel cancer.
<P>

<a name="90330w24.htm_para4">During 1997-98, the MRC spent &#163;691,000 on lung cancer; &#163;18,000 on prostate cancer; &#163;3,328,000 on breast cancer and &#163;1,469,000 on bowel cancer. The MRC's figures relate to research specifically into these named cancers, and research which has been classified as being undertaken in one of these sites may well have implications in another and vice versa. As a guide, the MRC spent &#163;13.2 million on cancer in 1994-95.

 Our overall objective is that the public should have access to a wide range of safe, high-quality herbal medicines with appropriate information about the use of the product. There are currently two contrasting routes to the market for herbal medicines. Licensed herbal medicines have to meet rigorous standards of safety, quality and efficacy. Unlicensed herbal remedies in the UK do not have to meet any specific standards for safety, quality or efficacy.
<P>

<a name="90330w25.htm_para4">We fully share the view, which was expressed at a recent meeting held by my noble Friend Baroness Hayman, by a range of organisations working in the natural health sector, that the current regulatory arrangements for herbal medicines have significant weaknesses and require review. The regime for unlicensed medicines does not give systematic protection to the public against low-quality and unsafe unlicensed herbal remedies which are known to reach the UK market. Nor does it permit manufacturers legally to give written information to consumers about the intended use of the product. In contrast, elements of the regime for licensed medicines--particularly some of the efficacy requirements--are difficult for responsible companies to satisfy in relation to herbal medicines. We believe that there is a need to work towards arrangements which provide better protection and information to the public, while continuing to allow responsible business and practitioners to operate effectively.
<P>

<a name="90330w25.htm_para5">We have asked the Medicines Control Agency to examine options for achieving our objectives for herbal medicines, consulting widely with interested organisations. Medicines law operates within a European framework. Accordingly, we will need to develop a position which is realistically achievable within the European Union. We intend to participate actively and constructively in any on-going EU discussions about future regulatory arrangements for herbal medicines.

 Bovine somatotropin (BST) occurs naturally in all cows milk. The manufactured form of BST is not currently permitted for use in the EU. If its use were to be authorised, it would be classified as a veterinary medicinal product. Products have previously been assessed by independent scientific committees against the statutory criteria of safety, quality and efficacy. I asked the independent Veterinary Products Committee to set up a Working Group, which is currently consulting the latest scientific information on animal and human safety, and the Committee is expected to offer advice to Ministers on the safety of BST in the summer.

Furthermore, although statistics are collected on the number and weight of seizures of illicit drugs, we have no measure at present of the overall size of the drugs market, or the percentage of illegal drugs seized, which would allow comparisons to be made.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will announce the timetable for the introduction of legislation to enable cash and fund-of-fund open-ended investment companies to be launched in the UK domestic market; and when authorisation of cash and fund-of-fund open-ended investment companies will enable ISA providers to promote such companies as an alternative to authorised unit trust schemes.  [79344]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90330w28.htm_spnew2"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 The Financial Services and Markets Bill will include a provision to make orders allowing the formation of a wide range of open-ended investment companies (oeics). The aim will be to create a single corporate code for all authorised oeics. The Financial Services Authority will then be able to authorise oeics with a broad range of investment objectives. These could include cash and fund-of-fund open-ended investment companies.
<P>

<a name="90330w28.htm_para2">Existing cash and fund-of-fund authorised unit trusts are eligible for inclusion in ISAs. Changes to the tax regulations permitting cash and fund-of-fund open-ended investment companies to be offered as ISA products will be introduced once these are established in law and are authorised by the Financial Services Authority.

<P>
<a name="90330w28.htm_spnew3"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 In line with the Statement of Intent on Environmental Taxation, the Government considered carefully the potential impact of the climate change levy on the international competitiveness of United Kingdom industry. The design of the levy closely follows Lord Marshall's recommendations. Its introduction will 



<P>
<P><I>30 Mar 1999 : Column: 666</I><P>
involve no increase in the overall burden of taxation on business. The Government intend to recycle the revenues to business through a cut of 0.5 percentage points in the main rate of employer National Insurance Contributions. Businesses will also benefit from an additional &#163;50 million for schemes aimed at providing energy efficiency directly and stimulating the take-up of renewable sources of energy.
<P>

<a name="90330w28.htm_para3">The Government also recognise the need for special consideration to be given to the position of energy intensive industries given their energy usage, the separate Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control regulation and their exposure to international competition. In line with the recommendations made by the CBI, the Government will not be taking a blanket "across the board" approach to setting the appropriate level of the new levy. Subject to any legal and practical constraints, the Government intend to set significantly lower rates for those energy intensive sectors that agree targets for improving energy efficiency which meet the Government's criteria.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will establish criteria for defining an energy-intensive industry, to be exempted from the new energy tax; and if he will publish a ranked list of manufacturing sectors in terms of their energy intensity.  [79197]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90330w28.htm_spnew4"><B> Ms Hewitt </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 29 March 1999]:</i> The Chancellor announced in the recent Budget that, subject to any legal and practical constraints, the Government intend to set significantly lower rates for energy intensive sectors that agree targets for improving energy efficiency. Sites in sectors covered by the EU Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control Directive will be eligible. The Deputy Prime Minister, along with Ministers from the DTI and HM Treasury, met with the energy intensive sectors on 29 March to begin these negotiations.
<P>

<a name="90330w28.htm_para4">Lord Marshall's report, "Economic Instruments and the Business Use of Energy", which was published on 3 November 1998, contains an analysis of energy intensity by business sector.

<P>
<a name="90330w28.htm_wqn5"><B> Dr. Cable: </B>

<P>
<P>
<a name="90330w28.htm_spnew5"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 In the draft Regulatory Impact Assessment published by Customs and Excise on 9 March they commented that we expect that fewer than 1,000 businesses will be liable to account for the levy. Following Custom's consultation a more accurate figure will be calculated.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90330w28.htm_spnew6"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 It will be for energy suppliers to decide how they pass on the climate change levy to their business customers. We expect most suppliers to include it in the unit price, but it will be up to them to choose whether to identify it as a separate amount.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90330w28.htm_wqn7"><B> Dr. Cable: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what steps the Government have taken to ensure that their proposed energy tax is compliant with <i>(a)</i> the rules of EU Single Market and <i>(b)</i> the rules of the World Trade Organisation.  [79189]

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90330w28.htm_spnew7"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 The EU rules governing the harmonisation of taxes within the Single Market permit member states to introduce national taxes provided they do not give rise to border-crossing formalities in trade between member states, nor infringe State Aid rules. Customs and Excise's consultation paper on the design and administration of the levy, published on 9 March, proposes a treatment of the imports and exports of energy products which meets our obligations concerning trade between member states. And following the announcement of the climate change levy in the Budget, I informed the European Commission of the Government's announcement. The Government are working closely with the European Commission to help ensure that the proposed scheme to set significantly lower rates for energy intensive sectors that agree targets for improving energy efficiency is compatible with State Aid rules. In doing so, we shall also take into account our obligations under the World Trade Organisation.

 <i>[holding answer 22 February 1999]:</i> The Government are committed to providing modern public services which are responsive to the needs of the public. Although the Treasury undertakes various public opinion research, this is usually in the form of business and economic surveys. The Treasury has not commissioned specific public opinion polls since 1 May 1997.

 The Millennium Gift Aid scheme is for donations to UK charities to support education and anti-poverty projects in the world's poorest countries. Donations to support services provided in the UK would generally not qualify.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what assessment he has made of the recent report of the Financial Services Agency on millennium compliance; and if he will make a statement.  [79385]<P>

 As the FSA has made clear, the primary responsibility for ensuring high levels of Year 2000 preparedness lies with the industry itself. But the FSA regards the issue as a major supervisory priority. It recently made public, on an aggregated basis, its assessment of the state of readiness in financial institutions. The UK financial services sector is generally regarded as a leader in working towards Year 2000 preparedness. Within that overall picture, though, a small number of firms appears to be less ready than others. The FSA has challenged these firms either to show that this assessment is out of date or rapidly produce a plan for remedial action. It has also made clear that--where there is no better way to protect depositors, investors or policyholders or the integrity of markets--it will take supervisory action.
<P>

<a name="90330w29.htm_para1">The decisions on whether to take such action are the statutory responsibility of the FSA, though the Treasury will continue to liaise closely with them.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will establish a review of the estimated &#163;1.5 billion of mis-sold endowment mortgages on the same basis as the recent pensions mis-selling review.  [79187]<P>
<P>

 The Financial Services Authority has confirmed that it is currently gathering information with a view to considering if such a review is necessary.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what estimate he has made of the impact on employment of a 5 per cent. increase in the value of the pound against the euro, assuming no other changes of policy or external circumstance over a two-year period.  [79213]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90330w29.htm_spnew6"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 Assuming that the exchange rate were to increase with all other things remaining equal, there would tend to be a depressing effect on output, employment, and inflation in the short term. However, this is a wholly artificial assumption, not least because the Bank of England is required to set interest rates to hit a symmetrical inflation target.
