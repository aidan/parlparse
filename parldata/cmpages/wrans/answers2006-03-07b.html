<p><a name="st_38"><a name="60307w04.html_spnew6"><b> Jane Kennedy  </b> 
<i>[holding answer 2 March 2006]:</i> The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency&#039;s (MHRA) Sentinel programme, began in 2002 following formal Government procurement processes. The expected life of the programme is 10 years and to date has cost around &#163;19 million, which incorporates enhancements to the scope of the original programme. The MHRA is currently using Sentinel to handle all applications for marketing authorisations and variations, for clinical trial certificates and for import and export licences, as well as a range of internal corporate functions, and will soon extend Sentinel to pharmacovigilence, including new capabilities for signal generation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60307w04.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_27">Recently assessment approval times have lengthened, mainly due to delays in validating applications, and assessment targets are not being met in a proportion of cases although urgent cases are being processed promptly. Some technical problems were encountered when parts of the Sentinel programme were implemented, which is not unusual for a project of this complexity, but those have been or are being resolved. Positive improvements have already been achieved and more are forecast. Sentinel&#039;s development is founded in its ability to handle electronic submissions and as industry increases its use of the external portal for this purpose, the workflow will be further streamlined.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60307w04.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_28">Sentinel completely revolutionises the MHRA&#039;s approach to information management and processing and will put the them in a leading position in its ability to handle electronic submissions, attract revenues from within and outside the United Kingdom and to remain a centre of excellence for medicines regulation. It will enable improved access to information to assist in the protection of public health and provide a better service to all its stakeholders.

As far as policy on forestry is concerned, the Government are working closely with the NGO Global Witness on how best to protect Burma&#039;s forests. Their recent report, &quot;A Choice for China&quot; calls for a ban on illegally logged timber. It did not, however, support a ban on all timber from Burma in recognition of the complexity of the problem. Instead, Global Witness called for timber companies not to import illegally logged timber, and for the Chinese Government to suspend importation of logs and processed timber across the China-Burma border. This is pending a review of the legality of all logging operations in Kachin state. Global Witness&#039;s work has had a significant impact in Burma, and as a result of their highlighting this problem, the State Peace and Development Council and the Chinese Government have taken steps to clamp down on the illegal trade. According to Global Witness, the destructive logging and vast timber trade on the China-Burma border have come to a near halt over the past four months although it is not clear how permanent such moves will be.

As no charges have been paid before, the Government decided to ease the transition towards full cost recovery, phasing in the charges gradually over a three-year period. The new affordability tariff in Northern Ireland will be based on income and set at a level equivalent to 3 per cent. of the single person&#039;s pension credit guarantee, as updated by Parliament each year.

<i>[holding answer 27 February 2006]:</i> The Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH) is wholly owned by the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC). NERC science budget allocation has doubled since 1997 to 334 million for this year, demonstrating our commitment to maintaining the quality of environmental research in the UK. NERC is responsible for determining the details of how this funding is allocated to specific activities. NERC is currently considering the input from a wide consultation with stakeholders on proposals on how best CEH can contribute on a sustainable basis to UK environmental science in the future.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60307w16.html_para11">
<a name="stpa_125">NERC has set out the criteria used in developing the proposals in the CEH Business Plan (available on the NERC website). The proposals were informed by assessments by an international peer review and a moderating panel, leading to recommendations to NERC Council from NERC&#039;s Science and Innovation Strategy Board. This included assessment of the science quality, value for money and the fit of the CEH science proposal to NERC&#039;s strategy. In addition, there was input from a strategic review of CEH conducted by independent consultants in 2005, which enabled NERC to estimate the likely level of future commissioned research income that CEH could expect to win. NERC also factored in the necessary level of future investment in the facilities for the research carried out by CEH.

The tree at NPL is one of a number of similar descendants around the world. Public access to this tree is not possible but a similar, and perhaps more directly related, tree can be seen at Woolsthorpe Manor, which is in the care of the National Trust.

 Under UN Treaties, the Government are internationally responsible for activities in outer space carried on by its nationals, and assumes certain liabilities for damage caused to third parties as a result of those activities. The Department administers the Outer Space Act 1986, which requires that such space activities be licensed. Anyone who carries on a licensable activity gives an unlimited indemnity to the Government against claims. The Department seeks to secure indemnification in part by requiring &#163;100 million insurance cover. If the insurance policy proved insufficient to cover a particular claim, the licensee would be required to indemnify the Government of the excess. However, if the licensee were unable to meet this, the Government would have to fund the remainder from its own resources. Hence, there is a contingent liability.

 We keep under review the use of reduced rates for construction work where these could help support regeneration and renewal, and to date have targeted relief at areas of specific need, such as certain residential conversions (including converting a non-residential property into single household dwellings or converting a house into flats) and the renovation of housing that has been empty for more than three years. These measures have helped bring vacant homes back into use and create new homes through better use of the UK&#039;s existing housing stock. However, a blanket reduced rate for all household repairs is unlikely to be an efficient or well-targeted use of resources.

 The Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (DARD) is working closely with the Department of Agriculture and Food (DAF) in the Republic of Ireland in taking measures to deal with the threat of avian influenza. Given the mutual interest in ensuring that any outbreak on the island is identified quickly as a first step to its eradication and recognising the importance of the poultry industry, DARD officials have had frequent contact with their counterparts in Dublin over recent months to exchange information and discuss the respective approaches. These discussions have covered such issues as wild bird surveillance, the assessment of risk, preventive actions taken to date in both jurisdictions, and contingency planning. DAF officials have participated as observers in the exercises DARD has held to test its contingency plan and DARD officials have participated as observers in the Republic of Ireland. DARD has been invited to send an observer to meetings of the recently convened Republic of Ireland&#039;s Avian Influenza Expert Advisory Group.

 The Department has issued guidance to schools indicating that wherever possible preference should be given to newly qualified teachers, or experienced teachers seeking to return to employment, rather than prematurely retired teachers, when filling vacancies. Schools have also been advised that they should recruit to vacancies on a permanent rather than temporary basis unless the vacancy is clearly of a temporary nature.

 It was disappointing that the European Court of Auditors (EGA) was unable last November to give a positive Statement of Assurance on the EC Budget for 2004. It is encouraging, however, that there have been noticeable improvements since 2003 with pre-accession expenditure once again being cleared, as it was in 2002, and, for the first time, certain areas of agricultural expenditure also gaining clearance. This has meant that around 35 per cent. of EC Budget expenditure was cleared in 2004 compared with only 6 per cent. in 2003. Much of the European Court of Auditors&#039; difficulty in giving a positive assurance on the EU budget payments as a whole arises in the budget sector managed by the member states, who are responsible for 80 per cent. of spending under the EU budget. That is why, during our Presidency, we encouraged member states to take on a greater share of the responsibility for signing off the accounts. We succeeded in securing an agreement that will contribute to bringing about a step change in the EU&#039;s financial management and control at a meeting of EU Economic and Finance Ministers on 8 November 2005. We hope that, over time, implementation of the action points in these conclusions will enable the EGA to give positive Statements of Assurance to the EC Budget in future years.

This will be a challenging task&#151;merging the two governments involves downsizing from 27 to 16 Ministries and reunifying some 400,000 civil servants from the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) and more than 500,000 civil servants from the Kurdish Democratic Party (KDP).

 Our Welfare Reform Green Paper; &quot;A new deal for welfare, Empowering people for work&quot;; set out our proposals for the future of the welfare state and builds on the success of our welfare to work policies such as new deal and Pathways to Work.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60307w34.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_257">The funding for welfare reform has been drawn from the budgets provided to the Department through the 2004 Spending Review settlement which covered the financial years 2005&#150;06 to 2007&#150;08. Details are available in The departmental report 2005 (Cm 6539) published in June 2005. The &#163;360 million funding is largely to be spent extending the Pathways to Work programme beyond the pilot areas and covers 2006&#150;07 and 2007&#150;08, but may also be used to fund other measures dependent on responses to the consultation.

<a name="stpa_258">While we are still in the consultation phase a detailed costing of the various parts of our proposals is not possible. This is especially the case in relation to the costs for each Pathways to Work scheme as we are looking to the private and voluntary sector to deliver many of the Pathways schemes and it is not possible to provide detailed costs prior to contract negotiations. This is also the case when it comes to the need for additional medical professionals where we are consulting to develop the detail of the new personal capability assessment.

<p>
<a name="60307w34.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_259">However, I can tell you that if every current incapacity benefit recipient was given a work focussed interview at least once a year, we estimate the cost would be around &#163;80 million annually. The actual costs would be dependent on the numbers joining and leaving the benefit during any one year. But, although the cost savings from measures outlined in the Green Paper depend to a large extent on the final proposals following the consultation, we know that the existing Pathways pilots are already generating savings, and we expect further savings from further roll-out.

Where these checks produce doubt about the nature or extent of an individual&#039;s incapacity, a fresh personal capability assessment will be required.

 The Government commissioned an Independent Review into the Supporting People programme following significant late growth in estimated costs from &#163;1.4 billion in December 2002 to &#163;1.8 billion by March 2003. The review reported in January 2004 that there are wide variations in unit costs between authorities and that &#163;1.8 billion was too much to pay for the services provided.

We continue to keep the impact of VAT on different types of building work under review, and have introduced reduced rates where they support our regeneration and renewal objectives. However, while agreements with our European partners allow us to keep our zero rates as they currently stand, we cannot extend them or introduce new ones. This means that in order to

 For a number of reasons it will not always be possible to authorise the release within 24 hours of the death. The body of a homicide victim may, for example, require forensic analysis. Early release will also depend on the availability of pathologists to conduct post mortem examinations. But coroners fully appreciate the need to release bodies quickly following a coroner&#039;s post-mortem examination, and are particularly sensitive to the requirements of faith groups.

 The Government of Iraq, together with the UK and other donors, has made significant progress with reconstruction since 2003; but there is still a long way to go. Once a relatively wealthy country with high levels of education and healthcare, by 2003 Iraq had suffered more than 20 years of conflict, mismanagement and chronic under-investment from a brutal regime.

With help from donors, including DFID, the interim Government negotiated an emergency post-conflict agreement with the IMF, paving the way for the Paris Club debt reduction deal.

 Since the Global Fund began its operations in 2002, the International Community, including public and private donors has pledged and/or contributed a total of US $8.6 billion to support the institution&#039;s work through to 2008. This is a substantial achievement for such a young institution and has helped to dramatically increase international funding to combat the three diseases over the last four years. During the September 2005 Replenishment conference, the Global Fund achieved pledges of US $3.7 billion against its estimated resource needs of US $7 billion for 2006 and 2007 which has allowed it to finance all ongoing projects. A further US $3.3 billion is needed to enable the Global Fund to finance new projects over the next two years.

 I had frank discussions with President Kibaki about corruption when I visited Kenya in January 2006.

Indeed much of our assistance is directed towards trying to prevent future corruption through improved financial management, procurement, better governance, justice, law and order. The bulk of our assistance (over 70 per cent.) to Kenya improves lives. Our support will mean textbooks for each of the 18,500 primary schools in Kenya and 12,000 new classrooms. It will also deliver 11 million insecticide treated bednets, saving 167,000 children&#039;s lives. We have provided &#163;23.7 million to drought affected regions of Kenya since December 2005.

 According to national poverty line data collected by the United Nations, the percentage of the population living in poverty in Latin America and the Caribbean decreased from 48.3 per cent. in 1990 to 42.9 per cent. in 2004. Levels of extreme poverty, whereby a person&#039;s basic food needs cannot be met, decreased from 22.5 per cent. to 18.6 per cent. over the same time period. Extreme poverty rates in the region differ considerably across countries. In Bolivia,

More than half of the total population in Latin America living in extreme poverty is concentrated in the largest countries: Brazil (25 per cent.), Mexico (14 per cent.) and Colombia (12 per cent.). The extreme poverty rate is higher among indigenous and afro-descendant people, ranging from 1.6 times higher than the rate of the rest of the population in Colombia to 7.9 times in Paraguay.

Income inequality levels are highest in Bolivia, where the poorest 20 per cent. of households receive only 2.2 per cent. of income and in Brazil where the richest 20 per cent. of households receive 62.4 per cent. of income.

<a name="stpa_46">At current rates of progress, Latin America is unlikely to meet the Millennium Development Target to halve the proportion of people living on less than a $1 a day by 2015. Although substantial progress was made in reducing poverty in the early 1990s, progress slowed down subsequently due to the economic crises experienced in many countries in 2000 and 2001. Poverty has been reduced more rapidly in countries that have relatively high levels of human development such as Chile, Uruguay and Brazil. Conversely, countries with low levels of human development such as Honduras and Bolivia have made the lowest levels of progress. Latin America is on track to meet MDGs on universal primary education; gender equality and reduction of child mortality but faces huge challenges in meeting those for maternal mortality, HIV/AIDS, and environmental sustainability.

 The drought affecting parts of southern Somalia is considered to be the most severe for at least 10 years.

Many of the people in southern Somalia live by raising livestock and due to the exceptionally dry conditions this year they are having to travel further than usual to find pasture for their animals. We have also heard reports that in some cases this has resulted in people arriving at wells only to find them dry or unusable, but without the resources or ability to reach another well. This is a desperate situation. In addition, water is a commodity that is bought and sold in southern Somalia, so it is possible that people simply do not have the means to pay, although it is widely understood that people who are in desperate personal need are given water even if they are unable to pay.

 There is currently no UN mandate covering peacekeeping operations in Darfur. Peace support operations there are at present being conducted by African Union personnel (AMIS) on the basis of a Memorandum of Understanding between the African Union (AU) and the Government of Sudan. The UK and other international partners recently participated in a joint assessment mission with the AU. This concluded that AMIS&#039; current mandate is adequate but that the African Union Mission&#039;s capacity needs to develop further if it is to be able to carry out the tasks required.

 The Department for International Development&#039;s (DFID) second White Paper, &quot;Eliminating World Poverty: Making Globalisation Work for the Poor&quot;, December 2000, drew attention to the dangers for developing countries of tax competition&#151;the process whereby Governments offer ever more generous tax concessions (such as tax holidays) in an attempt to attract new investment.

<p>
<a name="60307w47.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_92">DFID has supported several international studies in this area (for example, by the World Bank and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development). While specific features of a tax regime may influence some investment decisions in some countries at some times, the general conclusion of this work is that selective tax incentives can unnecessarily reduce Government revenues while having little effect in attracting new investment. Consistent with this finding, DFID&#039;s policy work emphasises that developing countries should focus on improving the quality of their overall investment climates for domestic and foreign investors alike, rather than competing on taxes.

</ul>
<p>

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_60">I understand that you have recently met with Mike Bell, the Executive Director for Coventry and Warwickshire, and at that meeting you clarified the fact that your interest is in budgets for adults in general, not just those undertaking courses designated as adult education courses.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_61">In the academic year 2004&#150;05, the West Midlands was allocated a budget of &#163;266.2m for adults. In addition, a further &#163;38.8m was allocated to Additional Learner Support.</p>

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_62">In the academic year 2005&#150;06, the West Midlands was allocated a budget of &#163;246.3m for adults, with an additional &#163;40m for Additional Learner Support.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_63">I am unable to give you specific figures for Coventry South, as we allocate funds to individual institutions, which do not confine their recruitment to only part of the city.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_64">I can, however, tell you that in 2004&#150;5 Colleges in Coventry as a whole were allocated &#163;21.4m for adults, and &#163;20.5m in 2005&#150;06.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_65">As a whole, Coventry and Warwickshire LSC was allocated &#163;36.7m for adults in 2004&#150;05, plus &#163;6.6m for Additional Learner Support, and &#163;36.6m in 2005&#150;06, plus an additional &#163;6.7m for Additional Learner Support.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_66">Budgets are allocated to individual colleges and institutions based on their performance in previous years. Overall the LSC&#039;s budget has increased significantly since we were created in 2001 and has risen again this year. We welcome this increase in resources provided for post-16 learning by Government year-on-year but we also recognise that there will never be enough public money to meet all needs. Therefore we are seeking to encourage individuals and employers to engage in learning, but also make an appropriate contribution to the costs as I will explain below.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_67">The reason for the slight drop in adult budgets between 2004&#150;05 and 2005&#150;06 is because of our focus on our priorities, as agreed with Government, We are committed to providing a place for every 16 to 18 year old, and Coventry and Warwickshire saw 



<br>&nbsp;<br></ul><i>7 Mar 2006 : Column 1409W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
<ul>growth in participation by young people between 2004&#150;05 and 2005&#150;06. Our funding allocations to individual institutions in 2005&#150;06 sought to recognise and address this achievement.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_68">Our adult budgets are therefore increasingly focused on fully-funding those adults who lack basic literacy and numeracy skills&#151;&#039;Skills for Life&#039;&#151;and those who lack a first Level 2 qualification, without which entering the labour market is very difficult.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_69">We continue to part-fund adults who already have a first level 2, and a wide range of Level 3 qualifications as our contribution to meeting skills needs at all levels.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_70">We do, however, expect adults outside our fully-funded priority groups to make a contribution towards the cost of their learning as there will be beneficiaries economically. In 2005&#150;06 we increased our expectations regarding the proportion of the cost of learning to be met by individual learners from 25%, where it had been fixed for some time, to 27,5%.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_71">This increase in what we expect adults to pay will continue, by 2007&#150;08 we expect adults to contribute 37.5% of the cost of learning. This will still mean that the public purse will subsidise 62.5% of the cost of adult learning, outside our fully-funded priority groups.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_72">This clear focus of the LSC&#039;s resources on what we should fully-fund and part-fund is essential if we are to ensure that we make the greatest impact with public money, while encouraging others to recognise and invest in the true costs and benefits of learning.</p>

<a name="stpa_113">In 2005, there were 14 training places in the Leicester area, 24 in Surrey and 624 in England as a whole. In 2005, 598 VDPs were appointed to these vocational training practices including 14 in the Leicester area. Information for earlier years is not held centrally. Given that the number of VDPs is largely determined by the number of dental undergraduates and there had been no significant increase in admissions to dental schools until we funded a major expansion from autumn 2005, it may, however, be assumed that these figures have remained fairly constant since 1997.

 The Department for Education and Skills and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport are jointly implementing the national PE, School Sport and Club Links strategy in England. In the five years to 2008 over &#163;1.5 billion is being invested (including &#163;686 million lottery funding) to implement the strategy.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60307w52.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_121">The strategy is delivering an ambitious public service agreement target to increase the percentage of 5&#150;16 year olds who spend a minimum of two hours a week on high quality PE and school sport within and beyond the curriculum to 75 per cent. by 2006 and then 85 per cent. by 2008. The long-term ambition, by 2010, is to offer all children at least four hours of sport every week. The 2004/05 school sport survey results found that overall, 69 per cent. of pupils in the 11,498 schools taking part were participating in at least two hours of high quality PE and school sport a week. In 2003/04 this figure was 62 per cent.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60307w52.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_122">Spearheading this strategy is the creation of a national PE/sports infrastructure, by establishing a network of Sports Colleges and School Sport Partnerships (families of schools which work together). Hendon is in the London borough of Barnet, which currently has 85 schools within a School Sport Partnership. By September this year all maintained schools in the borough will be included within a partnership.

<sup>(54)</sup> These figures are derived from the Annual School Census in 2005.<br>

<sup>(55)</sup> The percentage of pupils known to be eligible for Free School Meals (FSM) is expressed as a proportion of the number of pupils on roll.<br>

<sup>(56)</sup> Top and bottom schools on the basis of Key Stage 1-Key Stage 2 Value Added measures. Note that the list of top schools contains 121 schools and the list of bottom schools contains 109 schools as the value added measure (centred on 100) is rounded to 1 decimal place and schools below the cut-off may have equal values to those at the lower end of the list.<br>

<sup>(57)</sup> Top and bottom schools on the basis of Key Stage 2-Key Stage 4 Value Added measures. There are 100 schools in each list as the measure is centred on 1,000 and so rounding does not present the same issue as in <sup>(58)</sup>.<br>

 The Department is aware that there is a gap between eligibility and take up of free school meals and has funded research commissioned by the Child Poverty Action Group into the reasons children fail to take up their free school meal entitlement. The findings were published in a report entitled &quot;Improving the Take-Up of Free School Meals&quot; in May 2001. The report shows that pupils and parents considered that the quality and choice of food on offer can discourage take up.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills how many students who entered higher education in each year since 1996 went to universities that are members of <i>(a)</i> the Russell Group, <i>(b)</i> the 1994 Group and <i>(c)</i> the Coalition of Modern Universities; and what proportion in each category were from each socioeconomic group.

<p><a name="st_136"><a name="60307w56.html_spnew2"><b> Bill Rammell: </b> 
 Information on the social background of entrants to higher education is published annually by the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA) in &quot;Performance Indicators in Higher Education&quot;. For every higher education institution in the UK, the figures show the numbers and proportions of young, full-time entrants to first degree courses from social classes HIM, IV and V (for 2001/02 and earlier) and socio-economic groups 4, 5, 6 and 7 (from 2002/03). This gives a partial picture due to the exclusion of entrants to other undergraduate courses, part-time and mature students from the figures. The aggregate figures for the various institutional groupings are summarised in the table.

Notes:<br>

1. Data reported using Real terms figures at 2004&#150;05 prices, based on GDP deflators as at 23 December 2005.<br>

2. Figures reflect relevant sub-blocks of Standard Spending Assessment / Education Formula Spending (EFS) settlements and exclude the pensions transfer to EFS and LSC.<br>

3. Total funding also includes all revenue grants in DfES Departmental Expenditure Limits relevant to pupils aged 3&#150;19 and exclude Education Maintenance Allowances (EMAs) and grants not allocated at LEA level. For those authorities in receipt of advance of grant under the transitional support arrangements for 2004&#150;05, advance grant funding is included in the year of payment (2004&#150;05). There will be a consequential reduction in DfES grant for these LEAs in future years (either 2006&#150;07 and 2007&#150;08 or 2006&#150;07 to 2008&#150;09, depending on the terms on which the advance was given to the LEA).<br>

4. Where responsibility for funding a school has transferred from an authority, related funding no longer appears in the series.<br>

5. Figures are rounded to the nearest &#163;0.1 million.<br>

6. 1997&#150;98 figures for authorities subject to Local Government Reorganisation in that year have been estimated, pro-rata to their post LGR figures.<br>

 The LSC is embarking upon a major transformation programme that will make it a smaller, more dynamic and more customer-focused organisation. This will build upon its existing strengths; further develop its relationships with providers and with its partners, and help push the highest proportion of its funding out through colleges and providers into front line delivery. At local level, the LSC will develop small teams of professional staff who will support the delivery of its priority objectives through strategic relationships with colleges, providers and other key stakeholders and so ensure that the needs of local employers and learners are met. I fully support the changes the LSC is making as I believe it will help bring about an organisation that is fit for purpose.

We have introduced a seventh theme of transformation of the LSC itself, strengthening our ability to work locally, while sharing a number of common functions at the regional level.

 My hon. Friend and I receive regular performance reports and have regular meetings with the LSC to discuss performance. The LSC leads on delivering four PSA targets: skills for life, apprenticeships, level 2 at 19 and adult level 2. Since its inception in 2001, the LSC has had a strong record of success. It has delivered two key PSAs: the 2004 skills for life target and the 2005 apprenticeship target. It is

leading on delivery of the level 2 at 19 target set for 2006 and 2008&#151;current indications are that the 2006 target is likely to be met. The LSC also lead on the adult level 2 target for 2010 and current estimates show that the 2007 milestone will be met.

This includes performance reporting and review by its council and management group on a regular basis and a six monthly scrutiny by the chief executive of each of the nine regions, including London, through a formal performance review with the regional directors. In addition, the LSC&#039;s annual report includes details of the performance against targets of each of the local LSCs.

 Every Child a Reader (ECAR) is a three-year programme which aims to help 5,000 five- and six-year-olds learn to read by placing specialist literacy teachers, trained in &#039;Reading Recovery&#039;, into schools to provide intensive one-to-one support to children most in need. The programme will also explore the potential for those teachers to support tailored literacy teaching more broadly within a school. ECAR is currently funded by the KPMG Foundation, the Esmee Fairbairn Foundation, the Indigo Trust, JJ Charitable Trust, and the SHINE Trust in partnership with the DfES. Further sponsors are being sought. The KPMG Foundation are also funding the appointment of an experienced educationalist to manage the programme, working with the Primary National Strategy and the Institute of Education.

The Government are concerned about any child missing education, as it is not just the child&#039;s educational attainment that is at risk, but also potentially his/her safety and welfare. That is why we signalled our intention, in the White Paper &#039;Higher Standards Better Schools for All&#039;, to introduce in the Education and Inspections Bill a new statutory duty on all local authorities to make arrangements to identify children missing education.

<sup>(72)</sup> 2004&#150;05 figures in cash terms as reported by local authorities as at 23 February 2006.<br>

<sup>(73)</sup> Due to having only one school, Isles of Scilly LA and City of London LA will have a different expenditure pattern than other authorities which will include some fixed central administration costs which are unavoidable regardless of the size of the local authority. Consequently the expenditure on central administration as a percentage of total education spending by City of London and Isles of Scilly LA&#039;s should not be compared with other authorities<br>

Although we can not specifically identify parents of deaf children separately among these learners we know the majority of them (90 per cent.) were not people with a learning difficulty and/or disability. Therefore, the vast majority of learners on sign language courses do not have a hearing impairment but are undertaking the course for a variety of other reasons which will commonly include being a parent or other relative of a hearing impaired person.
