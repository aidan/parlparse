To ask the Secretary of State for Defence (1) if the price of the DFM contract for the first three type 45 destroyers awarded to BAE Systems assumes <i>(a)</i> the involvement of BAE Systems Marine and Vosper Thornycroft in developing a single design definition for the type 45 destroyer and <i>(b)</i> that the first and third ships will be assembled by BAE Systems Marine and the second ship by Vosper Thornycroft;  [153706]

<P>
<P>
<a name="10320w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 I have replied today to my hon. Friend. The delay in replying was caused by the need to obtain information from sources outside the Ministry of Defence.

 In my letters, I explained that research into the issues raised was continuing. This has involved research into records dating back 10 years and contacting key personnel in the unit to which Mr. Coakes was attached. Our inquiries are now complete and I hope to write to the right hon. Member within the next week.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how many <i>(a)</i> civil servants and <i>(b)</i> other personnel from his Department have attended sessions of the Saville inquiry.  [154050]<P>

 Sessions of the Bloody Sunday Inquiry have been attended variously by nine Ministry of Defence officials and one Army officer.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10320w01.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. McNamara: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence (1) how many persons, from which divisions and with which specialisms comprise the Bloody Sunday Inquiry Unit in his Department;  [154051]
<P>
<UL>(2) what the composition is of the Bloody Sunday Inquiry Unit in terms of <i>(a)</i> perceived community origin and <i>(b)</i> gender.  [154052]<P></UL>

<P>
<P>
<a name="10320w01.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Waterson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will review the pension provision for officers who were in service before their 21st birthdays but whose service before those dates is not counted for service pension purposes.  [154295]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10320w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The recently published Ministry of Defence Consultation Document on a new Armed Forces Pension Scheme includes the proposal that pension benefits should begin to accrue from the date of entry to the armed forces for both officers and other ranks. This compares with the current scheme under which benefits accrue from age 21 for officers and age 18 for other ranks. In line with usual practice in public sector pension schemes, these changes would not be retrospective.

 The Treaty of Nice was signed on 26 February by the Foreign Ministers of all 15 member states of the European Union. This event was highlighted in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) daily bulletin of 23 February, available on the website at www.fco.gov.uk. An FCO press release was sent to various national newspapers, and the FCO published a pamphlet setting out the main features of the Nice Treaty.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10320w02.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Vaz: </B> 
 A Command Paper containing the Treaty of Nice as signed on 26 February was published today as Cm 5090. Copies are available from the Vote Office and the Printed Paper Office.
<P>

<a name="10320w02.html_para2">For the first time in generations, there is a real prospect of uniting Europe. The Treaty of Nice brings this goal closer by reforming the EU's institutions to enable them to operate effectively after the accession of up to 12 new member states.
<P>

<a name="10320w02.html_para3">The Treaty increases the relative weight of Britain's vote in the Council of Ministers and raises the threshold for a qualified majority. The democratic legitimacy of decisions taken by qualified majority voting is assured by the addition of a population threshold, which means that the three largest member states (including the UK) can still block decisions together. In addition a qualified majority must have the support of at least the majority of member states.
<P>

<a name="10320w02.html_para4">The Treaty delivers a reformed Commission, with one Commissioner per member state from 2005 up to a maximum of 27. It proposes more qualified majority voting where this is in Britain's interests, and preserves the veto in areas where the Government said we would.

<P>

<a name="10320w02.html_para6">A Declaration to the Treaty looks forward to a wide public debate about the future of the European Union. A further Intergovernmental Conference will be held in 2004 to make changes arising from this debate. Public consultation was launched on 7 March.
<P>

<a name="10320w02.html_para7">In making the institutional changes necessary for the accession of new member states, the Nice Treaty opens the way for enlargement of the EU. This has been the goal of successive Governments for the sake of the peace, stability, and prosperity of Europe.
<P>

<a name="10320w02.html_para8">The Nice Treaty cannot enter into force until all member states have ratified it in accordance with their national procedures. The Government intend to introduce legislation to enable the UK to ratify the Nice Treaty as soon as it is practically possible.

 On 23 February the British Government, with EU Partners and the US issued a demarche to the Turkmen Foreign Minister regarding the detention of Shageldy Atakov and called for his release on humanitarian grounds. The Foreign Minister took note, and undertook to pursue the issue. We still await a formal response but will continue to remind the Turkmen authorities of our concern.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what his policy is on the granting of financial aid to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia conditional upon its Government co-operating with The Hague concerning the tribunal case against Slobodan Milosevic.  [154055]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10320w02.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Vaz: </B> 
 No conditionality relating to the International Criminal Tribunal on the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) was attached to the 200 million euro package of humanitarian and emergency assistance to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) agreed by the EU in October 2000, nor to UK bilateral assistance programmes over the winter (amounting to over &#163;13 million).

<P>

<a name="10320w02.html_para9">Future assistance to the FRY will need to take full account where appropriate of the FRY's progress towards political and economic reform and its legal obligation to co-operate with the ICTY.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what the Government's position is on the future status of Montenegro.  [154019]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10320w02.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Vaz: </B> 
 The UK and the EU would prefer to see a renegotiation of the relationship between Montenegro and Serbia take place within the framework of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The EU set out this preference in the Conclusions of the General Affairs Council of 22 January. Decisions on status will need to be taken in an open, democratic and consensual manner, taking full account of the need to preserve the internal stability of the FRY and the regional stability of south eastern Europe.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="10320w02.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Vaz: </B> 
 Vojvodina is a province of the Republic of Serbia. We support the efforts of the democratically- elected authorities in Novi Sad and Belgrade to reach political agreement on a redefinition of the autonomous powers of Vojvodina within that framework.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10320w02.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Vaz: </B> 
 The Yugoslav Army (VJ) and ethnic Albanian extremist groups in southern Serbia agreed a ceasefire brokered by NATO on 12 March. The agreement provides for the unconditional cessation of all military activities and use of force by either side. The Commander of KFOR (COMKFOR) retains his authority over the 5 km ground safety zone on the Kosovo/Serbia boundary. On Macedonia the situation remains tense. KFOR is providing support to the Macedonian authorities.

 European Standards (ENs) are determined by the European Committee for Standardization (CEN). The British Standards Institution (BSI) is the United Kingdom member of that Committee and carries out public consultations on draft ENs. In developing any proposal for standards on air conditioning equipment, the Government would expect BSI, CEN and industry to take account of the commitments given by the UK Government and the European Union as a whole to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. However, responsibility for these standards and resolving any technical issues, ultimately falls to the BSI.

 Local authorities have a broad new power which enables them to take action to promote or improve the economic, social or environmental well- being of their area, including establishing and supporting local community initiatives. In deciding how to exercise the power, authorities must have regard to their community strategy, which should reflect local communities' priorities and long-term aspirations. Local authorities must work through local strategic partnerships to develop and implement their community strategies, to integrate the work of the council with that of other public, private, voluntary and community organisations.

 In our White Paper, "Modern Local Government: In Touch with the People" (July 1998), we said that the present system of a national business rate had some advantages and we would therefore retain it.

In our Green Paper, Modernising Local Government Finance (September 2000), we sought views on how this might work in detail. A summary of the responses to the Green Paper has been published on the DETR website. We will publish our conclusions in a White Paper later this year.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10320w06.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 The Driving Standards Agency operates under a trading fund regime and is required to generate a financial surplus equivalent to 6 per cent. of its average net assets in order to cover the cost of the public resources being used by the organisation. This 6 per cent. return is paid to the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions in the form of dividends plus loan repayments and interest.
<P>

<a name="10320w06.html_para6">Where the Agency makes a financial surplus above the 6 per cent. requirement, this is retained by the Agency as a reserve and may be used to offset future fee increases.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10320w06.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 Motor manufacturers are responsible for advising owners of vehicle recalls. If the Driving Standards Agency becomes aware of a vehicle problem that could affect the safety of the candidate, the examiner and other road users, the Agency would display information on posters in driving test centres and on the Agency's website. The Agency would also tell driving instructors via its newsletter "Despatch".

<P>
<P>
<a name="10320w07.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Robert Ainsworth: </B> 
 The NSC, as part of NATS' two centre strategy for the provision of en route air navigation services endorsed by the Government, is expected to have the capacity to service the Scottish FIR, the Oceanic region and provide a significant contingency in the case of catastrophic failure of the Swanwick or West Drayton centres. The latest review of the two centre strategy, carried out in 1997, proposed the transfer of the services provided by the Manchester Area Control Centre to Swanwick, although the NATS Strategic Partner may wish to review this.
<P>

<a name="10320w07.html_para0">NATS has informed the Government that a New Scottish Centre with around half the number of workstations that Swanwick will have should be able to handle up to about 70 per cent. of normal traffic levels in the event of the Swanwick centre going out of action.

 The majority of Lincoln constituency lies within the city of Lincoln and the district of North Kesteven. The principal kinds of funding that this Department has provided to the local authorities between 1997-98 and 2001-02 are shown in the tables. These include grants and borrowing approvals for revenue and capital expenditure.
<P>

<a name="10320w07.html_para1">It is not possible to determine how much of this money Lincolnshire county council and North Kesteven district council have spent on Lincoln constituency. It is for the local authorities to decide where within their boundary these resources are applied. The city of Lincoln lies entirely within the Lincoln constituency.

<a name="10320w07.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 As the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, my hon. Friend the Member for North Warwickshire (Mr. O'Brien), told the House on 8 January 2001, <i>Official Report,</i> column 830, we intend, subject to the approval of the House and the other place, to make an Order under section 18 of the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000, transferring the functions of the Local Government Commission for England (LGC) to the Electoral Commission with effect from 1 April 2002. We also intend, as provided for in the 2000 Act, to include provisions in the Order to modify and to transfer to the independent Electoral Commission the Secretary of State's current functions relating to the implementation of the LGC's recommendations on electoral reviews. The proposed modifications are to take account of the constitution of the independent Electoral Commission and its statutory Boundary Committee for England, and to improve the procedures for conducting and implementing reviews, including allowing the Commission's Boundary Committee, after undertaking a review, to undertake a further review of the electoral arrangements of part of the local authority's area.
<P>

<a name="10320w07.html_para3">On this basis, from 1 April 2002, the programme of periodic electoral reviews and their implementation would become the responsibility of the Electoral Commission.
<P>

<a name="10320w07.html_para4">Electoral reviews are implemented, on a normal election day for the council concerned, by the making of an electoral changes order prior to that date. We intend that it will be for the Electoral Commission to make all the electoral change orders for reviews implemented on the normal election day in 2004 and subsequent normal election days. Electoral change orders for reviews to be implemented on the normal election day in 2003 will also be made by the Electoral Commission, except where a review is completed sufficiently prior to April 2002 that it is practicable for the Secretary of State to make the Order to assist the Electoral Commission as it takes on its new functions transferred from the LGC.
<P>

<a name="10320w07.html_para5">This approach means that it will be for the Electoral Commission, on or after 1 April 2002, to decide whether or not to give effect to the LGC's current review recommendations for the counties of Derbyshire, Devon, Durham and Surrey which are due to be implemented on the normal election day in 2005 under the programme of reviews announced to the House on 27 July 1999, <i>Official Report,</i> column 356.

 The Government are at present reviewing the operation of the Blue Badge scheme for parking concessions for disabled people. As part of the review we will be seeking views on whether there should be a link between that scheme and the exemption or concession arrangements for disabled motorists from road user charges and workplace parking levies. We expect to complete this review by the end of this year, and we then plan to consult on the scope of England-wide exemptions or concessions from road user charges and workplace parking levies.
<P>

<a name="10320w08.html_para0">The aim will be to provide a uniform minimum standard of exemptions and/or concessions throughout England including Greater London, subject to considering whether an exception should be made for the unique circumstances of central London.

<a name="10320w08.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Stuart: </B> 
 Following discussion by the European Union Council of Ministers, member states agreed to introduce the testing for bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) of animals slaughtered at over-30-months old, both those dying on the farm or in transport and those subject to normal slaughter, so that only meat from those animals with a negative test result may enter the human chain. All member states have been required to carry out this testing since 1 January 2001. In the United Kingdom, since we prohibit the sale for human consumption of beef from cattle aged over-30-months at slaughter, this testing requirement only applies to cattle slaughtered aged up to 42 months under the Beef Assurance Scheme, which covers registered herds with very low risk of BSE. Fallen stock is also being tested as required, although these do not go into the food chain. There are no plans routinely to test animals slaughtered at 30 months of age or younger.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what assessment the Government have made of the threat to human health posed by the illegal sale of imported over-30-month beef; and when that assessment was made.  [144250]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10320w08.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Stuart </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 8 January 2001]:</i> I am advised by the Food Standards Agency that it assessed, in December 2000, that any illegal sale of imported over-30-month (OTM) old beef from countries where there have been cases of BSE would pose a slightly higher risk than legally sold carcase meat imported from those countries. It should be borne in mind that the OTM rule is only the first defence against BSE and that the most risky parts of the animal, the specified risk material, such as the brain and spinal cord, are removed at slaughter. This greatly reduces the amount of infective material from older cattle.
<P>

<a name="10320w08.html_para4">In addition, from 1 January 2001 cattle aged over-30-months that are slaughtered in the European Union must test negative for BSE before being allowed into the food chain. This provides consumers with some additional protection, though the tests are limited in their sensitivity to pre-clinical infection.

The forum will also help to improve information about on-going research, facilitate partnerships between funders and researchers, consider how to accelerate recruitment for clinical trials and how best to exploit the findings from research to develop new approaches to diagnosis and disease. The membership currently consists of the four United Kingdom Health Departments, the MRC and three charities: the Wellcome Trust, the British Heart Foundation and Diabetes UK.

We are aiming to introduce the changes later this year. There are no plans to change the existing arrangements for patients' charges.

 As forms HC1 (claim form) and HC3 (which conveys a decision that a person is not entitled to full help under the National Health Service low income scheme) make clear, anyone who wants the decision reviewed has only to write and request this. That review will be dealt with by the Prescription Pricing Authority's (PPA) independent review section, which is not involved in the day to day calculation of low income scheme entitlement.
<P>

<a name="10320w10.html_para0">If it is clear to the independent review section that an error has been made in the original calculation, this will be corrected. In all cases, an explanation will be given of how the decision has been reached. If the explanation is not acceptable, a detailed commentary on the legal provisions used to calculate entitlement will be provided on request. If, after this, the explanation remains unacceptable, it is open to the person making the claim to seek a judicial review of the PPA's decision.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10320w10.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 We know that it is young men who are at most risk of suicide. In December 1997 the Department launched the Campaign Against Living Miserably telephone helpline in Manchester. The helpline, aimed at young men, offers advice, guidance, information and counselling at the onset of depression. CALM has been extended to Merseyside and Cumbria and we are looking to make it available in other areas in partnership with local agencies. Ultimately, we hope that the helpline will help to bring down the suicide rate in young men.
<P>

<a name="10320w10.html_para1">Also, as a result of new investment and new services outlined in the National Health Service Plan, we expect that every young person who develops a serious mental illness will benefit from specialist teams who can offer them the help and treatment they require. In addition, work in prisons and improved community crisis resolution services will target the particular needs of high suicide risk areas, as well as making the mental health system more responsive.

 I am today publishing "Valuing People: A New Strategy For Learning Disability For the 21st Century", which sets out cross-Government proposals for improving the life chances of people with learning disabilities. This is the first White Paper on learning disability for 30 years and sets out an ambitious and challenging programme of action for improving services for a particularly vulnerable and socially excluded group in our society. Copies have been placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="10320w10.html_para4">Our proposals are based on four key principles: civil rights, independence, choice, and inclusion. Valuing People takes a life-long approach, beginning with an integrated approach to services for disabled children and their families and then providing new opportunities for a full and purposeful adult life. It has cross-Government backing and its proposals are intended to result in improvements in education, social services, health, employment, housing, and support for people with learning disabilities and their families and carers.

Up to &#163;30 million a year of this will be revenue funding and &#163;20 million capital. The fund will be introduced from April 2002 and will be targeted on the priorities set out in the White Paper. We are also setting up an Implementation Support Fund of &#163;2.3 million a year for three years from April 2001 to provide central support for key aspects of the White Paper. Priorities for the Implementation Fund, which includes &#163;300,000 a year from the Home Office Active Community budget, include developing independent advocacy services and establishing a National Learning Disability Information Centre and Helpline in partnership with Mencap.
<P>

<a name="10320w10.html_para6">We will be setting up a Learning Disability Taskforce to take forward the implementation of the White Paper and an Implementation Support Team to promote good practice and share practical experience.

<a name="10320w11.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The Home Office is working to build a safe, just and tolerant society in which the rights and responsibilities of individuals, families and communities are properly balanced, and the protection and security of the public are maintained. Detailed information on the impact of Home Office policies across the full range of responsibilities is set out in Home Office Annual Reports. A copy of the most recent report, Home Office Annual Report 1999-2000, is available in the Library. The next report will be published shortly. Information on recorded crime and policing is also published. "Recorded Crime England and Wales, 12 months to September 2000" and "Police Service Strength England and Wales, 30 September 2000" can be found in the Library. The recorded crime statistics include information on recorded crime by Basic Command Unit and Crime and Disorder partnerships.

<a name="10320w11.html_para2"><i>Reducing Burglary Initiative</i>
<P>

<a name="10320w11.html_para3">One scheme in St. Giles Estate, Lincoln was awarded &#163;60,000 under the Reducing Burglary Initiative which will include the employment of a Civilian Crime Reduction Officer. A multi-agency approach (Crime Prevention Officer, Police, Housing Department) will be taken to tackle issues including: anti-social tenants; community policing; targeting unemployment; social exclusion; substance misuse and extending Neighbourhood watch. The scheme will also concentrate on target hardening of houses that have been burgled and intelligence-led policing.

<P>

<a name="10320w11.html_para4">Under round one of the Crime Reduction Programme's CCTV initiative, the Lincoln Crime Reduction Executive was awarded &#163;76,000 for the Shuttleworth House CCTV Initiative. The scheme covers a multi-storey block of flats in the Abbey Ward area of Lincoln. The main aims of the scheme are to combat fear of crime and to directly impact upon the incidence of racist graffiti.

<a name="10320w11.html_para5"><i>Youth Offending Teams (YOTs)</i>
<P>

<a name="10320w11.html_para6">In response to the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, key agencies came together in partnership to initially set up the Youth Offending Service (YOS) in Lincolnshire. This group has now evolved into Lincolnshire in Partnership and oversees the YOS, (Drug Action Team) (DAT), Road Safety Partnership, Domestic Violence Project etc. The group comprises the Chief Officers of Social Services, Health, Education, Police, Probation, Health, Highways and Planning, Director of Community Safety, Chief Crown Prosecutor, Chief Executive of Magistrates Courts Committee and a Chief Executive representing the District Councils. There is a very strong emphasis placed on working in Partnership in Lincolnshire, which is also reflected in the fact that Lincolnshire and Rutland will have one of the first Connexions Services in the country as of April 2000. There are three area YOTs covering the east, south and west of the county. The west YOT covers the City of Lincoln. Each team has representatives from the five key agencies and provides services predominantly to Young People in trouble, their families, the Police and the Courts. Lincoln City Council has a very active Crime Reduction Partnership Group and the YOS are involved in this group and the other six district council groups within the County. A range of new orders are available to the Courts including Reparation Orders, Action Plan Orders, Parenting Orders which the YOS are providing along with other Community sentences. Although it is too early to assess the full impact of the YOTs in Lincolnshire early indications are promising. For example out of a total of 146 young offenders who have received an intervention from the YOS between October and December 2000, 86 per cent. or 130 young people have not been charged or convicted of a further offence.

The five areas traditionally associated with youth crime--burglary, motor crime, criminal damage, street robbery and juvenile nuisance--all showed significant reductions compared with the corresponding period in the previous year. The combined drop for these crimes was 14 per cent. and the Home Secretary recently agreed a further &#163;2.1 million from the Home Office Crime Reduction Programme to run 150 Easter and summer school holiday Splash programmes in 2001.

<P>

<a name="10320w12.html_para19">As of November 2000, Redbridge and Waltham Forest Drug Action Team split into two borough based DATs. Waltham Forest now has its own DAT that met for the first time on 2 March 2001. The DATs have local targets to meet the National Drugs Strategy. Objectives for young people include: to increase drug education and decrease drug-related incidents in Waltham Forest primary and secondary schools; develop service agreements with the local Youth Offending Team regarding drugs education for high risk young people; explore the development of drug referral programmes for first time offenders; co-ordinate and increase the access to treatment services for under-18s. Other interventions for adults include: the establishment of Arrest Referral, which aims to reduce drug-related crime by increasing numbers of arrested problem drug users attending treatment; extend the Redbridge Court Referral project to Waltham Forest;

Since roll-out of DTTOs in October 2000, seven Orders have been made (six male, one female) and two of these are receiving residential treatment and five participated in a Day Programme based in Walthamstow. Information sharing protocols have been established between police, probation and housing services, and a collaborative approach against raising awareness has been undertaken between Safer Clubbing, Community Drug Awareness Project and treatment services.

 The Government believe that it is right in principle that a person wishing to own a shotgun should have a good reason for doing so. However, we acknowledge that this is a complex area of law and practice and we would wish to consult widely on this issue.
<P>

<a name="10320w13.html_para0">For this reason I have asked the Firearms Consultative Committee (FCC), the independent statutory body that advises the Government on firearms matters, to consider this matter further and to report back later this year. The FCC itself includes members of the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) and of the main shooting organisations. The FCC in turn has sought the views of a wide variety of shooting and other organisations and convened a working group to discuss this issue in detail.

 The power has been exercised on one occasion to remove Belfast and Maze prisons from the list and to extend the boundaries of Maghaberry Prison to include these two sites. In practice, these sites have been under the control of the Governor of Maghaberry Prison for some time and the variation simply regularises the situation.

 I understand that the draft Land Reform (Scotland) Bill, which is currently out to public consultation, contains provisions for creating a right of responsible access to inland waters for non-powered craft.

 The available data, showing the proportion of under 21-year-olds who enter higher education, are shown in the following table. There was an increase in the index in 1997-98 related partly to changes in the funding arrangements for higher education, with students choosing to enter HE rather than wait until 1998-99. There was a corresponding reduction in 1998-99 before the entry rates started to increase again in 1999-2000. Between 1996-97 and 1999-2000, total HE students in English universities and colleges rose by 76,000.

 <i>[holding answer 6 March 2001]:</i> The following table shows the estimated allocations made to schools in the Stroud constituency for additional devolved formula capital in 2000-01, following the pre-Budget report. This funding was made available in 2000-01 rather than 2001-02. Gloucestershire local education authority will be able to confirm the final allocations made to non-Voluntary Aided schools. A total of &#163;4.346 million devolved formula capital has been made available to schools in Gloucestershire in 2000-01.
<P>

<a name="10320w14.html_para0">Schools in Gloucestershire will benefit from over &#163;11.5 million through New Deal for Schools Devolved formula capital over the three years 2001-02 to 2003-04, plus a share of the &#163;300 million of additional funds made available by the Chancellor for the programme in his Budget of 7 March.
<P>

<a name="10320w14.html_para1">Overall, central Government support for capital investment in school buildings in England has tripled from &#163;683 million a year in 1996-97 to over &#163;2 billion in 2000-01. It will be &#163;3.5 billion in 2003-04, including grant, credit approvals and Private Finance Initiative credits. There will be central Government investment of &#163;8.5 billion in school buildings in total from 2001-02 to 2003-04.

 The 12 existing ONE pilots are due to run until March 2002, and we are investing considerable resources in a thorough evaluation. Clearly, we do not want to prejudge the results of the full evaluation, but the lessons we are learning from the pilots are helping to inform the development of the service to be delivered by the Working Age Agency, which will bring together the services of the Employment Service and working age-related elements of the Benefits Agency. On 14 March of this year, the Secretary of State for Education and Employment, and the Secretary of State for Social Security, together announced the establishment from October this year of around 50 Pathfinder sites for the Working Age Agency. The Government's commitment to expanding the approach tested in ONE is being taken forward through these Pathfinders, which will deliver a ONE-style service to all working age benefit claimants. This will form the basis for the service we expect the Working Age Agency to deliver, over time, across the country.

 <i>[holding answer 16 March 2001]:</i> The Government want an inclusive education service to offer excellence and choice. Where parents want a mainstream place for their child everything reasonably possible should be done to provide one. Equally where more specialist provision is what is sought, it is important and right that the wishes of parents are listened to.
<P>

<a name="10320w15.html_para3">There is a continuing and vital role for special schools. As has always been the case there will be changes to provision to reflect local needs and circumstances. While some special schools have closed, others have been enlarged and new special schools have opened. The overall size of the special school sector has remained broadly the same since 1996 and caters for 1.2 per cent. of all pupils. The Government do not envisage this will change dramatically.

 This is a matter for Shropshire local education authority (LEA) to manage, working with the school. I understand that the school has made representations to the authority to secure funding for this project.
<P>

<a name="10320w15.html_para4">Several possible sources of funding exist for this project. In January this year, we announced New Deal for Schools (NDS) Condition and New Deal for Schools (NDS) Devolved formula funding for the next three years to 2003-04. From that funding, Shropshire LEA and its schools will receive around &#163;4.08 million NDS Condition funding and &#163;5.82 million NDS Devolved formula funding over the period. The NDS Devolved formula allocation will be increased by the extra funding announced in the Chancellor's Budget statement on 7 March. As a result, I estimate that Sundorne Secondary School will receive over &#163;16,000 in total next year under the NDS Devolved capital funding programme, with increased amounts in later years, for it to use on priority capital work.

England working for the whole of the survey date of 20 January 2000. There were a further 11,860 non-agency supply teachers on contracts of less than one month.
<P>

<a name="10320w15.html_para6">At January 2000 there were 750 full-time teachers (including agency teachers) employed on a fixed term contract of one month and less than one term in the maintained nursery, primary and secondary sector in England. Agency teachers on contracts of one month or more are not identified centrally.
<P>

<a name="10320w15.html_para7">Information for Wales is the responsibility of the National Assembly for Wales.
<P>

<a name="10320w15.html_para8">A number of factors may have affected the demand for short term supply teachers in January 2000 including the requirement for schools to give teachers in their induction year a 10 per cent. reduction in timetable, and a flu epidemic that some education authorities reported.
<P>

<a name="10320w15.html_para9">The number of regular teachers (excluding short term supply teachers) in the maintained schools sector in England in January 2000 was 404,600, the highest for 10 years, and 6,900 higher than January 1998.
<P>

<a name="10320w15.html_para10">There was a growth of more than 2,300 in the number of people training to be teachers between 1999-2000 and 2000-01, the first such increase since 1992-93.

<a name="10320w15.html_para11">From April 2001 new graduate recruits can expect to earn &#163;17,000 a year (up 6 per cent. from the previous year) and starting salaries in Inner London will rise to &#163;20,000 (up 9 per cent. from the previous year).

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what financial incentives are being offered, as part of the European Year of Languages, to encourage individuals to improve their linguistic skills.  [154482]<P>

<P>
<a name="10320w16.html_spnew0"><B> Jacqui Smith </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 19 March 2001]:</i> European Year of Languages aims to raise awareness of the benefits of knowing another language, provide information about teaching and learning languages and celebrate other languages and cultures.
<P>

<a name="10320w16.html_para0">No specific financial incentives are being offered as part of the Year. However, the Centre for Information on Language Teaching, which is managing the UK's contribution, has produced a broad and inclusive programme of opportunities for people to participate in a wide range of projects and events. It includes a mixture of roadshows, lectures and concerts to raise awareness of the importance of language learning. A number of specific events like "Adult Learners Week" will also be held.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment if he will relax the rules that prevent teachers who have taken retirement on the

grounds of ill health from undertaking any employment in teaching, without forfeiting their entitlement to pension benefits.  [154668]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10320w16.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 Ill-health benefits are now granted on the basis that a teacher is permanently unfit to teach, and include compensation in the form of enhancement of service for the loss of future working years. It would therefore be inappropriate to allow teachers in receipt of an ill-health retirement pension to retain that benefit if they are deemed fit to return to the classroom.
<P>

<a name="10320w16.html_para1">The numbers of teachers who retire on ill-health grounds have reduced by 50 per cent. since 1997. Occupational Health Guidance which has been issued recently, as part of the Healthy Schools Programme, outlines the value and importance of a fit and healthy teaching workforce and the subsequent benefits to both teachers and the pupils they teach.

 The Department for Culture, Media and Sport last year considered a bid for additional funding for S4C, following the Authority's assessment of its future budgetary needs. Departmental spending limits and competing priorities precluded our meeting the bid, but annual increases in S4C's grant in line with the Retail Prices Index, under the provisions of the Broadcasting Act 1996, are maintaining the real value of the grant. The

 I refer the hon. Member to the statement made by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State in the House on 14 March 2001, <i>Official Report,</i> columns 1021-36. The overall economic impact on the rural tourism industry in England following the foot and mouth outbreak is running at approximately &#163;100 million a week and could grow.

<a name="10320w17.html_para1">The target turnaround time for verification of entitlement to the free licence is one week, provided the application form is completed correctly and the details match those provided to the BBC by the Department of Social Security. Where the details do not match, further information needs to be requested from the applicant and the time taken to verify the application will vary according to the individual case. The timetable for verifying refund applications is the same as for free licences, but short term licences for people approaching the age of 75 have been available since April 2000, so refunds should now be the exception rather than the rule.
<P>

<a name="10320w17.html_para2">The BBC has indicated that approximately 2.95 million free licences and 1.1 million refund cheques have been issued since the introduction of the concession last November. The majority of applications now being received are from people currently aged 74; approximately half a million such applications have been validated and free licences will be issued when the applicants turn 75. Approximately 86,000 applications are currently awaiting validation but the majority of these are from people under the age of 75. 11,000 applications submitted prior to November last year have still to be verified and action is being taken to clear these by the end of this month.

Separate drives have been aimed at recruiting enumerators in local areas and to raise the profile of the Census.</FONT></UL>

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what assessment he has made of the effectiveness of self-regulation in the newspaper wholesaling and retailing sectors; and if he will make a statement.  [154464]<P>

<P>
<a name="10320w20.html_spnew3"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 DTI works closely with those involved across the newspaper sector and, although no formal assessment of the effectiveness of self regulation in the sector has recently been carried out, I believe that in general self regulation is working reasonably well. In particular, I am aware of the recent agreement by those involved in both newspapers and magazines to enter into a process to re-examine distribution issues and we shall be following developments in those discussions.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what recent discussions he has had with the National Federation of Retail Newsagents about problems facing independent retailers; and if he will make a statement.  [154463]<P>

<P>
<a name="10320w20.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 Small independent retailers are a vitally important part of the economic life of the country, creating wealth, satisfying customer demands, providing employment and playing an important social role within communities. Although there has been no recent contact with the National Federation of Retail Newsagents (NFRN) we do recognise the difficulties their members face. For example, the Better Regulation Task Force will this year be investigating the regulatory burden faced by small retailers and will be reporting on this in due course.

<P>
<a name="10320w20.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 I am pleased to announce today the publication of the analysis of responses to the Renewables Obligation Preliminary Consultation. Key issues were the cost of the Obligation to the consumer, whether or not to include energy from waste in the Obligation, the proposed level of capital grants, the treatment of imports, support for the longer term technologies and the profile of the Obligation up to 2010.

<UL>(2) what the organisations that received public funding for research into the development of renewable fuels spent the money on in each year <i>(a)</i> between 1992 and 1997 and <i>(b)</i> since 1997; how much they received; and if he will list the organisations.  [151124]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10320w20.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 The Government have announced substantial initiatives towards achieving the target of obtaining 10 per cent. of our electricity from renewable energy by 2010.
<P>

<a name="10320w20.html_para4">The main mechanisms for the market stimulation of renewable energy are the proposed Renewables Obligation and the earlier Non Fossil Fuel Obligation (NFFO). Funds provided by the NFFO programme and its Scottish equivalent are estimated to peak at around &#163;150 million per annum in years between 2003-04 and 2009-10. The Renewables Obligation is estimated to provide up to &#163;600 million per annum by 2010.
<P>

<a name="10320w20.html_para5">Over the next three years, the Government have allocated over &#163;250 million for the development of renewable energy. This includes:

<a name="10320w20.html_para6"><P>

<a name="10320w20.html_para9">The Enterprise, Skills and Innovation White Paper published on 13 February proposes a major initiative to achieve a UK solar photovoltaic demonstration programme in line with those of our major competitors.

<P>

<a name="10320w20.html_para11">DTI directly supports research, development, demonstration, technology transfer and export promotion activities relating to a range of renewable energy sources through its New and Renewable Energy Programme. The breakdown of expenditure on specific renewable energy sources in the years since 1991-92, including programme management costs, is as shown. This Government have set rising budgets for the programme to begin to reverse the trend set under the previous Administration, and to bring forward new technologies. A budget of &#163;14 million was allocated to the programme for this year. Proposed provision for the programme over the three year period 2001-04 is &#163;55.5 million.
<P>

<a name="10320w20.html_para12">In addition, through the Science Budget, DTI supports relevant research being undertaken by the Research Councils. Expenditure for the full period between 1992 and 1997 is not readily available. Between 1997 and 2000, the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, the main Research Council funding work on renewables, spent &#163;22.8 million on projects on renewable and clean electricity generation. The total value of current EPSRC projects in this field is &#163;13.4 million.
<P>

<a name="10320w20.html_para13">Under the European Commission's 5th Framework Programme (1998-2002), funding for renewable energy projects co-ordinated by UK companies amounts to some 23 million euros to date.

 The Department's claims handling agents, IRISC, have registered a total of 7,468 claims by former miners who have died and where the date of death is after the date of claim. In all these cases, the claims will be continued by the claimant's widow or dependants. In addition, where the claimant's death certificate shows that one of the respiratory diseases for which British Coal were found liable either caused or materially contributed to the death, the Department will also make bereavement or loss of society awards.

 The Department's claim handling agents, IRISC, have registered a total of 6,802 claims by former miners who have died and where the date of death is after the date of claim. In all these cases the claims will be continued by the claimant's widow or dependants. In addition, where the claimant's death certificate shows that one of the respiratory diseases for which British Coal were found liable either caused or materially contributed to the death, the Department will also make a bereavement award to the claimant's widow. To date the Department has made 5,200 bereavement awards, totalling &#163;43.1 million. In addition, we announced on 2 March that we propose to make &#163;2,000 interim payments to those widows who have previously received a bereavement award but still await payment on account of damages.

<a name="10320w22.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 I am today publishing this report, copies of which are being placed in the House Libraries. Copies of the regional reports will be placed in the Libraries by 30 March. I welcome publication of this report which I commissioned the Environment Agency to produce, in partnership with the other bodies responsible for responding to the flooding, particularly local authorities and the emergency services.
<P>

<a name="10320w22.html_para2">The report shows that since last October we have seen the worst flooding for half a century, following the wettest autumn on record. Thankfully no loss of life was directly associated with the floods, though 10,000 properties suffered flooding--some repeatedly--and I again extend the Government's sympathies to all those who were affected.




<P>
<P><I>20 Mar 2001 : Column: 187W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="10320w22.html_para3">I endorse the key finding that the Agency, and those responsible for the emergency response, performed well. I am particularly pleased to note that the seamless and integrated service of flood forecasting, warning and response, for which I called after the Easter 1998 floods, was delivered in most if not all areas. I am also pleased to note that in a number of localities the emergency response arrangements benefited from exercises conducted last summer between the Environment Agency, local authorities and the emergency services. The new flood warning codes, introduced by the Agency within weeks of the floods, also worked well.
<P>

<a name="10320w22.html_para4">I want to thank the Agency, and all the other organisations and individuals involved, for their efforts in response to the flooding. This involved many hours of long, hard work, rapid decisions which needed to be made, and also individual acts of bravery, for which the country must express its gratitude. The effects of the flooding would almost certainly have been much worse were it not for their efforts.
<P>

<a name="10320w22.html_para5">Nevertheless, the report identifies some further lessons to be learned, the key ones being:
<P>

<a name="10320w22.html_para6"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The flood warning arrangements worked well but there are some detailed lessons for further improvement. I have asked the Agency to provide me with their proposals for implementing changes by September 2001. Also, the report notes some deficiencies in the weather forecasts received by the Agency. A review will be taken forward by the Environment Agency in conjunction with the Met Office, to report by September 2001.
<P>
<BR>
There is a need for the current Home Office review of local authority emergency planning arrangements to take account of the lessons learned from the floods.
<P>
<BR>
There remains some confusion in the minds of the public about responsibility for measures to prevent flooding, and for responding to it. The key to sound action is planning, partnership and provision of information. Through the Ministry's High Level Targets, operating authorities are required to provide policy statement which will indicate flood risk locally and how it will be managed, and to describe local partnerships. Such statements are due to be completed soon. These statements will provide information on "assumed" responsibility which will provide a useful basis for determining if further action on attribution is necessary in specific instances and developing a sound local partnership. Provision of a "one stop shop" may then be possible by local agreement.
<P>
<BR>
We have a High Level Target in place for the Environment Agency to organise a programme of local and regional emergency exercises and should also conduct a national emergency exercise during the course of 2001. While local and regional exercises should continue, I have accepted the Agency's recommendation that it is unnecessary to conduct a national exercise this year. I shall consider with the Agency the timetable for a future national exercise.
<P>
<BR>
We need to determine the appropriate level of investment in flood and coastal defence. Substantial increases were made in the Comprehensive Spending Review and the 2000 Spending Review. An additional &#163;51 million was announced in November, and we have also put together an &#163;11.6 million package to fund the exceptional costs of the Environment Agency in responding to the flooding and in undertaking emergency repairs. However, I recognise that we need to be ready to consider whether further expenditure may be justified. We have already instituted additional research to identify in broad terms what future investment may be required so that this can be considered in future spending reviews. Other developments such as strategic catchment studies should assist in the future production of more realistic needs-based expenditure programmes.
<P>
<BR>
We have established a series of High Level Targets to ensure Government policy for flood and coastal defence is delivered by the operating authorities and others. One group of targets requires 



<P>
</UL></FONT><P><I>20 Mar 2001 : Column: 188W</I><P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the Environment Agency to establish a database of flood and coastal defences and to record information on their condition, based on inspections undertaken by the operating authorities. The database is an important development, for which MAFF is currently contributing towards the cost; we will consider whether additional funding is needed. It is also necessary to ensure that inspections of defences are completed by the operating authorities accurately and to time. I am asking the Environment Agency to report on this, as part of their report on the inspections and assessment of flood risk required under the High Level Targets.
<P>
<BR>
The Environment Agency's report raises questions about the process for making investment decisions. I have asked the Agency to provide me with supporting evidence by September 2001 and I will consider with them, and the other operating authorities, whether changes are required. This issue will be relevant to the review, already under way, of the priority scoring arrangements for consideration of MAFF financial support for flood and coastal defence schemes.

Also under way is a review of the current funding arrangements for flood and coastal defence. I shall ensure that relevant recommendations in the report are considered by the Review Steering Group.

Friend the Deputy Prime Minister was right when, on 31 October 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 607, he referred to the effects of the earlier violent storm as a "wake up call". We can certainly expect climate change to mean that events of this type will occur more frequently in future. Another inevitable fact is that Governments--past, present and future--cannot prevent all flooding; but where it is sensible and sustainable to do so, we can take further action to reduce the risk.
<P>

<a name="10320w22.html_para9">We can also take action to ensure that as a nation we are prepared to deal with the effects of severe weather, including but not limited to flooding, and that our key national infrastructure can withstand these effects. This is a matter on which we are working closely with local authorities and other key players through the Central Local Partnership.
<P>

<a name="10320w22.html_para10">In summary, if it had not been for the effective response of the Agency and others, the flooding would have had much more serious effects than it did. There are still lessons to be learned, but we have all come a long way since the flooding three years ago.

 <i>[holding answer 16 March 2001]:</i> The Government have accepted the advice of the Independent Scientific Group on Cattle TB (ISG) that research into the genetic base of disease resistance in cattle is not a priority at present, given the major practical difficulties the ISG has identified in pursuing research, and given that any genetic differences seem likely to affect mainly the severity of the disease in cattle, whereas current control policies are based on the removal of all infected animals identified through an immune response.

<a name="10320w24.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 8 March 2001]:</i> The Ministry has not issued specific advice regarding pedestrian access to canal footpaths. However we have posted advice on MAFF's website regarding restrictions and precautions on outdoor activities in an infected area. We advise members of the public not to take part in activities on land where livestock is kept, or which might bring them into contact with susceptible species.
<P>

<a name="10320w24.html_para0">The Ministry has issued advice to Local Authorities on the Foot and Mouth Disease (Amendment) (England) Order 2001 and the Foot and Mouth (Amendment) (No 2) Order 2001. These Regulations allow, with exceptions, MAFF and local authorities to prevent the entry of any person onto any land or into any agricultural building in a controlled area (currently Great Britain has been declared a controlled area). They also allow local authorities to prohibit the movement of members of the public onto any land where there may be animals and onto any footpath or right of way within identified areas in their districts, for the purpose of preventing the spread of foot and mouth disease. These restrictions could be applied to canal footpaths.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food if he will make a statement on compensation arrangements for animals culled because of possible infection with the foot and mouth virus, with particular reference to <i>(a)</i> effects on hill subsidies and environmental allowances if stocks have been removed thus contravening the requirements for receiving subsidy, <i>(b)</i> the time scale for payments to be made and <i>(c)</i> valuations.  [152951]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10320w24.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 We are aware that, as a consequence of foot and mouth disease, farmers are facing difficulties in respect of CAP subsidy schemes, including those funded under the England Rural Development Programme. Although some of these difficulties may be covered by force majeure provisions, some will need changes to specific regulations. We are in urgent discussions with the European Commission about them. In the meantime it is important that farmers contact their Regional Service Centre if they believe they will have difficulty in complying with scheme requirements.
<P>

<a name="10320w24.html_para1">Arrangements are in place to ensure that compensation claims for animals slaughtered to prevent the spread of foot and mouth disease will be processed and paid as quickly as possible. We aim to pay compensation to owners within about a week of slaughter taking place.
<P>

<a name="10320w24.html_para2">An independent valuation is carried out on the animals which are due to be slaughtered and the owner is invited to agree a statement of valuation. If an owner chooses to reject this valuation, he may call in his own valuer so that the matter can go to arbitration.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what criteria are used by his Department to define an outbreak of foot and mouth disease that has more than one geographical location associated with it.  [153838]

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10320w24.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 15 March 2001]:</i> An outbreak of foot and mouth disease is declared when disease is confirmed on any separate or distinct holding. For example, if a single business consisting of two separately located farms had foot and mouth disease confirmed at both locations, this would be treated as two separate outbreaks.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what advice he has given to retail premises specialising in products for farmers about the risk of cross-infection of the foot and mouth virus.  [153839]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10320w24.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 15 March 2001]:</i> Such businesses should comply with the general advice posted on the MAFF website www.maff.gov.uk for persons who work in the countryside.
<P>

<a name="10320w24.html_para3">Central to this advice is that people should follow strict cleansing procedures which would include leaving vehicles outside the farm, disinfecting boots and wearing boots or clothing supplied by the farm. People working in the countryside should ensure that all mud, slurry and manure is washed off before they leave the premises.
<P>

<a name="10320w24.html_para4">It is essential that all visits to farms and possible contacts with animals are recorded. The records should include the date and time of the visit. Should disease occur on a farm then these records will be used to trace movements and possible spread of the disease.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food if outbreaks of foot and mouth disease have occurred in the vicinity of landfill sites; and if he will make a statement about the implications for the control of the disease.  [153821]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10320w24.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 15 March 2001]:</i> Information as to whether infected premises are located in the vicinity of a landfill site is not readily available. However, veterinary advice is that landfill sites have not played any part in the spread of the disease.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10320w24.html_wqn7"><B> Dr. Tonge: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what estimate he has made of the average annual cost per farmer of buying foot and mouth vaccine.  [153719]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10320w24.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 15 March 2001]:</i> If the Ministry were to approve vaccination against foot and mouth disease, vaccine would be dispatched to local control centres. Veterinary surgeons employed by the Ministry for the purposes of foot and mouth control would be responsible for the vaccination of susceptible species. There would be no cost to livestock farmers.

[154074]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10320w24.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Quin </B>

<P>
<P>
<a name="10320w24.html_spnew9"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 16 March 2001]:</i> The Ministry is using a great many contractors at a local level throughout the country. This information could be collected only at disproportionate cost.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10320w24.html_spnew10"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 19 March 2001]:</i> An assessment of the plant health risks from passengers' baggage was carried out in 1992, as a result of which personal imports from outside the EU of vegetables (except potatoes) and up to 2 kg of fruit are permitted. Customs officers seize fruit in excess of 2 kg, and any potatoes, when they are detected at entry. There are no restrictions on the quantity of fruit or vegetables which may be brought into the UK from within the EU.

 I understand that the Environment Agency is starting work on studies leading to the preparation of a flood defence strategy for the River Ouse and its tributaries. It is expected that the strategy, which will seek to identify sustainable options for flood defence in the catchment, will take eight to 12 months to complete. The timing of applications for grant aid on individual schemes will then be a matter for the Agency.

<P>
<a name="10320w25.html_spmin1"><B>The Prime Minister</B> 
 <i>[holding answer 19 March 2001]:</i> Relaxing the existing requirement to purchase an annuity would provide an incentive for some to use pension schemes for purposes other than providing a secure income throughout retirement. Costs will vary depending on the nature of any reforms, including what level of income must first be secured and what tax charge is applied to withdrawals above that level. Proposals for tax-free withdrawals could cost billions of pounds a year in lost income tax and extra tax relief.

 The current average clearance time for cases referred to the office of the Independent Case Examiner at February 2001 is 32.3 weeks. When a case is received, an initial review is carried out before a full investigation can begin. Once the initial review has been undertaken, cases currently wait around 16 weeks for the full investigation to start.

 The information is in the table and gives the number of additional pensioners floating on to the main Income Related benefits in 2001-02 resulting from the increase to the applicable amount. This includes all the measures announced in the November 2000 pre-Budget report; aligning the different pensioner premiums, protecting the Minimum Income Guarantee (MIG) in line with the increases to the basic State pension in 2001 and earnings uprating. It also includes the increase to the capital limits announced in Budget 2000.

<i>Notes</i><P>

1. The assumption used is that the costs of the MIG have been calculated over and above the cost of uprating the MIG by Rossi.<P>

2. Figures have been rounded to the nearest 10,000 cases.<P>

3. The number of floaters has been calculated using the Policy Simulation Model for Income Related Benefits. This models the benefit system in 2001-02 and is based on data from the Family Resource Survey (FRS) for 1997-98, uprated to 2001 prices. Figures for floaters are calibrated to historical take up assumptions and therefore do not reflect behavioural changes due to recent initiatives. <P>

New procedures for assessing claims for DLA/AA were introduced last year to improve the accuracy of decisions on entitlement. Customers can receive clearer explanations of decisions on their benefit entitlement. Initially these changes led to significant increases in the time it took to process each case which, together with a growing caseload, created a temporary, but significant, backlog of work. In addition, the backlog of work caused an increase in the number of enquiries received from customers, resulting in additional work for staff to process. The backlog has been tackled as a priority with a number of improvements being made to processes, forms and the use of IT in order in turn to improve clearance times. However, changes of this order require time for staff to be trained and to become familiar with new processes before they can become fully effective. Decision-makers have become accustomed to the new procedures and the backlog has now been cleared.

I hope this is helpful.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security when he will publish the inspection report of the Benefit Fraud Inspectorate in respect of Newcastle City Council.  [155013]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10320w27.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The Benefit Fraud Inspectorate (BFI) report was published today in respect of Newcastle City Council and copies of the report have been placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="10320w27.html_para5">The report makes recommendations to help the council address weaknesses and to improve the administration of Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit, as well as its counter fraud activities.
<P>

<a name="10320w27.html_para6">BFI looked at the performance of Newcastle in August 1997 as one of a series of trial inspections during the initial set up of BFI, but the findings were not published.
<P>

<a name="10320w27.html_para7">Inspectors report that Newcastle has responded positively to their 1997 findings and recommendations. The council has a large HB and CTB caseload and a transient population and the BFI was pleased to note that there were no backlogs at the time of their on-site inspection, despite the volume of work.
<P>

<a name="10320w27.html_para8">There have been noticeable improvements in the council's administration. In particular, its claim form, verification and liaison with the Benefits Agency, Rent Service, private sector landlords and Housing Associations.




<P>
<P><I>20 Mar 2001 : Column: 206W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="10320w27.html_para9">The report also notes that substantial progress has been made in counter fraud work. The council now undertakes its own prosecutions and has introduced a computerised fraud management system.
<P>

<a name="10320w27.html_para10">The report acknowledges a significant improvement has been the development of a joint protocol between Internal Audit and District Audit which ensures both teams are working together to ensure maximum audit coverage and effectiveness.
<P>

<a name="10320w27.html_para11">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State is now considering the report and will be asking the council for its proposals in response to the findings and recommendations of the BFI.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security when he will publish the inspection report of the Benefit Fraud Inspectorate in respect of Sandwell metropolitan borough council.  [155012]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10320w27.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The Benefit Fraud Inspectorate (BFI) report was published today in respect of Sandwell metropolitan borough council and copies of the report have been placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="10320w27.html_para12">The report makes recommendations to help the council address weaknesses and to improve the administration of Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit, as well as its counter fraud activities.
<P>

<a name="10320w27.html_para13">This was a follow-up inspection. The BFI previously reported on Sandwell metropolitan borough council in August 1999. Since then the council has responded very positively to BFI's recommendations and has been particularly active in taking steps to tackle fraud and error, despite a high level of staff turnover and recruitment problems.
<P>

<a name="10320w27.html_para14">Inspectors noted that the council had implemented most of their recommendations and this had led to improvements in its overall administration and counter fraud performance.
<P>

<a name="10320w27.html_para15">Inspectors noted that the council had approved a prosecution policy and together with training for its fraud officers this had led to the council conducting a large number of successful prosecutions. Inspectors found the council had the best performing fraud section of the 30 highest spending local authorities the BFI have inspected to date.
<P>

<a name="10320w27.html_para16">Inspectors also noted that centralising benefit processing has helped the council reduce backlogs and improve clearance times.




<P>
<P><I>20 Mar 2001 : Column: 207W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="10320w27.html_para17">The report concludes that the council has achieved a lot in a short space of time and this is commendable. However, there is still room for further improvement, in particular through the council implementing the Verification Framework to support the council's counter fraud strategy, and the report makes recommendations for this.
<P>

<a name="10320w27.html_para18">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State is now considering the report and will be asking the council for its proposals in response to the findings and recommendations of the BFI.
