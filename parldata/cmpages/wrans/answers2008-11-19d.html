 During the summer opening programme, professionally qualified Blue Badge Guides are employed to conduct tours of the Palace of Westminster. Half-day and full-day rates are calculated on the basis of nationally agreed Blue Badge rates. A qualified London Blue Badge Guide delivering a standard parliamentary tour in English would earn &#163;38.30 per hour; in foreign languages &#163;43.30. The cost of the Blue Badge Guides is covered by the ticket price.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_358"><a name="81119w0001.htm_para6"><a name="08111989000108">For Member-sponsored tours when Parliament is sitting, the current policy is that guides are drawn primarily from serving or retired House staff and that Parliament should bear the expense of the tours. The current rate for in-house guides is &#163;22.70 per hour.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_359"><a name="81119w0001.htm_para7"><a name="08111989000109">The difference in pay reflects the higher level and formal nature of the training and qualification of Blue Badge Guides. The higher level of training includes the mechanics of guiding and detailed knowledge of London as a whole (which fits in with the requirements of summer opening visitors), as well as an independent parliamentary qualification.</p>

The court may also authorise the publication of a text or summary of a judgment or order made by the court. The court can authorise the publication of information on its own initiative or on an application made by one of the parties to proceedings.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Justice pursuant to the answer of 4 November 2008, <i> Official Report</i>, columns 315-17W, on marriage, (1) how many orders under section 55 of the Family Law Act 1986 in relation to the validity of marriages were <i> (a)</i> granted and <i> (b)</i> denied in each of the last five years; [235877]</p>

 The courts do not record how many applications under section 55 of the Family Law Act 1986 are received, nor do they record the outcome of these cases. Anecdotal evidence from courts suggests that there are very few.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_363"><a name="81119w0003.htm_para0"><a name="08111989001768">There are no provisions for judicial separation under the Family Law Act 1986. The provisions for judicial separation can be found within the Matrimonial Causes Act 1973. There were 3,388 applications made for judicial separation during the five-year period 2003-07. Records show that for the same five-year period 1,953 decrees of judicial separation were pronounced (the following table sets out the number of cases per year). The courts do not keep records of the number of applications which were denied. For comparison 778,575 applications for divorce were received for the same period.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_364"><a name="81119w0003.htm_para1"><a name="08111989001769">Not all applications for judicial separation result in a final order as many parties choose not to pursue the case. This is not always because the parties have reconciled. The law prohibits divorce during the first year of marriage and some applications for judicial separation issued during the first year of marriage are withdrawn on the first anniversary of the marriage, before a decree is granted, and a petition for divorce then is issued.</p>

 In order to reduce the amount of residual household waste for disposal, local authorities can promote a range of sustainable activities.

 Under EC Regulation 216/2008 the type certification of the majority of aircraft manufactured or registered in EU member states is the responsibility of the European Aviation Safety Agency. This has been the position since 2003 when the agency came into being. However, certain aircraft types listed in annex II to the regulation are not covered by the agency&#146;s remit.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what estimate he has made of the share of UK greenhouse gas emissions which will come from the aviation sector in 2050, calculated on the same basis as the figures in paragraph 1.6 of Annex K of the UK Air Passenger Demand and carbon dioxide forecasts published in November 2007 and on the assumption that the UK achieves an 80 per cent. cut in carbon dioxide emissions by 2050 but with the other forecasts remaining unchanged.

<i> [holding answer 17 November 2008]:</i><i> </i>&#147;UK Air Passenger Demand and CO2 forecasts&#148; (November 2007) included an estimate of the share of UK emissions accounted for by aviation in 2050. This   <br>

assumed the UK domestic target for CO2 reductions in 2050 was 60 per cent. below 1990 levels and that abatement effort to meet the target was predominantly in the rest of the economy, with aviation abatement taking the form of fuel efficiency (resulting from fleet renewal and technological development) and air traffic management improvements, in line with the assumptions underlying the forecasts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_397"><a name="81119w0007.htm_para0"><a name="08111989002290">On the basis of the same assumptions used in the November 2007 document, but taking an 80 per cent. reduction target, the share for aviation in 2050 would be around 35 per cent. To account for the non-CO2 climate change effects of aviation, consistent with the 2007 document, for simplicity a radiative forcing factor of 1.9 could be applied to aviation&#146;s CO2 emissions. On this basis, aviation&#146;s share would rise to around 41 per cent. The relativity between the CO2 and non-CO2 impacts may change over this time frame which would imply a different radiative forcing factor.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_398"><a name="81119w0007.htm_para1"><a name="08111989002291">These estimates are based on central emissions forecasts. Forecasts over such a long term time frame are subject to significant uncertainty. Adopting alternative underlying assumptions to reflect these uncertainties would therefore change the estimate of aviation&#146;s share of emissions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_399"><a name="81119w0007.htm_para2"><a name="08111989002292">Under an 80 per cent. target, not all parts of the UK economy would be expected to contribute equally to the total emissions reductions required. Sectors that are more carbon intensive, or in which abatement options are expensive or particularly difficult, would be expected to make up an increasing share of total UK emissions over time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_400"><a name="81119w0007.htm_para3"><a name="08111989002293">It should be noted that the Department for Transport is currently updating its forecasts of aviation emissions for all years to 2050 and these are expected to be published before the end of the year. The estimate of aviation&#146;s share of emissions will therefore be updated in line with those new estimates.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_401"><a name="81119w0007.htm_para4"><a name="08111989002294">The basis of UK aviation CO2 forecasts is estimates of emissions from UK sales of aviation fuels. This is consistent with the UK&#146;s reporting of international aviation emissions to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Estimates of emissions from fuel used for international aviation do not form part of the UK&#146;s national emissions inventory, as there has been no international agreement on how to allocate them to individual countries.</p>

 The deliberate targeting of civilians would represent a direct contravention of international law. A wide range of checks and balances exist within the UK military chain of command to ensure that this can never happen.

Release of air-launched weapons is coordinated by controllers on the ground, who are fully trained in the use of lethal force, law of armed conflict and the appropriate rules of engagement. Controllers and pilots communicate with each other to ensure that the target is accurately identified, using target designating equipment where appropriate, and the weapon and method of attack is selected so as to minimise any risk of civilian deaths or injury, or damage to civilian property.</p>

 The Duchess of Kent Psychiatric Hospital was closed in 2003 as part of the Defence Medical Services&#146; move (in accordance with clinical best practice) towards providing treatment regionally, primarily through enhanced out-patient facilities and the contracting-out of in-patient treatment. The military community treatment capability was enhanced and the Defence Medical Services provide service personnel with speedy access to skilled and effective help and treatment that is flexible and based around their individual needs. A military Department of Community Mental Health (DCMH) is located a short distance from the old hospital ward.</p>

Psychologists and social workers who work for the defence mental health services are directly recruited fully trained, and all personnel engage in continuing professional development as recommended by the various professional bodies (such as the Royal College of Psychiatrists; Nursing and Midwifery Council and British Psychological Society). All training is conducted under the direction and administration of the Defence Postgraduate Medical Deanery and this organisation is advised by the Defence Consultant Advisor in Psychiatry.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_442"><a name="81119w0010.htm_para5"><a name="08111992000499">The military Departments of Community Mental Health (DCMHs) assess all service personnel referred to them for risk in accordance with NICE (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence) Clinical Guidelines which include the identification of clinical and demographic features known to be associated with risk of further self harm and/or suicide. An appropriate care plan is agreed with the individual, in consultation with the unit medical officer and appropriately supervised treatment is implemented, and similar procedures take place where individuals are being discharged from in-patient care.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_443"><a name="81119w0010.htm_para6"><a name="08111992000500">Mental health practitioners will also alert the chain of command where there is clear risk of death or serious harm to the patient or others, or where reasons underpinning the suicidal intent may also impact on others, balancing the issues of confidentiality and consent against the duty of care to the patient, as well as to others who might be harmed by a suicide attempt.</p>

The programme is still in the concept phase, and the requirements for numbers and variants have not yet been finalised. The future roles to be undertaken by FSC have yet to be fully defined but will be coherent with the capabilities called for in the 2004 Defence White Paper, &#145;Delivering Security in a Changing World, Future Capabilities&#146; (Cm 6269).</p>

 No assessment has been made of the effect on the supply of private rented accommodation of the introduction of the local housing allowance as it is too early to do so.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government what steps she plans to take to make brownfield sites available for housing development. [229864]</p>

<p><a name="st_237"><a name="08111992000835"><a name="81119w0013.htm_spnew4"><a name="08111992001072"><b>Mr. Iain Wright:</b>
 Building on brownfield land is essential if we are going to develop the homes that the country needs. Communities and Local Government's policies and programmes play a key part in ensuring that this happens. Through &#145;Planning Policy Statement (PPS) 3: Housing&#146;, for example, local planning authorities are required to plan for the long term by identifying developable sites for housing. The policy guidance maintains a continuing focus on recycling land and retains the national target that at least 60 per cent. of new homes should be built on brownfield land. Current performance against this target is 77 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_464"><a name="81119w0013.htm_para1"><a name="08111992000836">Policy guidance is also supported by priorities given to delivery bodies, such as the new Homes and Communities Agency which will be established later this year. Sustainability, including the reuse of brownfield land, will be at the heart of its work with a priority to bring about the most effective use of land and the ability to acquire derelict land for the provision of new housing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_465"><a name="81119w0013.htm_para2"><a name="08111992000837">Also, in March this year the Government published their response to English Partnerships' recommendations for a national brownfield strategy. The strategy considers brownfield land in the widest sense including all types of development and will help site owners, developers and regulators in the process of returning brownfield land to beneficial use. Work in developing the strategy has demonstrated the importance of a joined-up approach to developing brownfield policy. CLG and DEFRA have agreed to sponsor a new national body&#151;the National Brownfield Forum&#151;to secure better co-ordination at national level. The forum brings together key Whitehall Departments, agencies and industry stakeholders and promotes a more cohesive and inclusive approach to brownfield policy development and encourages knowledge sharing and best practice.</p>

For the European elections in 2004, the voter turnout was 38.5 per cent. compared to 24 per cent. in the previous European elections in 1999.

 While it is difficult to provide an accurate estimate of such savings, the indications are that savings in the region of &#163;10 million could result from holding the English local elections and elections to the European Parliament on the same day. To the extent that the costs of the European elections are reduced, this will be reflected in a lower call on the Consolidated Fund, while any reduction in the costs of local elections will reduce the call on councils' own resources.</p>

 Providers of registered care services are responsible of the health and welfare of people using their services.

1. The Southport and Formby PCT and the South Sefton PCTs merged in 2006-07 to create the Sefton PCT&#151;these two PCTs can be added together to compare with 2006-07.<br>
2. As a result of the merger of the Southport and Formby PCT and the South Sefton PCT, figures are provided for these PCTs from 2002-03 to 2005-06. A complex merger occurred prior to 2002-03 and it is not possible to trace which trusts should be included in order to get an accurate comparable figure.<br>
3. Ungrossed data&#151;figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data.<br>
4. A FCE is defined as a period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one health care provider. FCEs are counted against the year in which the FCE finishes. The figures do not represent the number of patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the year.<br>
5. It is also important that the PCT and trust figures are not added together, as the same FCEs may be counted under both organisations. This is because the trust data look at activity provided by the trust, whereas the PCT activity looks at activity commissioned by the PCT (which may then be provided at Aintree University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust).<br>
6. Data Quality&#151;HES are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and PCTs in England. Data are also received from a number of independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br>

<p><a name="stpa_512"><a name="81119w0018.htm_para0"><a name="08111996001031">The table also shows the regions in which these consultants worked.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_513"><a name="81119w0018.htm_para1"><a name="08111996001032">In summer 2006, HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) statisticians created an anonymised statistical dataset for research into the staff market forces factor (MFF) used in NHS resource allocation. The dataset was created by linking selected variables supplied by NHS Information Centre for health and social care from the 2003 NHS Medical and Dental Workforce Census with three income variables derived from HMRC records: total employment income, total self-employment income and the sum of these two variables. Any variables used to link the data were removed prior to access by the academic researcher contracted by Department. This deliberately partial data set contained only the information required by the researcher to carry out the statistical (regression) analysis used in the review of the MFF.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_514"><a name="81119w0018.htm_para2"><a name="08111996001033">The researcher had access to only this anonymised, statistical dataset. The statistical analyses were undertaken on HMRC premises. Having signed appropriate confidentiality undertakings, the researcher was allowed supervised access to the dataset in an isolated environment with no connection to either HMRC networks and administrative data systems or to external sites via internet or e-mail. HMRC reviewed all statistical output compiled by the researcher and released only aggregate non-disclosive summaries. No outputs based on single or small number of records were released. The smallest sample count in the published report was 30. This is well within the guidelines for dissemination of statistics in National Statistics protocols. The researcher was not allowed to return to the dataset once the agreed analysis had been completed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_515"><a name="81119w0018.htm_para3"><a name="08111996001034">As will be clear from the table, it was impossible to link records in the statistical dataset with any data relating to an identifiable individual, so no permission was sought from NHS consultants for this research to take place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_516"><a name="81119w0018.htm_para4"><a name="08111996001035">The total cost of the contract for research into the staff MFF was &#163;75,000. The analysis of private sector earnings of NHS consultants was a relatively small, but influential part of the review of the MFF. The final research report on the review of the staff MFF will be made available on the Department of Health website alongside the PCT revenue allocations, to be announced at the time of the Operating Framework for the NHS later this year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_517"><a name="81119w0018.htm_para5"><a name="08111996001036">The correspondence files relating to securing access to the tax return data base do not exist, since no one was given access to a data base of tax returns. The process that was followed to give access to an anonymised data set is as described.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_518"><a name="81119w0018.htm_para6"><a name="08111996001037">In the last 11 years, HMRC has conducted surveys into consultants&#146; earnings on behalf of the Department of Health for tax years 1998-99 to 2004-05 inclusive, using data from HMRC records. No outputs from this work have been provided to non-HM Revenue and Customs personnel in either pseudo-anonymised or non-anonymised form. HMRC released only anonymised outputs to the Department of Health or to the NHS Information Centre for health and Social care.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_519"><a name="81119w0018.htm_para7"><a name="08111996001038">In addition, at the request of the Department for 2003-04 only, HMRC created an anonymised statistical dataset relating to consultants&#146; earnings. It contained only the pre-arranged data items for a sample of 24,407 cases that were necessary to enable researchers acting on behalf of the Department of Health to undertake statistical analysis. The researchers were allowed supervised access to the dataset on HMRC premises. HMRC reviewed the outputs from the statistical analysis to ensure that only non-disclosive summary and aggregate statistics were compiled and used in the report.</p>

 Current United Kingdom dietary recommendations for maximal levels of sugar intake are based on a review of the evidence carried out by the Committee on Medical Aspects of Food Policy (COMA) in 1991, and are in line with a more recent review by the World Health Organisation (WHO) in 2003. The Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition, which now advises the Government on nutrition issues, are about to embark on a review of the evidence on carbohydrates and health, including sugars and sources of sugar. As a result, dietary advice and any recommendations on specific foods will be amended accordingly.</p>

As well as giving substantial support to the work of industry, the Health and Safety Executive is taking action to improve safety through a mix of enforcement initiatives and the provision of guidance. Future work will also take account of the findings from the inquiries into recent accidents involving tower cranes that the Health and Safety Executive are currently undertaking.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions how many people in Crosby constituency experienced a rise in income as a result of the introduction of the national minimum wage; and what estimate he has made of the number of such people whose income is affected by the national minimum wage in 2008.

 I have been asked to reply.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_566"><a name="81119w0023.htm_para8"><a name="0811204000424">Evidence from the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE) shows that a growing number of people are affected by the National Minimum Wage (NMW). BERR estimates using ASHE data that in 1999 around 1 million people in the UK were covered by the introduction of the NMW. This rises to around 1.1 million people covered by the October 2008 uprating of the NMW. This reflects an increasing importance of the NMW when determining the hourly wage of the low paid. The adult NMW has risen by around 59 per cent during this period from &#163;3.60 to &#163;5.73 per hour. The rise in the NMW has been greater than average earnings over this period.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_567"><a name="81119w0023.htm_para9"><a name="0811204000425">Information for individual parliamentary constituencies is not readily available in the ASHE dataset. However, information is available on a government office region basis. In 1999 around 120,000 employees in North West and Mersey were covered by the introduction of the National Minimum Wage. This estimate is based on Spring 1998 ASHE data. Using Spring 2008 ASHE data we estimate that around 130,000 employees were covered by the latest October 2008 NMW upratings.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_568"><a name="81119w0023.htm_para10"><a name="0811204000426">It is difficult to isolate the effect of the NMW on income as income is affected by hours worked and other sources of income such as tax credits. However, evidence suggests that since its introduction the NMW is affecting more people and the hourly wage is rising faster than average earnings benefiting the lowest paid in the economy.</p>

 We propose introducing additional flexibilities and safeguards in regulations. These will meet the specific needs of parents, particularly lone parents, and further safeguard the welfare of children.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_588"><a name="81119w0026.htm_para6"><a name="0811204000895">Jobseeker&#146;s allowance regulations will be amended to enable Jobcentre Plus staff to consider just cause and good cause so that a parent who is claiming or receiving jobseeker&#146;s allowance may not be penalised if they leave paid employment, or fail to take up paid employment, because appropriate or affordable child care is not available. The amendments will also give Jobcentre Plus staff additional flexibilities to treat parents as available for, or actively seeking, work in certain circumstances. For example, if a child is excluded from school or if there would be no reasonable prospects of a person with caring responsibilities obtaining suitable jobs in the area if they were to reduce their hours to a minimum of 16 hours a week. The existing jobseeker&#146;s allowance hardship regime will be extended to include lone parents as a vulnerable group, and Jobcentre Plus staff will be able to consider whether travel time to a job is reasonable, taking health or caring responsibilities into account.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_589"><a name="81119w0026.htm_para7"><a name="0811204000896">We also propose to introduce operational safeguards which will ensure that lone parents affected by the introduction of these changes and making a new claim are aware of their obligations to attend quarterly work-focused interviews, and that voluntary interviews will be available to them six weeks before their entitlement to income support ends. Also, if they fail to attend a fortnightly job review, at least one attempt at contacting them will be made by telephone on the day the meeting was missed. If no contact is made, a letter will be sent to their home address telling them that if they do not make contact within five working days their entitlement to benefit will end.</p>

<i> [holding answer 17 November 2008]:</i> The Government's crime strategy builds upon the achievements of the last 10 years in reducing crime and disorder but moves away from centrally imposed targets instead making local agencies accountable and responsive to the needs and priorities of the local community. This means that local areas can focus greatest effort on reducing those crimes that matter most to people locally, whatever the crime.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_598"><a name="81119w0027.htm_para7"><a name="08112012000054">Where the theft of agricultural machinery emerges as a pressing local issue we would encourage local police forces and their partners in Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships to devote resources to tackling this crime. To this end the National Policing Improvement Agency has produced a practical guide specifically for those facing the challenges of policing rural areas, titled Neighbourhood Policing in Rural Communities (2008). This aims to support the police in tailoring their approach to the needs of the rural communities they serve.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_599"><a name="81119w0027.htm_para8"><a name="08112012000055">The Home Office supports schemes such as Farm Watch and Countryside Watch, which are now operating across England and Wales, allowing farmers and those living in rural communities to share practical advice on crime prevention in order to look after their vehicles, property, families and animals.</p>

It operates the policy advocated by Home Office Guidance that the appropriate intervention should be used in the right way at the right time and incrementally.

 Contracts for the NIS using the &#145;Strategic Supplier Group&#146; framework and for passports contain provisions for termination based on Office of Government Commerce guidance. These include terms for ending the contract for poor performance or where a decision is made to terminate early (for &#145;convenience&#146;). For termination for convenience where between 12 and 18 months notice is given, a supplier may recover costs incurred to the point of termination and those associated with terminating the contract. Where less notice is given, in addition to costs incurred, some anticipated profit lost as a result of the decision to terminate early may be claimed. As these provisions are based on formulae dependent on when any decision is taken, work incurred to date and what elements of services are being terminated, no &#145;value&#146; can be calculated.</p>

 The Security Industry Authority&#146;s revocation process, which applied following right to work checks with the United Kingdom Border Agency on non-EEA SIA licence holders, incorporates a number of safeguards to ensure that licences are not revoked incorrectly. This includes written notification to the holder informing them that the SIA is minded to revoke their licence and allowing 21 days to respond with evidence of their right to work, during which the licence remains in force. Revocation follows if no such evidence is provided, but the holder retains the right of appeal through the courts for a further 21 days and a licence remains in force until the appeal process is completed.</p>

 The Government have no plans to extend police powers of objection to temporary event notices (TENs), nor do they plan to extend the right of objection to local residents.

 The Gambling Commission has advised that it does not have regulatory responsibilities in respect of prize competitions and free draws but that they do monitor the boundary between them and Lotteries. The Gambling Commission has published a range of guidance documents on the implementation of the Gambling Act 2005, including Guidance on Prize Competitions and Free Draws, published in November 2007. A press release urging homeowners to be aware of the rules on &#145;house competitions&#146; was published in October 2008. The press release advised that individuals considering or operating a scheme to sell their house using prize competitions should consider the guidance on the Gambling Commission website and take independent legal advice before proceeding.</p>

 We have made no assessment of the net change in the number of public houses over the last year. The DCMS Statistical Bulletin on Alcohol, Entertainment and Late Night Refreshment does not identify the number of pubs in England and Wales; but rather the number of premises authorising the sale or supply of alcohol by means of a premises licence or a club premises certificate. These figures apply not only to public houses, but also to other licensed premises such as hotels, off licences and convenience stores.</p>

This work includes extensive transport demand forecasting and modelling, which draws on estimates of journey times from a range of sources. People will travel to the Olympic Park using a wide range of transport modes including National Rail, London Underground, Docklands Light Railway (DLR), bus, coach, park and ride as well as walking and cycling.

 The Government are committed to supporting a demonstration of the full chain of CCS technologies (capture, transport and storage) on a commercial scale coal fired power plant in the UK. The Government are keen to see progress made towards the construction and operation by 2015 of up to 12 demonstration plants of commercial power generation with carbon capture and storage, as agreed by the European Council in spring 2007. The Government hope that the UK's CCS demonstration will participate in the EU's knowledge-sharing demonstration programme, once it is established. The UK has been working hard to tackle the main barrier to progress on demonstrations, lack of funding, by seeking an EU funding mechanism for CCS projects. June European Council Conclusions called on the Commission "to bring forward as soon as possible" such a mechanism, but to date, no source of EU funding has been identified for CCS demonstrations. However, as part of the ongoing negotiations on the 2020 climate change and energy package, the European Parliament has proposed an amendment to the EU ETS Directive to allocate 500 million allowances from the new entrants reserve to support CCS demonstration projects. The UK Government support this amendment  <br>

From DECC and European Commission analysis there are sufficient allowances (the Commission has proposed 5 per cent. of the total) in the new entrants reserve to support both new entrants and CCS demonstrations.

In making such decisions, all local authorities are under a duty to consider the views of the person to whom the record relates, the views of their parent or carer and of any schedule 4 or schedule 5 body (as specified by the regulations) working with that child or young person.</p>

<i> [holding answer 17 November 2008]: </i>The introduction of the Early Year Foundation Stage has generated some correspondence from child minders but the National Childminding Association (NCMA) has made clear that it sees it as a positive development, and as representing what good child minders already do. I recently met Liz Bayram, chief executive of the NCMA, to discuss the issues and challenges faced by child minders in their role as part of the wider child care work force. Child minding has, by its nature, always been a profession whose numbers have varied over time. The Government believe, however, that child minders have a vital role to play, and that they are used and valued by many parents for the unique type of child care they provide.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_714"><a name="81119w0042.htm_para3"><a name="08112048001016">It is true that child minding numbers have fallen overall, but it's important to remember that by its nature child minding has always been a profession whose numbers vary over time, for a number of reasons. For instance, Ofsted has recently carried out an exercise to remove child minders who are no longer actively looking after children from its register, which will have reduced the numbers.</p>

Most of the providers that close choose to do so voluntarily and for a variety of reasons. We do not collect these reasons. I am therefore unable to provide data identifying the reasons for providers closing in each of the last five years.</p>
</ul><a name="81119w0044.htm_brev3"><a name="08112048001930"><ul><p class="tabletext">Ofsted can only cancel registration where a person ceases to be qualified for registration, We would not normally take such action as a result of inspection, unless we believed that children were suffering or likely to suffer significant harm. The usual practice following an inspection judgement of inadequate is to require the setting to take action to improve. We have a number of enforcement options open to us to bring about such improvement, such as imposing conditions of registration or issuing a compliance notice requiring a setting to take certain actions by a particular date. It is an offence not to comply with such a notice. We only move towards cancelling registration when providers cannot or will not improve, As this is often much later than an inspection, we cannot attribute cancellation directly to the inspection judgement We must always give reasons for cancellation but these relate to the requirements a provider is failing to meet rattier than the immediate inspection outcomes.</p>

</ul><a name="81119w0044.htm_brev15"><a name="08112048001942"><ul><p class="tabletext">With regard to the regulation of childcare and early education, the period of the industrial action started after the end of the prescribed inspection period, completed by 31 March 2008. The new inspection programme did not commence until 1 September 2008. Our planned programme of work for the summer included registration visits, re-inspection of inadequate provision; short inspections of those providers who had no children on roll during the prescribed period; and first inspections of those who registered with us from December 2007. We completed all our planned inspection work during this period. We also met our targets for investigating complaints and for registering new day-care providers. Although we did not meet our registration target for new childminders, our evidence suggests the main reason for this was the delays caused by some police authorities in obtaining the CRB checks. As a consequence, I wrote to a number of police authorities about this issue.</p>

 Economic stabilisation, including currency reform, will be essential to recovery in Zimbabwe. If positive political change occurs and a new government embarks on a serious economic reform programme, it is expected that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) will provide advice and support for stabilisation, with the backing of other financial institutions and donors. Establishing a currency board is one of the options likely to be under consideration for currency reform and halting inflation. The Department for International Development (DFID), the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) and Her Majesty's Treasury (HMT) are working closely together to prepare for economic stabilisation and reform in Zimbabwe should the political situation allow and are in regular contact with (among others) the IMF, World Bank and Africa Development Bank on these matters.</p>

The June Council, and the Extraordinary European Council on 1 September, asked the Commission to develop proposals for stepping up the EU's engagement with our Eastern neighbours, among them Ukraine and Georgia, including through an initiative for an Eastern Partnership. We want this to be ambitious, in support of the aspirations of each of our neighbours, and provide increased practical support for closer integration with the EU. This initiative will be one of the items on the agenda for the December European Council.</p>
