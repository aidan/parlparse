<a name="80608w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B>

<P>
<a name="80608w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 No client under the supervision of the Public Trust Office has suffered a financial loss since 1990. Any loss that has occurred as a result of a mistake by the Public Trust Office is made good.

 It is only from the 1993/94 financial year that caseload figures in the Public Trust Office have been monitored on the same basis year on year. Although figures prior to 1993/94 exist, they have not been formulated in the same manner as those available from that date. On this basis, I am able to provide the figures from 1993/94 which include those cases in the Trust and Funds Sector of the Public Trust Office, as well as the Mental Health Sector caseload:

<P>
<P>
<a name="80608w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 No separate records are available before 1995 as, prior to the Public Trust Office being established as an executive agency on 1 July 1994, complaints referred to the parliamentary Commissioner were not separately recorded. Since 1995, one formal complaint has been received from the Parliamentary Commissioner

<a name="80608w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 I am able to supply the figures for each financial year from 1990-91. However, it should be noted that the introduction of Charter Standards by the Public Trust Office, to coincide with the launch of the Office as an executive agency on 1 July 1994, together with the recommendations made by the Citizen's Charter Complaints Task Force, meant that, from 1994-95, complaints were monitored in a more rigorous and consistent fashion across the Office.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80608w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 A new magistrates court for Worcester is being procured though the Private Finance Initiative. Final offers have been submitted by two bidders. It is hoped that a preferred bidder will be announced shortly with the contract finalised later this year. The new accommodation is expected to be available in 2001.

 The Legal Aid Board is unable to provide the information in the format requested. Legal aid cases relating solely to parental access are not separately recorded by the Board. Such cases could be covered by a certificate issued in response to applications for residence and contact orders; or by combined certificates including injunctions ancillary relief, residence and contact orders. Applications for residence and contact orders are not solely covered by civil legal aid.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what plans he has to review the training of administrators on the Legal Aid Board.  [43889]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80608w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The Legal Aid Board is an independent body and I do not interfere in the day-to-day running of the organisation. There are two executive members of the Legal Aid Board who are administrators, the Chief Executive and the Director of Resources and Supplier Development. Their training is monitored by the Board's Top Management and Personnel Committee. The Committee is chaired by the Chairman of the Board and oversees the performance of all senior executives and is responsible for ensuring that they are adequately trained. We have no plans to review arrangements.

 Taking together the London Cycle Network, the Thames Cycle Route, the Priority (Red Routes) programme, and other measures on London's trunk roads, approximately 225 miles of cycle lanes had been introduced by March 1998. Highway authorities have also provided cycle lanes on local roads, outside of the London Cycle Network and the Red Routes, but mileage figures are not held centrally.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what reports he has received from his French counterpart, concerning her decision to halt movement of spent irradiated nuclear fuel transport flasks on 6 May; how many flasks of this type have been transported into the United Kingdom; and if he will place the safety of spent fuel transportation on the Agenda for the next European Environment and Transport Council meetings.  [44108]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80608w02.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 I understand that consignments of irradiated nuclear fuel from power stations are currently suspended in both France and Germany following revelations of high levels of non-fixed radioactive contamination arising during shipments to the reprocessing facility at La Hague. I am not aware of any shipments from European power stations to Sellafield revealing similarly high levels of contamination in the United Kingdom. I further understand that my counterparts in France and Germany have set up a working group of the representatives of their safety authorities, charged to organise the bilateral co-operation of the specialists in the disciplines concerned. My officials have offered to participate in this working group. I believe it would be appropriate to await the findings and recommendations of this working group before consideration is given to putting this item on to the Agenda for the European Environment and Transport Council meeting.

 My Department measures air quality at the Ladybower site in Derbyshire.
<P>

<a name="80608w02.html_para1">There were six days during May when the National Air Quality standard for ozone (50 parts per billion (ppb) as an 8-hour running mean) was exceeded at Ladybower. The levels on these days reached the "moderate" air pollution band. There were no days during May when air pollution reached "high" (greater than 90ppb as an hourly mean). The highest hourly ozone concentration recorded during May at Ladybower was 69ppb.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what targets he has set and measures he has put in place to reduce atmospheric ozone to below the Government's ozone health safety limit.  [44377]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80608w02.html_spnew3"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 The Government have adopted a provisional objective for ozone of 50 parts per billion as a running 8-hour mean, to be achieved at the 97th percentile level, i.e. on all but 10 days per year assuming perfect operation of the monitoring station with 100 per cent. data capture throughout the year, by 2005.
<P>

<a name="80608w02.html_para2">Ozone is a secondary pollutant found in the atmosphere from the reaction of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) in the presence of sunlight. It is a transboundary pollutant in that precursors emitted in one country can contribute to ozone formation in others. Action to tackle ozone formation needs, therefore, to be taken in a coherent fashion at a European scale in order to optimise the cost effectiveness of abatement measures.
<P>

<a name="80608w02.html_para3">The United Kingdom has implemented many measures aimed at reducing ozone precursor emissions. These include ratification of the UNECE-CLRTAP (United Nations Economic Commission for Europe-Convention on Long Range Transboundary Air Pollution) Protocol to reduce emissions of VOCs by 30 per cent. relative to 1988, ratification of a UNECE-CLRTAP Protocol to

stabilise emissions of nitrogen oxides at 1987 levels, implementation of several European Community Directives to reduce exhaust emissions of VOCs and nitrogen oxides from road vehicles, implementation of an EC Directive to reduce emissions of VOCs from the storage and distribution of petrol and implementation of the European Community Directive limiting the emissions from Large Combustion Plant.
<P>

<a name="80608w02.html_para4">In addition, the Government are currently actively participating in discussions on further European measures to reduce emissions of VOCs from the use of solvents and further measures to reduce emissions from road vehicles planned for the years 2000 and 2005. Furthermore, and due to the international nature of ozone formation, the Government are actively participating in discussions to develop a further UNECE-CLRTAP protocol and a European Community Strategy to address ozone.

 We will be considering information from a variety of experts, including the Airborne Particles Expert Group, during the process of the review of the National Air Quality Strategy. The report of the Airborne Particles Expert Group has yet to be published. A draft of the report will be circulated for peer review in the summer. The final report is due to be published towards the end of this year.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what research has been carried out into the effects of genetically modified crops planted in England on <i>(a)</i> surrounding areas and <i>(b)</i> those who consume the food and into the risks of cross-fertilisation with non-genetically modified crops planted nearby.

<P>
<a name="80608w02.html_spnew10"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 The Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions funds a research programme to support the risk assessment of proposed releases of genetically modified organisms into the environment. Copies of all our published research reports have been placed in the House of Commons Library. Six completed reports are awaiting publication and seven projects are currently under way. Our assessment of the likely effects of the GMOs always includes the surrounding area. This would include, for example, gene transfer to wild relatives and other crops, effects on Sites of Special Scientific Interest, and the safety of those living in the vicinity of the release. Therefore, all our research projects contribute to our assessment of applications for consent in this respect.

<a name="80608w02.html_para8">The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food are responsible for safety of GMOs and products derived from GMOs which may be consumed as food and animal feed. MAFF are currently funding 25 research projects which address specific risk assessment issues with respect to use for food. Completed reports are publicly available in the MAFF library.
<P>

<a name="80608w02.html_para9">With respect to cross fertilisation, the risk assessment for applications for consent to release GMOs always considers firstly, the likelihood of gene transfer occurring and secondly, the consequences of gene transfer for human health or the environment. In coming to a view on gene transfer, we also take into account internationally agreed standards for seed purity which have been developed over years of plant breeding experience. These set out required isolation distances to achieve the required level of seed purity for seed certification.
<P>

<a name="80608w02.html_para10">A number of research projects have been carried out by both my Department and the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to investigate transgene movement.

<P>
<a name="80608w02.html_spnew11"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 Currently, there are 64 experimental trials of genetically modified crops in progress covering a total of approximately 841 acres. Of these, one site is 494 acres, with the remainder consisting of small size plots with an average area of less than 2 acres. In addition to the sites for experimental releases, there is one oilseed rape trial for commercial seed production covering 17.5 acres.
<P>

<a name="80608w02.html_para12">The majority of the experimental trials are for oilseed rape (27), sugar beet (16), and potatoes (14), although GM wheat (3), maize (2), chicory (1) and barley (1) are also grown.

<P>
<a name="80608w02.html_spnew12"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 The genetically modified maize crop sown at Staverton has animal feed safety clearance from the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, and it is normal practice for such material to be used as animal fodder after harvest. In addition, some of the crop may be used for analysis of seed production and yield, as it forms part of the National List Trials for maize.

 I promised earlier this year that I would begin the process of preparing a new national waste strategy with a wide ranging public consultation. My right hon.

<P>

<a name="80608w03.html_para3">The consultation exercise will last through the Summer. We will be looking for views from a wide range of people and organisations, and want to provoke a wide debate on the options open to us and the best way to take waste management into the twenty-first century.

 I have today laid before the House a draft Order, under section 57 of the Local Government Finance Act 1992, setting out our decision on the final cap for Derbyshire County Council.
<P>

<a name="80608w03.html_para5">We have considered very carefully all the available relevant information, including the case made by the Council in support of a higher cap, before taking our decision. We have decided to increase the cap proposed for Derbyshire, by &#163;2.9 million.

<a name="80608w03.html_para6">Derbyshire's cap is, in our view, reasonable, appropriate and achievable in all the circumstances of the County Council. This decision will reduce public expenditure and the burden on council taxpayers in the County by &#163;1 million in 1998-99. This will result in a council tax reduction (at Band D) of around &#163;4.31.

 <i>[pursuant to her reply, 1 June 1998, c. 28]:</i> Under section 33 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990, it is unlawful to deposit, recover or dispose of controlled waste without a waste management licence, contrary to the conditions of a licence or in a way which causes pollution of the environment or harm to human health. Where someone purports to be carrying out an activity which is exempt from waste management licensing but fails to comply with the terms of the exemption, that person may be prosecuted under section 33 of the 1990 Act for carrying out a licensable activity without a licence. The Environment Agency is responsible for the enforcement of these provisions in England and Wales.
<P>

<a name="80608w03.html_para7">Most landspreading of waste is carried out under the terms of the exemption from waste management licensing in paragraph 7 of Schedule 3 of the Waste Management Licensing Regulations 1994. I understand that the Environment Agency is developing a central prosecution database. However, I am advised that, at present, the Agency does not maintain a central record of occasions or sites on which waste may have been landspread in a manner which is inconsistent with the terms of the exemption in the 1994 Regulations.

 At our summit in Birmingham last month, we agreed to implement rapidly the Principles and 10-point Action Plan against high-tech crime adopted by our Justice and Interior Ministers in Washington last December. Our governments are engaged in co-ordinated discussions with relevant industries in our countries, including Internet Service Providers, to develop better arrangements for obtaining electronic evidence of crimes and making it available to investigators and prosecutors in other jurisdictions.

 The Department's funding for education extends principally to the further and higher education sectors, including grants to students. Such expenditure is not readily identifiable for particular geographical areas. Responsibility for school education in the Argyll and Bute area lies with Argyll and Bute Council and is funded through the general arrangements for local authority resources. Resources have also been allocated to Argyll and Bute Council since May 1997 for the following specified purposes related to school education:

<P>
<P>
<a name="80608w07.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 The proposals in the Crime and Disorder Bill relating to Home Detention Curfew are estimated to cost up to &#163;35 million per year, but are expected to avoid the need for estimated expenditure of up to &#163;180 million a year on new prison places. Research conducted on the current trials of curfew orders estimated that a national roll-out of curfew orders could cost up to &#163;22 million per year. However, this estimate does not take account of the effect of providing electronic monitoring for curfew orders simultaneously with Home Detention Curfew.
<P>

<a name="80608w07.html_para2">The Home Office is currently letting contracts for electronic monitoring services under which contractors will be responsible for providing a range of applications of electronic monitoring. The final cost of electronic monitoring services will depend on the outcome of the procurement process.

<a name="80608w07.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 Kits which test for the presence of ecstasy are, in our view, of doubtful value in reducing risks to users. Ecstasy itself is a drug with well-documented short-term risks; and there are worries about its long-term effects. Ecstasy tablets seized in this country which have been tested by the Forensic Science Service have not been contaminated by substances more harmful than ecstasy itself. While the situation will be kept under review, there is no present intention to introduce specific controls on the supply of these kits. But it should be noted that possession of a substance

 The Department was asked by E-Z Limited on 23 March for its view of the ecstasy testing kit it proposed selling. In reply, officials explained that the Home Office did not endorse such products, and that the Government believed that testing could give a false sense of security and would not help to reduce the risks involved in taking the drug.

 This information is not held centrally.
<P>

<a name="80608w07.html_para3">In practice, many clubs are already doing a good deal to tackle drugs misuse in partnership with the police, local authorities and other agencies. For those not able or willing to do so, the Public Entertainments Licences (Drugs Misuse) Act 1997 was brought into effect on 1 May 1998. This gives local authorities new powers of immediate closure where there are serious problems with the supply or use of controlled drugs at premises controlled by a club licence holder.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80608w07.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 It should be remembered that the Forensic Science Service (FSS) is involved in a minority of cases, where the technology is complex and technical/chemical enhancement of fingerprints is requested, not in the vast bulk of routine cases. The average turn-around time (taken over the year 1997-98) is 50 days. Where a result is needed urgently, the FSS endeavours to respond accordingly and fast-track responses are included in these overall figures.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80608w07.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 The present law, principally the Protection of Animals Act 1911, makes it an offence to ill-treat any animals, including greyhounds. We have no plans for further legislation in this area. The greyhound racing industry already takes greyhound welfare most seriously--both during and after the dogs' racing careers.
<P>

<a name="80608w07.html_para6">Neither the 1978 Royal Commission on Gambling nor the 1991 Home Affairs Committee report recommended a levy on greyhound betting. Both regarded this as a commercial activity that did not demand direct Government involvement. We take the same view.

<a name="80608w08.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 The Public Safety Radio Communications Project (PSRCP) is intended to replace all radio infrastructures for the police service with the new generation of digital radio communication systems from 1999 onwards. The project is being managed by the Police Information Technology Organisation (PITO) which became a Non-Departmental Public Body in April this year. Under the PSRCP, a national co-ordinated approach is being taken to the planning, design and implementation of the new communications systems, and PITO has been supporting North Yorkshire Police, along with all other forces in England and Wales, to achieve this. A Business Case for the implementation of the project will be completed this year, and a decision taken on whether to proceed. If a contract is awarded, the North Yorkshire Police force is scheduled to be one of the first forces to receive the new service.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80608w08.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 The last Government removed from Ministers any direct control over police numbers or the deployment of police officers. Under the Police and Magistrates' Courts Act 1994, it is for individual chief constables to determine the number of police officers in their force within the resources available to them. Resources for the police in England and Wales this year increased by 3.7 per cent., or &#163;258 million, to &#163;7.15 billion.
<P>

<a name="80608w08.html_para4">We are working with the police to ensure that these resources are used as effectively as possible, and to reduce administrative burdens in order to enable chief constables to put more officers back into the community.

<a name="80608w08.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 At the end of April 1998, there were 51,465 asylum applications awaiting an initial decision, a reduction on the previous year. Applications are currently estimated to be taking, on average, 14 months to reach an initial decision in cases lodged after the Asylum and Immigration Appeals Act 1993, and 58 months for those lodged prior to that Act. Both these figures reflect the proportion of inherited old cases within the system. But figures for 1997 show that 38 per cent. of initial decisions on asylum applications were taken within six months, as against only 10 per cent. in 1992.

 Payments under Options A and B of the large calibre handgun compensation scheme and the parallel ex gratia scheme for small calibre pistols were completed by the end of May, as planned. The only exceptions are around 300 cases involving firearms dealers and individual owners where payment cannot be finalised because of outstanding queries over the eligibility of items claimed for, difficulties in obtaining the required details to enable payment to be made, or where the claimant has declined to complete the required Declaration on the claim form. Payment on these remaining claims will completed as soon as the necessary information and signatures are provided.
<P>

<a name="80608w08.html_para7">The Firearms Compensation Section (FCS) is now devoting the bulk of its resources to processing the Option C claims, which are fewer in number but more complicated. There are around 24,500 Option C claims to be processed, the great majority of which are mixed claims on which payments have been made already under Option A or B. The rate of payment on these claims will increase now that we have more staff allocated to this task. In the interests of fairness, Option C claims are being dealt with in the order in which the guns were surrendered to the police, so that the claimant will not be penalised by any subsequent delay in forwarding the claim to the Home Office. The target is to complete most of these payments by the end of the year, if not all, and we will do everything that can be done to clear these claims in a shorter time if at all possible.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer which body will guarantee the value of notional euro in Phase B of Stage Three of EMU from January 1999 to July 2002.  [44459]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80608w09.html_spnew6"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 On 1 January 1999, the euro will become the actual and sole currency of participating member states. The old national currencies of these member states will continue only as denominations of the euro. The conversion rates between these currencies and the euro will be legally fixed. The European Central Bank will become responsible for euro monetary policy from this date onward.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what profits he estimates will derive to the United Kingdom from seigniorage if the United Kingdom participates in Stage Three of Economic and Monetary Union.  [44456]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80608w09.html_spnew7"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 If the UK participated in Economic and Monetary Union, its share of the monetary income accruing to the national central banks would depend on a number of factors, including the number of other Member States in EMU, the level of note issue by the European Central Bank, and the level of ECB reserve requirements. It is impossible to estimate with any degree of certainty now the size of the UK's allocation if and when it joined the single currency.
<P>
<P>
<a name="80608w09.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Mitchell: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer how profits of seigniorage on euro notes and coins will be distributed among participants.  [44453]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80608w09.html_spnew8"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 The method for allocating monetary income between national central banks in Stage Three of EMU is described in the Statute of the ESCB. The sum of monetary income accruing to the national central banks in the performance of the ESCB's monetary policy function will be allocated in proportion to each central bank's paid-up share in the capital of the ECB. National central banks' contributions to the capital of the ECB will be based on Member States' relative population and GDP.

<P>
<a name="80608w09.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Mitchell: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what recent changes have been made to the remit of the European Union Monetary Committee; and what is its role in relation to <i>(a)</i> the EMI and <i>(b)</i> the ECB.  [44455]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80608w09.html_spnew9"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 The remit of the Monetary Committee continues to be as set out in Article 109c(1) of the Treaty. In accordance with Article 109c(2) of the Treaty, the Monetary Committee will be replaced by an Economic and Financial Committee at the start of Stage Three of EMU. The ECB shall appoint two members of the Economic and Financial Committee. The Monetary Committee and the Economic and Financial Committee contribute to the preparation of the work of the Council, including with respect to matters involving the EMI and the ECB.

 The UK Government are committed to increasing transparency in EU decision making, including the activities of the EU institutions.

The UK has supported the Commission's proposals on Information and Communication programmes for TACIS and Phare and the Department for Trade and Industry maintains a database of projects being funded by major multilateral agencies, including the EC.
<P>

<a name="80608w10.html_para6">Some progress has been made on our initiatives to improve openness in the EU. We have also begun preparatory work with the European Commission and European Parliament on implementing the openness provisions in the Amsterdam Treaty.

 As stated in the White Paper <i>Eliminating World Poverty: a Challenge for the 21st Century</i>, this Government are committed to encouraging all multilateral developments institutions--including the European Commission--to integrate environmental and social sustainability into their projects and devote more attention to evaluating and monitoring their activities. DFID worked closely with the European Commission to develop procedural guidelines for this purpose. However, continuing efforts are required to ensure the Commission's guidance is always fully reflected in the design and implementation of projects and programmes. My Department continues to work with the Commission to seek to improve effectiveness in this area.

 The UK clearly set out its position on Stabex for the Commission and other Member States in the Government's paper on the future of Lome in October 1997. I have placed a copy of this paper in the Library. There has been strong opposition to the abolition of Stabex from some Member States in subsequent discussions on the EU's negotiating mandate for the successor to the Lome Convention. However, the UK has been negotiating vigorously to reform this instrument, most recently at the Development Council on 18 May which my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State and I attended.

 The British Government allocated &#163;6.2 million for the crisis in Southern Sudan during May bringing our overall assistance to Sudan since February to &#163;10.2 million.

<a name="80608w11.html_para3">Since my statement to the House on 29 April 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 331-38, the Government of Sudan have been gradually improving access to the worst affected areas, particularly in Bahr El Ghazal. I approved further British contributions during May totalling &#163;6.23 million which brings our overall assistance to Sudan since February to &#163;10.23 million. I have made it clear since the beginning of the current emergency that we alongside other governments will provide the funding needed for the Sudanese emergency and that the problem is one of access rather than resources. The EU General Affairs Council on 25 May again called for a ceasefire for humanitarian purposes, which remains the most urgent requirement. This is why we have been pressing for a ceasefire for humanitarian purposes, which remains the most important requirement in order to provide help to the people in need.

 It is for the livestock industry to take responsibility for disposing of its waste in a safe and sustainable manner. Nevertheless, the Department will continue to urge the industry to use knackers' yards and hunt kennels to dispose of fallen stock wherever possible. Officials will also continue to liaise with representatives of the knacker and farming industries over future arrangements for the disposal of fallen stock.

<a name="80608w12.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The labelling rules in the Novel Foods and Novel Food Ingredients Regulation (258/97) apply to all foods and food ingredients covered by the regulation including those considered under the simplified criteria on the grounds of substantial equivalence. There are no plans to review this regulation at this time. However, last month, detailed rules for labelling of genetically modified (GM) soya and maize ingredients were agreed which require all foods to be labelled where any material arising from the genetic modification process is present. These rules are expected to set a precedent for the way all future GM foods will be required to be labelled in Europe.

 In March this year, milk producers received an average of about 19.7p per litre, which was nearly 4p lower than for the same period in 1997. The main factor was probably the strength of sterling and the related revaluations of the green pound.

 No. The Fresh Meat (Beef Controls) (No 2) Regulations 1996, as amended, prohibit the sale for human consumption of any meat from a bovine animal over 30 months of age at the time of slaughter, whether in Great Britain or elsewhere, unless it is from a herd registered under the Beef Assurance Scheme or from one of the 14 countries exempted under the Regulations.

<P>
<a name="80608w12.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 From April 1999, only alcoholic butters (including brandy, rum and whisky butters) containing a minimum of 34 per cent. milk fat will be permitted to be described as such. This results from the adoption of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 623/98, which further amends Commission Regulation (EC) No. 577/97 relating to standards for spreadable fats. During the negotiations in Brussels, the UK did not support this particular rule which arbitrarily limits the milkfat content of products described using the term "butter".

 We do not systematically provide schools with information about the EU or euro, although there are a number of Government publications which individual schools can request and all schools received a pack which included information about our EU Presidency at the start of this year. In general, literature produced by Government departments about the EU takes a factual approach, explaining particular policies and the UK's views rather than weighing up arguments for and against EU action. But the Treasury booklet "The Pros and Cons of EMU" sets out the main potential costs and benefits of the euro.

 At a political level, we raise the issue of the safety of human rights workers with the Colombian Government whenever the opportunity arises. At a practical level, officials at the British Embassy in Bogota have a regular dialogue with human rights NGOs, and the Ambassador and his Deputy carry out high-profile visits to areas of conflict to demonstrate their support for the work of human rights workers. These visits, in particular, are highly valued by NGOs. The UK and EU partners are also pressing the Colombian Government to make early and practical use of the US$1.2 million they have earmarked for the protection of human rights workers.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80608w14.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson: </B> 
 The Luxembourg European Council last December agreed to enhance the pre-accession strategy for the Central European EU applicants to help them prepare for membership. The principal new element of this strategy are the Accession Partnerships, which identify the main priority areas for each candidate where progress is necessary to meet the Copenhagen Criteria for membership. The UK Presidency implemented the remit from Luxembourg to conclude the Accession Partnerships by the end of March.
<P>

<a name="80608w14.html_para0">The EU's Phare programme will target the priorities identified in the Accession Partnerships. Between 1995 and 1999, Phare spending on Bulgaria will be 415 mecu. (UK share approximately &#163;49 million). In addition, the Department for International Development's Know How Fund has provided approximately &#163;15 million of assistance to Bulgaria since 1991. This has been designed to help the transition to democratic pluralism and a market economy, in particular, by supporting the strengthening of civil society and promoting social inclusiveness, paying particular attention to the needs of vulnerable groups.

 The EU agreed a Common Position on Nigeria on 20 November 1995 which includes a full-scope arms embargo.

<P>

<a name="80608w14.html_para4">As Presidency we issued an EU Declaration on 1 May which voiced European concerns and called upon all parties to implement an immediate cease-fire.

 We do not consider there to be an effective government in Afghanistan. We remain deeply concerned by the continuing human rights abuses in Afghanistan.

We regularly make representations to all the warring factions on the issue. We also urge Afghanistan's neighbours, both bilaterally and in the UN, to use their influence over the warring Afghan factions to bring the fighting and the human rights abuses to an end.

<P>
<a name="80608w14.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson: </B> 
 The conference table forms part of the overall event production contract for the European Council. Our event production company established from the major UK conference furniture suppliers that no table which fully met the specification was available for hire, (their researches showed that a conference table which was the right size, not the right configuration, for Cardiff City Hall could be hired, but would still cost more than half as much as having a table made which could be used in Cardiff and subsequently). They put all carpentry involved in the European Council and G8 contracts (for which they were also responsible) out to tender to three companies as a package in order to keep costs to a minimum. The company judged by our event production company to have the capacity to manage this scale of project at lowest cost was awarded the carpentry subcontract. They are making the frame of the table, but have further subcontracted the veneer top and cable management system to a specialist cabinet maker regularly used by them for this type of contract.

 The table for the European Council meeting in Cardiff is being made by a UK company, with a UK sub-contractor, who are responsible for sourcing materials for the table against cost and quality criteria. Of the major materials used, the steel is from the UK. The MDF is from the Republic of Ireland, on grounds of cost and availability. The oak for the veneer

<P><I>8 Jun 1998 : Column: 462</I><P>
top comes from the USA. There are two reasons for using American rather than British oak: it is cheaper (British oak would cost 40 per cent. more); and the knotting grain pattern usually found in British oak would make a consistent veneer finish significantly more difficult to make.

<P>
<a name="80608w14.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson: </B> 
 The overall event production contract for the European Council (of which the conference table forms part) was awarded on the basis of an evaluation of the whole package put forward in the tender, not any single element. Six event production companies were invited to tender. Two declined to bid, and two others merged and submitted a joint bid. The three bids were evaluated against a comprehensive set of criteria, including cost and quality. Of those judged to meet an acceptable standard, the cheapest bidder was appointed.

<a name="80608w14.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson: </B> 
 In the original tender for the overall event production contract for the European Council (which includes the conference table) in August 1997, the company which won the contract quoted &#163;38,640 for the table. We have not yet received a bill for the table, but expect it to cost about &#163;50,000. We understand from the event production company that the cost has risen (i) because specialist advice on the acoustics of the Assembly room in Cardiff City hall has led to a sound system being built into the table (which was not part of the original specification), and (ii) because we asked the company to have the table made in adaptable modular format so as to be usable in different rooms (the original specification applied only to City Hall in Cardiff)--this involved making two extra endpieces.

A report of a suspected adverse drug reaction does not necessarily mean that it was caused by the drug, as factors such as underlying disease and concomitant medication may be contributory. The level of reporting of adverse drug reactions with particular drugs is influenced by the scale of drug usage, the period of time the drug has been on the market and publicity about the drug.<P>

 The contribution to be made by people placed by local authorities in residential or nursing homes towards the costs of their care is governed by the National Assistance (Assessment of Resources) Regulations 1992 No. 2977. We update these Regulations annually and issue clarifying guidance which takes account of points raised in representations made to the Department in the course of the year about the operation of the system. The most recent guidance, Local Authority Circular b(98)8, was issued in March 1998, copies of which are available in the Library. In order to receive local authority support, a person must undergo an assessment of their care needs by the local authority to determine the type and level of care needed, and if residential and nursing home care is arranged, a financial assessment to determine their contribution towards the cost. Concerns have been expressed about the way the elderly residents' savings have been treated in residential care and nursing homes. The Community Care (Residential Accommodation) Bill, will ensure that once a person has been assessed as needing residential or nursing home care they will not have to use savings below the capital threshold set out in the Regulations to contribute towards the costs. Subject to this becoming law, we will issue guidance to accompany it.

 There is already experience in the United Kingdom of prescribing the diamorphine (pharmaceutical heroin) albeit only for a small number of people in drug treatment. The Swiss trials indicate that it is feasible to use diamorphine under strictly controlled conditions as part of a comprehensive social and psychological intervention. In the absence of any comparative trials it is difficult to determine the value of the diamorphine provision as distinct from other aspects of the treatment package.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80608w16.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Keith Bradley: </B> 
 The Social Security Act 1998, which received Royal Assent on 21 May, paves the way for modernising the delivery of social security, including 



<P>
<P><I>8 Jun 1998 : Column: 469</I><P>
the handling of appeals. A wide range of measures--some of which we are introducing immediately--will streamline the administration of appeals and ensure appeals are dealt with more speedily. In particular, the Act enables the Secretary of State to assume responsibility for the administration of the appeals system. She will set and publish demanding targets for the administration of appeals and report on the results.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security what assessment her Department has made of the likely impact on marriage and illegitimacy of her proposed changes in the benefit system.  [42951]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80608w16.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Field: </B> 
 The social implications of all proposed benefit changes are considered carefully. We believe that the family remains the fundamental building block of society and the new welfare system will offer support to families on the basis of the needs of children rather than on family structure or marital status. The Budget announcements of increases to benefits for children, the Childcare Tax Credit and the Working Families Tax Credit are clear evidence of our commitment to supporting families with children.

 The methodology and actuarial assumptions in the minimum funding requirement were devised by the Faculty and Institute of Actuaries.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80608w17.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 We have made it clear in our Green Paper that Disability Living Allowance and Attendance Allowance will remain national and universal benefits and as such they will not be subject to a means test. Taxation is a matter for my right hon. Friend the Chancellor, but we have no current plans to tax DLA: there were no such proposals in the Green Paper. Equally, there are no plans to tax Income Support (the income-related benefit paid to many people with disabilities) War Pensions or Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit.

 There is no generally agreed formula for defining disabled people. The Disability Survey suggests that there are some 8.6 million disabled adults in private households. The numbers who receive benefits as a result of their disability are shown in the table.

 The factors taken into account are the effects of a person's disability on their day to day life as described in their self-reporting claim form. Information provided by a person's General Practitioner and/or hospital consultant or other health professional is also factored into these considerations. Adjudication Officers consult Benefits Agency Medical Services doctors on the nature and effects of disabilities. Information is also available to Adjudication Officers in the Disability Handbook which is compiled by senior doctors of this Department and approved and monitored by the Disability Living Allowance Advisory Board.

 Staff throughout the Agency offer a range of advice to customers. In line with Ministers' aims of achieving welfare reform and providing an Active Modern Service, we are developing an integrated approach to provision of advice, both in respect of benefit entitlement and in terms of broader welfare considerations. This approach reflects the principle that customers can be better served by greater co-ordination of services which have traditionally been provided by wholly separate organisations.
<P>

<a name="80608w18.html_para0">We are currently evaluating the ways in which such co-ordination might best be achieved. This may involve the deployment of more caseworkers, not only within the Benefits Agency, but also in partner organisations such as Employment Services, Local Authorities, other DSS Agencies and the wider welfare community including the private sector.

<P>
<a name="80608w18.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Keith Bradley: </B> 
 In his Budget Statement, my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer set out a number of measures for families with children. From November 1998, there will be a &#163;2.50 increase in the under-11 child allowance in Income Support (IS), Jobseeker's Allowance (JSA), Housing Benefit (HB), Council Tax Benefit (CTB), Family Credit and Disability Working Allowance. From April 1999, Child Benefit for the eldest child and the family premium in IS, JSA, HB and CTB will be increased by &#163;2.50.
<P>

<a name="80608w18.html_para1">Support for children will also be substantially improved by the introduction of a childcare tax credit which is designed to make support for children through the tax system more generous and more transparent.
<P>

<a name="80608w18.html_para2">In addition to these measures, increases in the childcare disregard for in-work benefits came into force from 1 June. The maximum disregard is now &#163;100 a week for families incurring childcare costs for two or more children of qualifying age and the upper age limit for children has been extended by a year.

 The Government are committed to improving opportunities and incentives for disabled people who want to work, whilst providing appropriate support to those who cannot. There are four strands to our strategy for helping people with disabilities or long-term sickness who want to work; taking action to help make work pay; providing the active help and encouragement people with disabilities need to move into work; removing obstacles to work from the benefits system; and promoting radical change in the work place to ensure equality and opportunity.
<P>

<a name="80608w18.html_para3">Specific initiatives include the New Deal for Disabled People, under which we will pilot a new Personal Adviser Service and fund a number of innovative schemes to test ways of helping disabled people who want to work; changes to benefit rules, including a new 52 week linking rule for incapacity benefits to be introduced from this October; the Disabled Persons Tax Credit, which we are developing to replace and enhance Disability Working Allowance; and the Disability Rights Task Force, which we have set up to advise on the best ways to secure civil rights and maximise the benefits of the Disability Discrimination Act (the remaining provisions of which we are committed to implementing).

<P>
<a name="80608w18.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Keith Bradley: </B> 
 Improved service delivery is central to our approach to welfare reform. Our services must actively help people to move off welfare and into work.
<P>

<a name="80608w18.html_para7">In December 1997, we launched our Active Modern Service programme to transform Social Security by building a system that commands the support and confidence of those who use it, those who administer it and those who fund it, providing a better, simpler, more efficient service to clients.
<P>

<a name="80608w18.html_para8">The focus of our effort will be to provide services that clients need. We will achieve a much better outcome if we include them in the debate. On 18 June 1998, we will be speaking to client representatives to begin to tell them of our plans and consult them about the way forward.
<P>

<a name="80608w18.html_para9">Much has begun to be put in place, enhanced quality of service delivery by improving decision making, closer working initiatives with Local Authorities, pilots to test the automatic delivery of benefit for pensioners and personal advisors for Lone Parents and the Disabled.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. Figures have been taken from the 1997 Social Security Departmental Report as well as earlier equivalent publications. The figures exclude the cost of Administration<P>

2. The figures for 1996-97 are estimates of expenditure in that year. Revised figures for the years 1996-97 to 1998-99 have been included in the 1998 Social Security Departmental Report. Figures for subsequent years are not included as they are subject to the findings of the Comprehensive Spending Review, the results of which are expected later this year<P>

3. Benefits have been allocated according to the main reason they are paid in order to provide figures consistent with tables in the Social Security Departmental Report. This means that some benefits, such as Attendance Allowance, have been included in the non-elderly totals shown in the table, even though they may be paid to elderly people.<P>
