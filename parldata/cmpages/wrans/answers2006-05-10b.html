[68402]</p><p><a name="06051073000221"><b><a name="06051073000584">Mr.
Dhanda:</b> The key recommendations in the social exclusion
unit's (SEU) report on &#145;Young Runaways' were that young people
at risk of running away should know who they could talk to about their
problems, that local services needed to work closer together to make
sure young people got help, and that a safety net of community-based
emergency accommodation was needed for those who did run
away.</p><p><a name="06051073000222">The findings of
the SEU report, which was published in 2002, influenced the wider
Government strategy on children's services, which was set out in the
Green Paper 'Every Child Matters' (2003). It is through the
&#145;Every Child Matters: Change for Children' programme currently
being taken forward by local authorities, and including the reforms set
out in the Green Paper 'Youth Matters', that the Government are
promoting measures that respond to the SEU
report.</p><p><a name="06051073000223">&#145;Change
for Children' aims to help local services respond to the full range of
children's needs&#151;including their health, their safety and their
economic well-being. It is particularly concerned with improving
targeted support for those children most at risk of negative outcomes,
such as those associated with running away or going missing from home.
The programme, drawing on the Children Act 2004 reforms, is enabling
local areas to improve integrated working arrangements by establishing
multi-disciplinary teams, while adopting a lead professional
model&#151;someone who is a single point of contact for a young
person who can co-ordinate a package of support when multiple needs are
present requiring help from various sources. Improved integrated
working at a local level is being accompanied by enhanced information
sharing between services, leading to earlier 
<br><notus-date day="10" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>10 May 2006 : Column 256W</b><br>identification of children's needs. This in turn allows young people to
be referred to the right source of support, at the right time. New
Joint Inspection Arrangements will judge the effectiveness and
co-ordination of such local
provision.</p><p><a name="06051073000224">We
have also run six projects to test out how best to provide safe,
flexible and responsive community-based services that can be easily
incorporated into mainstream children's services. We will disseminate
the lessons learnt from these to local authorities later this
year.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="06051073000024">Skills

Balls:</b> The estimated number of residential and
non-residential transactions, where stamp duty was payable on account
of the value of the transaction being higher than the stamp duty
threshold, is given in the following tables for the years and regions
for which information is available. The Stamp Duty threshold for
residential transactions was &#163;60,000 up to 16 March 2005 and
&#163;120,000 from 17 March 2005. For non-residential transactions
the threshold was &#163;60,000 up to 30 November 2003 and
&#163;150,000 from 1 December 2003 to the end of 2004-05. Residential
transactions from 30 November 2001 with values above &#163;60,000 and
up to &#163;150,000 in designated disadvantaged areas were relieved
from stamp duty and have been excluded from these figures. However
non-residential transactions which were valued above the threshold but
paid no duty due to the operation of reliefs (e.g. disadvantaged area
relief, charitable relief) are included in the table because reliable
estimates of all relieved transactions are not
available.</p><table border="1"><tr valign="top"><td class="tabletext" colspan="10"><i>Number
