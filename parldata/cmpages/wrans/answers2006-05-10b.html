PDS schemes have varying registration periods. To ensure comparability
with corresponding GDS data, PDS registrations for established PDS
practices are estimated using proxy registrations, namely the number of
patients seen by PDS practices in the past 15
months.<br>2. Data for 2003 and earlier do
not include those PDS schemes that do not have any registrations, for
example dental access centres, and is therefore not directly comparable
with 2004 and 2005 data.<br>3. The
registration figures for 1997 are not comparable with subsequent years
due to the change in the registration period to 15 months. Previously
the period for adults was 24 months whilst children's registrations
expired at the end of the following calendar year. The introduction of
PDS in October 1998 and subsequent growth has also affected the

Not applicable. Population estimates are not available at PCT level
prior to
2001.<br><i>Notes:</i><br>1.
Official 2005 population data is not yet available. 2005 data has
therefore been estimated using office for national statistics 2004
mid-year population estimates based on the 2001 census as these are the
latest available.<br>2. PDS
schemes have varying registration periods. To ensure comparability with
corresponding GDS data, PDS registrations for established PDS practices
are estimated using "proxy registrations", namely the number of
patients seen by PDS practices in the past 15
months.<br>3. Note that the
data on registration numbers for December 1997 is calculated on a
different basis from subsequent years. The registration period for both
adults and children in GDS was 15 months from 1 September 1996
(registrations expire 15 months after the end of the month of
registration). Previously the registration period for adults was an
exact 24 months while children's registrations expired at the end of
the next calendar year. Therefore, data on the 15 month registration
period is available from January 1998 for children and September 1998
for adults. The introduction of PDS in October 1998 and subsequent
growth has also affected the figures, changes in the registration
period from two years to 15 months impacted on the number of patients
registered after December 1997.<br>
4. The postcode of the dental practice
was used to allocate patient registrations to specific geographic areas
(not the patient's home
address).<br>5.
Registration rates (i.e. the percentage of the population registered
with a dentist) have been estimated by including registrations in the
area of the dentist, that is according to the postcode of the dental
surgery and not the patient's address. So the registration rates for
some areas may be affected by some patients receiving dental treatment
in a different area from the one in which they live. This can lead to
figures being unusually high, even over 100 per cent. for child
registrations, while other areas may have estimated rates which are
lower than the actual (but unknown) proportion of residents who are
registered with a dentist in or outside their own
area.<br>6. Figures have
been provided by the Information Centre for health and social care. The
data source is the Business Services Authority and the figures are
based on the numbers of patients registered with dentists with open
General Dental Service (GDS) or Personal Dental Service (PDS) contracts
as at 31 December in each specified year. Prison contracts have not
been included in this analysis.<br><i>Source:</i><br>

Rosie Winterton</b><i>[holding answer 8 May
2006]: </i>It is the responsibility of clinicians to
discuss with patients appropriate treatment options for their
particular condition. However, the National Institute for Health and
Clinical Excellence (NICE) was set up in 1999 to issue clinical
guidance to support the national health service including:
interventional procedure guidance to assess if a procedure is safe for
routine use in the NHS; technology appraisals to assess if a treatment
is clinically and cost effective; clinical guidelines to advise on the
diagnosis and management of certain conditions; and cancer service
guidance to advise on how services should be organised to ensure good
outcomes for
patients.</p><p><a name="06051058000910">In
February 2006, as part of its programme of work on interventional
procedures, NICE issued guidance on the use of photodynamic therapy
(PDT) in the treatment of non melanoma skin tumours. It noted that the
procedure was generally safe and did not cause major problems although,
in theory, it could start off cancerous changes in the skin. It
recommended that when doctors use this procedure for people with basal
cell carcinoma, Bowen's disease or actinic keratosis, they should be
sure that the patient understands what is involved and consents to the
treatment and that the results of the procedure are monitored. NICE
also noted that there is not much information available on how well the
procedure works in people with squamous call carcinoma. There is a
relatively high chance that the carcinoma will return after treatment,
and there is a risk that the carcinoma will spread and become more
dangerous. NICE has said that patients need to understand these risks
before they agree to have PDT. They also need to understand that
further treatment may be
necessary.</p><p><a name="06051058000911">Also
in February 2006, NICE published guidance on "Improving Outcomes for
people with skin tumours, including melanoma". This guidance includes
recommendations on the management of patients with suspected
precancerous or cancerous skin lesions. It describes PDT including the
advantages and disadvantages of this type of treatment and notes that,
at present, there is little information available on long-term cure
rates. It does however recommend that a number of surgical and
non-surgical procedures for the treatment of skin cancer, including
PDT, should be available for 
<br><notus-date day="9" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>9 May 2006 : Column 239W</b><br>use by clinicians in relevant teams, subject to locally agreed standards
of competence.</p><p><a name="06051058000912">There
are no plans to ask NICE to produce additional guidance on this
treatment.</p><p><a name="06051058000913">The
main agency through which the Government supports medical and clinical
research is the Medical Research Council (MRC). The MRC is an
independent body funded by the Department of Trade and Industry via the
Office of Science and Innovation. The Department is not directly
funding research on PDT for cancer, but is providing NHS support
through the national cancer research network for two trials of PDT for
biliary tract cancers. Over 75 per cent. of the Department's total
expenditure on health research is devolved to, and managed by, NHS
organisations. Details of individual projects, including a number
concerned with PDT, can be found on the department's website on the
national research register at

as a coping mechanism or survival strategy. The exercise started in
January 2006 and will run until autumn. It will ascertain the level of

programmes is highly dependent on the ability of organisations doing
the delivery on the ground, being able to operate safely. Security in
many parts of Afghanistan is improving, particularly in central,
northern and western areas and further progress can be made by
strengthening the effectiveness of the Afghan police and criminal
justice system. However security remains a particular challenge in the
south and east of the country, where the insurgency is most
active.</p><p><a name="06051073000071">Continuing

difficult to operate in some parts of the country. The majority of
DFID's livelihoods programme is channelled through the National
Priority Programmes of the Afghan Government. This helps to reduce some
of the security risks by using local contractors, but there have been a
number of attacks on implementing partners of these national
programmes. Although attacks have increased, so far they have not
caused widespread suspension of alternative livelihoods
programmes.</p><p><a name="06051073000072">Helmand
province will be a particularly challenging place in which to deliver
programmes that will support the development of alternative
livelihoods. DFID is currently designing a large multi-year programme
to support rural development in Helmand through the National Priority
Programmes of the Afghan Government. This support will only be
successful if implementing partners are willing to work in the
province. The UK military deployment to Helmand should help to
facilitate a greater Afghan Government presence in the province, and
improve the capacity of the police and the Afghan National Army to
provide the necessary security for development partners to operate
effectively.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="06051073000014">Burma</h3><p><a name="06051073000073"><b><a name="06051073000563">Mr.
