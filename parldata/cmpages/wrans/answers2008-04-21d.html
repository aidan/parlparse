 Local authorities are required to work towards meeting the air quality objectives in the Air Quality Regulations 2000 by designating air quality management areas where concentrations of any of the seven pollutants in the regulations exceed, or are likely to exceed, the stated objectives. To help local authorities do this, DEFRA operates an air quality grant scheme, a capital grant for which local authorities bid. The total amount of this grant, which is divided between successful authorities, is approximately &#163;2.3 million per year. While Peterborough city council was aware of the air quality grant, the council has not applied for the past three years.</p>

As individual keepers will be responsible for the costs of vaccination, our aim, in close collaboration with a core group of industry stakeholders, has been to develop a vaccination programme which will reduce the cost of vaccination to a minimum by using existing delivery chains and reducing regulatory burdens in order to encourage maximum participation.</p>

 The England catchment sensitive farming delivery initiative has been in place since April 2006 and is being delivered jointly by Natural England and the Environment Agency on behalf of DEFRA. It is currently based in priority catchments covering a little over a third of the agricultural area of England and its purpose is to encourage farmers to take voluntary action to tackle diffuse water pollution, mainly from nitrates, phosphorus, sediment, pesticides and livestock faeces.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_105"><a name="80421w0003.htm_para5"><a name="08042134000103">The main elements of the initiative are: forty priority catchments served by a network of 42 catchment sensitive farming officers working locally; a programme of farmer workshops, farm demonstrations and farm visits; partnership with the pesticides voluntary initiative; local catchment steering groups bringing together farmers, water companies and other stakeholders; a capital grant scheme. In its first two years the initiative also supported 20 projects, with similar aims and objectives, in other catchments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_106"><a name="80421w0003.htm_para6"><a name="08042134000104">In February 2008 DEFRA launched Future Water, the Government's new water strategy for England. This stated that DEFRA will continue to support farmers on catchment sensitive farming for a further three years. DEFRA has since confirmed that the England catchment sensitive farming delivery initiative will receive funding of &#163;12.9 million in 2008-09. Most of the initial programme is being rolled forward for a period of six months, with a new programme planned from October.</p>

 Waste incineration plants, including those in hospitals, are subject to the Pollution Prevention and Control Regulations (the &#147;PPC Regulations&#148;) which were superseded from 6 April 2008 by the Environmental Permitting Regulations 2007. These regulations require each incinerator to have a permit to operate which is issued by the regulator only after detailed consideration of the environmental and health impacts of the operation. Each permit contains operating conditions which incorporate the requirements of the waste incineration directive (the WID), among which is a maximum emission limit to air for dioxins of 0.1 ng/m<sup>(3)</sup> expressed as International Toxic Equivalents (ITEQ). This limit is considered to provide adequate protection to the human health and environment.</p>

 Milk quotas are a limit on production; a ceiling not a target.

In addition, they are an unnecessary cost and regulatory burden. We look forward to their abolition in 2015. Consequently, we have no plans to encourage greater milk production to fulfil the new quota ceilings. we believe producers should produce for the market.</p>

 The UK is largely self-sufficient in milk. Over 95 per cent. of the milk consumed in the UK is produced in the UK.

This was increased to 577 in 2005, due to recognition of two distinct sub-species of pipistrelle bat. On 28 August 2007, I announced a new UK list of priority species and habitats which contained 1,149 species.

 Under section 45 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990, local authorities (LAs) have a general duty to collect household waste. Section 46 of that Act gives LAs powers to determine arrangements for collection, such as the size, number and placing of receptacles for collection. As DEFRA advised in a letter of August 2005 to LAs, where an authority uses its section 46 powers to prescribe such arrangements and a resident does not comply with those requirements, an LA has no further duty to collect their waste, other than the duty to keep relevant land clear of litter and refuse.</p>

 The Chief Inspector of the Crown Prosecution Service was originally appointed on 1 October 2000 and his appointment expired on 21 March 2004. There then followed a series of short extensions of his appointment during a period when the Government's policy on criminal justice system inspection was under review and there was the prospect of (i) a merger between HMCPS Inspectorate and the new Inspectorate for the Unified Court Administration; and then (ii) a merger of all five criminal justice system Inspectorates. In the event, the then Police and Criminal Justice Bill was amended so the planned merger of all five Inspectorates did not proceed.

 The activities of the Digital National Framework (www.dnf.org) are agreed by an Expert Group formed of officials representing local and central government, non-Department Government bodies and the private sector. Their aim is to promote linkages across national and local datasets, which have a geographic component, to support the sharing of information about a common location. The majority of their resource comes from &#147;in kind&#148; contributions of individual members, supplemented by limited financial sponsorship to cover promotional activities and some technical documentation.

 Targeted Response Vehicles (TRVs) are used as an extra resource by Fire and Rescue Authorities (FRAs) at specified times and locations to provide a more flexible and increased service in specific areas. Effective use of new midi fire appliances or TRVs crewed with three firefighters can, in certain circumstances, provide a better service for local communities. As well as tackling small fires, using TRVs in identified 'hot spots' can act as a deterrent to miscreants and free up staff for major incidents and community safety work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_184"><a name="80421w0013.htm_para1"><a name="0804226000693">FRAs are required by the Fire and Rescue Service National Framework to have in place and maintain an integrated risk management plan (IRMP) which reflects local need and sets out plans to tackle effectively both existing and potential risks to communities. The IRMP enables the authority to tailor cover for fire and other incidents to local circumstances&#151;evaluating where risk is greatest and allocating resource accordingly.</p>

 The Department for International Development (DFID) is planning to continue its humanitarian engagement with a further &#163;5 million in 2008-09. DFID's support will focus in particular on internally displaced persons (IDP) and host populations. DFID will continue to support immediate relief interventions, to improve humanitarian co-ordination and look for ways to encourage early recovery. DFID is working with a range of implementers from the United Nations (UN) agencies, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and the Red Cross to ensure that the final distribution of assistance is carried out in a transparent and appropriately targeted way, with particular attention taken to ensure that partners are acting with independence and impartiality.</p>

The European Union Force (EUFOR) is mandated to protect IDPs, host populations and aid workers, and to promote the conditions for IDP return; as EUFOR deploys, we expect that it will become easier to deliver aid. DFID is making provision to allow the expansion of relief and early recovery efforts if and when the security environment is improved.</p>

 The Department for International Development (DFID) is committed to consulting effectively with the public and interested groups. DFID guidance on how to consult is based on the Cabinet Office's Code of Practice on Consultation. Public consultations are administered independently by the consulting policy or country team, using this departmental guidance. There is therefore no central record of the number held for the last three years, or of the number of respondents to each, and so it would be of disproportionate cost to provide these details.</p>

 Prosecutions are carried out by the police and the new parking regulations make no changes to their activities. 230 English local authorities have taken over from the police the enforcement of parking and that number increases each year. In those areas the number of penalty charge notices served by an individual local authority, and paid by motorists, will increase or decrease primarily according to local circumstances and local parking behaviour. The new regulations are aimed at improving parking behaviour, thereby improving traffic flows in the interests of other road users.</p>

A key consideration is whether particular subsidy changes would incentivise improvements to the fuel efficiency of the bus fleet and the use of environmentally friendly vehicles. We published on 13 March a consultation document, entitled &#147;Local Bus Service Support&#151;options for reform&#148;, which invites views on our proposals; and copies are available in the Libraries of the House.</p>

The level of the obligation will be 2.5 per cent. of total fuel supplied by the supplier in the first year (2008-09), rising to 3.75 per cent. in 2009-10 and 5 per cent. in 2010-11.</p>

 In practice there are two stages to the Secretary of State's decision making process in determining whether to proscribe an organisation. Firstly, the Secretary of State must consider whether she believes the organisation is concerned in terrorism within the meaning of section 3 of the Terrorism Act 2000. Section 3 provides that an organisation is concerned in terrorism if it:</p>

 Figures for funding for the National Domestic Violence Helpline from 2001-03 are not available as it was first established as a single service in December 2003. &#163;1.4 million was provided by the then Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM) for the next three years. In 2005-06, responsibility for the helpline transferred to the Home Office as part of the National Delivery Plan for Domestic Violence and &#163;60,000 was provided in addition to &#163;00,000 which was transferred from ODPM. In 2006-07 the Home Office provided &#163;250,000 and this has now increased to &#163;500,000 in 2007-08.</p>

 Mandatory registration with the Council for the Registration of Forensic Practitioners was recommended in the House of Commons Select Committee on Science and Technology Report &#147;Forensic Science on Trial&#148; (see recommendation 43 at paragraph 139), published 29 March 2005. The response of Her Majesty's Government to that recommendation was as follows:</p>
<a name="80421w0033.htm_brev1"><a name="0804232004884"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;It would not be appropriate for the Government to mandate registration with a private organisation. The criminal justice system must have access to appropriate expert testimony to ensure it reaches the correct decision. The use of a mandatory registration scheme would prevent appropriate experts from giving testimony in a number of circumstances, for example where the required expert does not normally work within the forensic arena and is therefore not registered. Another example might be that the required expert may work within the forensic arena but, perhaps due to working in research and development, does not carry out sufficient casework to be registered. The required expert may not work within the UK, or expertise may be required in a subject which rarely comes before the court. It therefore seems more sensible to have a scheme whereby the registration is voluntary. Where someone seeks to appear as an expert witness in an area where registration is available but they are not registered, this will highlight to the judge the need to consider carefully whether their testimony should be admitted and, if so, on what basis.&#148;</p>

 The Police Service has established policy and standards which enable integration, notably the Management of Police Information, a statutory code of practice introduced in 2005 to ensure that all police operational information is managed in a consistent way. The Association of Chief Police Officers Information Systems Strategy for the Police Service, which was adopted in 2006, sets out the standards used to specify, acquire and operate nationally-compatible Police information systems.</p>

 There are no figures held by the Home Office for either categories mentioned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_407"><a name="80421w0043.htm_para0"><a name="0804232004062">Websites containing child abuse images are usually removed from the internet by the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_408"><a name="80421w0043.htm_para1"><a name="0804232004063">The IWF, a self-regulatory organisation funded by the internet industry and the EU operates the UK&#146;s &#145;notice and take-down&#146; service for child sexual abuse content on the internet. They do not count individual images that are removed, rather they focus their efforts on removing web pages or websites which contain or provide access to one, tens, hundreds or possibly thousands of individual child sexual abuse images. On the rare occasion content depicting child sexual abuse is traced to servers in the UK, a takedown request is issued by the IWF and the content is removed, usually within a matter of hours.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_409"><a name="80421w0043.htm_para2"><a name="0804232004064">This partnership approach has proved very successful and UK hosted child sexual abuse content known to the IWF has been less than 1 per cent. since 2003, down from 18 per cent. in 1997. In addition, the IWF provides a list of newsgroups which feature, advertise or advocate child sexual abuse to all UK service providers who voluntarily block large numbers which, in turn, denies access to thousands of such images. Search providers are provided with a list of keywords so that they can manage the quality of their returns and remove potentially illegal websites known to the IWF.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_410"><a name="80421w0043.htm_para3"><a name="0804232004065">This work is about removing content, complicating access, protecting internet users from inadvertent exposure and making the operations of those behind the websites more difficult. Details of each website confirmed to contain child sexual abuse is also passed to UK law enforcement for appropriate investigation. As over 99 per cent. of online child sexual abuse content is now hosted abroad, the IWF works in partnership with the relevant hotline and other authorities around the world, passing on intelligence relating to content in that country. It also provides a dynamic list of child sexual abuse URLs hosted abroad to the online industry to enable them to protect users by blocking inadvertent access to such content.</p>

Data on the number of notification orders granted by magistrates courts are collated by the Ministry of Justice from MAPPA annual reports. Notification orders are applied for by the police and granted by magistrates courts. They require sexual offenders convicted overseas of an offence equivalent to a relevant offence in the UK to become subject to the notification requirements of the Sexual Offences Act 2003.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many offences were recorded under the Sexual Offences Act 2003 in each year since its entry into force, broken down by offence; and what percentage of these offences <i> (a)</i> resulted in court proceedings against suspected perpetrators, <i> (b)</i> led to a conviction and <i> (c)</i> resulted in a sanction detection.

<p><a name="stpa_419"><a name="80421w0044.htm_para8"><a name="0804232004365">Table 1 gives the number of offences recorded for the offence classifications which came into force with the introduction of the Sexual Offences Act 2003. It also gives the number of offences detected by means of a sanction detection. Table 2 shows the numbers of defendants proceeded against and found guilty at all courts for the years 2004 to 2006, and is taken from the court proceedings database held by the Office for Criminal Justice Reform. Figures for crimes and sanction detections in 2004-05 and those proceeded against and found guilty in 2004 are not for complete 12 month periods, as the Sexual Offence Act 2003 was enacted in May 2004.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_420"><a name="80421w0044.htm_para9"><a name="0804232004366">The figures given in Table 2 relate to persons for whom these offences were the principal offence for which they were dealt with. When a defendant has been found guilty of two or more offences, the offence selected is the one for which the heaviest penalty is imposed. Where the same disposal is imposed for two or more offences, the offence selected is the offence for which the statutory maximum penalty is the most severe.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_421"><a name="80421w0044.htm_para10"><a name="0804232004367">Recorded crime and court proceedings statistics are from two different databases and recorded in quite different ways. Recorded crime data are provided on a financial year basis and counts offences whereas court proceedings data are on a calendar year basis and count offenders. Therefore, these two separate data-sets are not directly comparable.</p>

 We undertook an extensive five month public consultation on the Counter-Terrorism Bill, including our proposal on pre-charge detention, during which we met representatives from the police, judiciary, civil liberties organisations and community groups and received a number of written representations. The results of the consultation were published on 6 December 2007 and copies are available in the Library. Since the end of the consultation, we have continued to discuss the Counter-Terrorism Bill with interested parties. The Department has also been sent briefing material from a number of organisations, including Liberty, Justice, the Equality and Human Rights Commission and the Law Society of Scotland.</p>

 The Review of the Protection of Children from Sex Offenders, referred to in the ministerial statement, included two actions relating to the disclosure of information on child sex offenders&#146; convictions to the public. Implementation of Action 3 of the review will introduce a legal duty on MAPPA responsible authorities to consider the disclosure of information about convicted child sex offenders to members of the public. Under Action 4 a separate process will be piloted whereby members of the public will be able to register their child protection interest in a named individual and receive information on any convictions for child sex offences that individual may have, where appropriate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_425"><a name="80421w0046.htm_para0"><a name="0804232004685">The Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill will amend the Criminal Justice Act 2003 to impose a duty on MAPPA responsible authorities to consider disclosure of a child sex offender&#146;s convictions to members of the public. The convictions that the MAPPA authorities must consider disclosing are set out at schedule 24 to the Bill. However, under their common law powers, the police are able to disclose details of other convictions in appropriate circumstances (see R <i> v</i>. Chief Constable of North Wales ex parte Thorpe (1998) 3 AII ER 310). The extent of the information disclosed will be decided on a case by case basis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_426"><a name="80421w0046.htm_para1"><a name="0804232004686">The MAPPA authorities will decide who, if anyone, should be provided with the information, and will be able to impose conditions, in order to prevent further dissemination of the information. Under the Bill, the MAPPA authorities will have discretion as to the extent of the conditions that they impose. When imposing such conditions, the MAPPA authorities will need to be mindful of their obligations under the Human Rights Act 1998 and what is necessary and proportionate to prevent harm to the child or children concerned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_427"><a name="80421w0046.htm_para2"><a name="0804232004687">Existing statutory MAPPA guidance will be updated to take account of the new statutory duty to consider disclosure.</p>

Before a disclosure is made, the intended recipient will be required to sign a declaration that they will not share this information with others.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_429"><a name="80421w0046.htm_para4"><a name="0804232004689">Applicants for disclosure under the pilot scheme will be asked to provide documentary proof such as the child&#146;s birth certificate to demonstrate their relationship with the child with respect to whom they are declaring a child protection interest.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_430"><a name="80421w0046.htm_para5"><a name="0804232004690">The Government will ensure that the police are issued with comprehensive guidance on all stages of the pilot process, and are currently working with the four force areas participating in the pilot to develop the disclosure process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_431"><a name="80421w0046.htm_para6"><a name="0804232004691">The extent of information disclosed under the pilot process will be considered on a case by cases basis by the MAPPA authorities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_432"><a name="80421w0046.htm_para7"><a name="0804232004692">It is intended that the statutory duty will come into force following Royal Assent being given to the Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill, by means of a Commencement Order.

<i> [holding answer 3 April 2008]: </i>Building Schools for the Future aims to renew all secondary school in England where there is need in 15 waves of investment which started in 2005-06. In early 2005, we announced the national programme for Building Schools for the Future, based on the expressions of interest for inclusion in the programme which authorities proposed. Expressions of interest include how authorities group their schools into geographically coherent projects. These projects were prioritised on the average social and educational need of the schools in them. Information on the national programme is available in the Parliamentary libraries. West Sussex proposed three projects, which are prioritised in waves 10 to 15. Later this year, when we have consulted on management of the later waves of the programme, we will invite authorities to revise their expressions of interest if they wish.</p>

This guidance was issued along with Circular LAC (2002)17 under section 7 of the Local Authority Social Services Act 1970, requiring local authorities to comply with it. The guidance sets out how local authorities and their partner agencies are expected to respond when young people go missing from their care placements. It includes information about measures that local authorities should put in place to prevent children from going missing as well as on reporting incidents. One of its requirements is that each local authority must appoint a designated senior manager to be responsible for monitoring missing from care incidents to identify any trends and to instigate any action necessary to respond to children&#146;s&#146; needs ensuring that they are properly safeguarded.</p>

 The Department's statutory guidance, &#147;Securing Sufficient Childcare&#148;, which was distributed to local authorities in summer 2007, contains examples of circumstances in which they should consider providing financial support from the Sure Start, Early Years and Childcare Grant to childcare providers. While it is for local authorities to decide their own priorities for funding providers, and how they publicise the availability of funding, the guidance makes clear the need to demonstrate "transparency and fairness".</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families how much his Department allocates to each local authority for the childcare sustainability grant; and what indicators are used to assess how much each local authority should receive in respect of the grant. [199897]</p>

 In the 2006-08 period, funding for this activity was included as part of Sure Start, Early Years and Childcare Grant which covered not only child care sustainability but support for early years outcomes, quality and inclusion. A number of different factors were used to determine the allocations and these included numbers of children, deprivation measures, Ofsted registered stock figures, and rurality measures. In addition, for the 2008-11 period, an inflationary uplift was added to this wider allocation block above and the resulting funding was split equally between child care sufficiency and access and early years outcomes, quality and inclusion. These funding streams sit within the wider revenue block of the Sure Start, Early Years and Childcare Grant and the overall allocations were smoothed to ensure that each authority received a minimum increase of 5 per cent.</p>

 The Department has worked across Government to co-ordinate the cross-Government Staying Safe Action Plan which was published on 5 February 2008. The report can be downloaded from www.ecm.gov.uk/stayingsafe and a copy is available in the House Library. Delivery of the action plan will be underpinned by the new PSA to improve children and young people&#146;s safety, which includes an indicator measuring emergency hospital admissions caused by unintentional and deliberate injuries to children aged up to 18 years. The same indicator is included in the new National Indicator Set for Local Government so data will also be collected at local level. This indicator will help us to assess the extent of accidental injuries to children and young people. In the Staying Safe: Action Plan, we set out new a commitment to carry out a priority review of local area accident prevention, which will make a number of recommendations about how accident prevention work might be improved. I will ensure that both other Government Departments and external stakeholders are involved in this review.</p>

 In private law child proceedings, where parents come to court for an order to determine the child's primary residence or the frequency of contact with a non-resident parent the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) introduced a new process in 2005. This means that when making an application for a child contact/residence order, allegations of domestic violence are expected to be raised at the point of the application. Courts are now required to consider whether any incidents of domestic violence&#151;not just from direct violence but also from witnessing violence&#151;have had an adverse impact on the child, or might affect the child in the future.</p>

Sometimes teachers made links from other subjects to citizenship that were insubstantial and failed to add up to a sensible curriculum overall.

Challenge and support through the National Secondary Strategy has also helped to raise standards in the last three years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_470"><a name="80421w0052.htm_para3"><a name="0804237001966">As part of the Chancellor of the Exchequer's budget for 2008, the Government have now committed a new &#163;200 million package, over the next three years, for a National Challenge to raise standards in secondary schools, with the particular focus on those schools where fewer than 30 per cent. of pupils achieve five or more good GCSEs including English and mathematics. The National Challenge programme will provide intensive support for the most vulnerable secondary schools, and will empower many head teachers of strong schools to help turn around other schools that are unable to raise low attainment. The programme will help create new trusts and federations based on successful schools; and, in areas of greatest need, drive forward a faster expansion of the academies programme.</p>

Inspectors evaluate the quality of personal development and well-being which includes school, local, and global dimensions. Additionally, schools now have a statutory duty to promote community cohesion, which came into effect on 1 September 2007. From 1 September 2008, Ofsted has a duty, under section 5 of the Education Act 2005, to report on the contribution made by schools to community cohesion. We are currently trialling our proposed approach to inspecting this aspect.</p>
</ul><a name="80421w0052.htm_brev51"><a name="0804237006474"><ul><p class="tabletext">When evaluating how well learners contribute to the community, inspectors are specifically asked to consider the development of learners&#146; understanding of citizenship (&#145;Using the evaluation schedule: Guidance for inspectors of schools&#146;, September 2007). The self-evaluation form requires schools to assess their compliance with statutory requirements. During inspection, aspects of citizenship are evaluated when inspectors judge the quality of the curriculum. Any non-compliance with statutory requirements is brought to the school&#146;s attention, and may be a key issue for improvement.</p>
</ul><a name="80421w0052.htm_brev52"><a name="0804237006475"><ul><p class="tabletext">Discussion with children and young people is an integral part of all inspections and their views are fully taken into account. The annual TellUs3 survey in 2008 asks children and young people for their views on their satisfaction with local services. It specifically asks them about outcomes relating to Every Child Matters, one aspect of which is their contribution to the community. The results of the survey are considered by inspectors undertaking Annual Performance Assessments and Joint Area Reviews. In 2007 over 100,000 children and young people responded to the TellUs2 survey. The Joint Annual Review programme comes to an end in 2008 and will be replaced by the Comprehensive Areas Assessment process from 2009.</p>

 The number of pupils for whom English is an additional language (EAL) rose from 500,000 to 790,000 between 1997 and 2007. Putting this in perspective, such children now comprise 12 per cent. of all pupils as against 7.5 per cent. in 1997 and 9 per cent. in 2001.

 Although funding arrangements do not provide financial incentives to join consortia we believe that working in partnership offers schools the opportunity to deliver high quality educational provision for best value. Indeed working with other schools is fundamental to delivery of key policies such as extended services and personalisation.</p>

Collaborative working, through arrangements such as federation or consortia, was identified as one mechanism in which schools may deliver improvements in value for money.</p>

Working in a federation may allow schools to realise financial savings and to provide better value for money. This could be achieved by employing shared staff, acquiring joint facilities and equipment, or by rationalising duplicated functions.</p>

 Guidance on incorporating biomass-heating and other renewable and low carbon technologies in new schools is provided on our website. Biomass heating has been installed in many schools but biomass cooling has not been used. Schools have little demand for cooling, and where there is a need for cooling this can be achieved effectively using other low carbon energy sources. The potential to use biomass for cooling in schools is likely to be limited to large scale community energy schemes serving mixed-use developments that include school buildings.</p>

 Plans for the introduction of a masters in teaching and learning for teachers were set out in &#145;Being the Best for our Children: Releasing Talent for Teaching and Learning&#146; on 7 March. Our aim is that over time the qualification should be open to all teachers and our expectation is that every teacher would want to complete it at some stage in their career. We propose to begin by targeting the masters mainly on teachers in the first five years of their careers, building on initial teacher training and induction. The Training and Development Agency for Schools has been asked to start developing the programme. Initially &#163;30 million has been set aside for the programme in the current spending review period.</p>

 The Department has no plans to review the rules on the transferability of Enhanced Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) Disclosures. We are not aware of any adverse effects arising from the rules relating to transferability. We are aware of the fact that there are often extra costs relating to temporary teachers if their employers insist on new Disclosures every time they change post or agency. This is however the decision of individual employers and not a result of our guidance to schools and teaching supply agencies. We issued our principal guidance document on safeguarding for schools &#147;Safeguarding Children and Safer Recruitment in Education&#148; in 2006. Within this guidance we clearly set out that CRB Enhanced Disclosure certificates could be reused by those teachers moving schools, local authorities, or further education colleges, provided that all other recommended safer recruitment checks had been carried out satisfactorily and that the gap between leaving their old employment and taking up their new post was not more than three months. The CRB has produced a comprehensive Portability Framework document which sets out the issues relating to the reuse of Disclosure certificates, and this can obtained from the CRB website at:</p>

The Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills has commissioned a report to look at the impact of these measures. The interim findings indicate a continuing high level of demand for ESOL and that the learner profile seems to be changing in some colleges, with more enrolments onto evening than daytime classes. A full report is planned for early spring.</p>

London Learning and Skills Council has negotiated an increase in the size of its employer responsive budget for 2008-09 due to the specific socio-economic needs of London and ESOL needs for the individual and employers will be addressed within this.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_562"><a name="80421w0065.htm_para3"><a name="0804237004566">In addition, the London Learning and Skills Council is expanding the offer of ESOL Skills for Life to Entry Levels 1 and 2 within the train to gain service. The service will also be expanded to include the new ESOL for Work qualifications. This enables a greater flexibility for employers and individuals in accessing ESOL.</p>

They may then go on to higher education and take advantage of HE student support, or progress to higher skills training and/or employment. HE students undertake longer, more expensive courses, with higher additional incidental costs, such as books and materials, which is why the financial support arrangements are not directly comparable.</p>

 The latest available information from Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS) is shown in the table. Figures for years earlier than 2002 have not been given because in this year the National Statistics Socio-Economic Classification (NS-SEC) was first introduced. It replaced the Social Class (SC) classification, and the two classifications cannot be directly compared. Also in 2002, a new subject classification was introduced which is not comparable with the classification used in earlier years.</p>

 Admissions decisions are a matter for individual higher education institutions (HEIs) who, as independent bodies, have discretion over their own admission policies and procedures. Hits are also responsible for their own staff recruitment and for determining the policies and practices that apply to this; in line with employment and equality legislation. The Department does not therefore issue guidance in these areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_579"><a name="80421w0067.htm_para4"><a name="0804237005057">I have been reassured by the Supporting Professionalism in Admissions (SPA) team, who provide a centre of expertise in admissions matters, that such practices are not a feature of university admissions, despite press suggestions to the contrary, I expect admissions officers to continue to select suitable candidates based on their achievements and potentially as they do now. Social and other networking sites will not provide reliable and authenticated evidence of the kind required to support such important decisions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_580"><a name="80421w0067.htm_para5"><a name="0804237005058">As outlined above HE institutions operate within a legal framework in relation to recruitment, like other employers. As such, they would be responsible for determining their legal position if they chose to make use of material that candidates' have placed in the public domain in their recruitment processes. Institutions must comply with the law and in our view they should also comply with best practice in their recruitment processes.</p>

This is very much a success story as these students contribute to the cultural mix, the research capacity and the finances of our institutions. The growth of international student numbers has not been at the expense of home students as they are not in competition with each other for places and it can be seen that the number of home students has also increased by over 128,000 during this ten year period.</p>

From 2008/09 the minimum threshold (of family income) for a full maintenance grant will be increased from &#163;17,500 a year to &#163;25,000 a year; with a partial grant available up to an income threshold of &#163;60,000, It is expected that up to around two thirds of air students will receive a full-or partial-grant</p>

 The director for fair access is responsible for ensuring that universities have satisfactory access agreements in place as a pre-condition of charging variable fees and for ensuring that institutions comply with these obligations. A range of sanctions is available to the director if a university is found to be in breach. In 2006-07, the director has reported that all universities have complied with the obligations in their access agreements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_608"><a name="80421w0070.htm_para5"><a name="0804237005410">The question rests on a misunderstanding of how bursaries work. Institutions do not allocate a fixed amount of expenditure for bursaries. They have made forecasts of the costs of their bursaries packages, but these have always contained a level of uncertainty for methodological reasons. Additionally, a number of universities forecast their highest level of overall payment rather than the most probable outcome.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_609"><a name="80421w0070.htm_para6"><a name="0804237005411">I have always made it clear that where a university is spending less than it had anticipated on bursaries, it would be right to spend on other activities to encourage widening participation, which will not normally be reported under the access agreement.

 The principle behind student loans is that borrowers repay broadly the same amount, in real terms, as they have borrowed. The interest rate on student loan balances is therefore fixed at the rate of inflation.</p>

The threshold for a partial grant will increase from &#163;38,330 for entrants in 2007/08 to &#163;60,005 for entrants in 2008/09. These thresholds relate to household income.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_612"><a name="80421w0070.htm_para9"><a name="0804237005420">This will mean that one third of all eligible students in England entering higher education in the academic year 2008/09 are expected to be entitled to a full non-repayable grant worth &#163;2,835 and another one third are expected to be entitled to a partial grant of between &#163;50 and &#163;2,835. Until students apply for support for 2008/09, we do not know the amount of grant per income decile as we do not know exactly where the decile bands will fall on the income scale. Further information on the amount of grant available to students in 2008/09, by household income, is set out in a memorandum entitled &#147;Support Available Under the Student Support Regulations&#148;, a copy of which can be found in the House Library.</p>

 75 per cent. of the maximum loan amount available is not means tested, so borrowers choosing to apply only for this part do not provide income details. This will include borrowers who know their household income is too high to be eligible for the means-tested element, those who do not wish to provide income details, and those choosing to take a smaller loan. Data are therefore not available to classify borrowers by income or socio-economic group.</p>

 The Ministry of Defence records instances of heat illness, as part of its monitoring of climatic injury. Heat illness has traditionally been divided into heat exhaustion and heat stroke, but in practice it is difficult to define the division between the two.

<i>  [holding answer 5 February 2008]:</i> The Defence Medical Rehabilitation Centre at Headley Court has a hydrotherapy pool on site which is in regular use.

We warmly welcome this very generous offer, in addition to the money we plan to spend to enhance the unit's existing facilities. We shall work closely with the charity as its proposals are developed. Headley Court is owned by a Charitable Trust and charitable funding has contributed to the enhancement of the facilities at Headley Court since the site was first used for the rehabilitation of military personnel in 1946.</p>

 At the time the data was taken MHS data collection processes and housekeeping procedures were still being developed. While works had been completed in a timely fashion, many orders had not been closed on the system. It is believed that the repair was completed in less than 324 days, but was recorded retrospectively on our repair reporting system. The system has since been updated to ensure that similar anomalies do not occur in the future.

 Life insurance is optional and is for those requiring additional cover above that provided by the Armed Forces and Reserve Forces Pension and Compensation Schemes. MOD facilitates voluntary insurance arrangements through commercial providers for personnel requiring cover.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_630"><a name="80421w0072.htm_para4"><a name="0804237005689">The cover provided by the PAX (for regular) and RPAX schemes (for reserve personnel including the TA) is virtually the same. Both primarily provide personal accident cover, but also include cover for injury and death resulting from war and terrorism, and (at an extra premium) death from natural causes. Both provide personal accident cover for bodily injury that causes permanent disability and also for certain fractures, burns and hospitalisation. The maximum cover for death is &#163;150,000. The maximum catastrophic disability cover is &#163;750,000 for quadriplegia and &#163;400,000 for paraplegia, with up to &#163;300,000 for other disabilities. From 1 March 2008 PAX increased its premiums, enhanced its cover for burns and added cover for flesh wounds; these changes will be replicated for RPAX in the near future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_631"><a name="80421w0072.htm_para5"><a name="0804237005690">Service Life Insurance (SLI) provides life cover and was launched by MOD on 8 May 2007. SLI guarantees Regular and Reservists (including the TA) worldwide war and terrorism cover, at competitive premiums, throughout their service and beyond. It provides this by means of a unique partnering arrangement with the commercial providers of the scheme, Sterling Life. The maximum life cover available is &#163;200,000.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_632"><a name="80421w0072.htm_para6"><a name="0804237005691">MOD&#146;s Service Risks Insurance Premium Refunds (SRIPs) scheme contributes towards the inflated life insurance premiums which some insurers charge personnel (both regulars and reservists) in certain high risk trades and those serving on operations. The compensation available is 90 per cent. of the extra premium up to a total sum assured. The latter is increased every year in line with service pay and is currently &#163;162,000.</p>

 The mission of UK forces in southern Iraq is to support the government of Iraq and their security forces so that they can take responsibility for ensuring security without coalition assistance and create the conditions for economic and political development. This involves monitoring, mentoring and training the Iraqi Security Forces (ISF) and providing support to ISF-led operations when requested. UK forces also undertake a range of force protection and logistic duties in support of the multi-national force's mission.</p>

 The security situation in Somalia as a whole remains unstable and volatile. Without the beginnings of a definable peace process and a willingness of Somalis to engage in such a process, a military deployment to stabilize the country is unlikely. Notwithstanding this, the continued efforts of Uganda and Burundi to supply troops to African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) should be commended for bringing an element of security and humanitarian assistance to critical areas of Mogadishu.</p>

The incomes presented here are at a household rather than individual level.  2. The figures are based on Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) equalisation factors and are rounded to the nearest 1,000.  3. The national median income of the survey year in question has been used (i.e. the contemporary median) instead of using a fixed median for a particular year. This is consistent with the preferred way of measuring poverty.  4. All figures are shown in nominal terms (i.e. not adjusted for inflation).  5. Median incomes have been provided rather than mean incomes because the income distribution is skewed with some outliers with high incomes.  6. Socio-economic status of household is defined by the socio-economic group of the household reference person, who is defined as the highest income householder without regard to gender.  7. Information by socio-economic group is defined by National Statistics socio-economic classification. This was introduced in 2001 and information on a consistent basis for earlier years is not available. A split between the 'never worked and long-term unemployed' and 'undefined' category is available only from 2003-04.  8.

The Government have also introduced the Child Trust Fund, which will ensure that, in future, all young people have a financial asset at 18. Personal Accounts, for pension saving, will be introduced in 2012 and will promote saving for retirement. Budget 2008 announced that the Saving Gateway will be introduced nationally, with the first accounts available to savers in 2010.

<p><a name="stpa_740"><a name="80421w0085.htm_para6"><a name="08042335001052">There is a limited number of exemptions or variations to this rule.

In such cases an export licence may not be required if the criteria set out in the order can be met. Similarly, an individual could make use of the Open General Export Licence (Accompanied Personal Effects: Sporting Firearms) if they meet the criteria set out in that licence. In cases where the criteria for these exemptions are not met an export licence, assessed against &#147;The Code of Conduct&#148; as described above, will be required. </p>

<i> [holding answer 2 April 2008]:</i> As part of his report on excellence in the arts, Sir Brian McMaster recommended a new, light-touch and non-bureaucratic system for judging the quality of the arts in the future. The starting point for this will be a system of self-assessment within organisations, designed to allow them to measure themselves against their own and shared objectives and a cyclical process of peer review, led by respected practitioners.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_782"><a name="80421w0089.htm_para5"><a name="08042335001230">Underpinning both will be a move away from measurement of data to a more judgment based approach, where qualified individuals who have the confidence and respect of the arts sector can make value based judgments of performance, without the need to burden arts organisations with overly complex reporting procedures.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_783"><a name="80421w0089.htm_para6"><a name="08042335001231">This reflects the wider work the Department is doing to reduce the burden we place on our NDPBs. A process of risk assessment will enable us to focus our scrutiny on the few areas of higher risk and adopt a more light-touch approach in most cases. Funding agreements will be shorter, with fewer targets, fewer monitoring returns will be required, and where possible and appropriate we will extend NDPBs&#146; delegated powers.</p>

 It is very difficult to estimate the number of hours of art and culture that children currently receive each week. Schools offer many cultural experiences, for example in music, art, drama and poetry, both within and beyond the curriculum.

 Between 1976 and the early 1990s the UK carried out a major Geothermal Research Programme at a cost in excess of &#163;50 million. The key conclusions from the programme were that the UK was unlikely to see major developments based upon geothermal aquifers or the hot dry rock (HDR) method due to a limited resource, limited scope for their application and unfavourable economics.</p>

However, once possible constraints were taken into account it estimated that the practicable HDR resource could be as low as  4 TWh/year or 500 MW over 375 years.</p>

It is for the supplier to decide whether or not to recover any additional element in the charge from the customer, or whether, for administrative simplicity, to apply a standard charge to all customers of IGT networks. Individual suppliers have different approaches, and it follows that the number of households that pay additional charges will depend on which supplier a household is contracted with at any one time. Neither British Gas nor Scottish and Southern Energy applies a surcharge to IGT customers; other suppliers&#146; surcharges lie in the range &#163;30-&#163;60 per IGT customer.</p>

 Where a local authority is interested in funding continued post office service provision in communities where branches are scheduled for closure, we have encouraged Post Office Ltd. to talk to them. However, local authorities should understand that Post Office Ltd. will want to ensure that all relevant costs are covered, that there is a commitment for several years and that there will not be a damaging impact on other post offices in the area not scheduled for closure. Ultimately, it is for Post Office Ltd. and the local authority to discuss and agree the details of any such arrangements and to ensure that the arrangements are compatible with EU rules on state aid.</p>

 The Department is committed to achieving the carbon reduction targets for the Government estate, published in June 2006. We encourage all our staff to use video conferencing where possible, to avoid the need for official travel. We have steadily increased our use of video conferencing, from a total of 6,679 conferences in 2004, to 10,526 in 2007, a 57 per cent. increase. We anticipate that usage in 2008 will be around 11,500, and we have plans to install a further 10 video conferencing suites in the coming months, to meet demand.</p>

 Following a detailed review of the delivery of official controls in approved meat plants, including slaughterhouses, the Food Standards Agency Board decided last July that continuance of the level of subsidy paid to industry into the future was unsustainable, and the Meat Hygiene Service (MHS) should seek to recover an increasing proportion of those costs through industry charges.

A new approach to charging is being developed with key stakeholders, including industry, and is taking into consideration that small and geographically isolated abattoirs may need some continuing support. Proposals for the new charging system will be subject to full public consultation, which will include a regulatory impact assessment.</p>

 As part of the public service agreement (PSA) for child health and well-being, the Government aim to reduce the rate of increase in obesity in children under 11-years-old over the period 2008-09 to 2010-11. Health Survey for England data from 1995 to 2006 has been used to calculate a linear trend for obesity in children under 11. This linear trend suggests that childhood obesity is growing at 0.5 per cent. points per year and this growth rate has been used to forecast a baseline trajectory over the period, with child obesity increasing from 16.1 per cent. in 2006 (latest year of actual data) to 18.7 per cent. in 2011.

 The conduct of clinical trials in the European Union (EU) is governed by EU law, implemented in the United Kingdom by means of regulations. These represent a comprehensive framework for the conduct of clinical trials, including requirements on reporting. However, following an investigation by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency into allegations that GlaxoSmithKline withheld relevant information gathered in clinical trials on the use of Seroxat in children and adolescents, some weaknesses in the law as it stood at the time of the alleged offences were identified. The Government have made a commitment to clarify and strengthen both EU and UK law in this area. We will seek to strengthen EU legislation on the obligations on pharmaceutical companies to report any information impacting on the risk and benefits of licensed medicines, including the results of clinical trials. In the meantime we will clarify the current law as it applies in the UK. Consultation on changes to UK law will take place in the summer.</p>

The latest available evidence suggests that the upper age limit (age 75) is not currently a significant constraint on retirement planning as only one in 20 people annuitise between ages 70 and 74. The limit therefore reflects current retirement patterns.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_985"><a name="80421w0107.htm_para14"><a name="08042354000097">Evidence suggests that age 75 strikes a balance between flexibility in securing an income and ensuring that tax incentives are used for their intended purpose of providing a pension income.</p>

The Agency routinely reports on the number of enforcement actions instigated in Table 21 of the Child Support Agency's Quarterly Summary of Statistics. This is available online at www.dwp.gov.uk/asd/csa.asp or in the House of Commons Library.</p>

These covered a range of processes including distress actions, county court judgement orders, 3rd party debt orders, charging orders, suspended committal sentences, committal sentences, requests for new deduction from earnings orders and deductions from earnings requests, suspended driving licence disqualifications and driving licence disqualifications. As the Agency records the numbers of enforcement actions rather than the number of cases, different types of enforcement action may relate to the same case.</p>

 The Chancellor announced in his Budget 2008 speech that for winter 2008-09 an additional payment will be made alongside the winter fuel payment.

The increases are calculated, for most contributory and non-contributory benefits, using the increase in the retail prices index for the 12 months ending in the preceding September. This ensures that benefits keep their real value in broad terms.</p>

The Rossi index is the retail prices index excluding rent, mortgage interest payments, council tax and depreciation costs. This index is used because help for housing costs is given to people getting income related benefits either as additional amounts in those benefits or in council tax benefit and housing benefit. Consequently any increases in council tax would usually be met by council tax benefit.</p>

<i> [holding answer 31 March 2008]:</i> Unfortunately, through no fault of any individual, overpayments of benefit can arise following the death of a benefit recipient. Such overpayments normally arise as a result of the Department being notified of the death too late to stop an automated payment being made into the deceased's account.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1043"><a name="80421w0116.htm_para5"><a name="08042354002198">We are doing all we can to improve the current process. We are in the process of preparing to receive electronic notifications of death from the Office of National Statistics on a daily basis. This will assist in enabling a prompt cessation of payments following death and reduce the number of these overpayments occurring.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions if he will make an estimate of the percentage increase in the basic state pension which could be paid in each year between 2009-10 and 2012-13 were tax revenue to be increased by the amount needed to enable the annual surplus in the National Insurance Fund to be used for such a purpose. [196767]</p>

<p><a name="st_1132"><a name="08042354003142"><a name="80421w0120.htm_spnew0"><a name="08042354004876"><b>Mr. Mike O'Brien:</b>
 When national insurance contributions are made, a proportion of them go directly to help fund the NHS, while the rest are paid into the national insurance fund (NIF). The fund pays out contributory benefits to which people who have paid sufficient contributions are entitled, such as the basic state pension, incapacity benefit and contribution-based jobseeker&#146;s allowance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1047"><a name="80421w0120.htm_para0"><a name="08042354003143">National insurance contributions and associated social security benefits operate within the Government&#146;s fiscal rules designed to ensure sound public finances and when there is a surplus, it is invested in public services. Any surplus of contributions over social security benefits in any one year (the NIF surplus) is not therefore an extra resource available to spend.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1048"><a name="80421w0120.htm_para1"><a name="08042354003144">As the Government Actuary&#146;s latest report on the draft Social Security Benefits up-rating and Contributions re-rating Orders (CM7312) notes, the excess of income overpayments each year is the difference between two large numbers and so quite small percentage changes in either of them results in a large percentage change in the surplus income. This, in turn, could have a significant effect on the fund balances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1049"><a name="80421w0120.htm_para2"><a name="08042354003145">However, if the equivalent of the national insurance fund&#146;s annual excess of receipts overpayments projected by the Acting Government Actuary for the years 2009-10 to 2012-13 were paid in its entirety to recipients of basic state pension, this would lead to an estimated percentage increase in the basic state pension of around 24 per cent. in 2009-10 and around 6 per cent. in the years 2010-11 to 2012-13. Any increase in basic state pension expenditure has a cumulative impact on Government spending going forward.</p>

The Government are committed to long-term sustainable state pension provision and views short-term spending of the NIF surplus as unaffordable going forward. The Government have guaranteed the basic state pension will increase each year in line with prices or 2.5 per cent., whichever is higher, and subject to affordability and the fiscal position, to increase the basic state pension in line with earnings in 2012, but by the end of the next Parliament at the latest.</p>

 There is no second adult rebate specifically for carers. Certain carers are disregarded for council tax purposes, as long as the person they are caring for meets the qualifying conditions.

 Police forces invoice in arrears for Operation Safeguard and it is often difficult deriving an accurate average for a particular force.

 Since October 2006 the Government have used police cells in significant numbers to help manage pressure in the prison population. The Government&#146;s policy however is that juveniles should only be held overnight in police cells in the most exceptional circumstances. It should not happen routinely. Our records indicate that since October 2006 two juveniles have been held overnight in police cells in Essex. Data prior to this cannot be obtained without incurring disproportionate cost.</p>
