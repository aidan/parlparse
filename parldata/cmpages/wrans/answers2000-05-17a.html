<P>
<a name="00517w01.html_spnew0"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 I will be discussing a range of development issues with my European colleagues at the forthcoming Development Council meeting, including EC policy on HIV/AIDS.

 The Prime Minister and the Chancellor have informed the Japanese Presidency of the G7/8 that we would like to use the opportunity of the Okinawa Summit (21-23 July), and the meeting of the G7 Finance Ministers running up to the Summit, to review and encourage progress on the debt relief initiative.
<P>

<a name="00517w01.html_para0">The Government are committed to keeping up the momentum in the run up to, and beyond, Okinawa, and will make every effort to see that resources are released for the eradication of poverty in HIPC countries.

<P>
<a name="00517w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Gordon Prentice: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for International Development if she will list the contracts entered into with private sector companies for the provision of goods or services since May 1997 where penalty clauses were triggered for non-performance; and if she will make a statement.  [122012]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00517w01.html_spnew2"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 My Department's standard contracts do not contain penalty clauses. In cases of poor performance we can withhold payment. We do not keep a central record of where poor performance has resulted in payment being withheld and this information could only be obtained at disproportionate cost.

<P>
<a name="00517w01.html_spnew3"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 When NATO troops entered Kosovo in June 1999, we invited a number of mine/unexploded ordnance (UXO) clearance organisations to submit

<P><I>17 May 2000 : Column: 124W</I><P>
capability statements so that self-contained rapid response teams could be immediately provided to deal with the mine threat in Kosovo. Five organisations, including DSL, were selected for an initial period of two months, on the basis of experience in stated capabilities, quality of key personnel, experience in humanitarian mine action, ability to deploy quickly the requisite skills, equipment and back-up, value for money and knowledge of the region.
<P>

<a name="00517w01.html_para1">The United Nations Mine Action Co-ordination Centre (UNMACC) in Pristina later requested the services of these organisations, including DSL, for two further phases: another three months of emergency work; a phase for the year 2000 to address the mine/UXO threat in a more structured way. For the present phase, DSL and the other organisations were invited to submit detailed proposals which were assessed as above, in the light of their earlier performance in Kosovo and their ability to meet UNMACC's future needs. Before entering into a long-term contract with DSL, we consulted a range of Government departments, as is our normal practice in such cases.
<P>

<a name="00517w01.html_para2">DSL has been accredited by UNMACC for work in Kosovo and has been commended both as a field operator and as a co-ordinator of mine action activities in southern Kosovo.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00517w01.html_spnew4"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 Kambia District, situated in the Northern Province, remained volatile after the signing of the peace agreement last July. Although access was, and is difficult, food security assessments were carried out in January and February 2000 by Caritas Makeni and Community Action through Progress (CAP) who are local implementing partners of Children's Aid Direct (CAD). CAD are supported by the Department for International Development.
<P>

<a name="00517w01.html_para3">The CAD programme began in Kambia in March. So far it has been limited to assessments and targeting and registration of beneficiaries. The distribution of inputs will commence as soon as the security situation allows.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00517w01.html_spnew5"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 We are supporting the work of Professor Christine Gosden of Liverpool University to develop a prioritised programme, in conjunction with the universities in northern Iraq and the recently established post-graduate school at Halabja. This will benefit the victims of chemical and biological weapon attacks on the Kurds, principally at Halabja in northern Iraq. The programme will include developing proposals for palliative care, curative treatment,

and neutralising environmental contamination. We shall consider providing more substantive assistance on the basis of these proposals. Other donors such as Switzerland, Sweden, Finland, Norway, Italy and the Vatican have shown an interest in providing humanitarian and other support.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00517w01.html_spnew6"><B> Janet Anderson: </B> 
 We will be making regular assessments of the estimated timescale for the switch-over from analogue to digital transmission in the formal two-yearly reviews which I announced last autumn. The first of these reviews will be in autumn 2001. They will measure progress against the key tests of availability of digital services; affordability; and take-up of digital equipment. The Viewers' Panel, which we are setting up, will provide advice at each review on the extent of progress towards digital television from the viewers' point of view.

<a name="00517w01.html_spnew8"><B> Kate Hoey: </B> 
 As a result of the National Lottery Act 1998 and Policy Directions issued by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, distributors are already doing much to ensure Lottery money is distributed more equitably. Research into the impact of the National Lottery on the coalfields and other areas, soon to be published, should help to identify what more can be done to ensure that those in every area, including seaside resorts, have access to grants from the National Lottery.

 Since 1991, the BBC has had statutory responsibility for the administration of the television licensing system, including the Accommodation for Residential Care concessionary licence scheme. The day-to-day management of the scheme is carried out by TV Licensing as agent for the BBC. I understand from the BBC that information on the concessionary scheme is not held in the form requested.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00517w02.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Edward Davey: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health what support the Government provide to research into motor neurone disease; what involvement the Motor Neurone Disease Association has had in the channelling of Government resources into this research; what support the Government provide to the Motor Neurone Disease Association; what the level of Government funding will be for research into motor neurone disease in the next three years; and if he will make a statement.

<UL>
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00517w02.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The Government support research into motor neurone disease through the Medical Research Council (MRC) and the Department of Health.
<P>

<a name="00517w02.html_para9">The MRC is the main Government agency through which we support research on the causes and treatment of disease and receives most of its income via grant-in-aid from the office of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry. In 1999-2000, the MRC spent approximately &#163;1.6 million on motor neurone disease and on basic work on the function of motor neurones. They are also funding relevant underpinning research, for example on nerve function and damage. The MRC involve the Motor Neurone Disease Association (MNDA) whenever they consider an application for clinical trials in motor neurone disease.
<P>

<a name="00517w02.html_para10">The Department funds research to support policy development in health and social care, and to support effective practice in the National Health Service. The Department also provides NHS support funding for research sponsored by charities, such as MNDA, and by the MRC that takes place in the NHS. The current commitment of centrally commissioned research projects relating to motor neurone disease is approximately &#163;241,000. Information about expenditure on NHS service support and devolved Departmental research in the NHS are not held centrally. The total level of Department of Health support for motor neurone disease may therefore be higher than the expenditure for centrally commissioned research.
<P>

<a name="00517w02.html_para11">Project details of Department funded research can be found on the National Research Register (NRR). This is available in the Library and most medical libraries on CD Rom, and on the Internet: http://www.doh.gov.uk/nrr.htm.
<P>

<a name="00517w02.html_para12">It is not possible to predict what the future level of Government expenditure will be on specific areas of research as new research proposals are regularly being considered and commissioned.
<P>

<a name="00517w02.html_para13">The Government do not provide financial support directly to the MNDA.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health (1) if there is a ban on the import of meat and meat products from cattle of over 30 months into this country;  [121434]
<P>
<UL>(2) if the ban on the sale of meat products from cattle over 30 months old includes gelatine and other edible by-products;  [121433]




<P>

<UL>
<P>
(3) what checks are carried out on imports of meat and meat products to the United Kingdom to ensure that they are not from cattle over 30 months old.  [121435]
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00517w02.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Stuart </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 9 May 2000]:</i> I am advised by the Food Standards Agency that there is no restriction on the import of meat and meat products from cattle over 30 months, but the ban on sale of beef for human consumption from cattle aged over 30 months at slaughter applies to both home produced and imported supplies. The only exceptions to this ban are for meat from specialist grass-reared United Kingdom herds under the Beef Assurance Scheme (BAS) and meat from 14 non-EU countries that traditionally supplied the UK and have no history of BSE. As far as home supplies and meat imported into licensed premises are concerned, the ban is enforced by the Meat Hygiene Service. The carcase or part of a carcase of any bovine animal that is found to be more than 30 months old at slaughter (or over 42 months for BAS animals) is sterilised or stained immediately as an animal by-product. Local authorities are responsible for enforcement at other points in the supply chain.
<P>

<a name="00517w02.html_para14">Imported gelatine and other edible by-products are not subject to the over 30 months rule. However, they are subject to controls on the use of specified risk materials in their production. The UK introduced these national SRM controls from 1 January 1998, pending the implementation of Community measures. Imports of gelatine and other edible by-products must be accompanied by a certificate confirming that they are SRM-free or that they are from animals born, reared and slaughtered in Australia or New Zealand.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00517w02.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Stuart </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 9 May 2000]:</i> The Scientific Steering Committee advises the European Commission on matters relating to the risks from BSE. It is for the Commission to decide, in the light of that advice, whether any proposals for measures to manage those risks at European Union level need to be made.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00517w02.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 Kensington and Chelsea and Westminster Health Authority has undertaken formal public consultation over proposals to move inpatient paediatric services from Harefield Hospital to the Royal Brompton Hospital. A decision to pursue these proposals has been contested by Hillingdon Community Health Council and it will, therefore, be referred to Ministers for a final decision. Any decision on the future location of Harefield Hospital's paediatric transplantation services would require the consideration of the National Specialist Commissioning Advisory Group.
<P>

<a name="00517w02.html_para15">These proposals must be set in the context of longer term plans. Following detailed planning and assessment by National Health Service organisations in West London 



<P>
<P><I>17 May 2000 : Column: 129W</I><P>
and the Imperial College of Science, Technology and Medicine, a preferred option has been identified for the future of specialist inpatient services in West London, including cardiothoracic services. This would see services that are currently provided at Harefield Hospital located in a new building on the Paddington Basin site, alongside other West London specialist cardiothoracic services currently provided at the Royal Brompton and St Mary's Hospitals.
<P>

<a name="00517w02.html_para16">An Outline Business Case is due to be submitted to the London Regional Office of the NHS Executive assessing a number of options, including that for the Paddington Basin. Full public consultation will be held in the summer of 2000 before any decisions are made.

<P>
<P>
<P>

 Information on dental registrations in individual constituencies is not collected by the Department. In the Gloucestershire Health Authority area 31 per cent. of the adult population was registered with a National Health Service dentist at 31 March 2000.
<P>

<a name="00517w02.html_para17">In Cheltenham patients who are not registered with a NHS dentist can receive treatment under the personal dental service scheme. On Monday to Friday emergency patients can access treatment via the health authority's dental helpline. Gloucestershire Health Authority has submitted proposals for a dental access centre in Cheltenham. A decision about this scheme will be made shortly.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what steps each health trust in Shropshire is taking to reduce the incidence of violence against NHS staff; and if he will make a statement.  [121761]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00517w02.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 We are determined to ensure that National Health Service staff are never faced with intimidation and violence, which is unacceptable and will not be tolerated. In addition to the national 'NHS Zero Tolerance Zone' campaign, each of the three local trusts in Shropshire are taking independent action to protect staff from violent and aggressive behaviour.
<P>

<a name="00517w02.html_para18">The Royal Shrewsbury Hospitals NHS Trust have introduced the People Management Standards Document, which states that all staff in high risk areas will receive prevention of violence training by an approved organisation.
<P>

<a name="00517w02.html_para19">The Princess Royal Hospital NHS Trust have recently updated their Dealing with Violence and Aggression Policy. Measures include logging abusive incidents, and the use of a 'Safe Haven' room for patients showing extreme aggression.
<P>

<a name="00517w02.html_para20">Shropshire Community and Mental Health Services NHS Trust have carried out risk assessments in all work areas, to identify potential areas of weakness. Areas of activity resulting from this include additional staff training, and issuing mobile phones, pagers and personal alarms where appropriate.

<P>
<a name="00517w03.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 We propose to establish the General Social Care Council on 1 October 2001.
<P>

<a name="00517w03.html_para1">Originally we had intended to establish the new Council on 1 April 2001. However, the GSCC Advisory Group, set up to consider the requirements for a well functioning Council, has recommended October 2001 as a more appropriate start date. This will allow sufficient time to complete the many tasks that have to be undertaken for the Council to begin its important work. The Care Standards Bill, which is currently before this House, proposes vital functions for the GSCC that will increase the level of safety offered to the public. We see it as being in the best interests of the public and the GSCC itself that sufficient time is allowed in order to deliver a Council that is ready and able to take forward these vital functions.
<P>

<a name="00517w03.html_para2">The GSCC Advisory Group will be continuing its role until the Council is established in shadow form.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what guidance his Department issues to chairs of local authority social services committees concerning the operation of the Prohibition of Female Circumcision Act 1985.  [122492]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00517w03.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 As well as being illegal, female circumcision is an extremely unpleasant practice with lasting mental and physical effects on those girls on whom it is carried out. We have issued no specific guidance on this matter to chairs of social services committees but our wider advice, set out in "Working Together to Safeguard Children" on child protection procedures is clear. The Prohibition of Female Circumcision Act 1985 makes female circumcision, excision or infibulation (female genital mutilation (FGM)) an offence, except on specific physical and mental health grounds. A local authority may exercise its powers under section 47 of the Children's Act 1989 if it has reason to believe that a child is likely to be or has been the subject of FGM.

<P>
<a name="00517w03.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Alan Johnson: </B> 
 The National Minimum Wage (NMW) Act provides for officers to issue a financial penalty against an employer who does not comply with an enforcement notice.

The company concerned employs between 0-10 people.
<P>

<a name="00517w03.html_para5">It is also a criminal offence to refuse or wilfully neglect to pay the NMW. So far it has not been necessary to use these criminal powers, though we will do so in appropriate circumstances.

 <i>[holding answer 16 May 2000]:</i> I am satisfied that the powers given to the Director General of Fair Trading by the Control of Misleading Advertisements Regulations 1988, together with the self-regulatory system operated by the Advertising Standards authority, are effective in controlling advertising in the United Kingdom. However, the Government recognise that advertising controls alone may not be sufficient in the field of cosmetic surgery to ensure that the information patients receive is of an acceptable standard and my colleagues in the Department of Health are therefore considering how best to take this matter forward.

 The Government's Chief Scientific Adviser will need to have a first class international reputation in science or engineering.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if he has set the financial target for the Post Office for 2000-01; and if he will make a statement.  [122924]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00517w03.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Alan Johnson: </B> 
 The Government are setting the Post Office a return on capital employed target of 13 per cent. in 2000-01 and this translates into an operational pre-tax profit target of &#163;392 million in 2000-01. This target excludes the network of post offices, where the PIU report is awaited, and the non-operational interest arising from past surpluses held on the Post Office's balance sheet. This target will be subsumed within the overall post-tax profit target for the Post Office as a whole, as described in the White Paper.
<P>

<a name="00517w03.html_para6">As already announced, the 'dividend' that the Government effectively take out of the Post Office is set at 40 per cent. of the post-tax profits of the business as a whole. This is subject to a dividend floor payment which this year will be raised from 80 per cent. to 90 per cent. of the dividend that would be paid if the Post Office meets its overall profit target.
<P>

<a name="00517w03.html_para7">In order to help the Post Office to plan for the medium term, the Government are also setting an indicative financial target for 2002-03 of 13 per cent. return on capital employed (ROCE) in the Post Office's operational business, excluding the network of post offices and any non-operational interest arising from past surpluses. Return on capital employed is defined as profit before interest payable and tax, but after operating interest receivable, divided by operating capital employed.
<P>

<a name="00517w03.html_para8">I have set the Post Office's financial target and dividend floor for 2000-01, and the indicative financial target for 2002-03 in the light of external benchmarking, the likely regulatory environment, market expectations, the Post Office's approved Strategic Plan for 1999-2004, and other projections from the Post Office.

 Patents are only available for inventions for new technical solutions.

However, material--including genes--isolated from its natural environment by means of an inventive technical process may be subject to patent rights. To be patentable, such inventions would have to satisfy the general criteria for patentability that the invention is new and would not be obvious to someone in the technical field.

<P>
<a name="00517w04.html_spnew10"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 It is not the policy of the Department of the Environment Transport and the Regions to use penalty clauses in its contracts as they are not legally enforceable. Legally valid clauses which require the contractor to make payments when in default have been invoked in 17 contracts since May 1997.

 Local authorities have the power to regulate personal watercraft, such as jet-skis and water bikes, through local byelaws. For instance, strict speed limits may be imposed to exclude watercraft from specific areas. My Department's Review of Byelaw Powers for the Coast recommended, among other things, that local authorities should be given a new power to create bathing-only zones and more general powers to regulate activities on the coast which affect the wider environment, such as the use of personal watercraft. We shall introduce legislation where it is needed to implement the Review's recommendations. In the meantime, we have published a voluntary code of best and safe practice for leisure craft users, and we are exploring options for a voluntary boat registration and identification scheme, which would include jet-skis.

 Thirty-five responses to the Government's proposals in the consultation document, "A Quality Assurance Programme for Combined Heat and Power", commented on the proposed arrangements for sale of electricity from combined heat and power installations to other users, in relation to the Climate Change Levy.

[122124]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00517w05.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The Climate Change Levy agreements seek to deliver significant improvements in energy efficiency in exchange for a reduction in the standard rate of levy. This reduction counts as operating aid and is the subject of a current State Aids notification. The Government have linked the availability of the aid to helping to achieve an important environmental policy objective that the Commission shares: ie, the need to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. The Government believe they have prepared a robust, balanced case which will deliver significant environmental benefits while also helping to safeguard international competitiveness.
<P>

<a name="00517w05.html_para1">In parallel, the European Commission's draft revised guidelines on State Aids for environment protection are being discussed with member states.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what decisions he has come to following the Government's consultation on the proposed CHP Quality Assurance programme, in relation to the exemption of Good Quality CHP from the Climate Change Levy; and if he will make a statement.  [123005]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00517w05.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The Chancellor announced in the pre-Budget Report in November 1999 that Good Quality CHP was to be exempted from the Climate Change Levy. The Government's proposals for determining 'Good Quality' were set out in the consultation paper "CHPQA--A Quality Assurance Programme for Combined Heat and Power", issued in January.
<P>

<a name="00517w05.html_para2">Over 130 detailed responses to the proposals were received. There was general agreement that the proposed Quality Index (QI) approach provided a sound basis for measuring the thermal efficiency and environmental quality of the range of CHP installations of different sizes, type and fuel use, and for determining eligibility for exemption from the Climate Change Levy, and for other purposes. The consultation also identified a number of detailed improvements to the proposals.
<P>

<a name="00517w05.html_para3">There was also general agreement that a QI score of 100 was the appropriate level at and above which installations should be eligible for full exemption from Climate Change Levy--that is to say, exemption of all heat and of all generated electricity used on site or sold directly to other users. There will be an interim commissioning period of 12 months for industrial installations, and 24 months for community heating installations, during which the threshold will be a QI of 95.
<P>

<a name="00517w05.html_para4">There was also agreement that the proposed CHP Equivalent Generation Limit (CHP EGL) methodology provided a robust basis for determining the entitlement to partial Levy exemption for installations with a QI of less than 100. But respondents argued that the datum used in 



<P>
<P><I>17 May 2000 : Column: 140W</I><P>
the calculation of CHP EGL for a scheme should be 100, rather than the figure of 110 in the consultation proposals, and the Government accept the case for this.
<P>

<a name="00517w05.html_para5">Special provisions for simplified metering and monitoring arrangements for small-scale CHP schemes will apply to installations of 2 MWe or less, representing almost 90 per cent. of installations, rather than 1 MWe as previously proposed.
<P>

<a name="00517w05.html_para6">The operation of CHPQA will be reviewed in the light of experience. Any changes made will apply to subsequent CHP developments, and will not be applied retrospectively to existing CHP schemes.
<P>

<a name="00517w05.html_para7">The provisions for exemptions from the electricity supply licensing requirements are relevant to the operation of direct sale of electricity from Good Quality CHP. The Department of Trade and Industry's document, "Electricity (Class Exemption from the Requirements for a Licence) Order 1997 Proposed Amendments" sought views on possible changes, to facilitate CHP and other embedded generation. DTI are now considering responses, and will announce their conclusions shortly.
<P>

<a name="00517w05.html_para8">I am grateful for the valuable contribution from CHP users and suppliers and other interested parties in developing these arrangements for the detailed operation of CHP's exemption from the Climate Change Levy--a measure which gives crucial recognition to the environmental, climate change and other benefits of CHP, alongside the exemption of Good Quality CHP from business rates and Government's other supporting initiatives.

 This Government will continue to press for the removal of all barriers to fair competition in the UK-US aviation market, including the refusal of cabotage rights and the restrictions on foreign ownership of US carriers.

To ask the Minister for the Cabinet Office if she will list for each <i>(a)</i> area-based and <i>(b)</i> other regeneration-related initiative for which her Department is responsible (i) the amount budgeted and (ii) the total expended in each financial year for the planned lifetime of each initiative.

 The Cabinet Office is responsible for two of the programmes listed by DETR under 'other regeneration-related initiatives'--The Better Government for Older People and The Drug Action Teams. It is not possible to provide information as specifically requested. The Cabinet Office does not have accounting responsibility for the majority of expenditure made on these two initiatives.

<a name="00517w06.html_para20">The Better Government for Older People programme was launched in 1998 and runs until end of 2000. The pilot projects are fully paid for by Local Government Authorities and their partners. The Cabinet Office contributes a small grant toward the central co-ordination of the pilots. Total cost of the programme for each financial year is as follows: 1998-99 (&#163;322,154), 1999-2000 (&#163;597,285), and expected expenditure in 2000-01 (&#163;500,000).
<P>

<a name="00517w06.html_para21">The Drugs Action Teams (DATs) receive funding and resources from a variety of sources, including local agencies and it is not possible to provide total expenditure figures that would be on a consistent basis. DATs receive 'development funding' from central Government, based on population data and paid through the Drugs Prevention Advisory Service at the Home Office. Information available for expenditure on development is for 1998-99 (&#163;2,989,700) and 1999-2000 (&#163;5,035,000). Expenditure forecasts for 2000-01 will be no lower than in 1999-2000. Resources for 2000-01 and beyond are subject to the Cross Cutting Review on Drugs as part of the 2000 Spending Review.

 In our recent Housing Green Paper "Quality and Choice: A Decent Home For All" we acknowledge the importance of making sure that Housing Benefit and housing policies work together, and that the Government are sensitive to the housing policy aims and objectives of the devolved administrations.

 Currently the RUC record figures relating to reported intimidation but paramilitary expulsions cannot be separately identified. Figures on exclusions are particularly hard to calculate, since those affected are often reluctant to notify the police. Exclusions can also vary from temporary decisions to leave a town or area within it and total "exclusion" from Northern Ireland. We would be prepared to explore ways with the police in which the quality of these statistics could be improved, but it is not easy to gather accurate statistics in this area.

 The fire at the Giant's Causeway Visitor Centre destroyed 80 per cent. of the building. Senior Government officials met Moyle District Council on 4 May to discuss the development of a permanent replacement and the provision of temporary buildings in the interim so that services to visitors can be maintained. The Council has been asked to liaise with Government on a way forward.

 A proposal by Belfast Harbour Commissioners involving the transport of the Port of Belfast to the private sector, with a view to establishing a public/private partnership, with Government retaining a 'golden' share interest, is under consideration. A further option, involving the restructuring of the Port while retaining its trust port status, is also being examined at present.

<a name="00517w09.html_para1">Given the vital role of the Port in relation to the Northern Ireland economy, its future is a matter of considerable importance not only to the port authority and port users, but also to those in industry and commerce in Northern Ireland. I am hopeful that the Executive will be restored before the end of this month and I am sure that the future of the Port of Belfast will be high on its agenda.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00517w09.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 It is deplorable that burglars are targeting the elderly in this way. The problem with certain window and double-glazing installations is not, however, confined to sheltered accommodation complexes. It applies to other housing, residential and non-domestic premises where such glazing was used. Those double-glazed windows most at risk were probably installed in the late 1980s/early 1990s, and it would appear that some window types may be more vulnerable than others. Where problems are identified, additional measures can be incorporated in the existing frame to enhance security. Housing associations have already undertaken a number of modifications. In 1991, the Department introduced a new requirement for housing association developments that "the design of doors and windows minimise the risk of forced entry". The Department will write to all associations drawing attention to the current situation. It will consult with the Northern

<a name="00517w09.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B>

However, the Council and the European Parliament have given an important lead by fast tracking the adoption of the E-Commerce Directive, which sets the legal framework for e-commerce in Europe by removing barriers to cross-border electronic business and providing legal certainty on issues such as the liability of intermediary service providers, e-contracts and information to be provided to consumers. Adoption is expected in the next few weeks, with implementation in all member states to follow within 18 months.

 The British Council is funded through grant-in-aid, voted by Parliament, for its activities world-wide rather than through specific grants for individual countries.

 The value of the British Council's DFID- funded contract work has been reduced by 55 per cent. since 1996-97.

 The FCO and the British Council experienced cuts in funding in the period from 1995-96 until this Government had the opportunity, in the last comprehensive spending round, to arrest the decline. It is unrealistic to expect that the FCO and the British Council will receive increases that will recoup these cuts quickly. My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary is pressing for a much-needed increase in FCO resources across the board.

 The Joint Nuclear, Biological and Chemical Regiment, which was established as a joint initiative in April 1999, following recommendations arising from the Strategic Defence Review, will be permanently based at RAF Honington.
<P>

<a name="00517w11.html_para2">The Regiment was established at RAF Honington as a successful joint initiative in April last year, following the recommendations of the Strategic Defence Review, and was fully operational by December. The Regiment's operational capability will comprise nuclear, biological and chemical detection, reconnaissance and survey and will combine these aspects with expertise in decontamination techniques. This is a critical enabling capability--and the Regiment will be invaluable in reducing the risk to our armed forces who deploy in dangerous areas like the Gulf.

 The operating costs of the Ministry of Defence are managed by 11 Top Level Budget (TLB) holders. Major equipment and research programmes are managed separately. Prior to 2000-01 there were three discrete TLBs covering the main activities of the Royal Navy, however, from 2000-01 a new tri-service TLB has been created to manage the Departments logistics activities--the Chief of Defence Logistics (CDL) TLB. This budget includes the costs of the Navy as well as the Army and RAF and it is not possible separately to identify the single service elements; the budget is managed as a whole. Equipment procurement costs are also managed centrally the Defence Procurement Agency (DPA) and are therefore also excluded.

 <i>[holding answer 9 May 2000]:</i> Somerset and Avon Police Authority set a budget this year of &#163;181.2 million, an increase of 4.5 per cent compared with last year.

Distribution of resources between the counties of Avon and Somerset will reflect the Chief Constable's judgment of priorities at different times and is not subject to Government determination.

<a name="00517w13.html_para0">Under the Crime Reduction Programme, over &#163;2 million has been allocated so far to Avon and Somerset for the Reducing Burglary, Targeted Policing and Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) initiatives.
<P>

Under the latest round of the Targeted Policing Initiative, two proposals with a combined value of just over &#163;1 million have been approved for further development: one combating robbery in central Bristol, the other increasing the use of court confiscation orders against property criminals and drug dealers in Avon and Somerset. Another &#163;1 million has been allocated to fund nine projects in Avon and Somerset under the CCTV initiative.

 Information is not collected on the number of investigations into institutional child abuse or on the numbers of people arrested, charged or convicted as a result. But a survey was carried out last year on behalf of the Association of Chief Police Officers Crime Committee to establish how many forces in England and Wales had been or were currently investigating claims of institutional child abuse. During the period covered by the questionnaire (1 January 1998 to 30 June 1999), 32 forces said they had been, or were, currently investigating such allegations. Many of the remaining forces stated that they had been engaged in such inquiries at other times.

These were to be phased on the basis of 1,000 recruits this year (2000-01), 2,000 in 2001-02 and 2,000 in 2002-03. I also gave details of the number of police officers each force had been allocated.

Tripling the number which can be recruited during the current financial year will cost about &#163;24 million above and beyond the &#163;35 million which has already been provided for the current allocation.

<a name="00517w15.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 We are taking several new steps to ensure seed purity, in addition to the current consultation on the importation and labelling of seeds. These include pressing internationally for agreed standards, testing of seed imports to the UK and working with the industry on a Code of Practice. The need for action in this area is highlighted by the recent information we have received from Advanta Seeds UK that some of its conventional rapeseed sold and sown in 1999 and 2000 in several EU member states, including the UK, contained about 1 per cent. of genetically modified rapeseed. The genetic modification in question has already been assessed and cleared for food use and for field trials in the UK. We have consulted both ACRE (The Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment) and the Food Standards Agency who have confirmed the view that there is no risk to public health or the environment.

promised in the "Modernising Government" White Paper of March 1999. Forest Enterprise was established as an executive agency on 1 April 1996 and its review has now started. Stage 1 is concerned with getting the organisation right, and its conclusions will be reported to Forestry Ministers in July. Stage 2, which is concerned with improving the agency's performance, will be completed in December.
<P>

<a name="00517w15.html_para5">The review will include wide ranging consultation with Forest Enterprise's customers, visitors and other interested parties, who are invited to contact the Secretary to the Forestry Commissioners, at 231 Corstorphine Road, Edinburgh EH12 7AT or to visit the Forestry Commission's website at www.forestry.gov.uk/fereview.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food when the weight limit on payments for cattle entering the over-30-months scheme will be removed; and if he will make a statement.  [122926]
<P>

<P>
<a name="00517w15.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 On 12 May the Beef Management Committee agreed a Commission proposal to remove the weight limit on payments for all cattle entering the over-30-months scheme. This will take effect for all cattle entering the scheme on or after 5 June. This delivers on a key element of the Government's Action Plan for Farming. It is worth &#163;20 million a year in payments to UK farmers and will also increase asset values. It will be of particular benefit to those running suckler heards.

 The Pig Industry Restructuring Scheme is being developed in close consultation with the National Pig Association and the Meat and Livestock Commission to ensure as far as is possible that the scheme is relevant to the needs of pig producers. Clearly the scheme must also remain within UK and EU law and meet any financial propriety concerns.

 Although import statistics are not collected in this form, it is unlikely that much pigmeat imported into the UK over the last two years was in the form of pig carcases. In 1998 the UK imported 188,000 tonnes of pork and 231,000 tonnes of bacon and ham. The equivalent figures for 1999 were 212,000 tonnes and 227,000 tonnes.

 <i>[holding answer 15 May 2000]:</i> Slaughter in an abattoir without prior stunning is not illegal if it is carried out by a religious method and in accordance with the requirements set for religious slaughter. The Government would prefer all animals to be stunned before slaughter, but are committed to maintaining this exemption from the requirement to stun, in recognition of the wish of certain communities to slaughter animals in accordance with their religious beliefs. That does not mean that we do not seek to apply improved welfare standards and we do meet representatives of religious organisations to discuss their issues.

 Country of manufacture is not routinely provided by suppliers and so the information is not readily available. Although it is possible to obtain the information from main dealers it would mean having to extract the chassis number of each vehicle in the Departmental fleet to enable the dealership to trace its country of origin. With some 550 official vehicles in use throughout the Department and Agencies, this could be done only by incurring disproportionate cost.

 The Lord Chancellor has agreed to a request from the Legal Services Commission to postpone the introduction of the Criminal Defence Service from 2 October 2000 to 2 April 2001. This will allow additional time for preparation by the professions and for the implementation of the new arrangements by criminal defence lawyers. The Legal Services Commission is notifying the professions by letter accordingly. This delay will have no substantial effects on the reform programme, including the development of the salaried defender service.

 Our advice in "Working Together to Safeguard Children", which we published jointly with the Department of Health and the Home Office earlier this year, highlights the importance of focusing on preventative strategies in relation to female genital mutilation. Copies of "Working Together" were sent to all local education authorities. Furthermore, our advice to schools and local education authorities on child protection procedures in Circular 10/95, "Protecting Children from Abuse: The Role of the Education Service" makes clear that, if school staff have reason to believe that a child is at risk from any form of abuse, they should report their suspicions immediately to the school's designated teacher for child protection. The designated teacher will refer any concerns to the appropriate professional agencies to investigate further.

In recognition of the importance of training, the Department is supporting expenditure of &#163;26 million in the 2000-01 financial year through the Standards Fund to help LEAs with the costs of training teachers of children with special educational needs, including training in the mandatory qualifications. The Teacher Training Agency has also been conducting a review of the courses leading to mandatory qualifications.

A 10p income tax band was introduced in Budget 1999 and increased in Budget 2000. As with the whole tax system, this band is kept under constant review.

 The Contributions Agency (CA), a former agency of the Department of Social Security (DSS), ceased to exist with effect from 1 April 1999 when, as part of the transfer arrangements with the Inland Revenue, all CA functions and associated staff moved across to the Revenue.

<P>

<a name="00517w18.html_para7">Prior to the transfer with the Revenue the CA, in line with other Government Departments and agencies, had delegated responsibility to formulate their own retirement age policy. Their policy, operated under the central DSS policy framework, provided for a normal retirement age of 60 for all staff. As part of the transitional arrangements on moving to this policy, some staff had been granted extensions of service up to a maximum retention date of 31 July 1999.
<P>

<a name="00517w18.html_para8">As part of the negotiations prior to the transfer, the Revenue undertook to honour any commitments given to staff in respect of extension of service in place at 31 March 1999. This undertaking was embodied in the terms and conditions package negotiated with the relevant trade unions, and accepted by CA staff by way of a ballot. Thus after the transfer any former member of the CA who had been granted an extension of service was able to remain with the Revenue until the expiry of that extension, up to the maximum retention date of 31 July 1999. Where an extension was not agreed at 31 March 1999, then staff would subsequently retire in line with Revenue retirement age policy, which at the time of the transfer was similar to CA policy, in providing for a normal retirement age of 60.
<P>

<a name="00517w18.html_para9">The Revenue has recently introduced a concession to the normal retirement age of 60, whereby staff with less than 25 years pensionable service at age 60 may be retained until this level of pensionable service is attained, or reach age 65, whichever is the earlier. This concession was part of a package of terms and conditions changes attached to a Modernisation Agreement with the Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS) accepted as part of the revised 1999 pay offer. The concession took effect on 21 January 2000.
<P>

<a name="00517w18.html_para10">On a wider front, the Revenue is carrying out a review of its current retirement age policy and, following consultation with the relevant trade unions, any resultant policy changes will be announced in due course.

 The total sum of the completed bids from the auction of licences for spectrum to support third generation mobile services in the UK was &#163;22.5 billion. Within any given level for total public spending, less on debt interest will mean more is available for other public services. Total spending will be unchanged from the spending envelope set in the Budget in line with the Government's neutral view of the economy's trend growth and in line with the fiscal rules. The Budget forecast that the stability and growth pact reference levels of 3 per cent. of GDP for the deficit and 60 per cent. for debt are achieved comfortably throughout the next five years.

<BR>
The Director of the Office for National Statistics (ONS) has been asked to reply to your recent question asking about the average household income of Wandsworth. I am replying in the Director's absence.
<BR>
No household income estimates are available from ONS at London borough level.
<BR>
The latest figures published by ONS for household income by region, up to 1997 were published in Regional Accounts 1997: part 2, Economic Trends no. 551, October 1999. This publication is available in the House of Commons Library.
<BR>
In this publication income of the household sector is defined on a national accounts basis. In addition to private households, this includes charities, voluntary and other non-profit organisations and quasi-corporations.
<BR>
The published figures are normally presented in terms of total annual household income per head of population. Converted to weekly averages published regional estimates for London (the smallest area published that includes Wandsworth) are as follows:
<BR>
1994: &#163;268

<BR>
Estimates of economic status are available from the Labour Force Survey (LFS). The measure of unemployment derived from the LFS is defined on a consistent and internationally recognised basis set out by the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and counts as unemployed people who are a) without a paid job, b) available to start work within the next two weeks and c) have either looked for work in the last four weeks or are waiting to start a job already obtained.
<BR>
The latest seasonally adjusted estimates from the Labour Force Survey covering winter (December-February) 1999/2000 show there were 268,000 ILO unemployed in the Greater London area.
<BR>
In the closest aggregation of Jobcentres to the Greater London area there were 36,100 unfilled vacancies in March 2000 the latest date for which data are available. Jobcentre vacancies do not represent the total number of vacancies available in the economy. Latest estimates suggest that about a third of all vacancies nationally are notified to Jobcentres. This proportion may vary between regions.
