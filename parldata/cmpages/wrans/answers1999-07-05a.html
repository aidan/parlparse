<P>
<a name="90705w01.htm_wqn0"><B> Mr. Pearson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what estimate he has made of <i>(a)</i> the cost of the climate change levy to his Department and <i>(b)</i> the savings from the reduction in National Insurance Contributions that will occur when it is introduced.  [88863]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90705w01.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 The net impact of the climate change levy and the associated reduction in main rate of employers' National Insurance Contributions on the Home Office will depend on the rates of climate change levy. The final rates of climate change levy will not be set until Finance Bill 2000.
<P>

<a name="90705w01.htm_para0">In addition, the Government are still considering a number of detailed issues on the tax treatment of different energy products which could have a significant impact in some instances. It is, therefore, not possible to give definitive figures about the impact of the climate change levy on the Home Office.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department which class of vote covers expenditure incurred on protection of Ministers and other current and former parliamentarians; and what is the total of this expenditure in the current financial year.  [88849]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90705w01.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 The class of vote covering such expenditure is Class IV. It is not the practice to publish how much is spent on protective security measures as to do so would provide an indication of the level of security being provided.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what plans he has to include individual restaurant health inspection data in his Department's proposals for freedom of information.  [89131]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90705w01.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 Food hygiene inspections are conducted by local authority Environmental Health Officers under the Food Safety Act 1990. This Act does not prohibit the disclosure of inspection reports unless they contain confidential information.
<P>

<a name="90705w01.htm_para1">Local authorities are public authorities within the meaning of the draft Freedom of Information Bill and will be required to apply the legislation to information requests when the Bill is enacted.
<P>

<a name="90705w01.htm_para2">Clause 34(2) of the draft Bill exempts information from the right of access if disclosure would, or would be likely to, prejudice the commercial interests of any person. It is possible that inspection reports may fall for consideration under this exemption. But, even if the disclosure of a 



<P>
<P><I>5 Jul 1999 : Column: 324</I><P>
report is exempt by virtue of this clause, authorities would have a duty under clause 14 to consider, on a case by case basis, whether the information requested should be disclosed in the public interest.
<P>

<a name="90705w01.htm_para3">In addition, under clause 6 of the draft legislation, public authorities would have a duty to adopt a publication scheme, which has regard to the public interest and must be approved by the Information Commissioner. Under clause 6, a local authority could agree with the Information Commissioner that such reports should be published as of right and if so, in what form and to what timetable.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90705w01.htm_wqn3"><B> Mrs. Brinton: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department (1) what estimate he has made of the cost of providing free access to criminal records checks for the voluntary sector;  [89123]
<P>
<UL>(2) if he will review the decision to include the voluntary sector in charging for criminal records checks on people who want to work in the sector;  [89122]
<P>
(3) what assessment he has made of the effects of charging for criminal records checks on the voluntary sector;  [89121]
<P>
(4) when the Criminal Records Bureau will be established;  [89124]
<P>
(5) what representations he has received on the effects of charging for criminal records checks on the voluntary sector.  [89120]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90705w01.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 It is intended that all applicants will be required to pay for certificates from the Criminal Records Bureau. We have received a large number of representations from voluntary organisations and individuals on this subject. We considered very carefully whether there was any way in which free checks could be provided for volunteers. Whilst we acknowledge the valuable contribution volunteers make, we have concluded that it will not be practicable to provide any free checks from the Criminal Records Bureau for volunteers or for any other groups. We realise that this is unwelcome news but providing free checks would prove an unsustainable burden on the public purse and may increase demand for certificates from the Bureau to an uncontrollable extent. In addition, we do not consider it would be fair to allow volunteers to have free certificates when there are other equally deserving groups such as the unemployed or the disabled.
<P>

<a name="90705w01.htm_para4">It is difficult to estimate what the cost of free certificates would be to the Bureau, as it is not known how many volunteers would be required to apply for certificates, but the cost is potentially enormous. If checks were provided only to new volunteers seeking the higher levels of checks, the cost could exceed &#163;10 million a year. If checks were extended to all existing volunteers, the cost could be between &#163;40--&#163;200 million. The cost of the fees for certificates from the Bureau will be kept to the minimum necessary to recoup costs and to provide a satisfactory service.
<P>

<a name="90705w01.htm_para5">The Criminal Records Bureau is being established to enable checks to be carried out to help prevent unsuitable people from working with children or vulnerable adults. It will be for voluntary organisations to decide whether 



<P>
<P><I>5 Jul 1999 : Column: 325</I><P>
volunteers require a certificate, and a certificate will not obviate the need for voluntary organisations to carry out their own checks and references as part of normal recruitment procedures. However, the over-riding consideration at all times must be the protection of the vulnerable, and the service provided by the Criminal Records Bureau will help to achieve this. We do not believe that volunteering will diminish with the introduction of these checks.
<P>

<a name="90705w01.htm_para6">The Bureau will be set up in Merseyside and work on implementation and timing is being taken forward.

 Details of the United Kingdom's extradition arrangements are not available on this basis. Those countries with whom the United Kingdom has extradition arrangements follow. The Extradition Act 1989 enables special extradition arrangements to be made with foreign states with whom the United Kingdom has no extradition arrangements. In addition, there are a number of international conventions which allow for the extradition of fugitives between ratifying states for certain serious offences, even in the absence of an extradition arrangement.

<a name="90705w02.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 The millennium preparedness of all fire brigades in England and Wales is subject to independent assessment by Her Majesty's Fire Service Inspectorate. The results, together with independent assessments of the millennium preparedness of the other emergency services and other key sectors of the national infrastructure, were reported to the Action 2000 National Infrastructure Forum on 21 April. Her Majesty's Inspectorate reported then that they expected all fire brigades in England and Wales to be fully prepared by September at the latest. That remains the case. The latest state of preparedness of each fire brigade will be reported at the next National Infrastructure Forum on 13 July, following which, I will forward further details to my hon. Friend.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what guidance his Department has issued to police forces about consultation with minority groups in the communities which they serve; and if he will list those forces which have established procedures for liaison with <i>(a)</i> ethnic minorities, <i>(b)</i> lesbian, gay, and bisexual people, <i>(c)</i> disabled people and <i>(d)</i> transsexual and transgendered people.

<a name="90705w02.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 In December 1996, the Home Office Police Research Group published a report "It's Good to Talk: lessons in public consultation and feedback". This report looked at good practice in consultation and feedback on policing and provided advice to police authorities and forces in deciding how to undertake their consultation arrangements. It set out a matrix methodology to help each force and authority decide on the most appropriate arrangements, and included advice on how to consult with minority groups--particularly those who found it difficult to take part in the more formal consultation processes.
<P>

<a name="90705w02.htm_para0">Extensive guidance has been issued on the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 which imposed new duties on police forces and local authorities to form partnerships to deal with crime and disorder. Consultation with local communities is a major aspect of these new duties and the guidance gives advice on the involvement of minority groups.
<P>

<a name="90705w02.htm_para1">Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary's thematic report on police community and race relations "Winning the Race", published in October 1997, and the follow-up report "Winning the Race--Revisited", published in March 1999, also made recommendations on a number of issues including the need to have sound and representative public consultation processes--with particular reference to minority groups.




<P>
<P><I>5 Jul 1999 : Column: 330</I><P>

A survey of all forces undertaken as part of the inspection revealed that at the time of the second inspection (September 1998), 93 per cent. of forces had a strategy in place to consult minority groups. The remaining forces are developing their own strategies. Such strategies will not necessarily be specific to any one group but will encompass all groups within the local community. The issue will be looked at again when Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary carries out a further inspection of race and community relations in 2000.

<a name="90705w02.htm_para2">The Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) has published guidelines for the police in dealing with gay and lesbian communities which includes advice on consultation arrangements.

<a name="90705w02.htm_wqn5"><B> Mr. Bob Russell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what legal basis exists <i>(a)</i> for the warning by the Association of Chief Police Officers that vehicles in motorway accidents or which have broken down must be removed within 30 minutes and <i>(b)</i> for the police to engage their own contractors and charge the owners to remove vehicles after this time limit; when these provisions will come into effect; and if he will make a statement.  [89553]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90705w02.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 Police powers to arrange for the removal of vehicles from motorways are contained in the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984 and the Removal and Disposal of Vehicles Regulations 1986. Under this legislation, the precise arrangements adopted by police forces for the safe recovery of vehicles from the motorway including the engagement of contractors to carry out this work are an operational matter for individual chief officers of police.
<P>

<a name="90705w02.htm_para3">In view of the increasing traffic flows on motorways and the associated dangers the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) issued guidelines in May this year which reduced the period of leeway which the police allow for the removal of vehicles from the motorway from two hours to 30 minutes. A memorandum of understanding has recently been agreed between the four main motoring organisations and ACPO whereby Greenflag, the Royal Automobile Club, Automobile Association and Britannia will aim to attend the scene of a breakdown on the motorway within 30 minutes.

 We intend to issue a consultation paper shortly. The Working Party on Electoral Procedures, which has been looking at this alongside other issues, is expected to report to the Home Secretary later in the summer. Consideration is still being given to the exemptions for the Security Service that would be necessary under the Data Protection Act 1998. At this stage, it is not envisaged that the Security Service would rely on exemption provided by section 29 of the 1998 Act (crime and taxation).

 Animals can be used in scientific procedures only where the benefits to humans, other animals or the environment outweigh the costs to the animals involved and where there are no suitable alternatives. Dogs (along with cats, primates and equidae) can be used only if animals of no other species are suitable or if it is not practicable to obtain animals of a suitable species. Unless otherwise authorised, only dogs acquired from designated breeding establishments can be used in scientific procedures.
<P>

<a name="90705w03.htm_para0">In 1997, 7,490 scientific procedures were carried out on dogs (less than 0.3 per cent. of all procedures) of which 7,240 involved beagles. Of the 7,490 total, 4,581 were for assessing the safety or efficacy of pharmaceuticals and 1,738 were for pharmaceutical research and development.
<P>

<a name="90705w03.htm_para1">No-one likes to use animals in scientific procedures and particularly dogs. However, their use in some procedures is still essential in medical research and testing. The aforementioned figures indicate the important areas of work in which the vast majority of dogs are used.

 We have received, and are studying, a detailed report provided, on 29 June, by the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection (BUAV). An investigation into the allegations made has already been launched and I have asked for urgent advice on whether there is a need to suspend--under the powers granted by section 13 of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986--the establishment's certificate of designation.
<P>

<a name="90705w03.htm_para2">A comprehensive and thorough investigation will be carried out. It will be led by a senior member of the Home Office Inspectorate unconnected with this establishment. This could take two or three months to complete, but I will be receiving interim reports.

<a name="90705w03.htm_para3">In addition to the standards of care and welfare of animals, the BUAV report criticises the Home Office Inspectorate. These allegations will be considered during the investigation.

One of these is of mild severity and one moderate. There are a further 22 project licences that have primary availability elsewhere, but that have secondary availability at this establishment. Eleven of these are of mild severity and the remainder are moderate.

[88011]<P>

<P>
<a name="90705w04.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 The Government intend to set significantly lower rates of the climate change levy for energy intensive sectors that agree targets for improving energy efficiency. Detailed negotiations on these targets are now underway with a number of industrial sectors with the intention of reaching agreement in October 1999.
<P>

<a name="90705w04.htm_para0">Over the period 1990-2000, the Government's climate change consultation paper estimated that about 70 per cent. of the fall in industrial carbon dioxide emissions relative to the increase in GDP is the result of large-scale fuel switching in electricity supply. Around three quarters of this fall is the result of the introduction of gas fired generation and the remainder from improved productivity of nuclear power and increased renewable energy. A further 10 per cent. can be attributed to changes in the UK's industrial structure and some 20 per cent. comes from improvements in energy efficiency.
<P>

<a name="90705w04.htm_para1">The climate change levy is expected to save around 1.5 million tonnes of carbon a year by 2010.

<P>
<a name="90705w04.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 The Government are committed to the promotion of competition in energy markets which will maintain downward pressure on pre-tax prices.
<P>

<a name="90705w04.htm_para3">The White Paper "Conclusions of the Review of Energy Sources for Power Generation" sets out the Government's broad energy policy, including radical reforms to the electricity market. These reforms will bring greater competition to the wholesale market and lower

<P>

<a name="90705w04.htm_para4">Proposals for the climate change levy also recognise the need to have regard to the competitiveness of UK industry.

<P>
<a name="90705w04.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. Wills </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 28 June 1999]:</i> Small and specialist shops are crucial to the economic, environmental and social development of small and medium-sized towns. They provide employment, regenerate the economy of town centres and have an important role to play in providing a service to those living and working in urban areas, particularly the disadvantaged, or those who may be socially excluded.
<P>

<a name="90705w04.htm_para5">The Urban White Paper published on 29 June will consider the effects of new technology on the retail sector and this is likely to include the role of small shops.
<P>

<a name="90705w04.htm_para6">In addition several Single Regeneration Budget schemes have an impact, either directly or indirectly, on retail sectors within small and medium-sized towns in the West Midlands region. Other assistance available to small businesses throughout the region includes schemes in Staffordshire, Hertfordshire, Shropshire and Worcestershire that offer a mix of business services and support.

<a name="90705w05.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 The Government do not collect statistics on UK coal production costs. We understand that, on average, UK coal is produced at costs which are roughly a third of German production costs, and a quarter or less of Spanish costs. Unlike the German and Spanish coal industries, the UK coal industry receives no state aid.
<P>

<a name="90705w05.htm_para0">Outside the European Union the picture is different. The delivered cost of UK deep-mined coal is currently reported to be around a quarter to a third higher than the delivered price of internationally traded coal, much of which also has a lower sulphur content than most British coal.
<P>

<a name="90705w05.htm_para1">The competitiveness of the industry is not determined purely by its costs, but also depends on factors including location, security of supply and the precise characteristics of the coal required.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90705w05.htm_spnew2"><B> Dr. Howells </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 2 July 1999]:</i> The proposed End of Life Vehicles Directive would provide for improved recycling and treatment standards for vehicles when they have become waste (as defined under existing legislation). In other words, it would apply only when the owners have decided to discard them. For this reason, no exemptions would be needed for classic cars, and the European Commission has therefore not proposed any such exemptions.
<P>

<a name="90705w05.htm_para3">At the Environment Council on 24 June, it was decided to put back a decision on a Common Position on the Directive until the next Environment Council meeting, in recognition of the German Government's concerns over the approach adopted to producer responsibility.

<a name="90705w05.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. George Robertson: </B> 
 My Department has concluded that, as the cost of building a domestic laser of sufficient power would be unaffordable, we should, in the absence of nuclear testing, invest in the US National Ignition Facility, NIF, in order to make use of its facilities. The precise details of our investment in the NIF have yet to be formalised in a contract with the US. The information requested is, therefore, commercially sensitive. I can, however, say that the investment, to cover a shot rate enhancement programme and the design and construction of a UK target chamber, will be in the region of &#163;100m. This represents an affordable and cost-effective way of discharging the undertaking we gave in the Strategic Defence Review that we would ensure the safety and reliability of our nuclear weapons.
<P>

<a name="90705w05.htm_para4">No new laser facility is under construction or planned for AWE Aldermaston. The present laser at Aldermaston, generally known as Helen and opened in 1979, has been used to research the principle of techniques to underwrite the integrity of nuclear warheads in the absence of nuclear testing. It is based on older technology than the NIF which is 600 times more powerful. Helen will be retained until access to NIF is obtained.

<a name="90705w05.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. George Robertson: </B> 
 The MOD has been aware of the development of a Russian ramjet propulsion system for a beyond visual range air-to-air missile since 1993, when a model, designated RVV-AE-PD, was displayed at the Moscow Airshow. During this year's Paris Airshow, the weapon itself was displayed. Representatives stated that the missile, which is a privately funded programme, had completed testing including ground-launched firings against a target. Air-launched firings had not been carried out due to the high costs involved. They also confirmed that it was now ready to go into production although they had no customers, either in Russia or elsewhere.

 A fixed price contract was let in July 1988 and ultimately the MOD spent &#163;42 million on the Trawlerman IT project. The project experienced serious technical difficulties and delays such that, by the time it was delivered in May 1995, some 3&#189; years late, it was obsolete. The problems experienced by this project go back to the early 1990s. The Department subsequently acquired a replacement system at a fraction of the cost (&#163;6 million), using a modern off-the-shelf design and applying the lessons learned from the experience of Trawlerman. Lessons have been learnt and procurement procedures have been improved with the introduction of the Smart Procurement Initiative launched earlier this year under the Strategic Defence Review. Further information is contained in the Eighteenth Report, Session 1988-99 of the Committee of Public Account on the Ministry of Defence: Appropriation Accounts 1997-98.

 I am not in a position to comment on NATO air forces as a whole. However, the RAF dropped some 500 RBL755 cluster weapons during Operation Allied Force, each containing 147 bomblets. Research trials of the equivalent weapon (BL755) when used at low level indicate that approximately 5 per cent. of the bomblets are likely to fail to detonate. However, when used at medium level as during Operation Allied Force, the failure rate is expected to be lower given that the impact angles and velocities are greater, and could be as low as 1 per cent.

We also envisage that the Centre will develop an international reputation for excellence in military medicine. Our aim is to have the formal Customer Service Agreement in place with our chosen partner by 1 April 2000 with a view to opening the Centre for Defence Medicine on 1 April 2001.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, pursuant to his answer of 18 June 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>264</i>, concerning the purposes of the proposed European Union Political and Security Committee and associated Institute for Security Studies, if he will list <i>(a)</i> the date, nature, status and attendance of the meeting at Petersberg, <i>(b)</i> the ministerial attendance from the United Kingdom, and reference to the consequential statement in any parliamentary proceeding and <i>(c)</i> the scope and definition of the tasks in executing an integrated and single Union policy for foreign defence, security and military activity in aid of peace keeping and crisis management as defined in the consolidated Treaty on European Union.

 The meeting at Petersberg was a ministerial meeting of the Western European Union. It took place on 19 June 1992. The United Kingdom was represented by the right hon. Douglas Hurd MP, then Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, and the right hon. Malcolm Rifkind MP, then Secretary of State for Defence.
<P>

<a name="90705w06.htm_para10">The Treaty on European Union provides for the Union to define and implement a common foreign and security policy, covering all aspects of foreign and security policy: and for the common foreign and security policy to include all questions related to the security of the Union, including the progressive framing of a common defence policy, and that this shall include humanitarian and rescue tasks, peacekeeping tasks and tasks of combat forces in crisis management, including peacemaking. These are the "Petersberg tasks". The Treaty on European Union further provides for the Union to avail itself of the Western European Union to elaborate and implement actions of the Union which have defence implications.
<P>

<a name="90705w06.htm_para11">The "Petersberg tasks" are referred to in the European Council Declaration on Strengthening the Common European Policy on Security and Defence issued at Cologne on 4 June. The Declaration also outlines the objectives of future work within the European Union in order to enable the European Union to undertake these tasks.

 Dr. Hassan Abdeen, Under-Secretary at the Sudanese Ministry of External Relations, visited London during the week beginning 21 June. He paid a courtesy call on me and had other meetings with officials.
<P>

<a name="90705w07.htm_para0">Discussions covered a wide range of issues and on 25 June a joint statement was released announcing agreement to the return of British and Sudanese staff to Khartoum and London. This is an important step in normalising relations between the two countries.

<a name="90705w07.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B>

 Oil exploration has been going on in southern Sudan for some time. A pipeline has recently been built from fields to the Red Sea coast. I understand that oil is likely to flow through the pipeline in the near future.

 Responsibility for implementing the judgment in Loizidou <i>v</i>. Turkey lies with Turkey. We take such responsibilities seriously, as with all obligations in the Council of Europe, and expect other members to do likewise. We continue to make clear to Turkey, including in the Committee of Ministers' Deputies, the need to respect the Court's judgment.
<P>

<a name="90705w07.htm_para2">The Chairman of the Committee of Ministers' Deputies wrote to the Turkish Foreign Minister on 22 June requesting information on how Turkey intended to satisfy its obligations in this case. The Government fully supported this action.

 <i>[holding answer 2 July 1999]:</i> KFOR are aware of a number of incidents where Serb civilians have been killed by Kosovo Albanians and are taking measures to ensure the security of all citizens. At present, no verifiable figures are available.
<P>

<a name="90705w07.htm_para3">As the answer I gave to my hon. Friend on 2 July 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>314</i> made clear, steps are being taken to reassure Serb civilians in Kosovo.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what steps are being taken to establish an armed international police force in Kosovo.  [89603]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90705w07.htm_spnew7"><B> Mr. Tony Lloyd </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 2 July 1999]:</i> UN Security Council Resolution 1244 authorised the UN Secretary General to establish an international civil presence in Kosovo, with responsibility inter alia for maintaining civil law and order, including through the establishment of local forces and meanwhile through the deployment of international police personnel. It was agreed at the Friends of Kosovo meeting in New York on 30 June that the United Nations Mission in Kosovo should acquire the capacity to take over responsibility for public security from KFOR as soon as possible.
<P>

<a name="90705w07.htm_para4">The UN Secretariat has recommended that UN police officers serving in Kosovo should be armed for self-defence purposes, but has left the final decision to UN members. The Foreign Secretary has already announced that the UK is willing to provide 60 police officers to recruit, to train and to monitor a civil police force in Kosovo.

 As part of the &#163;2m bilateral electoral assistance package, referred to in my written answer to the hon. Member today (ref 89207), we provided funding for a pre-election programme of in-country workshops on cross-party lines for Indonesian political parties run by the Westminster Foundation for Democracy, with the co-operation of hon. Members. This helped to develop a code of conduct for political parties as well as address issues of transparency, policy formulation and financial integrity. We also provided financial support for voter education programmes, including some aimed specifically at reaching women and first-time voters.

 There has been no change to the Jobseeker's Allowance Regulations in the past 18 months specifically relating to term-time employees.
<P>

<a name="90705w08.htm_para2">However, an independent Social Security Commissioner has recently decided that people who are not entitled to Jobseeker's Allowance during term-time because of the number of hours they work, are also not entitled to benefit during holiday periods. In deciding claims for Jobseeker's Allowance, adjudication officers are legally bound to follow this interpretation of the law.
<P>

<a name="90705w08.htm_para3">School ancillary staff may claim Jobseeker's Allowance during the 1999 summer vacation. This position has not changed since 1998. Whether such claims result in entitlement to benefit will depend upon the circumstances of each individual case. Where any doubt exists about entitlement to benefit, individual school ancillary staff should claim.

 Our priority is to help those pensioners who are the least well off.

After next year's earnings uprating of the guarantee, pensioner couples over 80 will be around &#163;8 a week better off in real terms than before the guarantee was introduced. Older pensioners will also benefit from the &#163;100 winter fuel payment to be paid to every pensioner household before Christmas.

We are continuing to encourage and develop strong links between the Benefits Agency and Local Authorities. For example, we have installed 360 Random Access Terminals in 349 Local Authorities to facilitate the exchange of data between the Benefits Agency and Local Authorities. More widely, the Government are helping Departments, Local Authorities and the private sector to work more closely together to combat fraud across the range of welfare services. There is a continuing work programme to measure the size of the security problem facing welfare services, to ensure that Departments know what type of data each holds and to explore new ways of working in concert to fight fraud and uphold compliance with the law. An Inter-Ministerial Group on Welfare Fraud was announced in July 1998 to oversee this work.

24. <a name="90705w09.htm_wqn0"><B> Dr. Julian Lewis: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security if he will make a statement on his proposals for pension reform.  [88050]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90705w09.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 Our strategy for a fundamental reform of the pensions system was set out in the pensions Green Paper "A New Contract for Welfare: Partnership in Pensions" published before Christmas. It is based on the principle that everyone who can save for his or her retirement has a responsibility to do so. In turn we have a responsibility to provide security in retirement for those who cannot save enough. Our proposals are based on four interlinked pillars:
<P>

<a name="90705w09.htm_para0"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the contributory Basic State Pension, increased at least in line with prices, will remain the key building block of the pension system.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="90705w09.htm_para1"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the Minimum Income Guarantee, delivered through Income Support, which will provide an income floor below which no pensioner without savings will fall, and we aim to uprate that guarantee in line with earnings as resources permit. The new Minimum Income Guarantee will form the target which we want people to beat through their pension provision and they will do that in different ways.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="90705w09.htm_para2"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a new State Second Pension to replace SERPS. State Second Pension will ensure that everybody who has worked and contributed throughout their working lives will have an income on retirement above the level of the Minimum Income Guarantee. People caring for a disabled person or bringing up children aged five and under, and disabled people with broken work records, will get credits for State Second Pension.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="90705w09.htm_para3"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Stakeholder Pension schemes, which will provide good value, reliable funded pensions for people for whom no suitable funded scheme is available.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="90705w09.htm_para4">We believe that for most people on moderate and higher incomes it is a funded pension that offers them the best prospects for their income in retirement and that is why we are determined to ensure that those people who today can save for their retirement have the framework in which to do so. Stakeholder Pension schemes will combine the low overheads and high security of occupational pensions with the flexibility of the best of personal pensions, and will be available to all. They will be particularly designed to help those on middle incomes, those earning roughly between &#163;9,000 and &#163;20,000 a year, but will benefit those on higher incomes as well. Once secure low-cost value for money Stakeholder Pension Schemes have become established, we expect the State Second Pension will no longer be earnings-related but paid at a flat rate.
<P>

<a name="90705w09.htm_para5">Occupational pension schemes are one of the main reasons for the improvement in pensioners' incomes over the recent decades and will continue to play a vital role. We want to build on the success of traditional occupational schemes. In the "Strengthening the Occupational Pensions Framework" consultation paper that was published on the day after the pensions Green Paper we set out a number of proposals to strengthen and simplify the regulation of occupational schemes.
<P>

<a name="90705w09.htm_para6">Our objective is to bring the UK pensions system up to date and to make sure that after a lifetime of hard work people do not arrive at retirement certain to depend on income-related benefits. We are determined to ensure that everyone has a decent income in retirement and these objectives are at the heart of the Pensions Green Paper we published in December.

<a name="90705w09.htm_spnew8"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 We want to set the overall charge limit at a level which will, over time, allow stakeholder pension schemes to meet the cost of delivering a number of services, including information and basic advice, to potential members. These costs are likely to vary from scheme to scheme and it would not be sensible to specify what proportion of the charge should be used to provide each element.
<P>

<a name="90705w09.htm_para14">We will be consulting further on the advice arrangements for stakeholder schemes, including defining what basic advice should cover. The final decision on the overall limit on charges will be made in the light of this further work.

 Under the Channel Tunnel Rail Link (CTRL) Development Agreement, London & Continental Railways (LCR) is permitted to dispose of land, transferred to them under that Agreement, which the Secretary of State determines to be surplus to the needs of the CTRL Project. Leyton Yard is such a site. The sale of the Leyton Yard site, as with other sites which may be declared surplus, is subject to a clawback which returns half the proceeds to the taxpayer, allowing for the costs of site development and sale. London & Continental Railways' share of the sale proceeds has to be used to fund the CTRL project. The disposal price of Leyton Yard was arrived at through an open bidding process. I understand from LCR that, in addition to Asda, negotiations were held with other major supermarket chains. The final size of the clawback payment cannot yet be calculated as the development is still at an early stage. The non-cash terms of the agreement are a matter for LCR, but the agreement also delivers significant planning gains to the London Borough of Waltham Forest, and helps to facilitate and finance important local highway improvements.

<P>
<a name="90705w14.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Meale: </B> 
 The Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions provides the Agency with grant in aid each year to enable it to carry out its statutory duties. One of its duties is to promote the conservation and enhancement of water and associated land for recreational purposes. In addition the Agency is a lead organisation for flood defence and water level management, both of which contribute to the distinctive landscape of the area.
<P>

<a name="90705w14.htm_para0">The Agency is just one of many organisations that has a role in maintaining, managing and developing the internationally important Somerset Levels wetland area. An organisation known as the Levels and Moors Partnership (LAMP) was set up some years ago to bring all the partnership organisations together to address such issues as the socio-economic development of the Levels.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90705w14.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Meale: </B> 
 The net impact of the climate change levy and the associated reduction in the main rate of employers' National Insurance Contributions on the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions will depend on the rates of the climate change levy. The final rates of climate change levy will not be set until Finance Bill 2000.
<P>

<a name="90705w14.htm_para1">In addition, the Government are still considering a number of detailed issues on the tax treatment of different energy products which could have a significant impact in some instances. It is, therefore, not possible to give definitive figures about the impact of the climate change levy on the Department for the Environment, Transport and the Regions.

OSPAR Convention meeting in Hull on 21 to 25 June; and if he will place in the Library a copy of the submissions made by <i>(a)</i> the United Kingdom and <i>(b)</i> other OSPAR contracting parties and recognised observer organisations relevant to the United Kingdom.  [89732]<P>

<a name="90705w15.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. Meale: </B> 
 The annual meeting of the OSPAR Commission, held in Hull at the invitation of the UK Government from 21 to 24 June, was opened by my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister. The main outcomes were the adoption of a strategy on environmental goals and management mechanisms for offshore activities (which, with the four strategies adopted at the Ministerial meeting in Portugal last year, means that all the main activities of the OSPAR Commission are now covered by long-term strategies), of a recommendation on the best available techniques for the manufacture of emulsion-PVC, and (with a reservation from Norway) of guidelines on artificial reefs in relation to marine living resources.
<P>

<a name="90705w15.htm_para5">Other matters discussed mainly concerned the implementation of the long-term strategies adopted last year. On the strategy for radioactive substances, the Contracting Parties agreed to intensify their efforts to implement it by focusing on the principal sources of discharges, emissions and losses, including the reprocessing of nuclear fuel and some other nuclear and non-nuclear activities; where action by the operators of nuclear installations is required, the Contracting Parties agreed to ensure that this is taken without delay. Another major theme was the improvement of the structure of the OSPAR Commission and of its working practices, in order to help the implementation of the strategies.

 <i>[holding answer 2 July 1999]:</i> My Department has received a number of representations concerning the effect of raptors on racing pigeons. This issue is being considered by the Raptor Working Group co-chaired by my Department and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee. The working group is due to make its final report before the end of the year. To assist the working group in drawing its conclusions my Department let a research contract to assess the impact of raptor predation on pigeons and to investigate the effectiveness of non-lethal deterrents. It is hoped that the findings of this research will help to provide some guide to pigeon fanciers as to how they may best reduce any losses they may be incurring.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what progress he has made with the possibility of using electronic equipment in the Greater London Authority elections.  [90057]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90705w15.htm_spnew9"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The Government have been considering the potential for introducing more innovative and up to date electoral procedures. Electronic voting is one of the areas the Howarth Working Party recommended for further consideration and piloting. The Working Party expects to submit a summary of its recommendations to Government later this month and its detailed report at the end of the summer. The London Mayor and Assembly elections on 4 May 2000 provide an excellent opportunity to introduce a more up to date system of voting or counting, more in keeping with our modern way of life.
<P>

<a name="90705w15.htm_para7">Following the invitation for expressions of interest from potential suppliers, issued in March, we received a number of suggestions as to how we might make best use of some form of electronic voting equipment for the London elections next year. We have shortlisted four potential suppliers, all of which have experience in elections worldwide where electronic equipment has been used successfully and offer either touch-screen voting at polling stations or optical scanning equipment to speed the counting process. The four suppliers are Data and Research Services Plc; Election Systems and Software Inc with Unisys Ltd.; Nedap; and Smurfit Ltd.
<P>

<a name="90705w15.htm_para8">The next stage is to carefully consider the detailed proposals for London's elections which the four shortlisted suppliers have been invited to submit. Our top priority is to run a successful election on 4 May 2000--less than a year away. We need to be sure that the use of electronic equipment will be cost effective, help rather than confuse voters, and lead to a more efficient delivery of results. The Greater London Authority will be a new modern form of governance and we need to consider voting systems to match as we move into the 21st century.

water company business plans for 2000-05. These programmes were largely comprised of investment required to meet the requirements of EC Directives, although they also included, in a fully integrated manner, significant programmes to improve compliance with domestic quality objectives.
<P>

<a name="90705w16.htm_para0">We consider that these proposals can be delivered for around &#163;8 billion.

 We are considering with water companies and other groups with an interest in water charging how any alternative to the present system of unmeasured charging, such as the use of Council Tax bands, could be designed to provide for fair charges and to avoid significant losses for some groups.
<P>

<a name="90705w16.htm_para1">There is no statutory bar on water companies introducing alternative unmeasured charging systems. Under the Water Industry Act 1999, companies will be obliged to include in charges schemes details of the basis on which they wish to charge for water and sewerage services to homes. Schemes will be subject to approval by the Director General of Water Services. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State will issue guidance to the Director General on the approval of schemes. We shall be consulting on draft guidance shortly.

 The Director General of Water Services' periodic review of prices for the period 2000-05 may be expected to offer reductions in average water and sewerage bills in April 2000.
<P>

<a name="90705w16.htm_para2">The Water Industry Act 1999 will, for the first time, require water companies to give householders a measure of choice in the method by which they are charged for water. Many pensioners, if they make comparatively small demands on the water system, will be able to benefit from the new statutory right to be charged on a measured basis free of initial cost. We propose to make regulations under the Act to provide protection for households who are particularly vulnerable to high measured charges because of unavoidable high water use, such as those with certain medical conditions.

in average charges for water and sewerage services must remain within limits set by the Director General for each company for each year. The Director General is currently conducting his periodic review of prices for the period 2000 to 2005. The Government have given guidance to the Director General on the environmental and water quality improvements to be delivered by 2005. We believe that these can be secured while offering reductions in average water and sewerage bills. The Director General expects to announce draft price limits for each undertaker later this month.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what measures his Department has taken to reduce the level of energy inefficiency in pensioner households.  [89440]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90705w16.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Meale: </B> 
 The Government have developed a wide range of measures to improve domestic energy efficiency.
<P>

<a name="90705w16.htm_para3">The Home Energy Efficiency Scheme (HEES) is currently the main programme for insulating the homes of the neediest householders. The Scheme provides grants (up to a maximum of &#163;315) for energy efficiency improvements in the homes of people on benefits, the disabled and the over-60s. Those aged 60 or over but not on a qualifying benefit are entitled to a 25 per cent. grant.
<P>

<a name="90705w16.htm_para4">On 11 May I launched our consultation proposals for revising and expanding HEES. With a budget of some &#163;300 million for the first two years, New HEES will provide comprehensive packages of heating and insulation improvements. The programme will provide substantial help for over-60s on low income, including central heating systems, with a revised grant maximum of &#163;1,800.
<P>

<a name="90705w16.htm_para5">The Government have also increased the annual Winter Fuel Payment to &#163;100 for every eligible pensioner household. Pensioners can put this money towards the cost of their fuel bills, or to help fund energy efficiency improvements.
<P>

<a name="90705w16.htm_para6">In addition to a broad range of Government energy efficiency programmes, the Director General for Electricity has, since 1994, set Energy Efficiency Standards of Performance requiring the public energy suppliers to encourage and assist customers with energy efficiency measures. Around two thirds of this help has gone to pensioner and low-income families.

 As a sport recognised by the UK and home Sports Councils, hang-gliding is eligible to apply for Lottery Sports funding.

 As independent corporate bodies set up by Royal Charter, it is for the UK and the four home country Sports Councils to determine their own spending and distribution priorities, to enable the most efficient and effective use of the public funds made available to them. Some of these funds are directed as grant-in-aid to sports governing bodies. The Sports Councils, as Lottery distributing bodies, have powers to delegate the handling of any grants made to governing bodies, member clubs and other groups. The Chief Executive of the Sports Councils act as Accounting Officers for the funding they receive and distribute and are explicitly required to ensure that any organisations given powers of delegation have suitable administrative controls and systems.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what is the estimated durability and life expectancy of post-1850 newspaper newsprint copies held in the national newspaper collections.  [89109]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90705w17.htm_spnew6"><B> Mr. Alan Howarth: </B> 
 Newspapers produced in the last 150 years have not been made to last. It is estimated that the durability of newsprint is unlikely to be more than 60 years. After this time, the paper is too brittle to be handled. The British Library is addressing the problem in its retrospective transfer of newsprint to microfilm and the continuing process of microfilming all issues of UK daily and weekly national and regional newspapers received under legal deposit.
<P>

<a name="90705w17.htm_para1">The Library is also a subscriber to Newsplan, a co-operative programme devised by public libraries, national libraries and the newspaper industry for microfilming and preservation of local newspapers and for making them accessible to users. It is estimated that, since the late 1980s, over 14,000 reels of microfilm, each corresponding to a bound volume of historic local newspapers, have been filmed by the Newspaper Library for Newsplan. In March this year, the Heritage Lottery Fund awarded &#163;5 million in support of Newsplan.

 The National Preservation Office at the British Library (in conjunction with the Library Association and the Society of Archivists) has for several years been instrumental in promoting actively the use of acid free paper, particularly to the UK publishing community. Resolutions for the use of permanent paper were adopted by the International Publishers Association in 1989, and by UNESCO IN 1997.

There are already special procedures in both Houses for such Bills, but modernisation of parliamentary procedures may in time create other opportunities for their scrutiny. The Government attach great importance to the work of the Law Commission. Where the Government do accept that the Commission's proposals merit legislation, we will seek to make the best use of available parliamentary time and procedures.

<P>

<a name="90705w18.htm_para1">Finally, the number and proportion of cases in which a prosecution proceeded are shown, divided into those where the defendant was bound over, those which proceeded to a committal hearing, and those which proceeded to a trial or guilty plea.
<P>

<a name="90705w18.htm_para2">A prosecution did not proceed in 251,167 cases, amounting to 18.5 per cent. of those completed during the year. However, it would not be true to say that no further action was taken in those cases. Every case received by the Crown Prosecution Service is reviewed by a lawyer, who must ascertain whether there is sufficient reliable and admissible evidence to offer a realistic prospect of conviction. If so, then the reviewing lawyer must determine whether a prosecution is in the public interest. The criteria on which these decisions are based are set out in the Code for Crown Prosecutors, and are applied in every case.
<P>

<a name="90705w18.htm_para3">If the balance of the evidence or the public interest weigh against a prosecution then the police must be consulted, wherever time allows, before a decision is taken.
<P>

<a name="90705w18.htm_para4">Review is a continuing process, extending up until the point at which a hearing begins. Thus a case may proceed as far as the date of the trial before the need for discontinuance becomes apparent and, in these circumstances, the prosecution will have taken all the action necessary to prepare for a contested hearing.
<P>

<a name="90705w18.htm_para5">More than half of discontinued cases are unable to proceed because: witnesses fail to appear at court, refuse to give evidence, or change their evidence; defendants produce driving documents providing their innocence on the day of trial; evidence is excluded because of irregularities in its collection; or gaps in the prosecution case cannot be plugged by the police.
<P>

<a name="90705w18.htm_para6">Cases not proceeding include those written off as well as those discontinued. However, these are quite distinct outcomes: a write off is an administrative procedure whereby dormant cases are removed from the record of live proceedings, so giving a more accurate account of work on hand. The majority of write offs occur where the police cannot trace a defendant for the service of a summons, or where a bench warrant for arrest remains unexecuted following the defendant's failure to surrender to bail. If the defendant is subsequently arrested, the prosecution can recommence.

 The Interdepartmental Group on Genetic Modification Technology (IGGMOT) is an internal forum for officials across Government to co-ordinate policy matters on genetic modification. The Ministerial Group on Biotechnology and Genetic Modification (MISC 6) is responsible for making decisions on Government policy in respect of biotechnology. IGGMOT supports the work of Ministers by ensuring that the wide range of Government Departments with an interest in this issue are in close and regular contact with one another about developments. It is not the normal practice of Government to release details of internal discussions, advice to Ministers, specific meetings or their content.

<a name="90705w19.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 Those staff who are required by roster to work in hospitals on 31 December 1999 and 1 January 2000 will receive their normal rate of pay: 100 per cent. for their standard hours, and payments for additional duty hours at the rate appropriate to their working pattern. Doctors rostered for duty on either of these two bank holidays will also receive time off in lieu.
<P>

<a name="90705w19.htm_para0">The payment of additional duty hours (ADHs) for a 72 hour week adds an extra 40 per cent. to the basic salary of a junior doctor, enhancing the basic salary from &#163;16,710 for a first year house officer to &#163;23,394 when ADHs are included.
<P>

<a name="90705w19.htm_para1">Pay for first year house officers expressed as an hourly rate is &#163;8.04 for each standard hour of duty. A class 1 (full shift) additional duty hour (ADH) will be paid at &#163;8.04; a class 2 (partial shift) ADH will be paid at &#163;5.63; and a class 3 (on-call) ADH will be paid at &#163;4.02. Doctors in more senior training grades will receive higher pay rates according to their incremental point: for example, a specialist registrar on the fourth point of scale would receive ADHs at the hourly rate of &#163;12.90, &#163;9.63 and &#163;6.45 respectively. The basic salary scale for an SpR is from &#163;23,300 to &#163;33,965. When ADH rates are included the total salary payable ranges from &#163;32,617 to &#163;45,571. For senior house officers the basic salary scale is from &#163;20,845 to &#163;27,845 and, including ADHs, the total salary payable ranges from &#163;29,176 to &#163;38,993.

 The Government indirectly control the prices of branded prescription medicines supplied to the National Health Service by the pharmaceutical industry through the Pharmaceutical Price Regulation Scheme (PPRS). Companies have freedom of pricing for new medicines launched on the market, although the PPRS controls the profits that pharmaceutical companies are allowed t make through their trade with the NHS.
<P>

<a name="90705w20.htm_para2">Under the PPRS, pharmaceutical companies are required to submit annual financial returns to the Department of Health reporting, among other things, sales, research and development expenditure, other costs and profits. These returns, however, are reported in aggregate form. It is not possible, therefore, to identify separately the profits made by pharmaceutical companies on individual medicines.

<a name="90705w20.htm_spnew6"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 Historically, National Health Service trusts have not been required to market test their insurance requirements. As with other goods and services, however, they have been expected to obtain best value for money. Since 1 April this year trusts have only been permitted to renew commercial insurance to cover motor vehicle risks. They are now able to cover other non-clinical risks--mainly buildings, property and liabilities--by membership of two new NHS risk pools established under Section 21 of the NHS and Community Care Act, 1990. Alternatively, they may choose to self-indemnify. These new arrangements are already significantly reducing the overall cost of insurance to the NHS, releasing additional money for patient care.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90705w21.htm_spnew4"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 The use of cloning techniques on non- embryonic human cells and tissue is a long-established medical practice for the treatment of serious disorders. This may include treatment using vaccines developed with cloning technology, or tissue grants such as skin for burn victims.
<P>

<a name="90705w21.htm_para2">In December 1998 the joint Human Genetics Advisory Commission (HGAC) and Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) report "Cloning Issues in Reproduction, Science and Medicine" was published. The Report recommended, among other things, that the Government should consider making regulations under the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990 to extend the purposes for which human embryos may be used in research to include particular therapeutic purposes.
<P>

<a name="90705w21.htm_para3">The Government's response to the joint HGAC/HFEA report, 24 June 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>436</i>, reaffirmed their policy that human reproductive cloning is ethically unacceptable and cannot take place in this country. However, we recognise that the recommendation to extend the regulations to allow research for particular therapeutic purposes should be very carefully considered. We believe that more evidence is required of the need for using human embryos in such research, its potential benefits and risks and also that account should be taken of alternative approaches that might achieve the same ends.
<P>

<a name="90705w21.htm_para4">We announced that a group chaired by the Chief Medical Officer would be set up to examine these issues and report early next year. We expect to announce the membership of that group shortly.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment how many school playing fields were sold <i>(a)</i> between 1979 and 1997 and <i>(b)</i> from May 1997 to date; and how these figures were collated.  [88662]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90705w22.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The Department did not collect information in the form requested before 1 October 1998, when section 77 of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998 came into force. However, sports bodies suggest that under the previous Government 40 playing fields a month were being sold off. Since 1 October 1998 an average of 8 applications a month have been approved. Because of the tightening up of the rules, local authorities are usually only putting forward proposals which meet our very strict criteria which have been further strengthened by new guidance we published on 7 June.

[89153]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90705w23.htm_spnew0"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 Tables which the Government published on 24 June showed, in column 2, the percentage of each local education authority's Local Schools Budget being delegated to schools this year. Delegated funding in this context took into account that part of an authority's Standards Fund programme which they were devolving to schools. We expect authorities to exclude from their Local Schools Budget any grant-supported expenditure of a capital nature.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90705w23.htm_spnew2"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 Involving parents in their children's learning is crucial to raising their expectations and we are pursuing a number of initiatives to encourage them to be actively involved. Parents have an important role to play in helping to raise standards in Education Action Zones and in the new "Excellence in Cities" initiative.
<P>

<a name="90705w23.htm_para0">We are supporting family literacy and family numeracy courses, targeted on parents and children with low basic skills, often in deprived areas. Many parents are helping with our summer school pilots this year, several of which are targeted at pupils in deprived areas who might not otherwise have access to the opportunities offered. And our "Playing for Success" initiative is establishing study support centres with Premier League and Nationwide Division One football clubs, most of which are situated in deprived areas. The centres target local pupils who have lost motivation, involving their parents through pre-course meetings and questionnaires.
<P>

<a name="90705w23.htm_para1">The publication of school performance tables enables parents to look at the results obtained by similar schools and encourages them to demand more of those in which their children are educated.

 The Government have promoted the recommendation of the National Committee of Inquiry into Higher Education (the Dearing Committee) that all higher education institutions should review their Equal Opportunities policies, and identify and remove barriers to recruitment and progression for particular groups. The Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals and the Commission on University Career Opportunity are advising institutions on equal opportunities policies and monitoring their implementation in the sector.

 Direct comparison cannot be drawn between local authorities' estimated expenditure on management and administration for 1998-99 and their estimated expenditure on strategic management for 1999-2000 in view of the very different definitions set down in regulations. Figures extracted from the statements for 1998-99 prepared under section 122 of the Education Act 1996 and for 1999-2000 prepared under section 52 of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998 are provided in the following table.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment if he will rank each local education authority according to the value of the schools components of its Standard Spending Assessment for 1999-2000 as a percentage of the value of those components for 1998-99; and if he will show those percentages and values distinguishing the authorities with grant maintained schools in 1998-99.

 The following table shows, for each local education authority, the value of the Schools Standard Spending Assessments (SSA) for 1999-2000 and 1998-99, and the former expressed as a percentage of the latter, ranked by this percentage. Schools SSA has been interpreted as an authority's total SSA excluding the "Other" block. Local education authorities with grant maintained schools in 1998-99 are indicated by an asterisk.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment if he will make a statement on the differences between spending shown in local education authorities' section 52 statements and that shown in their section 122 statement for 1998-99 which are attributable to the existence of grant maintained schools.

 Estimated expenditure on schools which were grant maintained in the financial year 1998-99 was not required to be included in budget statements prepared by local education authorities under section 122 of the Education Act 1996 since these schools were funded direct by the Funding Agency for Schools. Budget statements prepared under section 52 of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998 cover estimated expenditure for the financial year 1999-2000. Whilst grant-maintained status remains until the end of August, local education authorities have been responsible for passing on funding to these schools since 1 April and

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment if he will list the local education authorities which failed to meet the statutory deadlines <i>(a)</i> for notifying their fair-funding budget shares to schools and <i>(b)</i> for supplying to him details of their fair-funding schemes for 1999-2000, stating in each case the date by which the information was supplied.

<P>
<a name="90705w24.htm_spnew4"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 Information on the notification of budget shares to schools is not collected centrally. All authorities' schemes for the financing of schools made under section 48 of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998 were approved by 31 March 1999.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what measures he is taking to ensure that all public buildings and facilities comply with the standards set out in the Disability Discrimination Act 1995.  [89209]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90705w25.htm_spnew1"><B> Ms Hodge: </B> 
 The Disability Discrimination Act 1995 does not set specific standards for buildings or facilities. Rather, it requires employers and service providers to make reasonable adjustments for disabled people.

<a name="90705w25.htm_para0">The new duties on those who provide goods, facilities and services to the public to make reasonable adjustments for disabled people are coming into force on 1 October, although service providers will not be required to make physical adjustments to their premises until 2004. The October phase of implementation is being supported by a revised Code of Practice which was issued on 29 June. The Code gives guidance to service providers about their responsibilities under the Act and how to adopt good practice. A similar Code of Practice in respect of employers' duties under the Act was issued in 1996. In addition, other information for service providers and employers can be obtained from the DDA Helpline and more will become available as 1 October approaches.
<P>

<a name="90705w25.htm_para1">Whether a service provider or employer has fulfilled their duties under the DDA can only be determined when an individual pursues a claim through an Employment Tribunal or the Courts. However, we are currently taking legislation through Parliament to establish the Disability Rights Commission which will support disabled people in securing their rights under the Act and seek to ensure that employers and service providers who discriminate change their practices and procedures. The Commission will also work to promote good practice among service providers and employers, and be a central source of information and advice about the DDA.
<P>

<a name="90705w25.htm_para2">A campaign to raise awareness about the DDA, and disability in general, with employers and service providers, as well as the general public is currently underway. From 1 July, national newspaper advertisements have been alerting service providers to the new rights in respect of access to goods, facilities and services. Further newspaper and radio advertisements are planned for the autumn. The campaign will also be working with intermediaries such as the CBI, British Chambers of Commerce and the Local Government Association to ensure that all service providers, in both the public and private sector, are aware of the new rights and duties.

<P>

<a name="90705w25.htm_para8">The release into the environment and the marketing of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) are regulated by Council Directive 90/220/EEC. All such releases are carried out following a scientific assessment of risk carried out case-by-case on the basis of an environmental risk assessment. All authorisations for the experimental release of GMOs are issued by the UK authorities on the basis of this Directive. The UK authorities may impose specific conditions on any release, and may suspend a release where there is evidence of harm to human health or the environment.
<P>

<a name="90705w25.htm_para9">Consents to market GMO products (Part C consents under the Directive) are issued at Community level in order to secure the single market for these products. Notifications on the basis of the Directive are submitted through the competent authority of one member state and all other competent authorities may then comment upon the application. If there are differences between member states, the matter is resolved by qualified majority voting.
<P>

<a name="90705w25.htm_para10">Restrictions may always be imposed to take account of specific environmental conditions in member states, and the safeguard clause allows member states to suspend any release immediately if evidence emerges of harm to human health or the environment. This is subject to confirmation within three months at Community level.
