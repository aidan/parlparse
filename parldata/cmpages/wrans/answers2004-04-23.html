<p>
<a name="40423w01.html_para0">
<i>(a)</i>&nbsp;Defra has commissioned a wide range of studies on this topic. These programmes and their associated studies have been addressed by &quot;pollutant&quot; (eg greenhouse gas, ammonia, nitrate, phosphorus) rather than by farming sector (eg animal, arable). Full details of the numerous studies, both on-going and those completed in and after 1999, can be found on http://www2.defra.gov.uk/research/project&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;data/subject.asp?SCOPE=0. Most of this extensive research is listed under the policy areas &quot;Environmental Protection (Agriculture)&quot; and &quot;Farmland Conservation&quot;. Some of the output of this research is summarised in National Inventories for Greenhouse Gases and Ammonia.

<p><a name="40423w01.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 The international beef export market is expanding and Brazilian production is rising to meet demand. The vast majority of Brazil&#039;s export trade is currently with countries outside the European Community.

We have not undertaken our own assessment of the impact of the globalised beef market on deforestation in the Amazon Basin, but we are aware of work undertaken and published on 2&nbsp;April 2004 by CIFOR (Centre for International Forestry Research), which suggests that Brazil&#039;s beef production contributes to the destruction of the Amazon rainforest.

The Government is committed to tackling illegal logging. Under EU law, a ban on the import of illegally logged timber can be imposed only at EU level. We are therefore showing leadership within the European Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT) process. The FLEGT action plan includes the proposal to negotiate voluntary partnership agreements with timber producing countries. These agreements would be underpinned by a new EU import Regulation that would deny access to EU markets for illegally harvested timber from those countries.

<p><a name="40423w01.html_wqn4"><b> Linda Perham: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment she has made of the factors accounting for the trend in UK carbon dioxide emissions since 1996.  [165455]</p>








<p><a name="40423w01.html_spnew4"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 UK emissions of CO <sup>2</sup>  in 2003 were some seven million tonnes of carbon (MtC) lower than in 1996. Broadly speaking this can be accounted for by warmer temperatures in 2003 (-4MtC), greater economic output (+29MtC), lower energy consumption per unit of economic output (-26 MtC), and lower average carbon content of fuels per unit of energy consumption (-6 MtC). The figures in brackets indicate approximately the contribution of each effect, positive and negative signs indicating respectively a contribution to higher or lower emissions.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what recent estimate the Government has made of the annual costs&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to the insurance industry resulting from climate change.  [165815]</p>

 According to the Association of British Insurers storm and flood insurance losses in the UK over the past five years have totalled &#163;5 billion, twice that of previous years. At present, it is not possible scientifically, to attribute such changes and the associated weather events to climate change absolutely. However, what is clear is that the extreme weather events experienced in the UK over recent years (for example, the floods in 2000 and the hot summer in 2003) are typical of what is likely to be experienced with even greater frequency as a result of man-made climate change.

 Plastic packaging waste from farms is already subject to the Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) Regulations 1997 (as amended) which encourage the reuse of packaging where possible and require businesses to recover and recycle packaging waste to target levels.

Waste from premises used for agriculture is currently excluded from national waste management controls by section 75(7)(c)&nbsp;of the Environmental Protection Act 1990.

Currently the majority of agricultural waste plastic is disposed of by burial in un-licensed &quot;farm tips&quot; or by unregulated open burning with consequential risks to the environment and human health. The proposed regulations will prohibit the on-farm disposal of agricultural waste without a waste management licence or a registered licence exemption. Waste agricultural plastic will have to be disposed of or recovered in appropriately licensed or registered sites in line with other sectors of industry.

However, now that the White Paper has been published, it is necessary to move from simulations to develop a comprehensive redesign of London&#039;s airspace.

The White Paper also makes it clear that CAA will need to involve NATS in working up its detailed proposals.

 Recent trends in renewable energy investment have been highly encouraging.

 No such estimate has been carried out.

The funding ensures that, at least until 2006, Post Office Ltd. can maintain the rural network and prevent avoidable closures. Nevertheless, some closures are

This would complement paragraph 42 of PPG3 which expects local authorities, when revising their plans, to review all their non-housing allocations, including those for employment, and consider whether some of this land might better be used for housing or mixed use developments.

 To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what proportion of local authorities are able to undertake land searches electronically; and when this is expected to be extended to all authorities.  [166892]</p>







<br>&nbsp;<br><i>23 Apr 2004 : Column 692W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>






<p><a name="40423w07.html_spnew0"><b> Phil Hope: </b> 
 For land searches to be carried out electronically, local authorities must first have set up&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;electronic Local Land and Property Gazetteers (LLPGs). All authorities in England have been encouraged to set these up as part of their individual programmes to electronically enable 100&nbsp;per cent. of their priority services by 2005. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister&#039;s Local e-Government programme is helping local authorities to achieve this target, in particular by allocating a flat rate grant of &#163;200,000 per annum in 2002 and 2003 to each authority submitting a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;satisfactory Implementing e-Government (IEG) statement. The IEGs submitted in 2003 indicated that on average every authority would have electronically enabled 66&nbsp;per cent. of their priority services by March 2004; most authorities indicated that they would have electronic LLPGs by that date.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40423w07.html_para0">
Local authorities have also been encouraged to have automated links with the National Land Information Service (NLIS), which is an electronic search engine intended to be a one-stop shop for information about land and property in England and Wales. It was developed in the 1990s by a group of public sector bodies, but was transferred in 2000 to the Local Government Information House (LGIH), a private, wholly-owned subsidiary of the Improvement and Development Agency (IDeA), to take forward. The IDeA has told us that by January 2004, two-thirds of authorities in England and Wales had enabled electronic responses to searches via NLIS. It is important to note, however, that authorities do not have to be linked to NLIS to offer searchers an electronic search option.

<p><a name="40423w07.html_spnew1"><b> Keith Hill: </b> 
 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister does not currently collect statistics centrally for total amounts secured through section 106 payments, and could therefore provide this information only at disproportionate cost. It is not possible to say what percentage of planning obligations will be covered by the proposed optional planning charge, as it will be for individual applicants to choose whether or not they want to pursue this option. While we accept that setting up a charge system could lead to an increased burden on local planning authorities in the short term, this should be more than, offset by the longer term pay-off in being able to process individual planning obligations much more quickly and efficiently.

<p><a name="40423w07.html_spnew6"><b> Mr. Raynsford: </b> 
 The valuation for rating of public conveniences is normally reached taking account of the cost of construction and making allowance for obsolescence, expense of upkeep and location.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40423w07.html_para6">
<i>(a)</i>&nbsp;The number of persons using a public lavatory will depend on its location. A town centre convenience is likely to have greater usage than one in a remote location. In some coastal resorts, public lavatories may be used relatively intensively during the summer but closed altogether in the winter. The valuation of a public convenience is unaffected by usage. It is valued by reference to the cost which the occupier would otherwise incur if it had to construct an alternative facility. The cost of providing a facility which is intensively used is no greater than that of providing a facility which is less used, or used only seasonally. Exceptionally, instances have arisen where conveniences have been permanently closed at or before the relevant valuation date, and are thus not used at all; in such cases the Valuation Office Agency&#039;s Rating Manual recommends that no value is assessed.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40423w07.html_para7">
The VOA recognises that in some instances local authorities may be operating public conveniences where, in present circumstances, the cost of provision would not be justified. In such cases, current capital cost may be a doubtful indication of value. The VOA has addressed this by applying an age-related scale of obsolescence allowance, which is more generous than applied to other classes of property valued by reference to cost.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40423w07.html_para8">

The arts funding system in England has already reorganised along the lines of the Government&#039;s regional plans.

Six to eight members of the 15&#150;20 membership of the Regional Arts Councils are local authority nominees and the Chairs of the nine Regional Arts Councils are members of the National Council and form the majority of its membership of 15.

In February 2003, DCMS published &quot;Framework for the Future&quot; the first-ever national strategy for public libraries. It identified three areas where libraries have great potential to go beyond their traditional roles: the promotion of reading and informal learning; access to digital skills and services including e-government; and measures to tackle social exclusion, build community identity and develop citizenship. &quot;Framework&quot; is intended to encourage public library services fit for the needs of 21st century users. This strategy is being delivered through MLA and its partners.

In 2002 DCMS commissioned MLA to set up an Archives Task Force which would carry out an in-depth analysis of the sector and propose a strategy for making archives better understood, better looked after and better used. The report of the Archives Task Force, &quot;Listening to the Past, Speaking to the Future&quot;, was published by MLA in March 2004. The report makes a number of proposals, including a major new initiative to help more people access archives more easily, a greater role for archives in education, and a programme to modernise public sector archives and develop skills and expertise. DCMS will work with MLA and other partners to take forward the Task Force&#039;s proposals.

<p><a name="40423w11.html_wqn2"><b> Mr. Webb: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions if he will set out his plans for combined pension forecasts; in what sequence different groups will be issued with forecasts and over what timescale; how many forecasts he expects to issue for each group; and if he will make a statement.  [166248]</p>








<p><a name="40423w11.html_spnew2"><b> Malcolm Wicks: </b> 
 The combined pension forecast service gives people a projection of retirement income that brings state pension together with their current private pension. The service is delivered through employers and pension providers.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40423w11.html_para1">
By the end of March, a total of 1.12&nbsp;million Combined Pension Forecasts had been issued. To date over 700 employers and pension providers have expressed an interest in participating in the service. By the end of 2005&#150;06 we aim to have reached 6.3&nbsp;million people.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40423w11.html_para2">
We are not targeting particular groups with the combined pension forecast service. Rather we are encouraging all employers and pension providers to participate, currently on a voluntary basis. Additionally we are seeking reserve powers in the Pensions Bill so that, should the need arise, the provision of combined pension forecasts can be made a statutory requirement of pension schemes.

<p><a name="40423w11.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Pond: </b> 
 No date has been set for The Rent Service to begin publishing details of Local Reference Rents. The Local Housing Allowance for Pathfinder Local Authorities is published on a monthly basis by the participating local authorities, and is available on their websites.

<br>&nbsp;<br><i>23 Apr 2004 : Column 713W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>





<p><a name="40423w12.html_spnew4"><b> Ms Blears: </b> 
 Most of the policies initiated by the Home Office since 1997 have had an impact on the Newcastle East and Wallsend constituency as on other parts of the country. However, it is not possible to gauge the impact of every policy and action the Home Office has initiated since 1997 on a constituency basis and statistical information relating to the constituency is not available for all Home Office policy areas. This answer sets out the information that is available for the constituency itself, or the relevant local authority and police areas for Newcastle East and Wallsend, it is not always possible to provide details back to 1997. The following are examples of initiatives or policies that have had an impact on the constituency, or an area of which the constituency is a part, together with the relevant statistics.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40423w12.html_para3">
<i>Community Safety</i>
</p>


<p>
<a name="40423w12.html_para4">
Newcastle upon Tyne East and Wallsend forms part of the Northumbria police force area. On 31&nbsp;March 1997 the Northumbria police force had 3,677 police officers this figure had risen to 4,048 by 31&nbsp;December 2003, an increase of 371. In addition the Northumbria police force area has been allocated &#163;330,398 to deliver 45 Community Support Officers in 2003&#150;04.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40423w12.html_para5">
&#163;78,413 Basic Command Unit (BCU) funding was available to Newcastle East command in 2003&#150;04 and used to fund police operations, publicity material and technical equipment targeting burglary to homes, vehicle crime and violent crime. Events were held on personal safety, asylum seekers and community crime awareness, and youth diversionary work was also undertaken.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40423w12.html_para6">
In 1993, the total number of recorded crimes in the Northumbria police force area was 192,773. In 2002&#150;03, the total number of recorded crimes was 165,496. This represents a reduction of 27,277 (a percentage decrease of 14&nbsp;per cent.).
</p>


<p>
<a name="40423w12.html_para7">
Recent change in levels of crime at BCU level are difficult to interpret because of the introduction of the National Crime Recording Standard (NCRS) in April 2002 which increased the consistency of crime recording across the country but also inflated the number of crimes recorded by police. Northumbria police estimated that the NCRS had an impact of approximately 25&nbsp;per cent. on total recorded crime from April 2002.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40423w12.html_para8">
Home Office policy and actions since 1997 that contributed to these figures include setting up the Community Safety Partnerships, which are responsible for improving community safety, including quality of life issues such as anti-social behaviour, graffiti and the fear of crime.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40423w12.html_para9">
The Home Office provided &#163;352,073 Building Safer Communities funding in 2003&#150;04 rising to &#163;360,875 in 2004&#150;05 to Newcastle Community Safety Partnership and &#163;204,876 to North Tyneside Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnership (CDRP). Although the majority of this funding is used to benefit the area as a whole, some of the funding was targeted at specific areas, including the East End, for example Byker Street Wardens received &#163;50,000 to create eight warden posts, one supervisor and a manager. Over 1,000 patrols have been completed and 3,629 incidents have been reported. Running costs of &#163;5,000 have been provided for a CCTV 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>23 Apr 2004 : Column 714W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
van operating in Newcastle East. Funding of &#163;10,000 has resulted in increased monitoring of the Nexus CCTV system which serves Byker, Heaton and Wallsend.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40423w12.html_para10">
In addition, &#163;35,000 Small Retailers in Deprived Areas funding was used to improve the security and safety of 18 retail premises in the 10&nbsp;per cent. most deprived wards in Newcastle during 2003&#150;04, and similar funding of &#163;20,000 was made available to North Tyneside.

<p>
<a name="40423w12.html_para11">
<i>Community Development</i>
</p>


<p>
<a name="40423w12.html_para12">
The Home Office has funded the Byker Advice and Information project to assist community development. This project covers the wards of Byker, Dene, Heaton, Monkchester, Sandyford, Walker and Walkergate and is entering its third (and final) year of funding. &#163;25,009 was awarded in year 1, &#163;26,486 in year 2 and &#163;30,998 will be awarded this year. The project aims to assimilate a sustainable recruitment, training and development policy for local volunteers, which should increase their skill base, improve their career prospects and benefit the local community.

<i>Drugs Strategy</i>
</p>


<p>
<a name="40423w12.html_para14">
Drugs information relates to the areas of the Newcastle and North Tyneside Drugs Action Teams (DAT) which between them serve the constituency of Newcastle upon Tyne and Wallsend. The DATs are responsible for local delivery of the National Drug Strategy to a combined population of over 450,000 and until 1999 they operated as a single partnership. They continue to work together closely, with many users North Tyneside being treated at services based in Newcastle, e.g. Plummer Court.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40423w12.html_para15">
Central Government funding for drug strategy delivery has increased steadily in recent years. In 2004&#150;05 Newcastle&#039;s and North Tyneside&#039;s combined budgets for adult treatment will increase by over 7&nbsp;per cent. to over &#163;3.2&nbsp;million and expenditure on young people will exceed &#163;400,000. This investment and other Home Office funded programmes, e.g. Communities Against Drugs has resulted in:

</p>
<ul>

<p class "tabletext">A 64&nbsp;per cent. increase in drug users having structured treatment in Newcastle between 2002&#150;03 and 2003&#150;04 (1,180 users). In 1999&#150;2000 562 Newcastle based clients presented to drug services.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class "tabletext">Approximately 460 drug users resident in North Tyneside were in treatment as at November 2003. In 1999&#150;2000 175 North Tyneside based clients presented to drug services.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class "tabletext">Average waiting times in Newcastle and North Tyneside reduced sharply to two weeks between 2002&#150;03 and 2003&#150;04 (compared to 2.3 weeks across the region). In the same period the waiting time for specialist prescribing in North Tyneside reduced from over three months to two weeks. In 1999&#150;2000, the average waiting time in Newcastle and North Tyneside was about five weeks including 20 weeks for community prescribing in Newcastle.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class "tabletext">A planned 15&nbsp;per cent. increase to over 2,500 in available drug treatment places in Newcastle and North Tyneside in 2004&#150;05.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class "tabletext">Almost 1,400 drug possession offences were committed in Newcastle and North Tyneside in 2002&#150;03. Of these, almost 820 related to Class A drugs.</p>
</ul>
<p>





<br>&nbsp;<br><i>23 Apr 2004 : Column 715W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>
<ul>

<p class "tabletext">A number of high profile police operations in 2003&#150;04 including Operation Trinity which resulted in 34 arrests in East Newcastle and Wallsend and Operation Bobbin in which 1.4&nbsp;million of drugs was seized in Walker.</p>
</ul>
<p>

</p>


<p>
<a name="40423w12.html_para16">
Both DATs will also receive considerable funding from April 2004 to March 2006 to deliver the Criminal Justice Interventions Programme (CJIP, a range of schemes aimed at moving drug misusing offenders into treatment and away from drug use and crime). Newcastle will receive additional CJIP funding, having been selected a site for &quot;intensive&quot; delivery. Implementation of this programme will place considerable pressure on criminal justice and treatment agencies in the City but the GO Drugs Team is encouraged by the DAT&#039;s planning for delivery. The forthcoming intensive CJIP activity in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Newcastle is expected to impact upon crime in neighbouring wards in North Tyneside.

<i>Asylum Seekers</i> 
</p>


<p>
<a name="40423w12.html_para18">
Since 3&nbsp;April 2000 the National Asylum Support Service (NASS) has been responsible for administering the support provided to asylum seekers. Asylum seekers requiring accommodation will normally be housed in dispersal areas across the UK; Newcastle upon Tyne is a dispersal area. The total number of asylum seekers being supported by NASS in Newcastle East and Wallsend as at the end of December 2003 was 595, of these 585 were supported in NASS accommodation and 10 were in receipt of subsistence only support from NASS. These figures include dependants and are rounded to the nearest five. Corresponding data for earlier years is not available.
