To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport if he issued a heritage export licence for a Panzer iv/70 (V) main battle tank during 1998.  [82194]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90429w01.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Alan Howarth: </B> 
 The information given on applications for heritage export licences is commercially sensitive and is given in confidence. The Government cannot, therefore, reveal details about objects which are the subject of applications. We are advised that it would also be an unwarranted invasion of privacy contrary to Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90429w01.htm_wqn1"><B> Mr. Norman: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what <i>(a)</i> regulations and <i>(b)</i> guidelines he has issued relating to the export of military equipment which is over 50 years old.  [82172]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90429w01.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Alan Howarth: </B> 
 An individual export licence is required on heritage grounds from my Department for firearms between 50 and 100 years old if valued at or above &#163;39,600. All other arms and armour over 50 years of age and firearms more than 100 years old require an individual export licence on heritage grounds if valued at or above &#163;20,000. In addition, the export of any goods covered by Part III of Schedule 1 to the Export of Goods (Control) Order 1994, the so called military list, requires an export licence from the Department of Trade and Industry regardless of monetary value or age.
<P>

<a name="90429w01.htm_para0">The booklet, "Export Licensing for Culture Goods: Procedures and Guidance for Exporters of Works of Art and other Cultural Goods", which is issued by my Department, sets out the export licensing requirements on heritage grounds.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what is his assessment of the effect of recent changes to advance corporation tax on the tourism industry.  [81803]

<a name="90429w01.htm_spnew2"><B> Janet Anderson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 28 April 1999]:</i> We have made no specific assessment of the effect on the tourism industry of the recent changes to advance corporation tax.
<P>

<a name="90429w01.htm_para1">The abolition of advance corporation tax from 6 April 1999, together with other recent changes in corporation tax, is aimed at stimulating greater high-quality long-term investment and will increase the attraction of the UK as a location for international companies. The removal of advance corporation tax, which gives all small to medium companies that pay dividends a significant cash-flow advantage, should benefit some of the many small firms which make up the tourism industry.
<P>

<a name="90429w01.htm_para2">As we outlined in our recent strategy, "Tomorrow's Tourism", we are committed to creating the right economic climate for enterprise and investment for the whole of the UK economy as well as the tourism industry; these corporation tax changes contribute to our central economic objective of promoting economic stability as a platform for long-term sustainable growth.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90429w01.htm_wqn3"><B> Mrs. Anne Campbell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will list for shire counties <i>(a)</i> the education service-block Standard Spending Assessment for each county, divided by the total number of full-time-equivalent pupils financed by that county, <i>(b)</i> the primary education service-sub-block Standard Spending Assessment for each county, divided by the number of primary pupils financed by that county and <i>(c)</i> the secondary education service-sub-block Standard Spending Assessment for each county, divided by the number of secondary pupils financed by that county.  [82206]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90429w01.htm_spnew3"><B> Ms Armstrong: </B> 
 Data are not collected on the total number of full-time-equivalent pupils financed by a county.
<P>

<a name="90429w01.htm_para3">The calculations in the table for <i>(b)</i> and <i>(c)</i> have divided the Standard Spending Assessment by the estimated number of resident pupils (as defined in the Local Government Finance Report) for primary (aged 5 to 10) and secondary (aged 11 to 15) pupils respectively. Equivalent data for resident nursery (aged 3 to 4) pupils and resident pupils aged 16 and over do not exist; it is not therefore possible to provide data for <i>(a)</i>.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90429w02.htm_spnew4"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 Changes to the compensation arrangements linked to average punctuality would be a matter for negotiation between Opraf and the train operating companies. Opraf's remit is to ensure that the standards set out in the Passenger's Charters are being met. Opraf cannot unilaterally require improvements. The moving annual average is still seen as a reasonably fair way of compensating season ticket holders for poor performance and there are no current plans to change it.

<P>
<a name="90429w03.htm_spnew1"><B> Mrs. Liddell </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 26 April 1999]:</i> In the financial year 1998-99, the Scottish Office provided &#163;6.5 million directly to seven grant-aided special schools in Scotland, and &#163;1.2 million to support training of local authority staff working in special needs. It is not possible to express this in capita terms. Expenditure per pupil in local authority schools is the responsibility of each education authority. Local authority expenditure is supported by Aggregate External Finance. Such support is not specific to particular local authority services and it is for each authority to determine the allocation of all resources at its disposal.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90429w03.htm_spnew3"><B> Mrs. Liddell </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 26 April 1999]:</i> Direct expenditure by the Scottish Office on the education of school pupils is limited to grants made available to Jordanhill School, two self-governing schools, and certain residential special schools. Grants are also made available for pupils at certain independent schools under the Assisted Places Scheme. Comprehensive information on the division of these resources between the primary and secondary sectors is not available. Expenditure per pupil in education authority schools is the responsibility of each education authority. Local authority expenditure is supported by Aggregate External Finance. Such support is not specific to particular local authority services and it is for each authority to determine the allocation of all resources at its disposal.
<P>

<a name="90429w03.htm_para2">The average central Government funding, in the form of grant to further education colleges in Scotland, per full-time equivalent student in financial year 1996-97 (the latest year for which final student data are available) was &#163;3,418.
<P>

<a name="90429w03.htm_para3">Information is not held in the format requested for university students. However, based on the allocation to higher education institutions, including universities, made by the Scottish Higher Education Funding Council in 1998-99, the main source of central Government funding, an estimate of spend per full-time equivalent student is &#163;5,465. This does not include additional central Government money which individual institutions may access through a variety of programmes nor spending on the maintenance element of student support.

<P>
<a name="90429w03.htm_wqn4"><B> Mr. Wallace: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland (1) what estimate he has made of the cost of increasing the grant for pre-school education to cover four year old pupils whose parents wish to defer entry to primary school; and if he will make a statement;  [81745]
<P>
<UL>(2) if he will list those local education authorities which are funding the pre-school education of four year old children whose parents have deferred entry to primary school until after the child's fifth birthday.  [81746]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90429w03.htm_spnew4"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 We believe that decisions on whether a child should have their entry to school deferred should be taken locally in consultation with the education authority so that the maturity and preparedness for school of each child can be taken into account on an individual basis. Anecdotal evidence suggests that around 5% of children have their entry to primary school deferred each year. The cost of financing these places through the pre-school education grant would be around &#163;3.5m each year.
<P>

<a name="90429w03.htm_para4">We understand that all local authorities fund a number of children who have had their entry to primary school deferred.
<P>

<a name="90429w03.htm_para5">As from 1 July 1999, this will be a matter for the Scottish Parliament.

 It is for school admission authorities to fix admission limits for their schools. Where parental demand cannot be satisfied it is for the LEA or, in some cases the governing body, to consider whether to bring forward proposals to expand the school. In considering such proposals, the Secretary of State currently and, from 1 September 1999, the School Organisation Committee, will have regard, among other things, to parental preferences.

 For the 1998-99 academic year, parents with a residual parental income of less than &#163;16,945 after allowable deductions are not assessed as due to make any payment towards the &#163;1,000 tuition fee contribution. Thereafter, the level of the payment they are asked to make rises in line with their residual income. Parents are assessed as due to make the full contribution if they have a residual income of just over &#163;27,000. The threshold levels have been increased in line with inflation for the 1999-2000 academic year. We estimate that around 30 per cent. of students, where parental income is taken into account, will continue to make no contribution towards the cost of their tuition. A further third will pay less than the full contribution.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what assessment he has made of the advantages and disadvantages of requiring applicants who want to make complaints to the Parliamentary Ombudsman under the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information to ask an hon.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90429w07.htm_spnew6"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 The White Paper, "Your Right to Know", included an assessment of the arrangements for complaints to the Parliamentary Ombudsman under the "Code of Practice on Access to Government Information" and concluded that successive Ombudsmen had proved effective in policing the Code<i>.</i> The White Paper also stated that, as part of our proposals for a Freedom of Information Act, the Government favoured a mechanism which is readily available and freely accessible. The draft Freedom of Information Bill, which I hope to publish shortly for consultation and pre-legislative scrutiny, is likely to propose a procedure which will allow a complainant to access the Information Commissioner directly, rather than through an hon. Member.

<a name="90429w07.htm_spnew7"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 Improving offenders' employability and access to the job market is a priority for the probation service for 1999-2000. Probation services are actively involved in the delivery of Welfare to Work programmes, and developing strategies for generating employment, training and education opportunities for offenders, with a particular emphasis on literacy and basic skills provision. Over &#163;3.1 million was spent by probation services in 1997-1998 in partnership with the voluntary sector on the provision of employment, training and education services for offenders.
<P>

<a name="90429w07.htm_para4">Much work has already been done and is continuing to be done to assist offenders in gaining the skills and qualifications necessary to help them in their search for work. Funding has also been made available to probation services under the Crime Reduction programme to develop screening and tutoring programmes to improve the basic skills of offenders. The projects will pilot and evaluate new approaches with the aim of putting the most successful approaches into practice across the country.

<P>
<a name="90429w08.htm_wqn0"><B> Mr. Beith: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many offenders serving custodial sentences have taken part in the New Deal scheme through the Prison Service; how many offenders completed the scheme and obtained employment following participation in the scheme; and if he will make a statement.  [82455]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90429w08.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 Offenders are not eligible for the New Deal while serving custodial sentences, but they can take part in the Prison Service's Welfare to Work programme for 18-24 year olds running in selected prison establishments. This aims to improve their employability and help them gain the most from the New Deal Gateway, to which they have immediate access on release.
<P>

<a name="90429w08.htm_para0">In the 12 months from April 1998, 2,430 inmates joined the Prison Service programme in the 11 establishments piloting it, and 1,625 had completed it by the end of that period. Early results from an evaluation of the programme indicate that within 6 months of leaving prison, 28 per cent. of those who complete the programme go on to join the New Deal Gateway, compared with 11 per cent. of a control group. A survey of probation officers also indicates that 42 per cent. of programme completers have some employment and 6 per cent. go into education or non-New Deal training within four months of release. These percentages are similar to the control group.
<P>

<a name="90429w08.htm_para1">The programme is now continuing into its second year and the number of establishments has been increased to 13.

<a name="90429w08.htm_wqn2"><B> Mr. Dalyell: </B> 
To ask the Prime Minister what assessment he has made of the extent of collateral damage caused by NATO forces in Yugoslavia and of the percentage of bombs and missiles which miss their targets.  [80616]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90429w08.htm_spmin1"><B>The Prime Minister:</B> 
 We both assess the risk of collateral damage in advance of UK airstrikes and monitor the results afterwards on a case by case basis. Our pilots train intensively to ensure the greatest possible accuracy in bombing attacks and NATO as a whole has made every attempt to reduce the risk of collateral damage. The cases of injury and death among civilians which have nevertheless occurred have been acknowledged by NATO and are deeply regretted. But the accidental civilian casualties caused--despite these stringent precautions--by NATO bombing, contrast sharply with the deliberate and calculated slaughter of Kosovar civilians instigated by Milosevic in pursuit of ethnic cleansing.
<P>

<a name="90429w08.htm_para3">Under the terms of paragraph 1a of the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information, I am not prepared to release data on the percentage of bombs and missiles which miss their target. It would be wrong to assume that bombs and missiles which miss their target necessarily cause collateral damage.

 General Assembly Resolution 377(V) provides for the General Assembly, in certain circumstances, to make appropriate recommendations for collective measures for the maintenance of international peace and security. Details on the Resolution (known as the Uniting for Peace Resolution) are available in the Library of the House.

<a name="90429w08.htm_spmin3"><B>The Prime Minister:</B> 
 Under international law a limited use of force can be justifiable in support purposes laid down by the Security Council but without the Council's express authorisation when that is the only means to avert an immediate and overwhelming humanitarian catastrophe. Any such case would in the nature of things be exceptional and would depend on an objective assessment of the factual circumstances at the time and on the terms of relevant decisions of the Security Council bearing on the situation in question.

To ask the Minister of State, Lord Chancellor's Department if he will make a statement on his Department's policy on <i>(a)</i> the reform of the law relating to the mistake of law rule at common law and <i>(b)</i> the Law Commission report (1994 No.227) entitled "Restitution: Mistakes of Law, Ultra Vires Public Authority Receipts and Payments".

<P>
<P>
<a name="90429w08.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The House of Lords decision in Kleinwort Benson Ltd. <i>v.</i> Lincoln City Council last October means that it is no longer necessary to bring forward legislation to implement the first part of the Law Commission report No. 227 on "Restitution: Mistakes of Law, Ultra Vires Public Authority Receipts and Payments", which dealt with the common law aspects of mistake of law.

<a name="90429w08.htm_para4">Part 2 of the report proposed changes to the law to ensure that citizens had effective remedies in circumstances where tax was paid but not due. However, developments since the report was published, including the procedures associated with self-assessment of tax liabilities, have created an acceptable balance of rights and responsibilities between the taxpayer and the state. Therefore, the Government have concluded that it is no longer necessary to implement Part 2 of the report.

<a name="90429w09.htm_para4">We take the matter of illegal fishing in the Falkland Islands seriously and it is our shared objective with the Falkland Islands Government to combat the problem. Illegal fishing has the potential to undermine the Falklands economy and attempts to conserve fish stocks. Recently, there have been up to an estimated 50 unlicensed vessels in Falklands waters and we assume that all were engaged in illegal fishing activities. The number of vessels now appears to be declining.

<a name="90429w09.htm_para5">In January this year, we authorised the arming of a Fisheries Protection Vessel (FPV) with a 20mm Oerlikon cannon, which is the best weapon for the task of deterring illegal fishing and dealing with it, if necessary. The Falkland Islands Government (FIG) is responsible for the procurement and shipment of the cannon. This process has taken longer than anticipated. We have tried to help FIG speed up the shipment of the consignment but it cannot be carried on a passenger aircraft together with the ammunition needed. Accordingly, the Ministry of Defence has agreed to fly the cannon out on the next freight flight on 6 May.
<P>

<a name="90429w09.htm_para6">FIG requested approval for temporary use of a smaller, 0.50 inch, machine gun on an FPV, as an interim measure. This request was carefully considered and a decision was made not to give approval. The machine gun is not a good visible deterrent and there are concerns that warning shots, which the FPV would be required to fire to alert a suspected unlicensed vessel, would not be seen or heard.
<P>

<a name="90429w09.htm_para7">As a temporary measure, the Ministry of Defence has agreed to our request for one of the Royal Navy vessels stationed in the Falklands to accompany an FPV on its patrols.

We shall continue to urge the Taiwanese authorities to bring their fleet under control.

 The unit referred to, more properly known as the 457 Heavy Air Defence Regiment Royal Artillery (TA), was based at Portsmouth with one battery at Gosport. It was disbanded on 1 April 1967--almost a year before the Aer Lingus Viscount crashed into the Irish Sea. The establishments listed played no part in the events of that day. It is therefore extremely unlikely that the employees at those establishments or any other MOD employee would have any information concerning the causes of the crash. Nevertheless, I can repeat the assurances already given by my officials to the Irish authorities that if any MOD employee, military or civilian, had any information which could help determine the causes of the crash, there would be no inhibition or restriction whatsoever as to its disclosure to the Irish Accident Investigation Officials.

 We have received no specific proposals for the movement of refugees from Macedonia to Albania. It is normal practice for refugees to be cared for in the first country in which they seek safety. Any movement to third countries should be entirely voluntary--we have made clear our concern to the Macedonian Government about the way in which people were initially dispatched to other countries, including Albania, without their consent. It must also take into account the hosting capacity of the receiving country--Albania has already received over 350,000 refugees from Kosovo, and facilities there are stretched.

The Haemophilia Society assesses that more than ninety patients have died. We do not have information on the number of people with chronic liver disease or other significant health problems, but all identified cases of hepatitis C infection through blood or blood products are referred to a specialist for further assessment, and drug therapy as appropriate. We believe that 6 or 7 people with haemophilia are on the United Kingdom Transplant Support Service Authority's list of people awaiting liver transplants.

<P>
<a name="90429w11.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The investing in dentistry scheme was announced in September 1997 and up to &#163;9 million was made available to meet expenditure in that financial year, 1997-98. Grants to the value of &#163;3,836,408 had been approved by the end of March 1998, although by that point grant payments dispensed, and the estimated cost of the additional treatment fees generated by the extra patients registered, had together totalled about &#163;175,000. This is because there is often a period of several months after the approval stage before the additional staff or facilities are in place to receive patients, when the grant becomes payable. Under the current annuality conventions, any money which has been voted by Parliament for a particular year, but which is not needed to meet expenditure chargeable to that year, cannot be carried forward into the next financial year. However, in 1998-99, a further &#163;10 million was made available for the investing in dentistry scheme.

<a name="90429w11.htm_wqn3"><B> Mr. Maclean: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health (1) what was the average survival age for sufferers of cystic fibrosis in <i>(a)</i> 1998, <i>(b)</i> 1988 and <i>(c)</i> 1978;  [81753]

<UL>(2) if he will estimate the number of cystic fibrosis sufferers who reached their 18 birthday in <i>(a)</i> 1970 and <i>(b)</i> 1998.  [81752]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90429w11.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The information is not available in the form requested. The United Kingdom Cystic Fibrosis Survey can provide survival data based on three year cohorts. According to the Survey's current data (which include 1997 data for deaths from the Office for National Statistics) of people with cystic fibrosis born in the three year period 1986-88, 93 per cent. survived to age 12; of those born in 1977-79, 63 per cent. survived to age 21; of those born in 1968-70, the median survival was 16 years 8 months and 47 per cent. survived to age 18. For the 1986-88 cohort, 90 per cent. might be expected to survive to age 18. Recent trends for children indicate that the upper limit of survival to age 18 might be about 95 per cent.
<P>

<a name="90429w11.htm_para2">444 people with cystic fibrosis were aged 18 or more at the start of 1978 and 94 reached their 18 birthday in that year; 2,357 people with cystic fibrosis were aged 18 or more at the start of 1997 and 216 reached their 18 birthday in that year. Equivalent figures for the years before 1978 are not available and nor yet are those for 1998.
<P>

<a name="90429w11.htm_para3">A summary of information from the Survey up to 1997 is available from the Cystic Fibrosis Trust. Copies are available in the Library.

<a name="90429w12.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 Welsh has been specified as essential for posts in the translation service and in the editorial team for the record of Assembly business. Jobs for which Welsh is essential are carefully considered before reaching that conclusion and have attracted a choice of candidates. Posts for which Welsh is desirable or an advantage have been well subscribed by both English and Welsh speakers and also those speaking other modern World languages. An example is the recent Middle Managers recruitment scheme for which Welsh was identified as desirable and which generated over 1,000 applications for a possible 20 posts, the majority from English speakers.
<P>

<a name="90429w12.htm_para0">Welsh has been described as an advantage for a number of other posts. For posts where Welsh is advertised as desirable or an advantage, it could be used as a deciding factor only where two candidates were equally good in all other respects. There are no posts for which a knowledge of Welsh is undesirable.

<a name="90429w12.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 Local education authorities have a statutory duty to ensure pupils of statutory school age receive education suitable to their age, ability or aptitude, including pupils of above average ability. This will usually be in a mainstream school. The National Curriculum provides for children of all abilities, including those who are gifted. The Education Act 1996 gives LEAs discretion to arrange for the withdrawal of a pupil from primary school for the purpose of receiving secondary education once a child has reached the age of 10 years and 6 months.
<P>

<a name="90429w12.htm_para2">Our priority is to improve standards of educational attainment for all children in Wales. The Welsh Office Education White Paper "Building Excellent Schools Together", published in July 1997, recognised the need for schools to stretch gifted pupils to achieve their full potential.

 The Treasury Solicitor's Department, acting on behalf of the Welsh Office, predominantly use junior counsel when it is necessary to instruct counsel to provide legal advice or to conduct legal proceedings.
<P>

<a name="90429w12.htm_para4">In civil cases, the two First Treasury Counsel are both junior counsel and they will advise and represent the Government without a Queen's Counsel in many of their important cases. In addition, the Attorney-General maintains four panels of junior Counsel whom Departments are expected to use for the majority of the Government's civil litigation. The Attorney-General's approval, or that of the Solicitor-General, is required before a Queen's Counsel can be instructed to appear for any Government Department in civil litigation.
<P>

<a name="90429w12.htm_para5">In determining the level of counsel to use, the Department considers the individual circumstances of each case. Amongst other things it takes into account, inter alia, the importance and sensitivity of the case, the complexity of the law, the weight and complexity of the evidence, and the degree of experience and expertise required before deciding whether to instruct Queen's Counsel or junior counsel.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>As Director of the Office for National Statistics (ONS), I have been asked to answer your recent question on how many deaths have been reported from sudden death syndrome for the under 25 year-olds in each of the last five years. The information requested is shown in the table below.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Death certificates do not usually say whether a death was sudden or not, and 'sudden death syndrome' is not a term that is used much in this country. When one of these terms is used, the death is assigned an underlying cause of death of 'sudden death, cause unknown', (International Classification of Diseases Ninth Revision code 798).</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>However, all deaths that are sudden and unexpected must be referred to a coroner for investigation. Usually a post mortem examination by a pathologist identifies a previously unsuspected disease that caused the death. The table shows the number of deaths at ages one to 24 from heart disease, stroke, and epilepsy which were certified by coroners. This should include all sudden deaths from these diseases, but will also include deaths that were referred to the coroner for other reasons. The table also gives the number of deaths for which no cause could be found by post mortem or inquest but which were not actually stated to have been 'sudden'.</FONT></UL>

 Under Article 53 of the United Nations (UN) Charter, enforcement action under regional arrangements described in Article 52 requires Security Council authorisation.

To ask the President of the Council, pursuant to her answer of 18 March 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>711</i>, on special advisers, if she will give the total travel cost of each occasion when <i>(a)</i> departmental and <i>(b)</i> non-departmental advisers travelled abroad in an official capacity since 2 May 1997 and the place visited.

 In the period from 2 May 1997 to 31 March 1999 Special Advisers in my Department travelled overseas in an official capacity on one occasion, to France, Belgium and the Netherlands. The total cost of travel and hotel accommodation was &#163;463.07. All travel complied with the requirements of the <i>Ministerial Code</i> and the <i>Civil Service Management Code</i>.

<P>
<a name="90429w16.htm_spnew2"><B> Mrs. Beckett: </B> 
 The additional costs incurred were mainly for catering staff overtime, and some minimal costs for committee staff and security. It is not possible to identify the specific additional cost of running this committee to public funds because it is not the House's practice to analyse day to day running costs.
