 All industries face the same challenges and opportunities from the climate change levy. All revenue from the levy is recycled back to business through reductions to employer national insurance contributions (NICs) and support for energy efficiency.

 The UK is already providing 100 per cent. debt relief to Ethiopia. As a Highly Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) Ethiopia is eligible for debt relief under the enhanced HIPC initiative. In November 2001 Ethiopia reached Decision Point under the initiative and qualified for interim debt relief on payments due. For its part the UK goes further than is required under the terms of the HIPC initiative and always provides 100 per cent. debt relief. The UK Government are working with other donors, the World bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to help Ethiopia reach Completion Point under the HIPC initiative.
<P>

<a name="21126w02.html_para14">At that point debt will be irrevocably cancelled. To reach Completion Point Ethiopia will need to have demonstrated a clear commitment to poverty reduction, and show how its country-owned poverty reduction strategies will be able to use the resources released by debt relief to reduce poverty. The IMF and World bank estimate that Ethiopia could reach Completion Point as early as July 2003.

<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>As National Statistician and Registrar General for England and Wales I have been asked to reply to your recent question to the Chancellor of the Exchequer asking if he will institute an inquiry into the accuracy of <i>(a)</i> the 2001 Census population figures and <i>(b)</i> the 2001 mid-year estimate population figures. (82946)</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I am confident that the 2001 Census figures provide the most accurate estimate of the 2001 population, both nationally and locally. The 2001 Census results are the first to represent the entire population. This was achieved through a new strategy known as the 'One Number Census'. One of the key elements was an independent follow-up survey&#151;the Census Coverage Survey (CCS), which involved an intensive face-to-face survey of a sample of over 16,000 postcodes containing 320,000 households covering every local authority in England and Wales. By combining the results of the Census and the CCS, it was possible to estimate the total resident population in 2001&#151; the 'one number'&#151;to a high

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Thus in 2001, the Census results represent 100 per cent of the population. Census response, that is the proportion of people returning a form in England and Wales, was 94 per cent. The 6 per cent of people estimated to have been missed by the Census have been added to the counts using a statistical process that was subject to extensive consultation, and based on the results of the CCS.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In addition, the 2001 Census has undergone rigorous testing and quality checking throughout both the fieldwork and processing. Census tests were carried out in 1997 and 1999 and a survey designed to measure the accuracy of response to each question has been completed. Furthermore, a comprehensive set of verification and validation checks were built in to the processing of the data, and data quality played a key role in all aspects of processing the forms. All information on accuracy will be contained in a Census Quality report to be published in 2003.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The population base for the 2001 Census was defined so as to be entirely consistent with that used in the calculation of the mid-year estimates, and the 2001 Census figures will form the basis of the mid-year population estimates throughout the next decade. Thus, the 2001 mid-year estimate was calculated by adjusting the census figures to take account of births and deaths and an estimate of the net migration in the interval between Census day (29 April) and the 30 June.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>However, in the light of the evidence, shown by the 2001 Census figures, that the previous (pre-2001) mid-year estimate series had been over-estimating the size of the population and growth in the population over the last few years, the Office for National Statistics will be conducting an assessment of accuracy of the mid-year population estimates that is aimed at learning lessons from the 2001 Census results and making improvements to the method and data sources used to produce mid-year estimates in the future. The results of this assessment are due to be published on the National Statistics website in February 2003. A National Statistics Quality Review on international migration is also currently underway.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Some local authorities have experienced an unexpectedly large shift between their population estimates for mid 2001, and the Census values. We are working with several of these to examine our explanation of the differences.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>For the above reasons, I therefore do not feel it necessary to instigate any further inquiry into the accuracy of the 2001 Census and 2001 mid-year estimate figures.</FONT></UL>

 The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council is the court of final appeal for 16 independent Commonwealth countries. When hearing appeals the Judicial Committee applies the law of the country from which the appeal comes. Most of the countries concerned retain the death penalty for certain offences and some cases that come before the Judicial Committee are appeals against conviction and/or sentence in capital cases. Over the years the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council has played an important part in developing constitutional safeguards in relation to the imposition and execution of the death penalty in these countries and in helping to uphold the integrity of the criminal process.

<P>
<a name="21126w07.html_spnew1"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The Future Aircraft Carrier (CVF) programme is currently in the Assessment Phase, Stage 2 of which ended on 20 November. The procurement strategy for CVF does not rely on a 'bid' process, rather the two candidate prime contractors (BAE Systems and Thales) have been assessed on a continuous basis over the last three years. It is this continuous assessment that will form the basis of our forthcoming selection of preferred prime contractor. In terms of jobs, it is still too early to be definitive as to the numbers that will be involved but early indications suggest that the CVF programme could sustain and create some 10,000 jobs across the United Kingdom during the design and manufacture of the carriers; this would be true irrespective of which of the two candidate primes is eventually selected.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how nuclear waste was transported <i>(a)</i> within the former Chatham dockyard and <i>(b)</i> externally; and how it was identified.  [82525]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21126w07.html_spnew7"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 Within the dockyard, radioactive waste was moved in suitable containers, and under the supervision of an authorised person, in accordance with the Factories Act 1955 and the national regulations on ionising radiations that were in force at the time. Arrangements for the transportation of low-level waste took account of the route over which the waste had to be moved, and the nature of the waste itself. Waste was routinely moved from the Nuclear Complex to the Solid Waste Disposal Facility, a distance of about one mile, by motor vehicle. Within the Solid Waste Disposal Facility, waste containers were moved by fork-lift truck, although some very low-level wastes were moved over short distances by a hand-operated electrical lifting vehicle, where this was judged to be safe. Large items of intermediate level waste were usually transported within the dockyard under a police escort.
<P>

<a name="21126w07.html_para3">Very low-level waste for disposal by the local authority, and low-level wastes for delivery to the National Disposal Service at Harwell and to the national repository at Drigg, were usually transported by road vehicle, although on occasions waste was transported by rail. All transport of radioactive materials on the public highway or by rail was in accordance with the International Atomic Energy Agency's Regulations for the Safe Transport of Radioactive Materials.

 Prior to first starting work involving radiation, all radiation workers, whether classified or unclassified, received a lecture on the hazards and standard procedures for radiation protection. They were also given a personal copy of a booklet on radiation protection, which reiterated the content of the lecture. In addition, classified workers were given specific instruction appropriate to the nature of their work.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21126w07.html_spnew9"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 Solid radioactive waste was stored in the purpose-built Solid Waste Disposal Complex at the eastern end of Chatham dockyard. Other industrial buildings within the dockyard were also used as radioactive waste stores, as and when necessary. These buildings were monitored for radioactive contamination after use and, where necessary, decontaminated. Solid radioactive waste was stored in accordance with the Factories Act 1955, national ionising radiation regulations and Royal Naval instructions for radiological protection that were in force at the time. The arrangements were subject to inspection by the Factory Inspectorate.
<P>

<a name="21126w07.html_para5">Liquid nuclear waste was disposed of directly to the effluent treatment plant (ETP) in the nuclear complex, or transferred via liquid effluent tanks to the ETP.

<a name="21126w09.html_para6">There is no single reason why individuals decide to leave the services and reasons are not necessarily the same across all three services, but some common reasons can be gleaned. These are as follows:

<BR>
Current and future job satisfaction;
<BR>
Wish to take up another career;
<BR>
Better employment opportunities outside;
<BR>
Family stability;
<BR>
Promotion prospects;
<BR>
Separation from family.

<P>

<a name="21126w09.html_para7">For the Naval Service from the Ratings Notice Giving Survey 2001&#150;02, the following are the most common reasons listed in order of importance as to why people leave the service:
The desire to live at home;
Wish to take up another career;
To marry/raise a family;
Ability to plan long term;
Time spent on mundane tasks;
Level of job satisfaction experienced;
Extent of family disruption;
Pay in general;
Always intended to leave after a number of years.
The Army routinely carries out a survey of leavers. The six most frequently cited reasons for leaving the Army given by leavers are identified below.

Staying longer will make it more difficult to start a new career;

<a name="21126w09.html_para8">For the RAF, the Command Scientific Support Branch (CSSB) compiles an annual leavers survey that examines why airmen, airwomen and airmen aircrew are leaving the service. They also administer a questionnaire to all officers who have actively decided to leave the RAF, either at an option point or on PVR terms. The findings from the 2000&#150;01 administration show that there is no single prevailing reason for leaving the RAF. However, the main reasons (which are similar across all branches and trades) are as follows.
For officers the five most important individual items from the questionnaire were:

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what costs were incurred as a result of his ministerial direction regarding the Strategic Sealift programme.  [82567]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21126w10.html_spnew4"><B> Dr. Moonie </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 25 November 2002]:</i> No net costs resulted from the ministerial direction. There were some associated management and legal charges, which would not otherwise have been incurred, offset by savings in the terms of the service contract. The shipbuilding contracts themselves had already been negotiated by the service provider and the Ministry of Defence assumed responsibility for contract payments. These will be recovered from the service provider when the ships are completed.

<a name="21126w10.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. McNamara: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what the result was of his recent review of the definition of a self-inflicted death; what actions he has taken in consequence; and what steps have been taken to compare the rate of suicides in each of Her Majesty's armed forces with information available from the Office for National Statistics from samples of the civilian population and appropriate comparator groups.  [80686]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21126w10.html_spnew5"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The review of the statistical classification of deaths in the armed forces is still underway. Whilst this is going on, the category of Xself inflicted deaths", which had been the basis of some Parliamentary Questions and some official statistics, will not be used. This category had included coroner confirmed suicides and open verdicts, broadly in line with the Office for National Statistics definition of suicide, but coroners' verdicts of accidental death and death by misadventure, together with unknown and outstanding verdicts, were also included. This wider Xself inflicted" category was often misinterpreted as meaning suicide. One of the aims of the review is to remove such confusion by putting the definitions on the same footing as the Office for National Statistics (ONS) use. This will allow more meaningful comparison between military and civilian populations. Furthermore, in answering future questions specifically about the number of suicides, both coroner confirmed suicides and open verdicts will be shown. The Defence Analytical Services Agency are liaising with colleagues in the ONS, and intend to publish an analysis of trends and method of suicides among the armed forces compared to civilians in the first part of 2003.

<P>
<a name="21126w11.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Gibb: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what his estimate is of the total Government subsidy of the UK arms industry in the last year for which figures are available.  [81779]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21126w11.html_spnew0"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 As set out in our recent defence industrial policy, our aim is to ensure that our industry is competitive in both the home and overseas markets. This is best achieved through exposure to fair and open competition and it is not our policy to use subsidies, although some limited support, such as the Export Credit Guarantee scheme, is available to the defence industry.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence when British forces will be able to deploy weaponised unmanned aerial vehicles; and if he will make a statement.  [82213]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21126w11.html_spnew1"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 We currently have no plans to deploy weaponised unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). However, we are conscious of the need to exploit the significant potential offered by UAVs. The Joint UAV Experimentation Programme (JUEP) announced earlier this year as part of SDR New Chapter will therefore look at the operational utility of UAVs in a wide range of areas including the potential for weaponisation.

<a name="21126w11.html_para0">Corporate parenting refers to the parenting role that councils and therefore councillors take on when they look after a child or young person. Corporate parenting represents the amalgam of functions vested in councils with social services responsibilities by the relevant sections of Part IV of the Children Act 1989. The role does not apply only to the social services department but to the council as a whole on a corporate basis.
<P>

<a name="21126w11.html_para1">The then Secretary of State for Health, my right hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St. Pancras (Frank Dobson), used the term when he wrote to all councillors at the launch of the Quality Protects programme in 1998. He said:

Part of the funding, &pound;1.3 million in 2002&#150;03 was set aside to extend the drug, alcohol and tobacco education training package, which aims to support teachers in planning, delivering and monitoring effective drug education by learning from and with other teachers, through teacher observations and collaborative enquiry supported by teaching networks.

<a name="21126w11.html_para2">As drug education features within the National Curriculum Science Order, all initial teacher training courses for those preparing to teach science should address the appropriate aspects of drug, alcohol and tobacco education relating to each key stage. Through initial training newly qualified teachers acquire: an understanding of PSHE and Citizenship, through which drug education is usually delivered; working knowledge of their pastoral responsibilities as teachers; and a readiness to promote the well-being of pupils.

 In January 2001, we jointly commissioned research with the Coalfield Communities Campaign that looked into patterns of educational achievement in the coalfields. Evidence showed that coalfield areas are benefiting from the literacy and numeracy strategies at primary level, but attainment declines by Key Stage 3 level (11&#150;14 years olds) and is well below the national average by GCSE stage. The research also showed, however, that there is no particular 'coalfield effect' and that similar problems occurred in other comparable areas that had experienced industrial economic decline. The full research report is available on the Department's internet site (DfES research report 314) and in the House of Commons Library.

We do know that the World Food Programme (WFP) has sent 45 metric tonnes of food to Northern Bangui and that nine tonnes of this has been distributed in the area directly to the north of the capital, to those

 We are not providing any direct support to improve the transport infrastructure in Eritrea. The European Commission agreed a Country Strategy Paper with the Government of Eritrea on 15 November. This provides for support to the transport sector, including support for roads under the short-term rehabilitation programme and preparation of the transport sector study. Previous EC assistance included the rehabilitation of the Massawa-Asmara road. In addition the World bank is providing support under its emergency reconstruction project for transportation, including roads. With the Italian Government, they are also supporting a ports rehabilitation project.

<P>
<P>

 We have made a pledge to tackle age discrimination and we are committed to introducing age legislation covering employment, vocational training and guidance by 2006.
<P>

<a name="21126w15.html_para4">We are already encouraging employers to adopt non-ageist employment practices through our Age Positive Campaign. The campaign raises employers' awareness of the business benefits of an age diverse work force and encourages a flexible approach to retirement to open up choice and opportunity for individuals to stay in work longer.
<P>

<a name="21126w15.html_para5">In 1999 we published the Code of Practice on Age Diversity in Employment which sets out the standards for non-ageist approaches to recruitment, training, promotion, redundancy and retirement. The code was developed with leading organisations including the CBI, TUG, the Employers Forum on Age and Age Concern. Evaluation shows that from 1999 to 2001 the number of companies using age in recruitment had already fallen from 27 per cent. to 13 per cent. and the number of companies having a policy against employing older workers had dropped from 14 per cent. to 7 per cent.
<P>

<a name="21126w15.html_para6">Older workers have a wealth of skills and experience that can benefit individual businesses and the economy as a whole. Our policies will help to improve further the employment rate of people over 50, which has risen considerably since 1997.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what the evidential basis was for his decision not to increase the earnings disregards for jobseeker's allowance; when this disregard was last increased; and what it would be worth if it had been uprated.  [83242]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21126w16.html_spnew3"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 Our policies are giving everybody who can work the opportunity to do so, and providing security for those who are unable to work. We have introduced the national minimum wage, working families tax credit and, from April 2003, the new tax credits to ensure that people are better off in work than on benefits.
<P>

<a name="21126w16.html_para2">Any decision on increasing the earnings disregard for jobseeker's allowance is a question of fine judgment. We need to balance the benefits of encouraging people into part-time work and maintaining contact with the labour market, against any possible disincentives to full-time work. If the earnings disregard is set too high, then the gap between in-work income and out-of-work benefits becomes so narrow as to discourage people from taking up full-time work.
<P>

<a name="21126w16.html_para3">We keep the earnings disregard under review, but there is no set mechanism or formula for increasing it. There is, therefore, no basis on which to calculate an uprated value. We have, however, targeted extra help where it is most needed. For example, for lone parents and certain disabled people the earnings disregard was increased from &pound;15 to &pound;20 from April 2001.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21126w16.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. McCartney: </B> 
 The number of winter fuel payments issued is less than the total population aged 60 and over because, although most people aged 60 and over who normally live in Great Britain in the qualifying week are entitled to a winter fuel payment, there are some exceptions. These are people who, in the qualifying week, have been in hospital for more than 52 weeks; or have been in residential care for more than 13 weeks and receive income support or income-based jobseeker's allowance; or are in custody under sentence. Also, people subject to immigration control who are not eligible for help from the Department for Work and Pensions are not entitled to a payment.

 From April 2002 the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) changed from an annual to a monthly invoicing system for the fees paid by licensed centres. Under this new system the invoices issued each month are based on the number of patient treatment cycles reported to the HFEA in that month, making the reporting and the invoicing easier to reconcile. In addition, the HFEA will visit all licensed centres by the end of 2002&#150;03 to ensure that the centres are recording all the treatments they have undertaken in their monthly returns to the HFEA. The National Audit Office is continuing to monitor developments, working with the HFEA to establish how it will be able to rely on the results of these visits in order to draw conclusions on the accuracy and completeness of income due to the HFEA.

<a name="21126w19.html_para4">The United Kingdom subscribed to the International Code of Conduct against Ballistic Missile Proliferation (ICOC) on 25 November, which I announced to the House by means of a written Ministerial Statement today. Her Majesty's Government are already well placed to implement the undertakings in the Code. We already have strong measures in place for tackling the proliferation of ballistic missiles. The United Kingdom scrutinises export licence applications for any possible diversion of the goods to a missile programme of concern. We play an active part in the Missile Technology Control Regime, that co-ordinates national export controls on missile-related technology. Bilaterally, the United Kingdom encourages countries to show restraint in missile programmes and testing, emphasising the adverse effects they have on regional stability.
<P>

<a name="21126w19.html_para5">In implementing the ICOC, in line with Part 4 of the Code, the United Kingdom will exchange with other subscribing states pre-launch notifications on ballistic missile and space launch vehicle launches and test flights. Also, in line with the Code we will share annual declarations on the United Kingdom's ballistic missile and satellite vehicle policies and launches.

 The Council agenda states that the Commission intends to make a presentation on their package of measures for a Community approach to nuclear safety in the European Union. The Commission proposals were published on 6 November and include a directive on the safety of nuclear installations during operation and decommissioning, a directive on spent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste and a draft decision authorising the Commission to negotiate an Agreement between Euratom and the Russian Federation on trade in nuclear materials. Discussion of the proposals at the Council is not envisaged.

<i>[holding answer 21 November 2002]:</i> Chemical Industries Association (CIA), member companies and operators of nuclear installations have been carrying out contingency planning since strike action by the firefighters became a real possibility, and keeping the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) informed.
<P>

<a name="21126w20.html_para1">The CIA has discussed with member companies the need to review the adequacy of existing plans and procedures, and to consider any additional steps they might take in the absence of emergency assistance from the Fire Brigade. The nuclear operators are likewise acting in the light of their responsibilities for safety on their sites and for emergency preparedness, and are keeping under review the implications of possible further strike action for their day-to-day activities.
<P>

<a name="21126w20.html_para2">The Health and Safety Executive has offered advice to employers operating onshore major hazard sites and nuclear licensed sites. In essence, this advice is for businesses to review their risk assessments in the light of the changed circumstances and consider what additional actions might be necessary. Overall, the HSE view is that the existence of a strike should not, of itself, cause the vast majority of legitimate industrial or commercial activities to be curtailed, since emergency plans and evacuation should not be dependent on the presence of the fire brigade. The HSE's advice, and other advice to relevant industries, is available on HSE's website: www.hse.gov.uk/firefighters.htm

<a name="21126w21.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 Nuclear site licences contain no provisions regarding the insolvency of a site operator and HSE does not have formal contingency arrangements in the event that a site operator is declared insolvent or put into administration. I understand that HSE is considering how it might increase its surveillance of the safety of nuclear operations and monitor developments on affected sites in such circumstances. My officials are continuing to work closely with the Health and Safety Executive's Nuclear Installations Inspectorate to ensure the overriding priority of the safe operation of British Energy's nuclear power stations.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry whether the licence agreements that the Nuclear Safety Directorate negotiates with site operators contain provisions to deal with the accumulation and storage of nuclear waste material; and whether renegotiation of a licence agreement would be required where a site operator implemented a change of policy on nuclear waste material.  [82505]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21126w21.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Wilson:  </B> 
A Xlicence agreement" is not a recognised instrument of the Nuclear Installations Act 1965 (as amended). However, the Act does allow the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) to attach conditions to nuclear site licences in the interests of safety or with respect to the handling, treatment and disposal of nuclear material and within the arrangements made by licensees under those conditions the HSE does use formal Xagreements" to effect its permissioning role. Any activity on a licensed site requiring HSE's permission is subject to there being an adequate safety case.
<P>

<a name="21126w21.html_para0">Any changes, on the part of a licensee, relating to the storage of nuclear waste at the site would be subject to the acceptance of a revised safety case by HSE. Such changes would need to meet Licence Condition 32, which specifically addresses the accumulation of radioactive waste within the standard set of 36 conditions,. In enforcing this and other licence conditions, HSE's Nuclear Installations Inspectorate takes into account Government policy on radioactive waste management, as set out in Cm2919.
<P>

<a name="21126w21.html_para1">Additionally the licensee's policy on the management of radioactive waste is reviewed through the quinquennial review process, as required by Government policy. Changes in licensee's policy will be identified by this process and assessed by HSE. The results of HSE's

 The Horizontal Amending Directive (HAD) (2000/34/EC) entitles workers in the offshore sector to the full provisions of the Working Time Directive (93/104/EC). The HAD was formally adopted on 1 August 2000 and is required to be implemented by 1 August 2003.

<a name="21126w21.html_para3">The campaign deliberately targeted British travellers and holidaymakers, and was not aimed at specific third countries.

<P>
<a name="21126w23.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The most recent assessment of farmers' markets in England and Wales was a business survey carried out by the NFU in July 2002. This reported that the 450 regular farmers' markets currently operating have an annual turnover of approximately &pound;166.3 million with the average earnings of each stallholder being around &pound;8,700. With average farm incomes for 2001 of &pound;7,861, the economic benefits for local farmers participating in farmers' markets are clear.




<P>

<P>

<a name="21126w23.html_para1">The business survey did not specifically consider the impact of farmers' markets on retailers but it did report that 80 per cent. of locations had seen increases in trade for neighbouring businesses. This supports the findings of an earlier study carried out on behalf of the Countryside Agency in 2001 on farmers' markets in the South East. This reported that in the opinion of those market organisers and town centre managers that responded most considered that local shops had benefited.

little likelihood that a further flood alleviation scheme could be justified in Shrewsbury is based on the Agency's judgement that the costs of providing such schemes would outweigh the benefits, using the currently agreed methodology. However this methodology is subject to review next year and the Agency will consider any impact on the viability of defence measures for parts of Shrewsbury.

 <i>[holding answer 19 November 2002]:</i>The agreement provides South Africa, Botswana and Namibia with the prospect of a one-off sale of legal stocks of raw ivory after May 2004 provided that a number of strict conditions have first been met. These include verification of trading partners by the CITES Secretariat (to prevent illegal ivory entering legal markets), a requirement that baseline data on population and poaching levels is available from the MIKE system (Monitoring of Illegal Killing of Elephants) and any funds raised must be used for elephant conservation.

<a name="21126w24.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
: It is too early to assess the long term impacts of this oil pollution. Much will depend on the fate of the oil still in the holds of the wreck, and wind and sea conditions in the area. The primary responsibility for assessing the impact will rest with the Spanish authorities. Defra's Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science has contacted the scientists working on impactassessment and has offered any technical assistance they may find helpful Our current assessment is that it is extremely unlikely any oil from the Prestigewill reach the British coast.

The Fire Service, who work in the area of highest contamination, carry the highest grade of PPE suits, which include breathing apparatus.

 The Prison Service is taking a number of steps to stifle the availability of drugs in prisons. These measures, which include mandatory drug testing, operate alongside a comprehensive treatment framework and the provision of voluntary drug testing. The overall impact on drug use is demonstrated by the reduction in the positive rate of random mandatory drug tests from 24.4 per cent. (1996&#150;97) to 11.3 per cent. (year to date). The complementary nature of some supply reduction measures, e.g. drug detection dogs, Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) and low furniture in visits areas, and the complex nature of drug supply make it difficult to determine the impact of any single factor in reducing the availability or use of drugs.

 We will announce the new system for distributing Formula Grant, including detailed grant allocations for individual authorities, at the time of the provisional local government finance settlement which we expect to be around the start of December. Once the Government has allocated its grant, decisions about budgets and services are primarily for local councils to make. However, we have already guaranteed that no authority will face a cut in grant next year on a like for like basis, and we hope to do better than that when we announce the actual floors and ceilings scheme as part of the provisional settlement.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what representations he has received concerning Surrey County Council's Spatial Strategy; and if he will make a statement.  [83446]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21126w29.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 Since the publication of the draft Spatial Strategy in July, the First Secretary of State has received almost 250 representations from Surrey residents about possible housing development north east and north west of Guildford and south of Woking. We will consider what representations to make on the Deposit Draft Structure Plan, if any, when it is issued for public consultation.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister if he will estimate the population of each standard region of England; and for what reasons the standard region is being used as the basic unit for elected regional assemblies.  [82727]

<a name="21126w29.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 Annex A of the White Paper XYour Region, Your Choice" (Cm 5511) includes the most recent population figures for each region at the time of the publication of the White Paper in May 2002. These figures were drawn from XRegional Trends 36" (Office for National Statistics, 2001). The latest figures from the Office for National Statistics, as published in XRegional Trends 37", will be placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="21126w29.html_para0">Chapter 6 of the White Paper makes clear that these regions represent the existing administrative boundaries used by the Government Offices for the regions, the regional development agencies and other parts of central Government, as well as being the standard statistical regions used by the Office for National Statistics. These regions have existed for various planning and statistical purposes since the Second World War, with minor changes over time. They are also a credible size to support a regional assembly and to differentiate the assembly from local government in the region.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what assessment he has made of the ways in which elected regional assemblies will increase democratic accountability; what proposals he has to encourage voter interest in regional assembly elections; and if he will make a statement.  [82726]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21126w29.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 A detailed assessment of the ways in which elected regional assemblies will increase democratic accountability is set out in the White Paper XYour Region, Your Choice" (Cm 5511), particularly in chapters 1 and 3.
<P>

<a name="21126w29.html_para1">Publicity about voting in elections for regional assemblies will be a matter for the Electoral Commission. More generally, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has embarked upon an ambitious programme of electoral modernisation pilot schemes, of which the aim is to make voting more straightforward, efficient, secure and above all readily accessible to all electors.
