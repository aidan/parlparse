 The net additional cost of military operations is funded from the Reserve. For the financial year 2007-08 this amounted to £1.504 billion for Afghanistan. Costs that the Department would have incurred anyway, such as wages and salaries, are not included and are met from the core Defence budget. Savings on activities that have not occurred because of the operation, such as training exercises, are taken into account in arriving at the net claim on the Reserve.</p>

In 2007-08 these activities were carried out by the Department for International Development, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, and the Ministry of Defence under the auspices of the Global Conflict Prevention Pool, which is not part of the Defence budget.

<i> [holding answer 11 January 2010]:</i> Public service pension upratings are linked by primary legislation to those for additional state pensions, such as the state second pension, and the uprating in April 2010 will take account of the rate of inflation over the year to September 2009. As announced at the pre-Budget report 2008, legislation governing uprating for additional state pensions means that in the event of a negative Retail Price Index (RPI), benefit rates will be protected at least in nominal terms (i.e. not reduced on account of deflation), thereby providing an increase in support in real terms. The RPI change for September 2009 was minus 1.4 per cent., so benefits will remain at current levels.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_368"><a name="100119w0003.htm_para4"><a name="10011951000330">In July 2001 the new deal for disabled people was launched. This is a programme of advice and practical support, which helps people move from disability and health-related benefits into paid employment. The programme is delivered through a network of 'Job Brokers' offering different services, which can be tailored to a customer's individual needs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_369"><a name="100119w0003.htm_para5"><a name="10011951000331">April 2008 saw the introduction of Pathways to Work in Surrey and Sussex, which includes the Lewes constituency. This programme helps claimants of incapacity benefits or employment and support allowance get work by offering individual support and access to a wide range of help, including work-focused interviews.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_370"><a name="100119w0003.htm_para6"><a name="10011951000332">The public consultation 'Helping people achieve their full potential: Improving Specialist Disability Employment Services' was launched on 3 December 2007 to help shape the future of specialist disability employment provision. The new programme, Work Choice, which replaces existing specialist disability employment programmes, will be introduced in October 2010.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_371"><a name="100119w0003.htm_para7"><a name="10011951000333">Employment and support allowance replaced incapacity benefits for new customers nationally on 27 October 2008. Employment and support allowance has a greater work-focus than its predecessors. It also has a more modern and robust medical assessment, which helps to identify the help that people need to ensure they can fulfil their potential.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_372"><a name="100119w0003.htm_para8"><a name="10011951000334">Access to Work is a specialist disability programme that helps disabled people overcome work-related obstacles. It is flexible, easy to access and shows high levels of satisfaction from disabled people and their employers. The Access to Work base budget has been increased from £15 million in 1994-95 to £81 million in 2009-10 and will continue to grow to £138 million by 2013-14. We are also working to improve the programme to ensure it helps people with mental health conditions more effectively.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_373"><a name="100119w0003.htm_para9"><a name="10011951000335">The refreshed jobseeker's allowance regime and flexible new deal went live in Surrey and Sussex in October 2009. This is designed to offer personalised and more intensive support to customers, including those with disabilities, to help overcome barriers to work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_374"><a name="100119w0003.htm_para10"><a name="10011951000336">More generally, all jobseekers have full access to Jobcentre Plus vacancy services to enhance their employment opportunities. We recognise that some disabled customers may have a more limited availability and scope to find and carry out certain types of work. Therefore, at the start of their claim customers are asked to tell their adviser about any disabilities that might have such an impact, and can restrict their work search activity and availability for work if those restrictions are reasonable, given their condition.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_375"><a name="100119w0003.htm_para11"><a name="10011951000337">Customers with a disability can volunteer to be fast-tracked to the six month stage of jobseeker's allowance, subject to the Jobcentre Plus personal advisers' agreement. This allows disabled people to access additional intensive support earlier in their claim.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_376"><a name="100119w0003.htm_para12"><a name="10011951000338">Disability employment advisers are available to provide specialist support to people facing employment barriers because of a disability. They can advise customers about a range of specialised support available, and provide advice on job retention if a person is concerned about losing their job because of their disability. They are supported by work psychologists and various external disability specialists.</p>

<i> [holding answer 14 January 2010]:</i><i> </i>Changes in the number of farmers are just one element of the structural changes that have taken place in the sector. The long-term trend in dairy production is towards fewer, larger and more productive herds.

 We worked closely with Dairy Farmers of Britain (DFoB) Members Council, the Receivers (PricewaterhouseCoopers) and others towards our common goal of minimising the impacts of those affected, particularly farmer members of DFoB including those in Staffordshire, following DFoB's entry into administration last June.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_383"><a name="100119w0004.htm_para5"><a name="10011951000500">We ensured that all available assistance was given to those facing difficulties. This included advice from DFoB Members Council, the Receivers, the National Farmers Union and Regional Development Agencies. For example, there is the Business Link's Enterprise Finance Guarantee Scheme and HMRC's Business Payment Support Service, which might enable those affected to defer certain tax and national insurance payments. The Secretary of State also wrote to both the British Bankers' Association and the Agricultural Industries Confederation to ask their members to consider any short term cash flow problems faced by farmers sympathetically. In the succeeding weeks, 97 per cent. of the 1,813 active DFoB members found new contracts and buyers for their milk.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_384"><a name="100119w0004.htm_para6"><a name="10011951000501">Dairy farmers, including those in Staffordshire, are eligible for payments under the Single Payment Scheme (SPS). The Rural Payments Agency has made continued progress in making more timely SPS payments and this has helped farmers' cash flow, with around £1.5 billion (just under 78 per cent.) paid by the end of December under the 2009 scheme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_385"><a name="100119w0004.htm_para7"><a name="10011951000502">In addition, dairy farmers are eligible for funding under DEFRA's £600 million Rural Development Programme for England 2007-13. This includes over £107 million which is being targeted specifically at the livestock sector to help it meet the particular challenges that it faces. Through this, Advantage West Midlands are able to assist farmers through capital investments to increase competitiveness or diversification into other activities.</p>

<i> [holding answer 14 January 2010]: </i>No estimate has been made of the cost to the agricultural industry of the cross-compliance cattle and sheep inspections. However, with regard to these inspections, farmers need not do anything more than they are already required to do by the pre-existing cattle and sheep legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_390"><a name="100119w0005.htm_para4"><a name="10011951000546">Farmers are not charged for the costs of an inspection but may incur some costs in terms of time spent with inspectors. Significant non-compliance with EU cross- compliance requirements may result in additional inspections and/or the reduction or exclusion of their single payment scheme claim. For individual farmers, the costs of these will vary depending on the degree of non-compliance.</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_423"><a name="100119w0009.htm_para5"><a name="10011951001303">The guidance on winter service applies to roads affected by snow and ice and includes advice on materials that can be used for winter service. Recommended treatment rates for salt under different conditions are also provided.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_424"><a name="100119w0009.htm_para6"><a name="10011951001304">Through ongoing detailed research and analysis, the Highways Agency has developed a treatment matrix, which provides guidance for its service providers on appropriate treatment rates for their network. This matrix is under continuous review to assess identified treatment rates and as a result of recently completed research, the Highways Agency has been able to reduce its treatment rates helping to improve resilience through the current salt shortage.</p>

 The Legal Services Commission (LSC) does not record centrally the amounts paid to expert witnesses in legally aided cases.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Justice what proportion of Probation Service Staff in <i> (a)</i> England, <i> (b)</i> Wales and <i> (c)</i> Dyfed Powys undertake duties involving face-to-face contact with offenders; and what proportion of their working time is spent in such contact for such staff in each area. [307317]</p>

<p><a name="st_261"><a name="10011962000237"><a name="100119w0013.htm_spnew7"><a name="10011962000540"><b>Maria Eagle:</b>
 The number of probation service staff whose primary task is offender facing work in England is 67.9 per cent., in Wales 63.2 per cent. and in Dyfed-Powys 65.6 per cent. Our statistics record staff undertaking duties involving face-to-face contact with offenders as: qualified probation officers (PO), probation service officers (PSO), and trainee probation officers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_471"><a name="100119w0013.htm_para12"><a name="10011962000238">Delivery structures across probation areas vary as do the requirements of specific roles and the National Offender Management Service (NOMS) does not routinely report on the proportion of working time spent in face- to-face contact with offenders. In December 2008, the NOMS undertook a snapshot survey over a one week period, based on a small sample of PO and PSO staff. It reported that across England and Wales 24 per cent. of PO/PSO time was spent in direct contact with offenders, 41 per cent. was involved in computer activity and 35 per cent. of time was spent on non-computer-dealing with correspondence, meetings, travel, etc. The equivalent figures in the same survey for Dyfed-Powys were 21 per cent., 45 per cent. and 34 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_472"><a name="100119w0013.htm_para13"><a name="10011962000239">The reporting of the results against only three main headings means that much of the detail is open to interpretation. For example, time spent on computer activity is productive time, in that it involves the production of reports and assessments on individual cases. The recording of risk assessments, which is an integral part of this work, is vital to ongoing case management, and the proper recording of case information is essential to the provision of statistical information which can be deployed to develop NOMS's offender management strategy. Even if only about three-quarters of this time were included as work on cases this gives a picture of more like 54 per cent. of time being spent on work with individual offenders.</p>

 Information is not available in the form requested. Since 1997, there have been two major changes to the way crime is recorded. The effect of extending the coverage and changing the counting rules in 1998 was to artificially increase total recorded crime nationally by 14 per cent. It is estimated that the effect of the introduction of the National Crime Recording Standard (NCRS) in April 2002 caused a further artificial increase of 10 per cent. in total recorded crime in its first year.

 The following table shows the number of homes built and acquired for social rent in rural areas in England each year since 1991-92. Figures are not available for 1990-91.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_547"><a name="100119w0018.htm_para5"><a name="10011968000056">In 1997 there was a significant backlog of social housing repairs, more than 2 million homes failing basic decency standards and too many of society's most vulnerable people on the streets or in bed and breakfast accommodation. Therefore, funds were prioritised into tackling the quality of the existing social housing stock which while resulting in a decrease in new affordable homes being built led to significant inroads on delivering decent homes and tackling rough sleeping. In more recent years, increased funding has led to an increase in affordable housing.</p>

Any essential adjustment of the boundary of a green belt is for the local planning authority to propose as part of the local plan process. The Secretary of State monitors emerging regional strategies and local plans to ensure they are consistent with national policy. Government offices make representations to the independent examinations of draft Regional Spatial Strategies and Local Development Frameworks if the approach proposed is not consistent with PPG2.

All local authorities require applicants to confirm whether they are in receipt of these as Communities and Local Government reimburse local authorities on an actual basis when a grant has been paid to qualifying former service personnel.

 Healthy eating is an important part of good physical and mental health and achieving and maintaining a healthy weight. Ensuring that children, young people and their families have the information, advice and support they need to make healthier choices in what they eat is a long-standing priority for the Government. Our approach is about not just giving advice, but providing healthy food in schools and other settings. We have made significant progress in the past 12 months to build on the work to date.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_626"><a name="100119w0024.htm_para8"><a name="10011979000055">Statutory nutritional standards for lunches provided in schools came into force for maintained primary schools in September 2008 and for maintained secondary and special schools in September 2009: this means that lunches provided in all maintained schools must now meet these standards. Food served in other parts of the school day or from vending machines must also meet statutory food-based standards. The proportion of children having school lunches has started to rise and parents can be confident that their children are eating a healthy, nutritious meal at school. The School Food Trust, as the Department's delivery partner, is working with schools and local authorities to promote and encourage take up of school meals, and we continue to ensure that pupils aged four to six receive a piece of fruit or vegetable every day through the School Fruit and Vegetable Scheme. Cookery classes are already part of the curriculum in primary schools and pupils in key stage 3 can now take up the offer of the Licence to Cook programme: all pupils now get the chance to learn to cook healthy meals. The highly successful cookbook Real Meals-Simple cooking that tastes great, produced by this Department and made available to all year 7 pupils, was updated and re-launched in December 2009. This new edition contained a wider range of recipes, and accompanied by the Real Meals-cold food cookbook, also produced by the DCSF, which provides recipes for picnics and days out. All recipes were produced by the British Nutrition Foundation and meet the required nutrient standards. In addition, 99 per cent. of schools are now participating in the Healthy Schools Programme and healthy eating is a core criterion for achieving healthy school status.</p>

Over 415,000 families have joined the campaign and receive information and advice tailored to their needs. Change4Life is primarily aimed at families with children aged between five and 11. To support families with younger children, in October 2009 we published a Change4Life Early Years toolkit for practitioners working with younger children. Start4Life, launched in January 2010, provides authoritative and up to date advice to pregnant women and parents of babies and children up to two years old on breastfeeding, introducing infants to solid food and active play so that babies can have the best start in life.</p>

In October 2009 new guidance for the important review which takes place after a child's second birthday as part of the programme was published. Also in October 2009 the Secretaries of State for Children, Schools and Families and Health launched the Healthy Child Programme for five to 19 year olds to stakeholders.

The national Play Strategy, launched in December 2008, set out the Government's commitment to invest £235 million to deliver 3,500 new or refurbished outdoor play areas, plus 30 staffed adventure playgrounds, by 2011. This funding is allocated to every top tier local authority in England and intended to support play for all ages, but with a particular focus on eight to 13s. All local authorities are required to develop a strong understanding of local levels of need for outdoor play facilities as part of their decision-making on how this capital investment will be spent, and are supported in this process by the Government's national delivery partner, Play England.

The NCA for a given year is the product of the rateable value and that year's small business multiplier. The NCA is then compared to the previous year's reference value increased by the caps. The minimum of these two values was used as a proxy for the bill after transition but before all other reliefs. Details on the methodology and assumptions used can be found on page 49 of the 'The transitional arrangements for the non-domestic rating revaluation 2010 in England' consultation document.

 In the period 2007-2009, Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC) asked the authorities in Israel to verify a total of 65 preference certificates. Two of the certificates related to irregularities identified as a result of HMRC's physical examination of fresh produce at the time of importation. The remaining certificates concerned potential problems identified as a result of HMRC's routine examination of documents accompanying claims to preference under the EU-Israel Agreement. To date there have been no cases identified where doubt has existed over the place of production of imported cosmetics. HMRC continue to closely monitor such imports.</p>

 It is not possible to identify tax reliefs at the level of detail requested. However, an estimated 95 per cent. of UK businesses who invest in plant or machinery (including in computers and internet-related equipment) will have their expenditure wholly relieved from tax by the Annual Investment Allowance (AIA), which provides 100 per cent. relief for such investment up to an amount of £50,000 each year.</p>

 No change is being made to legislation. From the outset the exemption for the rail industry from the long life assets regime for capital allowances has been time-limited.
