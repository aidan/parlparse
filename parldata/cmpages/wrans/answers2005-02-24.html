<p><a name="50224w01.html_spmin1"><b>The Solicitor-General:</b> 
 The CPS reform programme aims to put prosecutors at the heart of the Criminal Justice System, providing a prosecuting service that meets the needs of victims and communities. This means prosecutors having a bigger role at each stage of the criminal justice process from charge through to sentence and working in co-operation with others in the criminal justice process while maintaining that independence of decision-making which is the hallmark of British prosecutors.

<p>
<a name="50224w01.html_para2">
In relation, to child witnesses, witness care units can be expected to support children by for example, arranging pre-trial court visits, providing an explanation as to what will happen in court, arranging a home visit, providing safe and easy access to court on the day of trial and also making contact with the local, school if there are difficulties in that regard.

<p><a name="50224w01.html_spnew0"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 Parents will be the front line of the drive to improve school meals, with an independent school food trust and tougher standards on processed food introduced in the new school year. Many schools already ensure that children eat healthy school meals. However, parents need to work with schools to improve the quality and nutritional value of their child&#039;s school meal. Further information on this initiative will be available in due course.

<p><a name="50224w01.html_spnew1"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 On 23 February I placed before the House the Command Paper &quot;14 to 19 Education and Skills&quot;. This should lead directly to an increase in the numbers undertaking vocational education and training in schools and colleges.

All PRUs are very different, and as a result the average running cost will vary widely depending on the individual characteristics of the PRU. However dividing the total planned expenditure on the provision of education at PRUs in England in 2004&#150;05 (as recorded on local authorities 2004&#150;05 section 52 budget statement) by the total number of PRUs in England as at January 2004 gives an estimated average planned running cost of around &#163;466,000.

<p><a name="50224w08.html_spnew4"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 Since announcing the Rural Strategy in July 2004 we have made excellent progress. Our reforms are aimed at delivering services more efficiently, through a smaller number of organisations with clearer and more accountable roles. We are devolving delivery to give a better deal for the environment and the taxpayer and the overarching principle is sustainable development.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50224w08.html_para3">
Work is now under way to identify clear priorities and simple processes in each region of England. In order to explore better ways of supporting rural communities we have identified a local &quot;rural pathfinder&quot; for each region. We are working with these rural pathfinders to test innovative ways of improving local delivery and they are currently developing their plans. From this April, rural socio-economic funding will be mainstreamed through Rural Development Agencies with an increase of &#163;27 million in their single pot allocation to &#163;72 million from Defra. Rural community councils will be funded directly by Defra and some further social and community funds will be channelled through Government Offices.

Everyone will benefit from our radical simplification of funding streams. Rural businesses are being helped by an additional &#163;2 million that Defra has provided to Business Links this financial year.

We are moving the Rural Development Service out of the policy core of Defra and providing it with greater autonomy and devolved authority for decision-making and delivery, and, in order to pave the way for the Service to move into being part of the new Integrated Agency, we have appointed Poul Christensen to chair a small non executive board.

<p><a name="50224w10.html_wqn0"><b> Mr. Stinchcombe: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department which department of the Prison Service advises prisons on producing information booklets for prisoners; whether the distribution of information booklets in prisons is monitored; and what guidelines have been issued concerning what information should be provided for prisoners <i>(a)</i> on reception and induction into prison and <i>(b)</i> prior to release.  [215295]</p>




<p><a name="50224w10.html_spnew0"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 The What Works in Prison Unit at Prison Service headquarters is responsible for the four centrally produced prisoners&#039; information books, published in collaboration with the Prison Reform Trust. Their distribution is not monitored centrally; prisons order the books direct from Prison Service Enterprise and Supply Services, who also arrange printing. The production of local information books is left to the discretion of individual prisons and is not centrally monitored. Establishments can call upon policy leads at Prison Service headquarters for advice on specific topics. The guidance provided in Prison Service Order (PSO) 0550 on reception, PSO 0550 on prisoner induction and PSO 2300 on resettlement, which are published on the Prison Service website. Audit arrangements apply through standards based on the PSOs.
</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what measures his Department is taking to increase the amount of purposeful activity available for prisoners.  [216802]</p>




<p><a name="50224w10.html_spnew1"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 The Prison Service is committed to increasing the provision of quality purposeful activity for prisoners. Through the Custody to Work initiative, an investment of over &#163;14 million per annum is being provided to expand the initiatives that have a positive impact on reducing re-offending and contribute to purposeful activity.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50224w10.html_para0">
This money is being used to develop the following purposeful activities across the prison estate: more accredited skills training in sectors with realistic job opportunities for released prisoners (such as construction, utilities, catering, industrial cleaning, warehousing and transport); job-search training and support; through-the-gate job placement; education and housing advice and support services.




<br>&nbsp;<br><i>24 Feb 2005 : Column 784W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="50224w10.html_para1">
Prison Industries occupy prisoners in out-of-cell activity and wherever possible help them gain skills, qualifications and work experience to improve their employment prospects on release. Over &#163;4 million has been invested in industrial workshops over the past two years to help develop quality purposeful activities.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many NHS trusts have <i>(a)</i> complied with their statutory duties under the Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000, <i>(b)</i> published a race equality scheme and action plan and <i>(c)</i> carried out race impact assessments.  [216546]</p>




<p><a name="50224w10.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 I have been asked to reply.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50224w10.html_para2">
Strategic Health Authorities (SHAs) have performance management responsibility for NHS Trusts. Information on local race equality schemes and action plans, as well as race impact assessments can be obtained from SHAs.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50224w10.html_para3">
To make sure that race equality is integral to delivering health services, four SHA chief executives in partnership with the Department and the Commission for Racial Equality developed a framework to assist national health service organisations measure for themselves their progress in promoting race equality within the health service. This guide can be accessed at (http://www.cre.gov.uk/pdfs.sha race equality guide. pdf).
</p>


<p>
<a name="50224w10.html_para4">
To ensure compliance with the legislation, the Department will be offering advice and support to NHS organisations in developing their new schemes. The Chief Executive Bulletin Issue 249, December 2004, included a reminder to all NHS organisations of the requirement to produce race equality schemes by 31 May 2005.

<p><a name="50224w10.html_wqn3"><b> John McDonnell: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department by what mechanisms the Royal Parks Constabulary staff pay and conditions will be protected if they transfer to the Metropolitan Police Service as proposed in the Serious Organised Crime and Police Bill.  [215292]</p>




<p><a name="50224w10.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Caborn: </b> 
 I have been asked to reply.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50224w10.html_para5">
The key elements of the proposed transfer arrangements, which have been the subject of consultation with members of the Royal Parks Constabulary (RPC) and their union representatives, are as follows.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50224w10.html_para6">
RPC pay rates are pegged at 85.5 per cent. of MPS rates; officers transferring to the MPS as constables will therefore immediately benefit from a higher rate of pay, as well as the much improved career prospects which the 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>24 Feb 2005 : Column 785W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
MPS is able to offer. Their length of service and rank will be recognised, and they will have the opportunity to remain in the Royal Parks Operational Command Unit for a maximum of 10 years. If an officer is ineligible, or chooses not, to transfer as a constable but wishes to transfer as a Community Support Officer or member of police staff, then the MPS have agreed to maintain their rate of pay on a mark time basis for three years. If officers are ineligible to become MPS officers they will also have the option of redundancy, though we hope that few will be in this position.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50224w10.html_para7">
As civil servants, RPC officers are currently in the Principal Civil Service Pension Scheme (PCSPS), whereas MPS officers are in the Police Pension Scheme (PPS). Officers transferring have the option of freezing their benefits in the PCSPS or transferring them to the PPS. We have worked very closely with the Government Actuary&#039;s Department on the arrangements for pensions transfers from the one to the other which are designed with the aim of providing at the time of retirement from the MPS a retirement package which will be at least as good as if they had remained in the PCSPS and retired at the same age.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50224w10.html_para8">
The current retirement age for RPC officers is 60, subject to continuing satisfactory health, conduct and performance. For MPS officers the retirement age is 55, but the maximum retirement age is also 60, subject to application for, and annual approval of, extension of service. Annual extensions take into account health, conduct and efficiency, and the continuing requirement for the role. So RPC officers transferring will, subject to these requirements, have the opportunity to continue until 60.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50224w10.html_para9">
The Police Act 1996 allows any person who was a member of a trade union immediately before joining a force to retain membership of that union with the consent of the Chief Officer. I understand that all requests from officers to retain union membership after their transfer to the MPS have been approved, and I see no reason why future requests should not also be approved.

 None.

In the light of the events that took place during the matches at Everton and Burnley last weekend, I understand that the Football Association plans to review the scheduling of matches with the police and broadcasters in advance of the next round of the FA Cup.

Notes:<br>

1. A finished admission episode is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. Please note that admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>

2. The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 14 (seven prior to 2002&#150;03) diagnosis fields in the hospital episode statistics (HES) data set and provides the main reason why the patient was in hospital.<br>





3. The main operation is the first recorded operation in the HES data set and is usually the most resource intensive procedure performed during the episode. It is appropriate to use main operation when looking at admission details, e.g., time waited, but the figures for &quot;all operations count of episodes&quot; give a more complete count of episodes with an operation.<br>

4. Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).<br>

5. Healthcare resource groups (HRGs)&#151;it should be noted that there may be many OPCS/ICD codes that map to a single HRG (a category into which similar treatments are grouped) and these are the national average costs at HRG level&#151;they are not the costs of the individual codes within the HRG, so the actual costs of such OPCS codes, etc. may differ from those detailed.<br>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what the original agreed contract price in relation to the contract with Swan Hunter (Tyneside) for the construction of Landing Ship Logistics (LSL) Largs Bay and Lyme Bay was; what the latest anticipated cost is; how much BAE Systems will be able to claim from the Department by reason of the failure of Swan Hunter to deliver design information to BAE Systems in relation to the two LSLs that that company is to build; whether his Department will claim from Swan Hunter in respect of its lateness in delivering design information on the LSLs; and which party under the terms of the original Swan Hunter contract undertook to accept the risk of the engineering requirements being greater than anticipated.  [216889]</p>




<p><a name="50224w15.html_spnew9"><b> Mr. Ingram </b> 
<i>[holding answer 21 February 2005]:</i> The original contract price for the design and construction cost of the two Swan Hunter Landing Ship Dock (Auxiliary) ships, Largs Bay and Lyme Bay, was &#163;148 million and the anticipated cost is now &#163;235 million. The Ministry of Defence has made a provision of &#163;40 million in the 2003&#150;04 Accounts for delay and dislocation costs in respect to the two LSD(A)s that BAE Systems are building and has already paid &#163;16 million as an initial payment. Negotiations continue on the final settlement figure with the company. As further disclosure could prejudice 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>24 Feb 2005 : Column 804W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
these negotiations I am withholding further information under the commercial interests exemption of the Freedom of Information Act 2000. The MOD will not be pursuing a claim from Swan Hunter in respect of providing information to BAE Systems as this would seriously jeopardise company&#039;s ability to delivery the Landing Ship Dock Auxiliary capability. The Swan Hunter undertook the engineering risk in delivering against the original contract. However, in September 2003, when the company announced that it could not absorb the risk and complete the contract at the agreed price and timescale, both financial and timescale risks were in effect transferred to the MOD.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50224w15.html_para3">
This new Landing Ship Dock Auxiliary class will provide a significantly enhanced capability that will enable the faster deployment of troops, vehicles and stores into operational and front line areas, at a safer distance and in worse sea conditions than the Landing Ships they will replace. The construction of Largs Bay and Lyme Bay is virtually complete and the retention of Swan Hunter as the lead yard offers MOD and the taxpayer the best value for money solution for delivering this new capability.

It is critical that both sides stick to their commitments as this will be the best way of achieving long-term stability and enabling a return to the Roadmap. We call upon militant groups not to undermine the efforts made by the Israeli and Palestinian leadership.

The Government assesses that the DPRK extracted sufficient plutonium in the early 1990s for up to two nuclear warheads and that it has the technical capability to weaponise this material. Since then, the DPRK claims to have extracted enough plutonium from its stock of fuel rods to manufacture several additional nuclear warheads.

<br>&nbsp;<br><i>24 Feb 2005 : Column 826W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>



<p><a name="50224w22.html_spnew3"><b> Jane Kennedy: </b> 
 Reducing the numbers of people on incapacity benefits by one million is a long term aspiration.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50224w22.html_para2">
This long-term aspiration is challenging. It will require continued macroeconomic stability and further radical welfare reform to build on the success that has already been achieved. New claims are already down by 30 per cent. since 1997. The caseload has peaked after decades when the numbers increased&#151;particularly in the 1990s when the caseload trebled. And in the latest two quarters there have been the first signs of a fall.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50224w22.html_para3">
It is not possible to put a firm timetable on this. Not only does it require legislative changes we also need to review the evidence from the successful Pathways to Work pilots and successfully roll-out the programme.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50224w22.html_para4">
We are already making progress. The significant improvement in off-flow rates registered in the pathways to work pilots, with 5,500 job entries up to last August, also shows for the first time how significant additional numbers of people on incapacity benefits can be helped back to work.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50224w22.html_para5">
Realisation of our aspiration will depend on further evidence from pathways (for example on the impact of work-focused interviews for existing claimants, starting this month) and other initiatives. It will also depend on when we can start to understand the additional impact of the new arrangements set out in the five year strategy. Outside of DWP it will also depend on the scale of progress on, for example, fitness for work issues and progress on employers&#039; sickness absence management policies.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50224w22.html_para6">
Progress towards our aspiration should come, in part, from improving support so people do not need to come onto IB, that is, reducing inflows and improving off-flows by helping more people to leave the benefit for work.

 For the first time ever we are giving people the chance to defer their State Pension and build up a lump sum.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50224w22.html_para7">
Taxation is a matter for the Chancellor, but it is proposed to tax the lump sum at the marginal rate (currently 10 per cent., 22 per cent., 40 per cent. or if not liable to tax&#151;no deduction) applicable to the person&#039;s other income, either in the tax year in which the person starts drawing his State Pension or, if the person so chooses, the tax year following. Payment of a lump sum will not count as income for the age-related personal allowance.

 The Criminal Justice Evidence (Northern Ireland) Order 2004 provides the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland with a power to prescribe categories of offences which are &#039;of the same type&#039; for use as an indicator that a defendant has a propensity to commit offences of a certain type. The draft proposed Criminal Justice (Evidence) (Northern Ireland) Order 2004 (Categories of Offences) Order 2005 proposes two such categories of offences: Part I deals with offences of theft; Part II deals with sexual offences against persons aged under the age of 17.

While Part II of the draft Order focuses on children aged under 17, any relevant previous conviction&#151;including those committed against persons aged 17 or over&#151;may be admissible at trial even when no relevant category of offences has been introduced. Both Part I and Part II categories are intended as a guide to the judiciary. Nor does the absence of categories for other types of offences prevent previous convictions from being admitted if they demonstrate a propensity to commit a certain type of offence. Further categories may be introduced at a later date.

<p class="tabletext">You recently asked the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland a Parliamentary Question about what plans the Water Service has for replacing the Whiterock Bay Sewer; and whether the Water Service plans to provide a storm overflow with a fully operational flap on the outfall; a storm retention tank and pumps upgrade (217468).

<p>

<p class="tabletext">Water Service is confident that the main sewer at Whiterock Bay is operating satisfactorily, and there are no plans to replace it. Water Service intends however to carry out a survey and examination of the sewerage infrastructure under the Killinchy wastewater treatment works project. I will keep you informed of any conclusion reached as a result of that investigation.</p>

</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">The unscreened combined sewer overflow to which you refer is situated on the main sewer in Whiterock to the northwest of the boat park. Its purpose is to prevent out of sewer flooding during periods of heavy rain, when the flow in the main sewer can exceed its capacity, by discharging the excess flow into Whiterock Bay. Combined sewer overflows are a common feature on many sewerage systems in the UK.</p>

<p>




<br>&nbsp;<br><i>24 Feb 2005 : Column 836W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">Water Service has no record of complaints about this particular combined sewer overflow or about sewage spillages in the Bay. However, if you can provide me with specific details of sewage spillages, I will have the matter investigated as a matter or urgency.</p>
