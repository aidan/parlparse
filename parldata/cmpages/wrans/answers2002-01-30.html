 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development if she will make a statement on the agenda for the world summit on sustainable development in Johannesburg in September.  [29129]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20130w01.html_spnew0"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 The UK Government are working to try to ensure that the world summit on sustainable development in Johannesburg in September commits the international community to work for the systematic reduction of poverty in a sustainable planet. It is only on this basis that the world community will be able to agree on the need to manage the resources of the world sustainably. My own hope is that the summit will bring the development and environment agendas together and thus strengthen the international commitment to poverty eradication.

 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development if she will make a statement on the United Kingdom's involvement in the preparation for the world summit on sustainable development in Johannesburg in September.  [29133]<P>

<P>
<a name="20130w01.html_spnew1"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 The UK is fully engaged in preparations for the world summit. The Prime Minister was the first world leader to announce his intention to attend. A Cabinet Committee has been established, under the chairmanship of the Deputy Prime Minister, to co-ordinate the Government's approach. We are working hard&#151;within the EU and internationally&#151;to ensure a successful outcome at Johannesburg.

7. <a name="20130w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Barnes: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what assistance her Department provides to the Government of Nigeria in helping it to tackle AIDS.  [29130]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20130w01.html_spnew2"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 Nigeria has an infection rate for HIV of 5.8 per cent. in the sexually active population. This is the level at which we normally see an exponential increase in infection rates. In some parts of Nigeria the rate is already 20 per cent. Given that one in four of the population of sub-Saharan Africa live in Nigeria, this situation poses a major threat. I recently approved a &#163;50 million seven-year programme that supports behaviour change and distributes condoms using social marketing, targeting vulnerable and high-risks groups. We intend to do more.

 We are supporting a &#163;7.5 million regional HIV/AIDS programme with the Southern African Development Community (SADC). The programme aims to develop capacity in Botswana, Namibia, Lesotho and Swaziland to mount an effective response to the HIV epidemic. DFID is also financing Voluntary Service Overseas (VSO), and Soul City, a regional non- government organisation, for HIV/AIDS work in the region.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20130w01.html_spnew4"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 In Zimbabwe we are spending &#163;18 million this year on 18 programmes, mostly aimed at providing food and medicines and slowing the spread of HIV and AlDS. Our aim is not to assist the Government, but to help the poor.

<P>
28. <a name="20130w01.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Andrew Turner: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development if she will make a statement on her response to food shortages in Zimbabwe.  [29151]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20130w01.html_spnew5"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 DFID has provided &#163;4 million since September 2001 for a supplementary feeding programme implemented by NGOs, targeting 300,000 people (predominantly children) in the worst hit areas of Zimbabwe. At the beginning of January we announced a contribution of &#163;6 million for the UNDP's Humanitarian Assistance and Recovery Programme; &#163;3.5 million for further feeding programmes and &#163;2.5 million for essential medical supplies and improved access to health care services.

 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what her priorities are for education investment in the poorest countries.  [29132]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20130w01.html_spnew6"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 Our priority in education is to achieve the millennium development goals of universal primary education in all countries by the year 2015 and gender equity in primary and secondary schooling by 2005. Since May 1997 we have committed over &#163;600 million in support of them. Our recent paper "Children out of School" proposes an eight-point plan of international action for accelerating progress towards the 2015 target.

<P>
14. <a name="20130w01.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Joyce: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what importance she places on the role of education in the context of Government assistance to developing nations.  [29137]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20130w01.html_spnew7"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 We give very high priority to education because education is a precondition of development and poverty reduction. We want other development agencies to do likewise. DFID's focus is on ensuring that we achieve the target of quality primary education for all children by 2015. Our education strategy paper, "The challenge of universal primary education", sets out DFID's overall approach and threefold strategy for delivering this goal.

 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what steps her Department is taking to combat child poverty in developing countries.  [29134]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20130w01.html_spnew8"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 We seek to reduce the poverty of children, which causes suffering to today's children and jeopardises the well-being of future generations, by working to address the causes of deprivation in their communities. Support for children's rights to basic health care, education, nutrition, shelter, protection from violence and abusive labour, along with sustainable livelihoods for their parents, is central to my Department's work towards the millennium development goals.
<P>

<a name="20130w01.html_para0">We are determined to do our utmost to energise the international system to achieve the goals. The goals include the target of, by 2015, lifting one billion people out of abject poverty, universal primary schooling, and reducing under-five child mortality by two thirds. The goals are achievable given greater and more united international effort.

 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what funding is planned for agricultural developments in Uganda in the financial year 2002&#150;03; and if she will make a statement.  [29135]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20130w01.html_spnew9"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 My Department plans to spend approximately &#163;3.35 million on rural livelihoods projects in Uganda in the financial year 2002&#150;03. In addition, DFID intends to provide &#163;35 million of general budget support to the Government of Uganda, which will be used to support Government programmes, including an innovative strategy for rural poverty eradication, known as the plan for the modernisation of agriculture (PMA). This incorporates reforms to key strategies that determine livelihood opportunities for the rural poor, including extension, research, lands and marketing.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20130w01.html_spnew10"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 The aim of British development assistance to Kenya is to reduce poverty. Direct assistance in 2000&#150;01 totalled &#163;52 million, including &#163;15 million as budget support and &#163;12 million on drought relief. We also support the provision of primary school textbooks and materials, HIV/AIDS prevention and care, reproductive health care, malaria prevention, private sector development, public service reform and initiatives to promote civic education and improved access to justice for poor people. In addition, Britain contributed substantially through multilateral agencies including about &#163;2.7 million through the EC's aid programme.

 There is general agreement that Tanzania needs a civilian air traffic control system to ensure safety in the country's air space. The issue is whether the contract with British Aerospace meets Tanzania's needs, and represents value for money.
<P>

<a name="20130w01.html_para1">The Government of Tanzania are working with the World bank and the International Civil Aviation Organisation to address these issues. The developmental impact will depend on whether the system is technically appropriate and affordable within the Government of Tanzania's budget, which is being targeted on priorities set out in its poverty reduction strategy.

 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what plans she has to promote fairer terms of trade for developing countries.  [29139]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20130w02.html_spnew0"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 The Government believe that trade has a vital role to play in helping developing countries to boost their economic growth and generate the resources necessary for reducing poverty. We have made important steps towards achieving these objectives, not least of which was the development agenda agreed at the Doha Ministerial Conference. This is, however, only the beginning of negotiations. To make it a real development round we will work to ensure that these commitments become a reality. We are therefore working with the Department for Trade and Industry, the European Union, the WTO and developing countries to assist them in forming clear and pro-development negotiating positions.
<P>

<a name="20130w02.html_para0">The UK Government are also at the forefront of efforts to enhance developing countries' capacity to trade. In the White Paper on Globalisation we undertook to double our commitment over the next three years. We have recently pledged a &#163;20 million package of trade related capacity building which will take us towards this goal.

 A "Comparative Study of Air and Sea Access" was published last July. A copy of the report was placed in the House of Commons Library.

This process is in its final stages and we hope to proceed to ratification soon. Details of the means of implementing the protocol will be covered in an explanatory memorandum to be laid before Parliament in the lead up to ratification.

 A new strategy paper will be published this year for DFlD's work in the Southern Africa Customs Union area, which comprises Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia, South Africa and Swaziland. DFID will continue to support the region's efforts to address inherited problems of poverty, inequality and exclusion. We will give increasing priority to work on HIV/AIDS.

 Thanks to the efforts of the UN-led humanitarian system, and with the support of the international community, a potential humanitarian catastrophe has been averted in Afghanistan. But at least five million people will remain dependent on food aid and other emergency support over the coming year. Unless there is significant rainfall in the next few weeks, a fourth

<P>

<a name="20130w02.html_para3">While it is vital that we prepare for longer-term development in Afghanistan, we must also continue to provide urgent humanitarian assistance, particularly over the remaining winter months.

<P>
<a name="20130w02.html_spnew7"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 I visited Sudan recently to assess the prospects for peace and development. In my discussions with Sudanese leaders and others in the north and south of the country, I found that both sides in the conflict were yearning for peace. I concluded that there is now a real window of opportunity for the UK and the rest of the international community to engage in dialogue to help Sudan bring this long running conflict to an end.
<P>

<a name="20130w02.html_para5">I believe the UK can play a significant role in helping resolve the conflict and that our involvement would be welcomed by both sides. My Department is now considering ways in which the UK can exert influence in the peace process. We will aim to raise and maintain the conflict's profile in the international arena, and to build the pressure for a just peace. This will involve discussing Sudan with the World bank, IMF and the EU as well as with African countries with the potential to help. It will also be important to maintain the continued interest and involvement from the US and we will work with them at official and ministerial level to ensure this.
<P>

<a name="20130w02.html_para6">Long-term development of Sudan cannot be achieved without an end to the war. Such a partnership would depend on an end to the conflict, sustainable peace and political stability, as well as a commitment on the part of the Sudanese Government to poverty eradication.

 Following a radical overhaul of the heavily indebted poor countries initiative in 1999, to ensure faster, deeper debt relief, up to $100 billion debt could be written off for the 42 HIPC countries. To date, 24 countries have qualified for this exceptional debt relief. Relief of more than $54 billion will be provided to these countries, reducing their debts by more than two-thirds on average. We hope that at least two more countries&#151;Ghana and Sierra Leone&#151;will qualify for debt relief in the coming months, but substantial further progress will be difficult, as many of the remaining HIPC countries are affected by conflict.
<P>

<a name="20130w03.html_para2">The Government have already written off their aid debts to all the poorest countries. The UK is also the second largest contributor ($306 million) to the HIPC Trust Fund to help international financial institutions meet their share of HIPC costs.

 Support for refugees from the Western Sahara in Algeria is mostly channelled through three agencies: the United Nation's High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR); the World Food Programme (WFP); and the European Commission's Humanitarian Aid Office (ECHO). UNHCR's budget for the refugees from Western Sahara amounted to about US$3.3 million in 2001. The WFP aims to provide 64,500 tons of food (costing US$27.5 million) in its 2000&#150;02 programme. ECHO's Global Plan 2001 began last September and aims to provide Euro 11.8 million in humanitarian support to the refugees, of which approximately 15 per cent. is attributable to contributions from the UK. Smaller amounts of financial and food aid assistance are provided by other EU member states.

 The regular statistical sources do not provide a basis for reliable estimates of the data requested.

 When franchises were originally let in 1996 the purpose of the Government at the time was to give train operators full discretion and responsibility for providing resources, including drivers, to meet their obligations. In November 1998 the Government held a meeting with Railtrack and the train operating companies to discuss the poor performance of the industry and to agree a plan to deliver solutions. Part of that plan included the recruitment and training of 800 new drivers. The SRA is currently encouraging train operators to recruit sufficient drivers to meet their service obligations. In some cases the extension or replacement of franchise agreements will enable the SRA to contractualise measures to ensure adequate numbers.

In the meantime, we want to encourage people to apply the guidelines and use the results to settle disputes with their neighbours amicably. We are preparing a leaflet specifically designed for this purpose, which we expect to launch in the spring.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20130w06.html_spnew1"><B> Dr. Whitehead: </B> 
 The audit arrangements for all executive non-departmental public bodies (NDPBs) are listed in the annual publication "Public Bodies". No audit details are provided for the other types of NDPB as their spend is usually negligible. In the majority of cases the National Audit Office (i.e. the Comptroller and Auditor General) is the external auditor. However, some executive NDPBs employ commercial auditors and, in such cases, the NAO has been granted inspection rights.
<P>

<a name="20130w06.html_para0">The Audit Commission rarely audits NDPB accounts. It does not keep records to enable it to identify separately any NDPB audits. The Audit Commission has only gained responsibility for auditing NDPB accounts when there has been a round of local government reorganisation and where some residuary or stand-alone bodies have been created by statute, which are treated by their founding legislation as local authorities, for the purposes of the Audit Commission Act 1998.

 Local government has no statutory powers to influence the spending and policy of NDPB's that have branches at local level.

 The new extension of the Tyne and Wear metro runs, in part, along existing mainline network. Therefore, HSE has required all of the signals on the metro extension to be fitted with an automatic train protection system (Train Protection and Warning System) similar to those fitted to the rest of this stretch of the mainline network. This is to ensure that all trains that pass a signal at danger are automatically brought to a halt.

<a name="20130w08.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 The current service level agreement between Ordnance Survey and local authorities took effect on 1 April 1999 and will continue until 31 March 2004. This five year agreement covers a range of organisations including county councils, borough councils, district councils, fire and police authorities and national parks.
<P>

<a name="20130w08.html_para0">The agreement allows for the provision of both large and small scale mapping to all participating organisations. The benefits of the service level agreement to the local authority community are wide ranging. The agreement provides a vehicle from which local authorities are able to obtain digital and paper mapping with both ease and speed. This has led to the widespread use of Ordnance Survey digital map data across the local government sector for use in their support of the local community. This widespread take up of Ordnance Survey's map data also ensures consistency of use across local government.

 The National Tramway Museum and six other major independent museums are among the museums and galleries whose collections have been recognised as being of pre-eminent importance under the Designated Museums Scheme. The Designated Museums Challenge Fund, which has provided &#163;15 million for designated museums over the period 1999&#150;2000 to 2001&#150;02, will continue with a further &#163;10 million to be awarded in 2002&#150;03 and 2003&#150;04.

 Under the UK's broadcasting arrangements, responsibility for what is broadcast on television rests with the broadcasters and the broadcasting regulatory bodies. Television advertising is subject to regulation by the Independent Television Commission (ITC) and broadcasters must comply with their codes of advertising standards and practices.
<P>

<a name="20130w10.html_para2">The general principle governing advertising to children is that, at times when large numbers of children are likely to be viewing, no product or service may be advertised, and no method of advertising may be used, which might result in harm to them physically, mentally or morally; and no method of advertising may be employed which takes advantage of the natural credulity and sense of loyalty of children (regarded as those aged 15 and under).

 The recent paper "Consultation on Media Ownership Rules" announced that the Government will bring forward legislation to allow religious bodies to hold a local digital sound programme licence. The paper also invited views on whether the restrictions on ownership of other terrestrial licences by religious bodies should be relaxed, and we are currently considering the responses. The Government will publish details of their proposals in the draft Communications Bill which we expect to publish this spring.

[31172]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20130w10.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 The Government believe that the Central Council of Physical Recreation's Voluntary Code on Broadcasting has been a great success since it was launched in 1996. Governing bodies in cricket, both codes of rugby, and other major sports have signed the code, and many invest rather more than the minimum of 5 per cent. of broadcasting income which it stipulates. Football's investments under the code have been successfully channelled through the Football Foundation since July 2000. The broadcasting provisions of the code apply to all signatories; these safeguard secondary, free- to-air television coverage of many major sports events.

Project operators draw down funds from distributing bodies, and distributing bodies from the National Lottery Distribution Fund (NLDF), when they are needed. Much depends on the nature and size of individual projects, the terms on which individual distributing bodies offer grant to particular projects and the arrangements agreed between the distributing body and the project operator.

 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State met chairs of the National Lottery distributing bodies on 24 January. The distribution of National Lottery proceeds, and the Government's wish to see the National Lottery Distribution Fund (NLDF) balance fall, were agenda items.
<P>

<a name="20130w11.html_para0">The Department is considering, with the distributing bodies, a range of measures which might facilitate a faster release of the 92 per cent. of NLDF funds that are committed to projects. These include revising financial directions to permit advance payment for low risk projects and, to help applicants get their projects under way more quickly, taking a more flexible approach to partnership funding and providing more funding for project planning.

<P>

<a name="20130w11.html_para1">The Parliamentary Data and Video Network (PDVN) consists of interconnected systems hosted on a large number of servers. Since 31 August 2001, the Parliamentary Data and Video Network (PDVN) has suffered three major failures affecting the whole of the 



<P>
<P><I>30 Jan 2002 : Column 341W</I><P>
network. These occurred on 3 October 2001, 20 November 2001 and 21 November 2001. The PDVN had previously remained stable for 19 months. Subsequent investigation into these failures, which were related, identified saturation and overload of Central Processing Units as an immediate cause. Action was taken to rectify this and other faults. The Parliamentary Communications Directorate (PCD) has since asked the firm responsible for maintaining the PDVN to provide quicker on-site assistance in the event of a major failure. PCD staff have also been trained to respond more swiftly.
<P>

<a name="20130w11.html_para2">There have been other smaller-scale interruptions to individual services offered on the PDVN since 31 August. Some of these have occurred because of routine maintenance at weekends. If the hon. Gentleman has concerns about a specific service failure, he may like to raise them with the Director of Communications, Mr. Matthew Taylor.

<P>
<a name="20130w11.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Andrew Turner: </B>

<P>
<P>
<a name="20130w11.html_spnew4"><B> Michael Fabricant: </B> 
 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="20130w11.html_para3">The Parliamentary Communications Directorate does not routinely collate information on login times. However, poor performance with regard to the length of time it takes to log into the Parliamentary Data and Video Network (PDVN), whether from within the Parliamentary Estate or from elsewhere, will result in an increase in the number of calls to the Parliamentary Communications Helpdesk (extension 2001). Defects are then identified, enabling action to be taken.
<P>

<a name="20130w11.html_para4">The Citrix service which enables remote access to the PDVN has been enhanced over the past 12 months. Reliability has improved and login times have been reduced. However, if the hon. Gentleman is having difficulties, he might like to raise the matter with the Director of Communications, Mr. Matthew Taylor.

<a name="20130w11.html_para5">The Information Committee regularly passes on to officials in the Parliamentary Communications Directorate feedback from Members and staff on the performance of the Parliamentary Data and Video Network (PDVN). In December 2001, the committee e-mailed a bulletin to all Members with PDVN accounts, describing issues being considered by the committee. The bulletin was also publicised in the All-Party Whip. A number of Members responded with comments and suggestions, some of which related to the performance of the PDVN. These are actively being taken forward by the committee.

 Issues relating to the Skye bridge are devolved under the Scotland Act 1998 and now fall within the responsibility of the Scottish Executive. Skye bridge was designed, built, financed and is operated under a PFI contract by Skye Bridge Ltd. (SBL). Under the Concession Agreement, signed in December 1991, SBL invested &#163;28 million (1991 prices), the bulk of which was provided by a combination of commercial bank debt, a European Investment bank loan and index-linked loan stock. This private funding is not classified as public sector borrowing.

 <i>[holding answer 21 January 2002]:</i> The development of surface links to airports should be addressed in the context of expected growth in passenger usage at Scotland's airports. The Government, jointly with the Scottish Executive, will shortly publish a consultation document on the development of air services and airports in Scotland. The results of this consultation exercise will feed into the preparation of the Government's White Paper on the future of the United Kingdom's air services and airports for the next 30 years to be published at the end of the year.

<a name="20130w12.html_para9">The Government have, with the Strategic Rail Authority and Scottish Executive, sponsored a scoping study into potential improvements in rail access to Scottish airports.

The study is examining options for direct rail links into Glasgow and Edinburgh airports.

 All regions of England are potentially at risk from agricultural nitrogen pollution of water supplies. Under the nitrates directive (91/676/EEC) 66 nitrate vulnerable zones (NVZs) were originally designated in 1996 for the protection of current drinking water supplies in England from agricultural nitrate pollution. Following a European Court of Justice judgment in 2000, we now need to designate NVZs for the protection of all waters in England. These include surface and groundwaters which could be used as water supplies in the future. The minimum designations are now required to complete implementation of the directive, and on which we are currently consulting, include proposed NVZ areas in every region of England.

The estimates in the table are based on information from the DEFRA annual survey of municipal waste management. The information is not available by constituency. The most commonly recycled material in all English regions, by all forms of household recyclable collections is paper and card, which constitutes over 60 per cent. of total recyclable materials. It is not possible to accurately quantify the least commonly recycled material.The Government have set a challenging target to increase the recycling of municipal waste to 25 per cent. of household waste by 2005. To ensure that all local authorities contribute to achieving this target, the Government have set each authority in England statutory performance standards for recycling and composting of household waste. They have also encouraged best value networks and issued guidance on joint municipal waste management strategies.<P>

<P>
<a name="20130w14.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 24 January 2002]:</i> Liability in respect of any damage from GM crops, including that to organic status, is being addressed at both European and UK levels. The European Commission is developing proposals for an environmental liability regime covering a range of activities, including the release of GMOs.
<P>

<a name="20130w14.html_para4">In order to minimise any impact from GM crops in the Farm Scale Evaluations (FSEs) on nearby conventional or organic farms, separation distances are used to help ensure that cross-pollination does not exceed 1 per cent. In many cases it will be much lower. We are working with organic sector bodies and the biotechnology and farming industry body, SCIMAC, to ensure that this situation continues in the final year of the evaluations.
<P>

<a name="20130w14.html_para5">I am also considering whether domestic liability provisions for GM crops might be needed in the light of the Commission's wider proposals. The benefits of a domestic regime might include increased reassurance for the public and nearby farmers, an effective mechanism for correcting environmental damage, and ensuring that producers of GM seeds and growers of GM crops take proper account of their potential impact on non-GM production. In the meantime, an individual who feels they have suffered a loss due to the release of a GMO may be able to commence an action in the courts.

<P>
<a name="20130w14.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 We plan to reduce the impact of coastal erosion by investing in coastal defences in the highest risk areas. However as the bulk of expenditure is ultimately met by taxpayers, both DEFRA and the coast protection authorities have a responsibility to ensure that value for money is obtained when funding works.
<P>

<a name="20130w14.html_para6">This Department provides grants for flood defence and coast protection capital works, and associated studies, which meet essential technical, economic and environmental criteria and achieve an appropriate priority score (based on departmental priorities, urgency and benefit:cost ratio). Further to increases in the last two Spending Reviews, additional funding of &#163;51 million over the four years from 2000&#150;01 was announced in November 2000 following the severe flooding. In all DEFRA flood and coastal defence funding is set to increase from &#163;66 million in 2000&#150;01 to &#163;114 million in 2003&#150;04. Funding for future years will be considered in the Spending Review process. Responsibility for deciding which projects to promote and their timing rests with the operating authorities. The operating authority for each area draws on its local knowledge to decide what needs to be done.

 This Department has policy responsibility for coastal erosion in England. No estimates have been made of the cost of the effects of coastal erosion for each of the last seven years. However DEFRA commissioned research into a National Appraisal of Assets at Risk from Flooding and Coastal Erosion and the outcome was published in September 2001. This research estimated that the "do nothing" annual average damage was &#163;84.3 million per annum but investment to date had reduced this to &#163;16.6 million per annum.

<P>
<a name="20130w15.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B>

<P>
<P><I>30 Jan 2002 : Column 355W</I><P>
the most energy intensive sectors set challenging targets for reductions in energy consumption in return for an 80 per cent. reduction in the levy. The proceeds of the levy will be recycled to industry through a 0.3 percentage point reduction in national insurance contributions, and also through the provision of funds for the Carbon Trust.
<P>

<a name="20130w15.html_para0">The Carbon Trust is a not-for-profit organisation, set up by the Government and the devolved Administrations to develop a clear framework to encourage the use of low-carbon technologies in the industry sector. The trust will take over management of the Government's Energy Efficiency Best Practice that has been running since 1989 as the UK's main source of energy efficiency information, providing best practice advice and support to organisations in the public and private sectors. The trust will also manage the enhanced capital allowance scheme that gives 100 per cent. first year capital allowances for businesses investing in approved energy saving equipment. Additionally the Carbon Trust will develop a low carbon innovation programme that will support new and emerging low- carbon technologies.
<P>

<a name="20130w15.html_para1">Combined heat and power is another vital component of the Government's strategy to enhance the energy efficiency of the UK economy. The CHP quality assurance programme assesses "Good Quality" CHP production that is energy efficient in operation. This provides a passport to climate change levy exemptions and other benefits which encourage the take-up of CHP and contribute to the Government's 2010 target of 10,000 megawatts of installed Good Quality CHP.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

Published data from the General Household Survey (Table 7.10 Living in Britain 2000).<P>

Weighted bases shown here differ slightly from the published table because the published table includes two other measures of self-reported sickness. Bases for each measure differ because of the varying number of "no answers" to each measure. In these instances, the smallest base only is shown.<P>

Percentages are based on data weighted to compensate for differential non response. The weighted figures give a grossed up population estimate.<P>

Figures for Scotland and Wales are included in the ranked list, an overall figure for England is given separately. <P>

<P>
<a name="20130w19.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Andrew Smith: </B> 
 The criterion for assessing the effectiveness of investment in projects is whether value for money is secured. The Treasury's guidance on project appraisal&#151;the "Green Book"&#151;is aimed to help Departments achieve this objective. Departments have set out their investment plans in "Departmental Investment Strategies" published in July 2000.

 EC law already allows a reduced rate of VAT for works to housing. It does not permit a reduced rate for works to other types of building, whether listed or not. However, in response to representations made by the Government, the European Commission has indicated that it will consider a reduced rate of VAT for listed places of worship in their general review of the reduced rates, which is due to take place in 2003.

 It is the responsibility of Departments to account for the management of their programmes and projects. However the Treasury has instituted a number of reforms since 1997 to improve acquisition of services through all forms of procurement, notably through setting up the Office of Government Commerce. In the area of PFI, the reforms following the two Bates reports, including guidance on standard contract terms and conditions and the establishment of Partnerships UK, together with experience gained in both public and private sectors, are believed to have resulted in reduced procurement costs.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what continuing role there will be for the Special Operations Executive Adviser on the transfer of the remaining SOE files to the Public Record Office.  [32267]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20130w21.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 The process involved in the final stages of preparing the SOE personal files for release to the PRO mean that it is no longer practicable for the SOE adviser to deal satisfactorily with inquiries relating to those files.
<P>

<a name="20130w21.html_para0">There being no further series of files for review and release, the SOE adviser will cease to have a function. From 15 February 2002, therefore, no further inquiries will be accepted by his office, which itself will close on 31 March 2002. With the transfer of the remaining personal files at the end of the year, public inquiries for access should be directed to the PRO.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20130w21.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 The records of the Special Operations Executive (SOE) have been released progressively since 1993. The next batch of records, covering the General and Headquarters (including America) files, has been transferred to the Public Records Office, and will be opened on 8 February 2002. The last batch of SOE records (the personal files) should be transferred around the end of 2002.

<P>
<a name="20130w21.html_spnew2"><B> Peter Hain: </B> 
 The UK remains committed to the OSCE arms embargo against both Azerbaijan and Armenia, which the UK interprets as covering all goods and technology controlled under entries in Part III of Schedule 1 to the Export of Goods (Control) Order 1994 (commonly known as the military list).
<P>

<a name="20130w21.html_para1">In March 2000 the Government approved a similar request for protective jackets for demining operations to Azerbaijan, a continuing problem.
<P>

<a name="20130w21.html_para2">While the grant of this licence constitutes an exception to the UK's interpretation of the scope of the embargo, it is in no way inconsistent with the purpose of the embargo and our continuing commitment to uphold it.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20130w21.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 The last ministerial contacts were at the OSCE Ministerial meeting in Bucharest on 3 and 4 December when the Under-Secretary of State, the hon. Member for Rotherham (Mr. McShane) met the Georgian Foreign Minister; the Minister for Europe also met the Foreign Minister in London on 12 September.
<P>

<a name="20130w21.html_para3">A senior FCO official visited Georgia from 22 to 24 January and held discussions on a wide range of issues with the Georgian Government. The Deputy Foreign Minister is coming to London for Political/Military discussions on 6 and 7 February. We will continue to support democracy and development in Georgia and assist the Georgian Government to build on the reforms they have stated.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20130w21.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. MacShane: </B> 
 The Abuja text sets out clear benchmarks on the rule of law, ending political violence and intimidation and promoting basic human rights. The Government of Zimbabwe has paid scant regard to the commitments.

 The six month pilot continues to schedule and will be withdrawn as planned on 1 March 2002.

<P>
<a name="20130w21.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 No formal assessment has yet been made of the trial. The outcome of the pilot will be fully evaluated by the Post Office, by those organisations participating in the pilot, and by the Government participating as a whole. The pilot ends on 1 March. The full evaluation report is expected in June.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20130w21.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 Operational management of the pilot project is a matter for Post Office Limited. I understand that since its inception in August 2001, the trial has been publicised by means of paid advertisements and editorial features in the local newspapers and radio. Leaflets have been distributed through a variety of channels including doctors surgeries and social security offices and presentations have been made to a variety of local groups. The publicity has continued since October 2001 with material adapted to include case studies and quotations from users of the service. A leaflet drop directly to households is planned for later in January.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20130w21.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 All previous Launch Investment contracts with BAE Systems have been transferred to Airbus UK. These contracts provide for the repayment of Launch Investment with a rate of return in the form of levies on sales of the products developed. BAES no longer has such commitments to the Department of Trade and Industry. Comprehensive information on BAE Systems' outstanding commitments to the Government cannot be provided without incurring disproportionate costs.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20130w21.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 The Department publishes conversion efficiencies for power stations operated by major power producers in Table 5.9 of the Digest of UK Energy Statistics. Efficiencies of CHP systems are given in Table 6A of the Digest and electrical efficiencies within CHP systems can be calculated from the data in Table 6.8. Conversion efficiencies of electricity from biofuels, onshore wind and hydro can be calculated from data given in Chapter 7; by convention, energy inputs to wind and hydro are equivalent to the electricity produced.

<P>

 <i>[holding answer 25 January 2002]:</i> The Department published estimates of the cost of gas- fired generation in the 1998 White Paper (Cm 4071, paragraph 5.38).
<P>

<a name="20130w21.html_para4">The last study of nuclear costs was published in 1995 and indicated that generation costs would be around 3.9p/kWh. Since then nuclear generators have produced generation cost estimates for new designs of around 2.6p/kWh.
<P>

<a name="20130w21.html_para5">Estimates of the cost of renewables technologies are contained in a report by the Energy Technology Support Unit (New and Renewables Energy Prospects in the 21st Century: Supporting Analysis) published in March 1999. This report is available in the Library of the House.
<P>

<a name="20130w21.html_para6">The Department has also contributed to the work of the energy review being undertaken by the Performance and Innovation Unit at the Cabinet Office, which has looked at the cost of new nuclear generation. A copy of their paper which covers estimates for a range of generation technologies (including onshore wind) can be found at: http://www.cabinet-office.gov.uk/innovation/2001/energy/ 2050.pdf.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what representations she has received about energy providers poaching domestic customers from other companies; and if she will make a statement.  [29755]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20130w22.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 I have received a large number of representations about domestic gas and electricity competition. A competitive market requires consumers to have access to offers from a number of suppliers, to be able to compare those offers and to be able to transfer between suppliers to make financial savings or gain improved service. It is also entirely legitimate that suppliers should promote their offers. The vast majority of contracts between suppliers and consumers are carried out in an appropriate manner, to the advantage of both. Since competition was fully introduced 14 million customers have benefited from greater choice and reduced energy prices by switching suppliers, and new entrants have been able to join the market.
<P>

<a name="20130w22.html_para0">It is important that consumers have confidence in the competitive market, and that problems that serve to weaken that market and cause distress to consumers be addressed. The problems raised in the representations made to me chiefly surround the erroneous transfer of gas and electricity supply, whether by administrative or data error or dishonest sales practice. It is the responsibility of the industry regulator, the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets (Ofgem), to oversee competition as a whole, and to monitor and address suppliers' performance and compliance with the range of statutory and regulatory instruments.
<P>

<a name="20130w22.html_para1">To reduce erroneous transfers, Ofgem and the Gas and Electricity Consumer Council&#151;Energywatch&#151;have developed the Erroneous Transfer Customer Charter. All domestic gas and electricity suppliers have accepted this charter, which came into force on 1 January. The charter should ensure that consumers transferred in error are restored to their original supplier swiftly, and with the minimum of inconvenience. Ofgem will review the industry's response to the charter in August 2002. If it feels that the response has been inadequate, or that insufficient progress has been made, it will consider the use of regulatory measures. These include the imposition of standards of performance (which can carry requirements for automatic compensation) and the modification of supply licence conditions. Ofgem will shortly also have the powers to levy financial penalties on companies for breach of licence conditions.
<P>

<a name="20130w22.html_para2">In addition, in November 2001, I wrote to all gas and electricity suppliers to express my support for the charter, and to stress the need for all suppliers to eradicate sales malpractices, which cause distress and inconvenience to consumers and bring the competitive market into disrepute. I made it clear that, if the problems surrounding sales malpractices were not dealt with, we would have to look again at how best consumers could be protected.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20130w22.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 The Manufacturing Advisory Service (MAS) is being set up to help increase the competitiveness of UK manufacturing (especially SMEs), by the transfer of knowledge, new technologies, best practice methods and processes, and facilitating innovative training, education and skills development. Although the MAS will not offer specific advice on the climate change levy (CCL), it will encourage manufacturers to look at the efficiency and cost effectiveness of their energy usage and be able to signpost businesses to the relevant organisations for this. HM Customs and Excise provides advice on administrative arrangements for the CCL; the Carbon Trust will provide advice through the Energy Efficiency Best Practice Programme which will cover information on cost-effective, low carbon technologies and other measures, including information on the enhanced capital allowances scheme for investments in energy saving technologies; while the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) handles the climate change agreements including advice on eligibility for these.

<a name="20130w22.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 The climate change levy is an environmental protection measure designed to avoid damaging the competitiveness of UK manufacturing. The levy's impact on individual manufacturing businesses will depend on the extent to which they take advantage of the various levy exemptions, the new scheme of enhanced capital allowances for energy efficiency, and energy support from the new Carbon Trust; and whether their sites qualify for a discount from the levy. Eligible sites in energy intensive industries are receiving an 80 per cent. levy discount where they have committed to challenging energy saving targets in negotiated agreements with the Government.

<P>
<a name="20130w24.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Wilson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 28 January 2002]:</i> The Government are providing substantial support to industry for the development of renewable forms of energy.
<P>

<a name="20130w24.html_para1">Introducing the new Renewables Obligation, exempting renewables from the climate change levy and protecting existing Non-fossil Fuel Obligation (NFFO) contracts will together create a long-term market incentive for renewables worth over &#163;1 billion per year by 2010.
<P>

<a name="20130w24.html_para2">We are underpinning the obligation with direct Government funding for renewables worth over &#163;260 million between 2001 and 2004. We are setting up extensive capital grants programmes, in particular for offshore wind and energy crops projects, initiating a major photovoltaics demonstration programme, and boosting research and development.
<P>

<a name="20130w24.html_para3">We recently introduced an order to allow locational flexibility for NFFO 3, 4 and 5 projects that have not yet been commissioned. This will allow more appropriate locations to be found in order to overcome problems in securing planning permission.
<P>

<a name="20130w24.html_para4">We have initiated studies of each UK region's capacity to generate electricity from renewable sources. Once all these assessments are completed, it is expected that specific regional targets for renewable energy will be adopted across the UK.
<P>

<a name="20130w24.html_para5">The Government are also exploring the scope for upgrading the electricity distribution system to enable the UK's huge renewable energy resources to be exploited to the full. For example, we have commissioned an initial 



<P>

<P>
<a name="20130w24.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Randall: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what percentage of electricity was provided by renewable carbon free energy sources at <i>(a)</i> January 1999, <i>(b)</i> January 2000, <i>(c)</i> January 2001 and <i>(d)</i> January 2002; and what her forecast is for each of the next 10 years.  [31360]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20130w24.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 The percentages of electricity generated in the United Kingdom from hydro, wind, solar photovoltaics, wave and tidal sources in 1998, 1999, 2000 were 1.7 per cent., 1.7 per cent. and 1.6 per cent., respectively. The percentage declined in 2000 because of the lower level of hydro output in that year resulting from lower precipitation.
<P>

<a name="20130w24.html_para6">The Government's target is that by 2010, 10 per cent. of licensed UK electricity sales will come from renewable sources eligible for the Renewables Obligation. It will be for suppliers to determine the proportion of the 10 per cent. which comes from individual renewable sources.

 Yes. The release of all young persons into the community from prison establishments is planned through a series of meetings. These meetings form an action plan and begin on reception and conclude prior to release. A support plan will be drawn up to enable the young person to be supported on discharge. Attendees at these meetings include sentence planning staff, community supervising officers and families. To date, 34 per cent. have been attended by families.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department (1) what representations have been made to other EU member states, to shorten the period between arrest, detention in custody and charge in their jurisdictions;  [29403]

<P>

 None. These are matters for the competent authorities in each member state, including the United Kingdom. Under Article 5 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which is binding on all member states, arrested or detained persons must be brought promptly before a judge or other officer authorised by law to exercise judicial power, and they are 



<P>
<P><I>30 Jan 2002 : Column 393W</I><P>
entitled to a trial within a reasonable time or to release pending a trial. Persons who are deprived of their liberty by arrest or detention are also entitled to take proceedings by which "the lawfulness of their detention shall be decided speedily by a court". The European arrest warrant cannot be used for the purpose of interrogating a suspect, but only for the purpose of conducting a criminal prosecution or executing a custodial sentence or detention order.

The guidance requires information about the number of registered sex offenders in each police area to be published. This will take place from June 2002 and local systems are being put in place to deliver it. Until these systems are in place such information could only be obtained by a specific exercise by the particular police force concerned which would entail disproportionate costs.

 <i>[holding answer 23 January 2002]:</i> In the year 2000, 10,559 persons were released from prisons in England and Wales on temporary licence. Licences can be given for a short period, for example, a day to attend a funeral, or may be given several times over a longer period, for example where a prisoner is working outside of the prison and for the purpose of resettlement and preparation for release. A total of 256,837 temporary release licences were granted over the year 2000. 318 of these were failures, the inmate did not return to prison at the time that they were required to. This represents a failure rate of 0.1 per cent. of licences granted and was the lowest rate since 1991.

 In "Quangos: Opening the Doors", published in June 1998, the Government stated that they would ensure that a new non-departmental public body is only set up where it can be demonstrated that this is the most cost-effective and appropriate means of carrying out the given function.

 In "Quangos: Opening the Doors", published in June 1998, the Government stated that future editions of "Public Bodies" would include a description of the functions of each body listed. In line with this, a description of each individual body's terms of reference was included in "Public Bodies 1998" and has been similarly included in subsequent editions.

 The payment of civil defence grants to local authorities supports their planning of generic responses to all local disasters or crises, which includes their contingency planning for responses to terrorist activities.

 A number of baseline security measures exist to try to reduce the likelihood that thefts will occur and to limit the scope for fraud.

<P>

<P>

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. Information for 2000&#150;02 and 2002&#150;03 is not yet available and as a result it is not possible to arrive at a projection.<P>

2. Figures for 1990&#150;91 to 1998&#150;99 include grant maintained schools. Figures for 1999&#150;2000 include ex-GM schools.<P>

3. Expenditure data for 1999&#150;2000 is taken from S52 outturn statements completed by local education authorities and returned to DfES. Data for all previous years is taken from DETR's Revenue Outturn Returns.<P>

4. For the years 1990&#150;91 to 1992&#150;93, Net Current Expenditure after recharges was not recorded in the RO1. Net Recurrent Expenditure is used for these years. Therefore, per pupil figures for these years may not be strictly comparable with the later years.<P>

5. SSA figures implicitly cover funding for Special Schools, and there is no split available for special schools.<P>

6. The NCE figures provided here are for pre primary/primary and secondary only. Hence the two sets of figures are not comparable<P>

7. Pupil numbers used in calculating per pupil figures are financial year averages, based on January Annual School Census returns.<P>

8. Pupil numbers for secondary schools for 1990&#150;91, 1991&#150;92 and 1992&#150;93 include sixth form colleges; these ceased to be classified as schools in April 1993.<P>

9. Cambridgeshire was re-organised in 1998&#150;99.<P>

 The Department for Education and Skills continues to work closely with the Department of Transport, Local Government and the Regions, the Department of Health and other members of the School Travel Advisory Group to promote alternatives to the car for the journey to school. We have also produced practical guides and software to assist local authorities and schools in introducing school travel plans and encouraging more sustainable school travel.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills if she will <i>(a)</i> set out the criteria for allocation of special grant to authorities most affected by the transfer of funding for sixth form provision to the Learning and Skills Council and <i>(b)</i> list the amount of special grant to be made available to each local education authority.  [32088]<P>

<P>
<a name="20130w29.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 The special grant will be paid to local education authorities: <i>(a)</i> whose post-16 SSA (after their Learning and Skills Council allocation for sixth form provision has been deducted) is less than 7.5 per cent. of their original post-16 SSA, and the grant will be such as would make up the post 16-SSA to 7.5 per cent. of the original post-16 SSA; or <i>(b)</i> who have less than 85 per cent. of their increase in education SSA (before the LSC transfer) available for purposes other than the increase in sixth form funding compared with the total of 2002&#150;03 real terms guarantees for the authority, and the grant will be such as would make 85 per cent. of that increase available. The table sets out the allocations of special grant by LEA.

 There are many factors involved in the effective administration of housing benefit. There is therefore no single objective measure by which to judge local authorities' achievements as best or worst overall.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20130w29.html_spnew4"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 Our reforms to bereavement benefits introduced in April 2001 concentrate the help available where and when it is needed most&#151;on immediate needs and on families with children. For the first time these benefits are available equally to both men and women.
<P>

<a name="20130w29.html_para2">Immediate help with costs arising on bereavement is provided by a lump sum bereavement payment of &#163;2,000&#151;double the old widow's payment of &#163;1,000. There is a weekly benefit for widowed parents who satisfy the qualifying conditions. A bereavement allowance is also available for 12 months, to give widows and widowers aged 45 or over without dependants time to adjust to their new circumstances.
<P>

<a name="20130w29.html_para3">We keep all our policies under review but we have no plans to introduce a bereavement pension for either widows or widowers.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. Private income has been assumed to mean any income other than that provided by state benefits. The estimates have been given for all pensioner units and are from the Family Resources Survey 1999&#150;2000.<P>

2. Pensioner units are defined as single (non-cohabiting) people over state pension age (65 and over for men, 60 and over for women) and couples (married or cohabiting) where the man is over state pension age.<P>

3. Proportions have been rounded to the nearest 1 per cent. and numbers to the nearest 10,000. Due to small sample sizes some figures are uncertain.<P>

4. The FRS relies on self-reporting of private income and hence estimates are subject to error.<P>

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. All costs are for Great Britain.<P>

2. The costs of earnings uprating of the MIG are rounded to the nearest one billion pounds from 2010 onwards. Costs are not available for every year requested.<P>

3. The costs of earnings uprating of the MIG assumes that pensioners' incomes grow over the long term at the same pace as average earnings and the distribution of earnings is the same over time in earnings terms. Average earnings are assumed to grow in line with Treasury economic assumptions until the end of the Parliament and then 1.5 per cent. above inflation over time.<P>

4. The costs of earnings uprating of the MIG are calculated as compared to price uprating. Because pensioners' incomes tend to grow over time faster than inflation, the costs of the MIG under price uprating would fall dramatically over time as ever fewer pensioners would be entitled to ever smaller amounts. The costs of increases in the basic state pension and state pension are net of income related benefit savings that would be generated by these increases.<P>

5. The costs of increases in the basic state pension and state second pension are net of income related benefit savings that would be generated by these increases.<P>

6. The costs given for earnings uprating of second state pension assume that expenditure on SERPS (accruals up to 2001&#150;02) would not be affected.<P>

7. The costs of earnings uprating of the state second pension only begin to become significant by 2015 because S2P only begins accruing in 2002&#150;03 and therefore the amount of S2P in payment will be negligible for some time after that.<P>

8. The costs shown for state second pension in the table have been calculated based on the estimated costs of S2P which were shown in the report by the Government Actuary on the Financial Effects of the National Insurance Fund of the Child Support, Pensions and Social Security Bill 1999 (Cm 4573). The costs shown are the increase in expenditure over and above the baseline projected S2P expenditure shown in this report.<P>

9. It has been assumed that the basic state pension and state pension changes would not happen together. If they did, there would be an interaction because the lower earnings limit is linked to the basic state pension. This means that the cost of S2P would be reduced if the basic state pension and, therefore, the LEL were raised.<P>

10. The pensioner population is assumed to grow according to GAD's central population growth estimates.<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="20130w30.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Nicholas Brown: </B> 
 A major goal of the Government is to help those people who become sick or disabled and who can work to do so, either by retaining their job or by rehabilitating to new employment. The Government recognise the important role that general practitioners play in this area through the treatment they provide to patients of working age and through the advice they provide as certifying medical practitioners.
<P>

<a name="20130w30.html_para10">This Department's Chief Medical Adviser issues guidance to GPs in relation to their role as certifying medical practitioners which stresses the need for clinical management which will encourage and support work retention and rehabilitation. In conjunction with the medical professional bodies this Department has developed training material for GP registrars. This material, along with further information for established GPs, such as evidence based recovery times, can be found on the Department's website www.dwp.gov.uk/medical. This information is also available in the House of Commons Library. We have also supported a project by Staffordshire university to develop a distance learning course for GPs in occupational health and rehabilitation matters. We are planning to develop additional on-line educational tools for GPs which will support work retention and rehabilitation.

 <i>[holding answer 17 January 2002]:</i> Research in England does not answer this specific question. However, recent research in the United States of America suggests that the average life expectancy of those with rheumatoid arthritis is shortened by about four years for women and eight years for men. Although modern medical and surgical treatment have done a great deal to improve the quality of life for people with rheumatoid arthritis, evidence suggests that there is still room for the development of more effective treatments.
<P>

<a name="20130w33.html_para4">The National Institute for Clinical Excellence is currently considering the clinical use of etanercept and infliximab as second-line treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in adults. The appraisal is expected to be issued in March 2002.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what steps he is taking to increase awareness of the symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning among the medical profession.  [28055]<P>

 <i>[holding answer 17 January 2002]:</i> In September 1998, the then Chief Medical Officer, Sir Kenneth Calman and the then Chief Nursing Officer, Mrs. Yvonne Moores published a letter "Carbon Monoxide: The Forgotten Killer". The letter pulled together the most current information available on carbon monoxide and was forwarded to community nurses, midwives, health visitors and general practitioners, who are most likely to be aware of patients' living conditions and so can identify those at increased risk. This letter is currently being revised for re-issue and will be circulated soon.
<P>

<a name="20130w33.html_para5">The Department is also hoping to forward a video tape, prepared for the Health and Safety Executive, to all GP surgeries. This video tape highlights the symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning and advises medical practitioners on how to diagnose possible cases of poisoning.

This includes the role to be played by the New Opportunities Fund which, later this year, will invite applications for finance in support of projects to assist children with life threatening illnesses.

<a name="20130w34.html_para1">Funding available from primary care trusts for services provided by children's hospices is subject to local negotiation. Guidance was issued in February 1998, "Evaluation of the Pilot Project Programme for Children with Life Threatening Illnesses" which addresses the range of options available including hospice care. Regional offices of the Department have been asked to work with health professionals and agencies to identify current service provision and any gaps in this provision, with a view to obtaining a better strategic fit.
<P>

<a name="20130w34.html_para2">As we develop the National Service Framework (NSF) for children we will consider the needs of disabled children, including those whose disability is sadly of a life threatening nature and for whom respite care at a children's hospice is the option of choice. Francine Bates, chief executive of Contact-A-Family, is chairing the Disabled Child Working Group, one of six working groups which are developing detailed advice on the content of the NSF.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health (1) how many patients of the NHS receive monitored dosage medicines;  [28654]

<UL>(2) how many patients of the NHS on monitored dosage medicines do not get free prescriptions.  [28653]<P></UL>

<a name="20130w34.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 Monitored dosage systems and other multi-compartment medicines compliance aids are widely used, especially by residents of care homes. We do not, however, hold any information centrally about the number of national health service patients whose medicines are dispensed in this way, nor about how many of those patients are entitled to free prescriptions.

 We are committed to ensure best practice in resuscitation decision-making throughout the national health service.

<P>

<a name="20130w35.html_para1">One of the basic principles of health care is that a competent patient has the right under common law to give or withhold consent to examination or treatment. In the case of patients who are not capable of consenting to treatment, and in the absence of a valid advance refusal of treatment, it is a doctor's duty to act in the best interests of the patient concerned. Decisions must be made on a case by case basis.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health, pursuant to the oral statement of the Under- Secretary of State for Health, the hon. Member for Salford (Ms Blears), on 20 November 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 62&#150;66WH, if he will provide references for the well-documented histories of traditional use of herbal

remedies in Europe; and if he will list those herbal products which are able to demonstrate a history of 30 years on the market.  [29521]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20130w35.html_spnew3"><B> Yvette Cooper </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 22 January 2002]:</i> The European Commission's proposals for a directive on the registration of traditional herbal medicinal products include provision for a positive list of herbal substances, which will include any information necessary for their safe use. Where a traditional herbal medicine was within the parameters of that positive list it would not be necessary for applicants to demonstrate evidence of traditional use. Pending negotiations on the directive, the likely timetable for the development of such a list is not yet clear.
<P>

<a name="20130w35.html_para4">Alternatively, under the published proposals, applicants would be able to produce bibliographic or expert evidence of traditional use for herbal medicinal products. Such products have been used extensively in the United Kingdom and elsewhere in the European Union for many years, in the form both of individual remedies made up by herbalists and of manufactured products placed on the market by companies. There is a very wide range of possible sources which, taken together as necessary, potentially could provide the required evidence. These include: authoritative literature on herbalism; the practical evidence of numerous licensed or unlicensed manufactured products on the market in many EU member states; the long-standing lists of herbal medicines accepted as traditional by regulatory authorities in a number of member states; and the testimony of recognised experts on herbalism. This last source may be particularly helpful in confirming the patterns of usage of combinations of herbal ingredients.
<P>

<a name="20130w35.html_para5">Our aim on this issue would be to minimise the regulatory impact on applicants of demonstrating traditional use, consistent with complying with legal requirements. The Medicines Control Agency intends to hold dialogue with the herbal sector with a view to developing guidance or criteria which would help meet this objective. Until these discussions have taken place, we think it would be premature to attempt to define specific acceptable sources in more detail.

 <i>[holding answer 23 January 2002]:</i> Coventry's personal social services standard spending assessment increases in 2002&#150;03 by about 4 per cent. compared to the national average increase of about 5 per cent. Coventry's increase is below the national average mainly because its population has decreased, whereas the national population has increased.

If the patient is being discharged from a hospital, responsibility for arranging transport usually lies with the hospital. The actual transport is provided either by a national health service ambulance trust or other organisation commissioned by the hospital for that purpose.
