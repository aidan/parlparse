<a name="40318w01.html_wqn0"><B> Huw Irranca-Davies: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will ensure that the Arctic campaign veterans, who do not qualify for the Atlantic Star due to length of service restrictions receive some recognition of their service.  [162158]<P>

<a name="40318w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Caplin: </B> 
 All armed forces personnel who completed 28 days' operational service were eligible to receive the War Medal 1939&#150;45. This included service on the convoys to Northern Russia. Any service curtailed by death, injury or capture also qualified for the award. There will always be those who fail to meet the qualifying period for a campaign medal for some reason or another. This does not signify that their service is not appreciated nor justify the institution of an alternative award.

<a name="40318w01.html_wqn1"><B> Llew Smith: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what initiatives have been taken by AWE Aldermaston to diversify out of nuclear warhead research, development and production.  [161756]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40318w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 AWE plc maintains a regular dialogue with industry and academia to encourage, within security constraints, beneficial exchanges and collaboration aimed at optimising its ability to meet its core mission of nuclear warhead research, development, production, in-service support and disposal. AWE plc's expertise in nuclear weapons inevitably has wider application; and the performance of core work can result in spin-off technology that has utility in industry and society at large. Beyond this, it is not AWE plc's function within its contract with the MOD to diversify out of the core business it is required to undertake.

However, the issues are complex in developmental terms as any change to such a highly distorted regime will bring about losers as well as winners. This complexity is amplified by the divergence

<a name="40318w02.html_para0">There was, in the Gun case, a clear prima facie breach of section 1 of the Official Secrets Act 1989. However, senior treasury counsel advised that there was no longer a realistic prospect of convicting Ms Gun. The Director of Public Prosecutions agreed. The evidential deficiency arose from the prosecution's inability, within the current statutory framework, to disprove the defence of necessity in this case.

 The Government introduced the Sexual Offences Act 2003, as one of a number of steps to improve the conviction rate for rape. Under the new Act, the test will be whether a person has a reasonable belief that the victim consented taking into account all the circumstances, including any steps he took to ascertain whether the victim consented. The Government believe that this will have an impact on rape trials because the defendant must be certain that there is consent to the sexual activity at the time in question.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40318w02.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 My Department commissioned research on the effectiveness of cycle helmets, including the relative risk of injury to cyclists with and without helmets, by way of a literature review, and this was published in November 2002 (Road Safety Research Report No. 30), a copy of which was placed in the Library. The conclusion from the review was that helmets have been found to be effective at reducing the incidence and severity of head, brain and upper facial injury, particularly for children. The report also concludes that there is evidence that compulsory helmet wearing may discourage some bicyclists leading to decreased bicycle use.
<P>

<a name="40318w02.html_para3">In addition to the periodic monitoring we carry out of the wearing rates for cycling helmets, we plan to initiate further research to explore the possible relationship between cycling casualties and cycling levels.

Noise preferential routes may in future need to be reviewed in any event in the light of the "Single Sky" proposals. Any changes which might have a significant effect on the level or distribution of noise and emissions would require prior consultation.

 Publicity campaigns to encourage use of public transport are generally taken forward by individual transport operators. The Department has focused on the provision of better transport information and in increasing consumer choice in our publicity campaigns. We have promoted "traveline", a public information number giving route and timetable information for journeys by bus, coach, train, tram, ferry and metro and will shortly be launching and promoting "Transport Direct" an interactive journey planner covering all major forms of transport.
<P>

<a name="40318w03.html_para4">Last September, the Department, together with the Department for Education, also announced a school travel campaign aimed at tackling congestion around the school run. This involves substantial funding to allow local authorities to recruit school travel advisers and publication of an 'Action Plan' to help schools promote safe and healthy travel to school. In addition, we have also worked with consumer and lifestyle press to stimulate publicity on school travel, encouraging alternatives to the use of the car.

 The UN Organisation for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) and the Government of Guinea have recently carried out a survey of refugees around the Guinean/Ivorian border. The UN OCHA has recommended that the humanitarian agencies and Guinean Government produce a co-ordinated assessment of the entire refugee problem. The findings from this should inform a wider strategy for refugees and lead to the creation of a National Humanitarian Action Plan.

<P>
<a name="40318w06.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Rammell: </B> 
 United Nation's Security Council Resolutions 1483 and 1511 envisaged a major role for the UN in building a secure future for Iraq. In particular, they mandated the UN to co-ordinate humanitarian and reconstruction assistance and to work with the Coalition Provisional Authority and the people of Iraq in developing new representative systems of government. We strongly support the re-engagement of the UN in Iraq and stand ready with our coalition partners to provide security for UN personnel and premises. We believe the UN has a vital role to play in helping to forge a consensus among Iraqis on the best way to establish an Interim Government after 30&nbsp;June 2004 and in preparing for elections in early 2005.
<P>

<a name="40318w06.html_para1">Federal issues are a matter for Iraqis to decide, including the degree of UN involvement. They will do so in the Transitional National Assembly to be elected in early 2005 and in a referendum on the draft constitution due later that year. The Transitional Administrative Law agreed by the Iraqi Governing Council on March 8 2004 recognises the administrative and legislative functions of the Kurdistan Regional Government. It also enshrines the principle that any federal system will not be based on ethnic or sectarian lines. But it leaves the final form of any federal structure to Iraqi democratic institutions to decide.

 The Commissioner does not profit from the actions of bogus collectors. His office is funded by government grant. It is a requirement of the Data Protection Act 1998 that all fees and other sums received by him in the exercise of his functions under the Act shall be paid to the Secretary of State, who in turn is required to pay them into the Consolidated Fund.
<P>

<a name="40318w06.html_para7">There are no current plans to amend the 1998 Act to enable the Commissioner to take legal action against unauthorised collectors, but the matter will be kept under review. The prosecuting authority depends on the type of legal action pursued and can be the Office of Fair Trading, Local Trading Standards Department or the Police.
<P>

<a name="40318w06.html_para8">I understand that there have to date been five successful legal actions initiated against these companies: four civil and one criminal. In the civil actions, the Office of Fair Trading has obtained final injunctions against companies and individuals under the Control of Misleading Advertisements Regulations. It has also obtained written assurances (in lieu of court action) from 14 other individuals and companies that they would no longer be involved with the publication of misleading advertisements about data protection notification services. The criminal action involved a prosecution initiated by Brent and Harrow Trading Standards Service against a company and its director under section 14 of the Trade Descriptions Act 1968. Fines totalling &#163;3,500 were imposed, plus &#163;850 in prosecution costs.
<P>

<a name="40318w06.html_para9">Section 16 of the 1998 Act sets out the "registrable particulars" which must be included in a valid application for notification. The Commissioner's own application form asks data controllers to indicate whether they consider that they are exempt but have decided to notify voluntarily. As this question is not mandatory, the Commissioner would not and could not refuse to accept an application simply because the question had not been answered. The applications submitted by the agencies do not include this non-mandatory question.

The scheme is not available to all village halls (the scheme's rules mean that projects have to be within 10 miles of a landfill tax operator's site). Grants are issued through registered environmental bodies and each will have its own priorities.

<P>

<a name="40318w08.html_para7">The scheme was reformed from 1&nbsp;April 2003. Approximately one third of funding (around &#163;47&nbsp;million) is to be made available through a reformed tax credit scheme for spending on local environment projects. Village halls, where they meet the criteria, will still be able to apply for funding. Government have no involvement in how the funding is spent. As yet, it is not possible to say what proportion will go to support village halls.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs whether she is required to take into account the application of the precautionary principle in assessing the need to make orders under section 29 of the Animal Health Act 1981 to reduce the risk to human health of any disease or organism carried in animals.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40318w08.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Although there is no universally accepted definition, the Government are committed to using the precautionary principle, which is included in the 1992 Rio Declaration on Environment and Development. The precautionary principle is one of 10 principles that guide the Government's approach to sustainable development, on which Defra takes the lead. The outline Animal Health and Welfare Strategy issued last July also confirmed that all Government decisions on animal health and welfare should be guided by the precautionary principle.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs pursuant to the Answer of 28&nbsp;January 2004, <i>Official Report,</i> column 380W on badgers, what numerical value she attributes to the phrase a few kilometres; and whether badgers forage from setts a few kilometres outside Krebs areas into farms within those areas and evade trapping.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40318w08.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 It is difficult to attach a numerical value to the distance travelled by foraging badgers as it will vary considerably. Badgers normally forage within their social group territory limits, and the distance they travel to do so will depend on the size of the territory, which will be determined by the availability of food and the quality of the habitat.
<P>

<a name="40318w08.html_para8">It is possible that badgers from social groups occupying setts outside Randomised Badger Culling Trial areas could forage on farms within them. If they did, they might or might not be captured during trapping operations.

<P>
<a name="40318w08.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The recent review of badger licensing procedures was subject of a public consultation to ensure that everyone with an interest in badgers had the opportunity to contribute their views. Furthermore, as part of this exercise, the Department surveyed the views and experiences of 300 randomly selected people who had applied for a licence under the Protection of Badgers Act, 1992 in the previous year.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40318w08.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 There are no figures currently available for the number of badgers killed each year on roads. The most widely quoted estimate, of 50,000 animals each year <sup>1</sup> , relates to the 1980s, but road casualties are probably broadly similar today.
<P>

<a name="40318w08.html_para9">A four-year pilot project (called 'Mammals on Roads') is currently under way. This aims to carry out a national road kill survey of selected mammal species (including badgers), calibrating road kill numbers with species abundance in various habitats and assessing the power of the survey to detect population change. In the project's June 2003 newsletter, it is reported that in 2001 and 2002 approximately four dead badgers were reported for every 1,000 miles of road surveyed.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment has been made of whether TB-diseased badgers bathing in cattle water troughs is a mechanism of TB transmission.  [158336]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40318w08.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 There is no evidence that badgers bathe in cattle water troughs, although ongoing research by the Central Science Laboratory indicates that they may drink from them. This research, which will report to Defra in December 2005, will indicate the relative frequency with which badgers visit cattle water troughs, and at what times of year, as a first step towards identifying their role in the risk of transmission of <i>M. bovis</i> from badgers to cattle.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40318w08.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 It is not currently known what level of infection in either badgers or deer constitutes a threat to their welfare, or a risk to cattle. Consequently, it is not possible to identify a 'tolerable' level in these terms.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what new advice she will give to farmers on the <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;design and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;positioning of cattle feed troughs following discovery that badgers can access troughs previously thought inaccessible.  [157934]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40318w08.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Changes in trough design might be appropriate. Recent work has established that badgers are capable of climbing into feed troughs set at 115cm above ground level, at which height they are inaccessible to cattle. It is also difficult to position troughs so that only cattle can access them, unless they are inside badger-proof buildings. Possibly troughs could be suspended from the ceilings of buildings to deny access by badgers. However, the purpose of many troughs is to provide supplementary feed to cattle at pasture, so badgers are likely to be able to access them wherever they are positioned.

 The Krebs Report suggested that some 12,500 badgers might be taken during a five-year trial, based on the assumption that average badger density is around 5/km <sup>2</sup> . The second report of the Independent Scientific Group on Cattle TB stated that this figure was likely to be an overestimate, based on experience from the Randomised Culling Trial up to that date.

 There is no evidence to indicate that badgers and cattle at the same stage of disease differ in their ability to infect other animals.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40318w08.html_spnew19"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The main potential benefit of introduction of pre and/or post-movement testing is fewer movements of infected animals into low risk areas. It is a precautionary measure that we would expect to reduce the number of new incidents in low risk areas. Uncertainties around the role of wildlife in geographic spread makes it difficult to be certain about the extent of disease control benefits. The Independent Scientific Group has supported the principle of pre-and/or post-movement testing to prevent the spread of disease.

The Group also proposed extending the test to control herds not affected by TB in <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;areas with a TB problem, and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;low TB-risk areas, but not acting on the information gleaned.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what other gaseous pesticides were <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;investigated and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;declared inhumane following an investigation by Porton Down on the use of hydrogen cyanide to gas badgers.  [157935]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40318w09.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 In 1980, at the suggestion of Lord Zuckermann, the Chemical Defence Establishment (CDE) at Porton Down was commissioned by the Ministry of Agriculture Food and Fisheries (MAFF) to assess the acceptability of the use of Hydrogen Cyanide (HCN) to control the badger population.
<P>

<a name="40318w09.html_para2">Records indicate that in 1982 the results from this research led to the agriculture Minister, Mr Walker, ordering a ban on the use of HCN to kill badgers. The details of the research were publicised in a MAFF Press Notice (No. 249) issued on 1&nbsp;July 1982.
<P>

<a name="40318w09.html_para3">Subsequent to this announcement, records indicate that discussions between CDE and MAFF were undertaken concerning groups of potentially toxic compounds which could be of use in pest control. However, there is no evidence to suggest that any further research with gaseous pesticides was undertaken involving badgers, although some practical assessments involving non-gaseous methods were undertaken using other animals, including foxes.
<P>

<a name="40318w09.html_para4">This latter research on contingency plans in the event of rabies becoming established in the UK was undertaken for MAFF, between 1977 and 1981, and was designed to determine a replacement for strychnine in baited poison.

 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has regular discussions with the Secretary of State for Health and other Cabinet colleagues on a wide range of subjects. It remains Defra's position that the current risk assessment process for pesticides provides robust safeguards for public health; a view that is endorsed by the independent scientists on the Advisory Committee on Pesticides. The Department of Health is a partner to the pesticides regulatory process, and has accepted the advice of the Advisory Committee on this issue.

<P>
<a name="40318w09.html_spnew8"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 Defra has regular contact with the Highways Agency about the control of Ragwort. I wrote to the Chief Executive of the Highways Agency in September 2002 reminding the Agency of the need to take effective action to control ragwort growing on the verges of motorways and other trunk roads to prevent the risks to horses and other livestock from ragwort poisoning. More recently, the Highways Agency was consulted on the draft Code of Practice to prevent the spread of ragwort, which I launched at the Hickstead Horse Show in July last year and responded positively.
<P>

<a name="40318w09.html_para5">The Highways Agency will be among those consulted when the revised code is issued for formal public consultation as required by the Ragwort Control Act. Finally, following the changes that I made in the way that Defra investigates complaints about injurious weeds, my officials have been working with the Highways Agency to streamline the way complaints from the public are handled. As a result the Highways Agency has established a central telephone point for all complaints involving ragwort and other injurious weeds growing on the verges of motorways and other trunk roads. This number has been included in Defra Weeds Act guidance leaflet.

 Standard One of the older people's national service framework sets out the general commitment to address age discrimination in access to health and social care. It requires that access to treatment and care should be made on the basis of individual needs not age, and that national health service services should be provided, regardless of age, on the basis of clinical need alone. This will require specific clinical assessment and judgement, taking account of the individual patient's needs and wishes, and the up-to-date evidence on effectiveness of specific treatments available.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister (1) how many parents of disabled children in England applied for the disabled facilities grant in 2003; and how many of them had their application means-tested; [162284]
<P>
<UL>(2) how many parents of disabled children in England who had their application for the disabled facilities grant means-tested in 2003 withdrew from the application process;  [162285]
<P>
(3) how many parents of disabled children received the full amount applied for in the disabled facilities grant in England in 2003;  [162286]
<P>
(4) what the total amount paid in disabled facilities grant in England was in 2003; and how much of this was paid to those whose applications had been means-tested;  [162287]
<P>
(5) what plans he has to abolish the means testing of the disabled facilities grant for the parents of disabled children in England.  [162288]<P></UL>

<a name="40318w12.html_spnew9"><B> Keith Hill: </B> 
 The total amount of disabled facilities grant (DFG) awarded by local authorities in England in 2002&#150;03 was &#163;173.8&nbsp;million. All applicants for DFG are subject to a means test.
<P>

<a name="40318w12.html_para6">Information is not held centrally on the number and value of DFGs awarded to parents of disabled children in England and could be provided only at disproportionate cost. The latest information available on the type of DFGs awarded and the characteristics of DFG recipients is from the 1996 report into the 



<P>
<P><I>18 Mar 2004 : Column 451W</I><P>
Evaluation of the DFG system published by the Department of the Environment. This showed that 5&nbsp;per cent. of all successful DFG applicants were parents with a disabled child. The report also showed that 35&nbsp;per cent. of those who initially enquired about a grant withdrew from the process either because they were ineligible for a grant, the council offered them some other form of assistance or because they would not qualify for a grant because of the means test. Of those who withdrew 8&nbsp;per cent. were parents with a disabled child.
<P>

<a name="40318w12.html_para7">Since 1996 the DFG means test has been amended and a special housing allowance for a family with a disabled child was introduced in 2000. This extra allowance is offset against that family's income.
<P>

<a name="40318w12.html_para8">The Government announced a review the operation of the DFG programme on 5&nbsp;January 2004. In answer to a parliamentary question from Baroness Wilkins, my right hon. and noble Friend Lord Rooker in the other place said that the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, jointly with the Department of Health will be reviewing the disabled facilities grant programme, including the operation of the means test, in the context of the Spending Review 2004. The conclusions of this review will be announced later in the year.

<P>
<P>

 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister does not set a single target rent for social rented accommodation, or for sheltered accommodation. The formula for target rent for each social rented property, whether a housing association or local authority landlord, reflects size, value and location when compared to all other social rented property.
<P>

<a name="40318w13.html_para6">Service charges in all social rented property, and support charges in sheltered accommodation, are charged separately from rent. The maximum charge to the tenant for service and support is the cost price to the landlord. Charges depend both upon services received, and the landlord's costs for fulfilling the service and support needs of its tenants. Tenants in sheltered housing may also be in receipt of Supporting People grant towards the cost of support services.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what discussions he has had with the Adult Residential Colleges Association concerning the contribution by residential education to the Government's Skills Strategy.  [159526]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40318w14.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 There are 32 adult residential colleges based in rural locations in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. These colleges are mainly owned and run by local education authorities (LEAs) and provide, in the main, short courses. They do not receive funding direct from the DfES or the Learning and Skills Council. It is for local Learning and Skills Councils, in discussion with LEAs, to consider whether, and if so how, residential colleges can contribute to meeting local needs in lifelong learning in the light of our commitments in 21st Century Skills to safeguard budgets for such learning. I have not, therefore, had direct discussions with the Association about the role of member colleges in meeting the commitments in the Skills Strategy.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40318w15.html_spnew4"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 Information on the number of new child care places created in individual constituencies is available only from 1999. Sefton local authority reported that between April 1999 and December 2003, 565 new child care places opened in Crosby constituency. A place typically helps more than one child, as not all children take up places full-time, and we estimate these places will help some 1,000 children. During the same period, Sefton reported that 217 child care places closed in Crosby, so that the stock of child care places rose by 348 helping some 700 children.

 <i>[holding answer 16&nbsp;March 2004]:</i> Connexions Partnerships are private companies with obligations to their individual boards. As such we do not collect the information requested centrally. The proportion of sub-contracted services are not separately identified in Partnerships' accounts. All costs are apportioned across three main expenditure headings&#151;staff, premises and administration. Private sector companies have had a leading role from the start of developing Connexions and much use has been made of their experience and expertise.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what factors he takes into account when determining the level of grant allocated to each Connexions partnership.  [161916]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40318w15.html_spnew12"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 The amount of grant allocated to each Connexions Partnership is calculated using a funding formula. The formula allocates 40&nbsp;per cent. of the budget based on the number of 13 to 19-year-olds in the Partnership area and 60&nbsp;per cent. based on the additional needs of those young people, as indicated by four proxies. The proxies are the number of young people achieving less than 5 GCSEs at grade A*-C, the number of 16 to 17-year-olds not in education and training, the number of 18 to 24-year-olds who have been unemployed for at least six months and the number of 18 to 24-year-olds claiming Income Support. The formula also incorporates area cost weightings and allocates a fixed amount to each Partnership to cover common costs.

 <i>[holding answer 11&nbsp;March 2004]:</i> Adults who wish to re-enter further education full-time face a range of issues. The National Employment Panel report, Welfare to Workforce Development, which was published on 9&nbsp;March, refers to a need for improved services and support for learners. The Study of Learners in Further Education (RR 469, September 2003), which my Department commissioned, also highlights the financial implications of being a full-time learner in further education.
<P>

<a name="40318w16.html_para8">Within the framework of the Skills Strategy, the Government is taking action to address these issues and to encourage adults to learn, The measures we are taking include:

However, both DfES and The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP), which has responsibility for the '16 hour rule', recognise that the rule can create difficulties for some people, including homeless people, who wish to participate in, and complete, courses of further education.

 The transaction of land and buildings by a Further Education college is specifically covered by the 'Financial Memorandum' which is a significant part of the contract between the LSC and FE corporations and regulates their relationship on financial and related matters. The 'Financial Memorandum' states that a college would normally apply the proceeds of asset sales to investment in fixed assets and, where the college is proposing to dispose of land and buildings which have been acquired by Exchequer funds, allows the LSC to require the college to surrender some or all of the proceeds.

<a name="40318w17.html_para1">The judgment of the House of Lords is consistent with the Government's understanding that councils with social services responsibilities, in discharging their duties under Section 17 of the Children Act 1989, have the power to provide support towards accommodation for children in need and their families. While councils with social services responsibility do not have a specific duty in relation to the children of families who have been deemed intentionally homeless, this is consistent with the fact that they do not have such duties towards the child of any other family. The service response of a local authority will depend, in every situation, on its assessment of the needs of the child, in the context of the wider family, with assessments being carried out under the terms of the "Framework for the Assessment of Children in Need and Their Families".

 Information on adult literacy skills has not been collected on a regular basis, and annual data since 1997 are not available. However, in October 2003 the Department for Education and Skills published the Skills for Life Survey: A national needs and impact survey of literacy, numeracy and ICT skills. This survey assessed the literacy and numeracy skills of around 8,000 adults aged 16 and above in England.

The assessment levels correspond to the new literacy and numeracy core curriculum and National Standards: Level 1 is broadly equivalent to a lower grade GCSE (grade D&#150;G) and Level 2 to a higher grade GCSE (A*&#150;C). Overall around 16&nbsp;per cent. of adults had literacy skills below Level 1.

 The total spend in 2002&#150;03 on contracted education hours was &#163;52,305,802. We estimate that 37&nbsp;per cent. of this was spent on the delivery of literacy, numeracy and English as a Second Language (ESOL) in 2002/03, against all other education.

<a name="40318w18.html_para0">This spend cannot be split into separate basic skills levels because contracted education hours are not disaggregated by the level of basic skills delivered. We fund prisons to give them flexibility to respond to the range of learning needs in their population.

 My Department does not give guidance specifically about physical contact between teachers and primary school children. However, my Department's Circular 10/98: "Section 550A of the Education Act 1996: The Use of Force to Control or Restrain Pupils", which gives guidance about the right of teacher's to use reasonable force to control or restrain pupils in certain circumstances, also includes advice about physical contact with pupils in other circumstances. The Circular points out that there is a variety of circumstances in which physical contact with a pupil may be appropriate or necessary: that teachers need to exercise their professional judgment about this, and that they should avoid touching pupils in ways that might cause distress or raise concerns. Similar advice is available on the internet in the child protection area of my Department's Teachernet website.

<a name="40318w18.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Stephen Twigg: </B> 
 Education about safety is included in the curriculum through the framework of Personal Social and Health Education (PSHE). In PSHE lessons pupils are taught about rules for, and ways of, keeping safe, to recognise the risks that apply in different situations and then to decide how to behave responsibly. They should be taught to recognise and manage risk, to be aware when pressure from others threatens their personal safety and to develop assertiveness techniques when dealing with unhelpful pressure.
<P>

<a name="40318w18.html_para4">Although there is no specific requirement on schools to warn pupils about the dangers of playing on or near railways, teachers may well use such situations to illustrate risk more broadly.

My Department supports all visits that have clear educational objectives and are carefully risk assessed and managed. Guidelines recently re-issued by NASUWT advise members to consider whether to take part in visits, and advise those who do to heed guidance from their employer and from my Department. A few teachers have been subject to legal action but I am pleased that most teachers continue to take pupils on visits. I expect field visits and other outdoor activities to thrive as teachers become more competent in supervision following visits coordinator training pump-primed by my Department in 2003. The Health and Safety Executive in 2001&#150;02 received reports of 6,363 accidents affecting employees and others in primary and secondary education (including one fatality) and in 2002&#150;03 5,812 (including three fatalities).

 Asylum seekers make applications for refugee status rather than for leave to remain. Applications may result in grants of refugee status, in refusals of refugee status but grants of humanitarian protection, discretionary leave to remain, or in outright refusals. In April 2003 humanitarian protection (HP) and discretionary leave to remain (DL) replaced exceptional leave to remain (ELR). Applications for further leave following Grants of HP and DL are subject to active review.

 In 2001&#150;02 there were 4.6&nbsp;million 16 to 59-year-olds living in London. Among this population the British Crime Survey estimates prevalence of illicit drug use was 0.1&nbsp;per cent. for heroin, 14&nbsp;per cent. for cannabis, 4.2&nbsp;per cent. for cocaine and 3.5&nbsp;per cent. for ecstasy.

 Within the Home Office there are currently no examples of environmentally sustainable procurement strategies that have driven innovation in the design and supply of products. However, it is expected that the forthcoming procurement section of the Framework for Sustainable Development on the Government Estate will set Government&#151;wide commitments for embedding sustainable development considerations in departmental procurement strategies. The Department will adopt the considerations in the framework as this will help to encourage environmental innovation in the design and supply of products.
<P>

<a name="40318w21.html_para4">The department supports the introduction of new environmental sustainable products that become available on the market and has adopted a positive stance to environmentally sustainable procurement in the following areas, recycled paper, green electricity, energy use, and recycling of redundant IT hardware.

<P>

 The free movement of accession nationals will apply across the whole of the EU from May 1. The Government's policy is to welcome accession nationals coming here to work but not simply to claim benefits. This will prevent an increase in illegal working, ensuring that accession nationals who come here to work will do so legally, paying tax and national insurance rather than being forced into the sub-economy.
<P>

<a name="40318w21.html_para5">We have also taken steps to strengthen controls on illegal working. We announced on 23&nbsp;February that we would introduce a registration scheme for workers from eight of the 10 countries joining the European Union on 1&nbsp;May this year. We announced on 16&nbsp;March measures to strengthen the law on the prevention of illegal working, section 8 of the Asylum and Immigration Act 1996.
<P>

<a name="40318w21.html_para6">The reform of section 8 will bring added clarity and security to the document checks employers must carry out on prospective employees to prevent the use of illegal labour, and the Immigration Service will continue to increase intelligence-led enforcement activity against illegal working. The workers registration scheme will allow these nationals access to our labour market in a monitored way, and will encourage those working here illegally to formalise their status and contribute to the

 A new Home Office presenting officer initially receives three weeks of classroom-based training. This includes technical, and skills-based elements. This is followed by a period of mentoring by an experienced presenting officer, at the end of which the trainee is ready to represent the Home Office alone in appeals heard before an independent Adjudicator of the Immigration Appellate Authority. Each presenting officer attends a period of consolidation training within three months of completion of initial training.
<P>

<a name="40318w22.html_para2">Senior presenting officers represent the Home Office in cases heard before the Immigration Appeal Tribunal. Where these staff have previously been experienced presenting officers, an analysis of their skills and abilities is conducted to identify specific areas which may require further training.

Those with little or no experience of presenting in court follow a training and mentoring programme similar to that provided to presenting officers, although with more focus on the role of the Tribunal, before they appear alone before the Tribunal.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what steps she is taking to improve the productivity of the call-centre industry in the UK.  [161222]<P>

<P>
<a name="40318w24.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 Call centres are used for a wide variety of roles across a broad range of commercial and industrial sectors and the public sector. In the light of this my Department has commissioned research to improve our understanding of the industry and the key factors contributing to its relative competitiveness. The study will help to identify whether there are any actions that can be taken by the industry or Government to address any constraints impacting on its productivity. We expect to publish a report on the study in April.

<a name="40318w24.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The Government share the European Commission's own view that Option 1, involving extension of the present regime beyond 2006, is not sustainable. Options 2 and 3 both involve reductions in EU prices and production consistent with cuts in tariffs and export refunds which would send a positive message in the context of the current WTO round. The Government are, however, still considering which option represents the best way ahead, taking account of the range of interests involved, including the implications for developing countries.

<a name="40318w25.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 The UK is committed towards taking forward the key recommendations of the G8 Renewable Energy Task Force report (G8 RETF)&#151;which is why at the World Summit on Sustainable Development, 2002 we launched an initiative for a global renewable energy and energy efficiency partnership (REEEP). Since then a small secretariat based in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office has been working with international Governments, business and other organisations including representatives of civil society to develop the REEEP as a means for enabling the delivery of the G8 REFT recommendations. The REEEP aims to trigger a step change in renewable energy markets and bring together stakeholders globally to provide the concerted action needed. For our part, the Government have the target of renewables providing 10&nbsp;per cent. of our electricity and has put in place the Renewable Obligation as the main means of increasing and development of renewable energy domestically to meet this target. Through the REEEP, the UK is working with others, including various G8 members, to share and build upon good policy, regulatory and financing practise necessary to accelerate the market development of renewable energy.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what action the Government are taking to ensure that the UK opt out from the EU Working Time Directive is not amended or abolished.  [153542]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40318w25.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Sutcliffe: </B> 
 The opt out is important to the UK as it maintains flexible labour markets and gives choice to individuals to work longer hours if they so wish. I, and my colleagues, are working in Europe to stress the importance of the opt out to both employers and employees and to ensure that key decision makers understand the benefits of an approach which provides protection to workers who do not wish to work long hours without restricting those who wish to make a different choice.
