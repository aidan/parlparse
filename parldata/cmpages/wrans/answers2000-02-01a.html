 The Secretary of State made a statement in the House on 19 January 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 845-48, setting out the Government's response to the Patten Report. The Government are considering a number of detailed issues in relation to the Report and will make its decisions clear in due course.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00201w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The Government accept the recommendations of the Patten report that the Policing Board should, with the Secretary of State's approval, be able to call upon the chief constable to retire in the interests of efficiency and effectiveness.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00201w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. William Ross: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland when he last met members of the Northern Ireland Police Federation to discuss his plans to reform the Royal Ulster Constabulary.  [107614]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00201w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State last met with members of the Northern Ireland Police Federation on Tuesday 11 January 2000 to discuss the Patten report.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00201w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. McNamara: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland if he will establish a public register of interests and associations for the police in Northern Ireland which will include currently serving officers.  [107816]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00201w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 No. The Patten report does not recommend a public register.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00201w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Crausby: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what action he is taking to reduce smoking in his Department.  [105796]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00201w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Mandelson: </B> 
 NIO has a well established policy on smoking in the workplace which was first introduced in 1991 and a complete ban on smoking, apart from designated smoking rooms, has been in operation in all NIO premises since 1995. The policy has been supported through participation in the annual no-smoking day campaign and various health awareness events where professional and medical advice and information has been made available to encourage staff who smoke to give it up. The Department also intends to participate in the Quit Year 2000 initiative which has just been launched by the Ulster Cancer Foundation.
<P>

<a name="00201w01.html_para0">The Department is currently participating in a detailed Health Survey of all its staff which will identify the mental and physical health of our staff including basic data on smoking habits which will be used to plan future employee well-being activity.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00201w01.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. William Ross: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland how many crimes were committed in Northern Ireland in each of the last 10 years in which legally-held <i>(a)</i> shotguns, <i>(b)</i> .22 rifles, <i>(c)</i> .22 handguns, <i>(d)</i> fullbore handguns and <i>(e)</i> fullbore rifles were used by (i) their legal owners and (ii) others.  [106065]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00201w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The Chief Constable has advised me that the information about the ownership of the firearms used in criminal activity is not readily available and obtaining it would incur disproportionate cost. The table, however, shows the number of offences involving the use of firearms, and the type of firearm used over the last 10 years.

 Regarding the first part of my hon. Friend's question, I refer him to the answer I gave him earlier today on questions regarding this subject. On the second part, I will not be reviewing the flying of flags on public buildings in Northern Ireland under my authority. Other public buildings in Northern Ireland, following devolution on 2 December 1999, now fall within the responsibility of the devolved administration.

 Local Education Authorities must provide free transport for a pupil of compulsory school age who attends his or her nearest suitable school, if it is beyond statutory walking distance from the child's home. These distances are two miles for pupils aged under eight, and three miles for those aged eight and over. If these criteria are not met, a Local Education Authority must still decide whether free transport is necessary, taking

<P>
<P>
<a name="00201w02.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Blunkett: </B> 
 The 2000 report of the School Teachers' Review Body has been published today. Copies are available in the Vote Office and the Library of the House. This is an historic pay round, centred on modernising the pay system for the entire teaching profession. I am grateful to the Chair and members of the Review Body for their important work.
<P>

<a name="00201w02.html_para0">I asked the School Teachers' Review Body to ensure that, in making its recommendations, six key considerations were taken into account:
<P>

<a name="00201w02.html_para1"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the strategy for modernising the teaching profession set out in the Green Paper "Teachers: meeting the challenge of change" (this strategy was similarly set out in the Green Paper "The BEST for Teaching and Learning in Wales);
<P>
<BR>
the need to minimise additional burden on head teachers and line managers, while ensuring effective implementation of the new arrangements to reward excellence in schools;
<P>
<BR>
specific items of non-pay expenditure for delivering a high quality education service should not be diverted to fund a pay settlement;
<P>
<BR>
firm three year plans for my Department's Expenditure Limit and for all local authorities set by the Comprehensive Spending Review, from which we must fund all service improvements and pay settlements, and similar constraints in Wales;
<P>
<BR>
the Government's inflation target, which requires responsibility in all pay settlements;
<P>
<BR>
the need for schools to recruit, retain and motivate sufficient teachers, deputy headteachers and headteachers of the required quality.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="00201w02.html_para2">I have considered the report carefully against these considerations and am satisfied that they are met. I have decided to accept the Review Body's main recommendations. They are in line with the Government's prudent and disciplined approach to public spending and its commitment to deliver high quality public services and low inflation.
<P>

<a name="00201w02.html_para3">My proposals, which include minor modifications of the STRB recommendations where indicated, are as follows:
<P>

<a name="00201w02.html_para4">
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>
<BR>
<i>General Pay Increase</i>
<BR>
with effect from 1 April 2000 the values of the pay spines for qualified classroom teachers, Advanced Skills Teachers, heads and deputies, and the pay scale for unqualified teachers, should be increased by 3.3 per cent;
<BR>
also with effect from 1 April 2000, London allowances other than the inner London Supplement should be increased by 3.3 per cent.




<P>
</UL></FONT><P><I>1 Feb 2000 : Column: 499W</I><P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>
<BR>
<i>Pay reform: classroom teachers</i>
<BR>
The existing pay spine will be replaced by a new pay spine and an upper pay range:
<BR>
<i>Pay spine</i>
<BR>
the pay spine will comprise nine full salary points (half points are to be abolished;
<BR>
teachers with a second class honours degree or better should be entitled to one point for qualifications, and the relevant body should have the discretion to award additional points on the pay spine for relevant experience outside teaching;
<BR>
teachers should receive a point on the pay spine for each year of service subject to the discretion of the relevant body to discount unsatisfactory service on the same basis as applies under the existing pay system;
<BR>
a teacher whose performance is exceptionally good in a particular year should, at the discretion of the relevant body, be awarded two points on the pay spine for that year of service;
<BR>
points awarded on the pay spine should become a permanent entitlement for the teacher concerned;
<BR>
<i>Upper pay range</i>
<BR>
the upper pay range will comprise five salary points;
<BR>
teachers at the top of the pay spine who apply to cross the threshold to the new upper pay range and are assessed as meeting national performance standards being developed by the Government will be placed on the first point of that range, which will be &#163;2,000 above point nine on the pay spine;
<BR>
further progression on the upper pay range will be at the discretion of the relevant body to recognise substantial and sustained performance and contribution to the school as a teacher. Points should not be awarded annually other than in exceptional circumstances, and normally at least two years should elapse between crossing the threshold and being awarded the next point above the threshold uplift. I propose that the first such points should be available in September 2002;
<BR>
once awarded, the first point on the upper pay range will be a consolidated addition to pay and transferable if the teacher moves to another school (the STRB will consider the status of subsequent pay points in their next report);
<BR>
<i>Management allowances</i>
<BR>
the existing system of responsibility points will be replaced by a range of four management allowances;
<BR>
management allowances should be awarded at the discretion of the relevant body to teachers who undertake clearly defined and significant management tasks additional to their normal duties as classroom teachers. I will consult further on the way such management allowances should be defined in the light of information about the way responsibility points are used at present;
<BR>
management allowances may be awarded while a teacher is holding a particular post or on a short-term basis at the discretion of the relevant body;
<BR>
<i>Recruitment and retention allowances:</i>
<BR>
the existing system of recruitment and retention points will be replaced by a range of three recruitment and retention allowances;
<BR>
the first or second allowance should be awarded at the discretion of the relevant body to teachers in schools generally; a third allowance could additionally be used in inner London, and in schools in special measures, to help ease particular recruitment and retention problems;
<BR>
the STRB has recommended that as an alternative to using recruitment and retention allowances as a normal salary enhancement in areas covered by the DfEE's "Excellence in Cities" initiative, the relevant body should also have discretion to use an annual allowance wholly or in part in the form of a lump sum payment subject to satisfactory completion of service in the year concerned. Where lump sums are paid they will not be covered by the normal presumption that teachers' pay and allowances are consolidated and pensionable. I have accepted this recommendation with the modification that the 



<P>
</UL></FONT><P><I>1 Feb 2000 : Column: 500W</I><P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>recommended discretion should be available for use by all relevant bodies rather than just those in Excellence in Cities areas.
<BR>
<i>Special educational needs</i>
<BR>
the existing system of special needs points will be replaced by two levels of allowance which should be awarded on the same basis as the existing points.
<BR>
<i>The reformed pay structure for qualified classroom teachers should be introduced on the following basis:</i>
<BR>
the new structure will be introduced with effect from 1 September 2000, from which date the existing system should cease to exist;
<BR>
appropriate assimilation arrangements will be drawn up in consultation with interested parties, based on the principle that no teacher should be worse off unless there has been a change in relevant circumstances;
<BR>
discretionary points and the mandatory special needs point awarded under the existing system should normally be expected to be converted into an appropriate allowance under the new system, but half points and excellence points should be protected on an individual basis; and
<BR>
discretionary points and the mandatory special needs point awarded under the existing system should not be offset against the threshold uplift.
<BR>
<i>Advanced Skills Teachers</i>
<BR>
The separate pay spine for Advanced Skills Teachers should be retained and their possible inclusion in strategic school leadership arrangements should be at the discretion of the governing body.
<BR>
<i>Leadership Group</i>
<BR>
The relevant body, having determined the pay of the head, must determine the pay of other leadership group members with effect from 1 September 2000 on the following basis:
<BR>
the relevant body must determine an appropriate five point individual salary range on the leadership pay spine for each member of the group other than the head;
<BR>
salary ranges must be positioned between the individual school range adopted for the head and the salary level of teachers immediately below the leadership group. Assimilation must ensure that no one is worse off as a result of the introduction of the new arrangements; and
<BR>
subsequent movement within the individual salary range must reflect performance as for heads under the arrangements introduced with effect from 1 September 1999.
<BR>
The maxima for the range of points for each of the eight school groups for heads will be raised by two points, and the top of the pay spine extended accordingly, with effect from 1 September 2000.
<BR>
To provide relevant bodies with additional flexibility for the initial setting of pay ranges for leadership group members, the existing rule which restricts the circumstances under which a head's individual school range can be reopened must be waived temporarily.
<BR>
Acceptance of these recommendations is subject to two modifications: first, senior teachers and deputies joining the leadership group should normally assimilate to the nearest point above their existing salary, except where the relevant body judges a higher point is appropriate to ensure that the pay ranges at the school properly reflect the relative responsibilities of jobholders; and secondly, that at the point of assimilation deputies should be on a higher point on the leadership spine than senior teachers in the same school who are not deputies.
<BR>
I propose to consult on the basis that leadership group members who are not heads should have the same professional duties as deputy heads, save that those who are senior teachers rather than deputies should not be required to undertake the professional duties of the head in the head's absence.
<BR>
<i>Special School Heads</i>
<BR>
With effect from 1 September 2000, the existing interim basis on which special schools are assigned to a school group for the purposes of determining the pay of the head will be replaced 



<P>
</UL></FONT><P><I>1 Feb 2000 : Column: 501W</I><P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>by a new formula which links job weight with pupil numbers and teaching and non-teaching staff numbers. Once the school is assigned to a group, the pay arrangements for the head should be the same as for the head of mainstream schools. The group for hospital schools will be determined on an individual basis, but the pay arrangements must otherwise be the same as for schools generally.
<BR>
<i>School Performance Award scheme</i>
<BR>
Governing bodies of schools in receipt of an award under the proposed School Performance Award scheme will be able to distribute some or all of it on the advice of the head in the form of non-consolidated, non-pensionable bonuses to staff.
<BR>
<i>Fast Track Teachers</i>
<BR>
The STRB has recommended that teachers on proposed fast-track programmes should have an additional spine point up to the proposed performance threshold, and that such teachers should not be subject to the working time limits that apply to classroom teachers generally. I propose to accept this STRB recommendation with the modification that the additional spine point should be available only to newly qualified teachers who join the fast-track. Other serving teachers below the threshold who join the fast track will benefit from double jumping of experience points so should receive an extra point anyway.
<BR>
<i>Existing Pay Allowances and Safeguarding</i>
<BR>
<i>Out of school learning</i>
<BR>
The existing scope for relevant bodies to make discretionary payments to classroom teachers who participate in out-of-school activities will be maintained but heads, deputies, other leadership group teachers, Advanced Skills Teachers and fast-track teachers will not be eligible for such payments.
<BR>
<i>In-service training</i>
<BR>
The existing scope for relevant bodies to make discretionary payments to teachers and deputy heads who undertake in-service training will be maintained and cover leadership group teachers other than the head but not fast-track teachers.
<BR>
<i>Acting duties</i>
<BR>
The existing discretionary scope for relevant bodies to pay acting allowances to classroom teachers who are assigned and carry out the duties of a head or deputy, but who have not been appointed as acting heads or deputies, will be maintained and cover teachers who are assigned and carry out the duties of other leadership group members.
<BR>
<i>Social Priority Allowance and Inner London Supplement</i>
<BR>
The existing basis for safeguarding residual entitlements to the SPA and ILS will be maintained.
<BR>
<i>1993 pay restructuring</i>
<BR>
I will take account of residual entitlements arising from the 1993 restructuring of teachers' pay when consulting interested parties on the appropriate basis for assimilation to the proposed new pay structure from 1 September 2000.
<BR>
<i>General safeguarding</i>
<BR>
I will also consult interested parties about the continued basis for general safeguarding with reference back to the STRB as appropriate.
<i>Financial implications</i>
The full cost of the settlement in 2000-01 will arise from the 3.3 per cent. increase in teachers' pay spines and allowances from 1 April 2000, and from the reforms of the qualified teachers' pay system and other changes consequent on previous restructuring which will come into effect from 1 September 2000. The cost of the April increase in 2000-01 will be &#163;420 million in England and Wales. This will be affordable within the resources available to local authorities. In England, Education Standard Spending will rise by &#163;1,103 million (5.4 per cent.) in 2000-01 compared with 1999-2000. Local authorities in England will also benefit in 2000-01 from increased spending power of &#163;90 million resulting 



<P>
</UL></FONT><P><I>1 Feb 2000 : Column: 502W</I><P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>from rescheduling of increased employers' contributions to teachers' pensions, and a general increase in Revenue Support Grant of &#163;35 million. In addition to the allocation through the Revenue Support Grant, I have confirmed today that I have identified an additional &#163;50 million from my Department's budget which will be available to schools in England, paid as a Special Grant to ensure that there are additional resources available to meet the challenging standards agenda and the new basic pay increase.

<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="00201w02.html_para5">In Wales, following decisions by the National Assembly, local authorities will be able to increase spending on education by &#163;75 million in 2000-01, compared with 1999-2000.
<P>

<a name="00201w02.html_para6">Additional specific funding will support the costs of the reform of the qualified teachers' pay system from September 2000. This will take the form of a new Special Grant in England and specific extra allocations to local authorities in Wales.
<P>

<a name="00201w02.html_para7">In the initial years of the new pay system, the Government will make additional funds available in England to support extra costs incurred by schools as follows:
<P>

<a name="00201w02.html_para8"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a Special Grant, established under section 88B of the Local Government Finance Act 1988, which will fund fully the threshold salary uplift of &#163;2,000 payable from September 2000 for every full-time-equivalent teacher moving to the upper pay range in the current year. There will be no quota on threshold successes. All eligible teachers who apply and are assessed as meeting the national standards will move to the upper pay range. This grant will operate until at least March 2002;
<P>
<BR>
a one-off payment of &#163;2,000 from the same Special Grant for every full-time-equivalent classroom teacher appointed directly to the new leadership group in academic year 2000-01. This payment will help support the additional salary costs of teachers joining the leadership group; it will be for schools to decide on a case-by-case basis what pay point on the leadership pay spine would be appropriate taking into account the nature of the post. These payments will be available for academic year 2000-01 only. Thereafter, the additional resources will be included in the local authority funding system and schools' delegated budgets in the normal way.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="00201w02.html_para9">In addition, the Government will in England make a specified amount of extra resource available for the same period of time as the threshold grant to support the costs to schools of high-performing heads, deputies and Advanced Skills Teachers progressing up their individual pay ranges from September 2000. This will help ensure that excellent achievement among these teachers is recognised and rewarded more consistently--an issue to which the Review Body has drawn attention in paragraph 147 of the current report. The DfEE will consult stakeholders on the operation of this funding, including the most appropriate mechanism for distributing these funds.
<P>

<a name="00201w02.html_para10">In Wales, funding for the pay consequences of teachers' pay restructuring will be made as additional increases to local authorities to enable them to meet the costs of the various elements. The National Assembly is providing an additional &#163;14.5 million in 2000-01, bringing the overall increase in local authorities' spending power in 2000-01 to &#163;91 million. The National Assembly has been consulting on the arrangements for distribution of those additional amounts.




<P>
<P><I>1 Feb 2000 : Column: 503W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="00201w02.html_para11">Taking account of this funding, the additional costs arising within Education Standard Spending from 1 September 2000 are estimated as &#163;7.5 million in respect of the assimilation of classroom teachers to the new pay system and of restructuring the pay of special school heads. Other assimilation costs may arise depending on local decisions by schools; the Review Body is therefore unable to estimate the overall level of such costs.

<P>

<a name="00201w02.html_para13">I am grateful to the Review Body for recommending a general increase at a level which is fair and which can be implemented without staging. I hope teachers will welcome the fact that they will receive their pay increase in full on 1 April this year. I will now initiate consultation with the teacher associations, the employer organisations and other interested parties, as required under section 2(1) of the School Teachers' Pay and Conditions Act 1991, before I make provision by order for teachers' pay and conditions in 2000-01.

<a name="00201w03.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 We will shortly be advertising for organisations interested in providing consultancy support and delivering education services in the event of intervention in local education authorities. This will include extending the remit of the work undertaken by consultants to provide a wide range of general management consultancy and advice. Advertisements will appear in the national press and specialist press from 2 February.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what is his estimate of the percentage of children with moderate learning difficulties who are fully included in education in mainstream schools in each local education authority in England; and if he will make a statement.  [107672]<P>

<P>
<a name="00201w03.html_spnew1"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 Information by specific types of learning difficulty is not collected centrally.
<P>

<a name="00201w03.html_para0">However, in January 1999, returns of the Annual Schools' Census showed that, in England, 59 per cent. of all pupils with statements of SEN were being educated in mainstream schools.

<P>
<a name="00201w03.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Ashdown: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment if he will make a statement on the Government's policy on the inclusion of children with moderate learning difficulties in mainstream schools.  [107671]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00201w03.html_spnew2"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 Promoting the inclusion of children with learning difficulties within mainstream schools, where parents want it and appropriate support can be provided, is a cornerstone of the Government's special educational needs strategy. The education of children with special needs is a key challenge for the nation, and critical to the creation of a fully inclusive society. There are strong educational, as well as social and moral, grounds for educating pupils with special needs or disabilities with their peers.




<P>
<P><I>1 Feb 2000 : Column: 504W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="00201w03.html_para1">The SEN/Disability Rights Bill--which will be introduced later this session--will strengthen the right to a mainstream place for pupils with special needs. Where parents want a mainstream setting for their child our policy is to try to provide it. Equally, when parents want a specialist setting for their child it is important that their wishes are respected. Our approach has been practical, not dogmatic. We are advocating inclusion by choice and have underlined that there remains a continuing and vital role for special schools. The key objective must be to safeguard the interests of all children and to ensure that they achieve to their full potential.

As a child, Professor Winter was taken to hunts on about half a dozen occasions.

 In the course of consultations during the preparation of the Order, the Data Protection Registrar indicated her preference for it to include a requirement for data controllers to record the third party source of information processed subject to its terms, but that she was otherwise content with its provisions requiring them to provide data subjects with information and to record the decision-making process in cases where disclosure of information where a notice has been received from an individual would involve disproportionate effort. In considering the provisions of the Order, we concluded that a third party recording requirement would impose a burden on business disproportionate to any data protection benefits which it might yield.

 The table relates to Great Britain and provides the readily available information. 'Handguns' include pistols/revolvers, no further breakdown being available in the statistics collected centrally. 'Other firearms' includes all other firearms except shotguns (ie rifles, air weapons, imitations, 'supposed' and 'other' firearms). Fatal and other injuries involve weapons being fired and, for England and Wales only, being used as a blunt instrument. Only in cases of fatal injury (ie homicide) is the legal status of the firearms collected centrally and this is shown in cases where the weapon was known to be legally held.

 Mr. Jarvis wrote jointly to me and to my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister on 19 November with a proposal for an alternative to the Public Safety Radio Communications Project (PSRCP).

the Metropolitan Police; what was the cost of the installation; what was the cost of the system in the last financial year for which figures are available; what is the contract cost in the current financial year; and for what time period was the initial contract and with what options.  [107402]<P>

<P>
<a name="00201w05.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The Receiver for the Metropolitan Police District tells me that the installation of the ORBIS computer system was completed and accepted by the Metropolitan Police on 15 October 1999. The cost of installation, inclusive of computer hardware and software costs and the salaries of the Metropolitan police staff involved, totalled &#163;265,000.

 Information on the use of animals in scientific procedures is published each year in the Statistics of Scientific Procedures on Living Animals (Great Britain). Tables 1, 18d and 18e refer to the numbers of primates used by type and also provide information on the primary purpose of the procedure. In 1997, the total number of primates used was 3,908. In 1998, the total was 3,655. There were no primates used in Northern Ireland in 1997 and 1998.

Based on the costs set out in the Bidding Guidelines, which were issued for forces and a copy placed in the Library on 2 December 1999, funding for 2,908 officers would total more than &#163;96 million.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00201w06.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 Under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, the Certificate of Designation for an institution does not license individuals. Anyone performing a regulated procedure on a live animal must hold a personal licence in accordance with the 1986 Act. The procedure must be applied as part of a programme of work specified in a project licence which authorises the application of that procedure.
<P>

<a name="00201w06.html_para2">Currently, there are 60 project licences for the use of animals in education and training, held mostly by university employees. In each case, a licence has been granted for an educational objective which cannot be realistically taught by alternative methods.

 The Government are concerned about the damaging effects of graffiti on neighbourhoods and there are substantial penalties available under the Criminal Damage Act 1971: where the criminal damage is more than &#163;2,000, the maximum penalty is 10 years imprisonment for those aged 18 or over, and up to two years detention in a Young Offenders Institution for those aged 15-17. However, within the maximum limit sentencing is a matter for the courts to decide in the light of all the circumstances of the case.
<P>

<a name="00201w06.html_para3">The police already have the power to arrest anyone whom they reasonably suspect has committed or is about to commit the offence of criminal damage. Where vandals are found in possession of a paint spray can with the intention of damaging property or already having done so, the criminal law can be brought to bear. We do not have any plans, therefore, to legislate specifically against the sale or carrying of spray paints but, of course, the matter will be kept under review.

 My Department's policy is to promote recycling of office waste.

 As aircraft accidents are very rare events, statistics in this format serve no useful purpose and are not used by either the Department or the Civil Aviation Authority. For UK registered aircraft, the CAA use an accident rate per million hours flown averaged over three years as a performance indicator. These figures are published in the CAA's annual report. In addition, the CAA has carried out a review of fatal accidents by world regions. The results of this review were published in CAP 681 "Global Fatal Accident Review 1980-96". Copies of both documents are already in the Library.

 We have no plans to do so. An insurance company could only enforce such standards by refusing to pay any claim where minimum standards had not been met. This would not help leaseholders.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what is his policy on the circumstances in which planning inquiries may be held on proposals to build waste incinerators, and the rights of objectors to such proposals to have a public inquiry.  [108320]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00201w07.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The building of a waste incinerator requires planning permission, for which an application must be made to the local planning authority. Where a local planning authority refuses an application for planning permission, grants it subject to conditions or fails to determine it within eight weeks, the person applying for permission may appeal. The appeal may be dealt with by public inquiry or hearing, although most are dealt with by written representations. An inquiry is likely to be held in the very small proportion of cases where my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State considers it necessary to call in a planning application to determine it himself, instead of leaving it to the planning authority.
<P>

<a name="00201w07.html_para2">My right hon. Friend's policy on call-ins was stated in a written answer by my predecessor on 16 June 1999, <i>Official Report,</i> column 138W and this remains the position. He will be very selective about calling in planning applications. He will, in general, only take this step if planning issues of more than local importance are involved. Such cases may include, for example, those which in his opinion:

<a name="00201w07.html_para9">Objectors to planning applications, including those for waste incinerators, do not have a right to a planning inquiry into their objections. However, they may put their objections to the local planning authority considering the application to which they are opposed, and the authority must have regard to their objections in reaching its decision. Similarly, where an appeal has been lodged against a refusal to an application, objectors may put their points to the inspector, either in writing or, where an inquiry or hearing is held, in person.

<a name="00201w08.html_wqn5"><B> Dr. Harris: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for International Development, pursuant to her answer of 6 December 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 337-38W, on departmental research contracts, if she will <i>(a)</i> state total expenditure on research let by her Department since May 1997 and <i>(b)</i> list the titles of all research contracts let by her Department during 1999 and costing &#163;20,000 or more, stating what is the value of each contract, and in each case whether the contract included (i) departmental veto over publication of the research results, (ii) departmental control over the date of publication of the research and (iii) a requirement that the final research results incorporate departmental amendments; and if she will place a copy of the standard research contract in use by her Department in the Library.  [107105]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00201w08.html_spnew5"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 The best estimate of total expenditure on research remains as stated in my answer of 6 December 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 337-38W. No figures are yet available for this financial year.
<P>

<a name="00201w08.html_para12">I have arranged for a list of research projects over &#163;20,000 let in 1999 to be placed in the Library of the House. This covers 254 projects with a total value of nearly &#163;54 million. The list is not necessarily exhaustive (because research contracts are let by several units in DFID) but shows the overwhelming majority of contracts let during that period.
<P>

<a name="00201w08.html_para13">It also remains the case that the Department's contracts do not provide for departmental veto over publication of research results (except, rarely, where intellectual property rights might otherwise be infringed) or for control over the date of publication of the research. There is no requirement that the final research results incorporate departmental amendments.
<P>

<a name="00201w08.html_para14">I have also arranged for a version of the research contract used by DFID to be placed in the Library of the House. There are slight variations in this contract where it has been tailored to meet the particular needs of different research funding units in the Department.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what assessment he has made of the regulatory environment for broadcasting in the United Kingdom.  [105956]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00201w09.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Chris Smith: </B> 
 The Government's assessment of the regulatory environment for broadcasting in the United Kingdom was set out in the joint DCMS/DTI Green Paper "Regulating Communications--approaching convergence in the information age" and, in the light of responses, our conclusions were published in June last year as "Regulating Communications: The Way Ahead". But it is now clear that a more fundamental reassessment is needed. I shall shortly be announcing how this is to be taken forward.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport how much his Department, its agencies and associated public bodies spent in total on extra bonuses above usual payments for staff working over the New Year period; what were the <i>(a)</i> maximum and <i>(b)</i> minimum bonuses paid; how many people received the (i) maximum and (ii) minimum payments; and if he will make a statement.  [104500]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00201w09.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Chris Smith: </B> 
 DCMS and Royal Parks Agency would have difficulty in identifying the actual amounts spent or the maximum and minimum payments made to staff working over the new year period from other overtime payments. The pay information for non- departmental public bodies is not held centrally. The information required could only be provided at disproportionate cost. Only a small number of DCMS and Royal Parks Agency staff were required to work over this period.

 There are no plans to introduce a requirement to share trenches within the scope of Telecommunications Act 1984 licences. While trench sharing between two or more operators often occurs, circumstances of timing and routing make this impractical as a requirement. However, the licences currently issued require operators to explore the possibility of using existing ducts or conduits and the New Roads and Street Works Act 1991 places a duty on the highway authorities to co-ordinate the execution of works in the highway.
<P>

<a name="00201w10.html_para3">Additionally the Department has written at both Ministerial and official level to all telecommunications operators with code powers reminding them of their obligation to explore duct sharing and encouraging them to consider trench sharing as a means of reducing unnecessary digging.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00201w11.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Watts: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what conclusions have been reached in response to the public consultation on Government policy for renewable sources of energy.  [108365]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00201w11.html_spnew2"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 Renewable sources of energy are an essential element of the Government's Climate Change Programme. They are set to make an increasingly important contribution to the provision of secure, diverse and sustainable energy supplies. Renewable sources of energy will become increasingly important in the new millennium as electricity consumption increases and existing nuclear generating capacity is retired. For all these reasons the Government are committed to increasing the contribution from renewable sources of energy to the UK's energy supplies.
<P>

<a name="00201w11.html_para1">The Government believe that our objective for the renewables industry can best be achieved within the framework of a competitive market. This will give the industry the greatest opportunity for technological innovation and the optimisation of efficiency so that the most cost-effective renewables can be brought forward. In order for this to be achieved the Government intend to give a clear signal to the industry that we are targeting a 10 per cent. share of electricity supply to be provided from renewable sources.
<P>

<a name="00201w11.html_para2">Key elements of our strategy to achieve the policy aim will be:
<P>

<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="00201w11.html_para7">The Renewables Obligation will enable us to make progress towards a target of generating 10 per cent. of our electricity from renewable sources by 2010. Clearly hitting this higher target may, at least in the medium term, mean slightly higher costs to consumers and the acceptability of those higher costs must be fully considered. The necessary legislative powers will be taken in the Utilities Bill which the Government introduced on 20 January. The Renewables Obligation and the associated Renewables (Scotland) Obligation will be an obligation on all licensed suppliers to supply a specified proportion of their electricity supplies from renewable sources of energy. Any additional cost of supplying electricity from renewables will be met by suppliers and may be passed onto their customers. There will be no new levy for these arrangements. The Renewables Obligation will be imposed by a Statutory Instrument that will contain the detailed requirements. The Government expect to require all suppliers to obtain a specified proportion of their electricity from renewables rising year by year to achieve the 2010 target. I shall be consulting the industry, as well as electricity consumers, on the costs of achieving the precise obligation (and the rate of progress towards the overall target and price cap) in advance of the enabling Order being laid before Parliament later this year.




<P>
<P><I>1 Feb 2000 : Column: 537W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="00201w11.html_para8">It will be essential to ensure that commercially viable projects already contracted under the NFFO and SRO arrangements continue to attract and retain project finance so that the UK stays on track to source 5 per cent. of its electricity from renewables by 2003. Accordingly, transitional arrangements are being developed by the contracting parties. The Utilities Bill will give powers for secondary legislation to be developed to facilitate this process. The Bill includes powers to continue the operation of the current sections 32 and 33 of the Electricity Act 1989 (relating to NFFO and SRO Orders and the Fossil Fuel Levy) and these measures may be amended to adjust to the new arrangements as necessary.
<P>

<a name="00201w11.html_para9">The renewables industry has made great strides in recent years. It has reduced the costs of the more mature renewable technologies over the last decade to the point where they are rapidly becoming competitive with other energy sources in the UK. The Government hope that the industry can rise to the challenge of the new policy by meeting the proposed targets at an acceptable cost that will not have a major impact on electricity prices. We will be consulting on what increase would be acceptable to consumers in order to promote renewables, but have in mind an increase of 1-2 per cent. in electricity prices by 2010, in return for which there will be real benefits to society from lower greenhouse gas emissions and a more diverse energy supply. This new approach to bringing forward renewables works with the grain of other developments in the electricity supply market. These other changes that the Government and the Regulator are taking forward should more than offset any increase arising from our support for renewables, so electricity prices should continue to fall in real terms over the coming years.
<P>

<a name="00201w11.html_para10">In addition, the Government's new policy will provide a positive strategic approach to planning for renewable energy from the regional level downwards to facilitate its development while continuing to protect the countryside. The Government are therefore proposing that regional renewable energy assessments should set the framework for a more strategic land-use planning approach at regional level, itself providing the framework for local authorities' development plans and decisions on individual energy projects.
<P>

<a name="00201w11.html_para11">This is an exciting time for the renewables industry, and an opportunity for it to move from being a fledgling industry to becoming a mainstream business activity. This policy offers good business opportunities in the home market, which will provide a good base for developing exports. Most importantly, it will make an important contribution to the protection of our environment, while contributing to diversity and security of energy supplies.
<P>

<a name="00201w11.html_para12">I have published today "New and Renewable Energy--Prospects for the 21st Century--Conclusions in Response to the Public Consultation", to coincide with the introduction of the Utilities Bill. This is an initial policy statement to inform discussion of the powers in the Bill to introduce a Renewables Obligation on electricity suppliers. I am also planning to provide a full report containing the proposed programme for renewables later in the year after further discussion with interested parties in the light of this document.

 Protection of the Kosovo Serbs and other minorities is a top priority for KFOR and UNMIK. KFOR devotes around half of its resources at present to maintaining a presence in minority areas. In the UK-led sector, there are KFOR soldiers present in Serb towns and villages, as well as soldiers deployed to protect individual homes and farms. KFOR conducts patrols and escorts individuals to school and to work. In September 1999 UNMIK and Mr. Kouchner estimated 97,000 Serbs remain in Kosovo from a pre-war population of around 200,000. Since then there have been population movements in both directions of similar size.

 The KLA was demilitarised in September 1999, in accordance with UN Security Council resolution 1244 and has ceased to exist. Recent opinion polls indicate that the PPDK (Democratic Progress Party of Kosovo), the political party formed by the former commander of the KLA, Hashism Thaqi, has about 29 per cent. support and its leader about 15 per cent.

<P>
<a name="00201w12.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Vaz: </B> 
 There were 430 reported murders and 180 kidnappings in Kosovo in the period between KFOR's deployment there on 12 June and 25 December last year. We do not have a breakdown of these figures by ethnic origin but of the 383 murders reported up to mid- November, 139 were Serbs, 145 Albanians and 99 of unknown ethnic origin. UNMIK and KFOR are putting substantial resources into protecting ethnic minorities. Currently over 50 per cent. of KFOR troops are on minority protection duties, providing a permanent presence in Serb towns, villages, neighbourhoods and individual houses. KFOR's presence has resulted in a significant reduction in the number of reported major offences from over 300 in the last week of June to fewer than 50 in the last week of November. There are no figures available for the other crimes.

<a name="00201w12.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Vaz: </B> 
 The questions of a visit to Brussels came up in an unscheduled telephone conversation between Prodi and Gaddafi in December. We were not informed in advance of this conversation and no formal invitation was made. Following a Libyan suggestion in January that Gaddafi was to make a visit, we made clear to the Commission that such a visit would be premature until Libya had confirmed that it accepted the Barcelona Declaration and the acquis of the Barcelona Process unconditionally and in full. A visit to Brussels could only then be considered.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, pursuant to his statement of 18 January 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 669, whether border controls, defence, taxation, social security, own resources and Treaty amendments represent a definitive list of issues in which he will not countenance an extension of qualified majority voting at the IGC.  [107397]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00201w12.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Vaz: </B> 
 We have long made it clear that we will not support the extension of QMV to areas of key national interest. Border controls, defence, taxation, social security, own resources and Treaty change are examples of such areas.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00201w12.html_spnew14"><B> Mr. Vaz: </B> 
 The threshold for a blocking minority has for many years been set at around 30 per cent. of the votes. The Government's view is that this sets about the right balance between ease with which legislation can be passed or blocked.

[107398]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00201w12.html_spnew15"><B> Mr. Vaz: </B> 
 We have made it clear on a number of occasions that we will consider the extension of qualified majority voting on a case by case basis. Where it is in Britain's interests we will support it. But in key areas of national interest we shall insist on retaining unanimity.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what is his policy on incorporation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the EU Treaties; and if he will make a statement.  [107364]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00201w12.html_spnew16"><B> Mr. Vaz: </B> 
 We believe that a Charter which sets out rights already enjoyed by EU citizens in a clear and accessible way will help to deepen and strengthen the culture of rights and responsibilities at all levels across the EU. We consider that these objectives can best be met if the Charter is drafted as a declaratory document, identifying and complementing existing legal instruments on fundamental rights. We do not therefore favour the Charter's incorporation into the Treaties.

He emphasised that the UK wants the applicant states to join the European Union as soon as they are able to meet the obligations of membership. It is too soon to say when this will be.

<a name="00201w14.html_para1">Entitlement to Incapacity Benefit is based on a person's incapacity provided they satisfy the National Insurance contribution conditions. An award of benefit is made from the outset if the contribution conditions are satisfied and there is acceptable medical evidence to support the claim. Subsequently, incapacity is assessed under the relevant medical test (either the Own Occupation Test (OOT) during the first 28 weeks of incapacity where the claimant has a recent work record or the All Work Test (AWT) after 28 weeks or from the start of the claim where the claimant has not recently worked). If the test is not satisfied, benefit is disallowed from that point.

(14) The sum of the IB awards and those disallowed at outset does not equal the number of IB claims, as this figure includes claims that are subsequently withdrawn and accident declarations (which are made in case a claim to benefit becomes necessary at a later date as a result of an industrial accident).

<P>

<a name="00201w16.html_para0">We recognise that greater assurance for the public is needed about the safety and quality of the treatment being provided in this area. We therefore intend to introduce improved regulation of independent healthcare services, including premises where cosmetic surgery is performed, medical treatment is provided under anaesthesia or sedation, and where certain laser treatment is provided. These measures are included in the provisions of our Care Standards Bill. Our aim is to achieve more effective regulation to assure the quality of private cosmetic surgery, the adequacy of information for patients and would-be patients, the safety of the technology and equipment used, including laser treatment, and the effectiveness of complaints procedures when things do go wrong. We are confident that this will provide the enhanced safeguards and assurance of standards in private cosmetic surgery.

 NHS Direct has proved to be very effective in meeting patients' needs. Sheffield University's independent interim evaluation of the first three NHS Direct pilot sites found that overall 97 per cent. of callers surveyed were either satisfied or very satisfied with the service they received. Out of those callers triaged by a nurse, nurses advise two out of three callers to a more appropriate setting of care than the caller said they would otherwise have used.

<P>
<a name="00201w16.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Stuart: </B> 
 NHS Direct is improving access to health care by advising callers which part of the NHS to contact. NHS Direct nurses advise two out of three callers to use a more appropriate setting of care than the caller said they would otherwise have used. One in three callers are advised how to look after themselves at home. Over the holiday period, NHS Direct handled over 200,000 calls: if NHS Direct had not been available, many of these callers would have contacted other NHS services, including accident and emergency departments and the ambulance services at a time when these services were very hard pressed.

 481 Primary Care Groups began on 1 April 1999 and are making excellent progress in bringing GPs, nurses, health professionals and social services together to deliver better services for their local population. 68 Primary Care Groups have also made applications to gain Primary Care Trust status this year and I have recently announced the first 17 to start from 1 April 2000.

<P>
<a name="00201w16.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 Improving mental health services in the National Health Service is a priority for this Government. The Department also works closely with organisations such as the Alzheimer's Society, Dementia Relief Trust and the Dementia Services Development Centres who provide advice and support to users, their carers and those developing local services.
<P>

<a name="00201w16.html_para9">The work for the National Service Framework for Older People covers mental health including dementia. We expect to be publishing the National Service Framework later this year.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00201w16.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 We are committed to help the National Health Service recruit the extra nurses it needs to deliver modern and dependable care.
<P>

<a name="00201w16.html_para10">Last month (January), we announced an above inflation pay award of 3.4 per cent. for all nurses, with additional increases for experienced staff nurses of 7.8 per cent.
<P>

<a name="00201w16.html_para11">As a result of last year's national recruitment campaign, over 5,000 nurses are returning to the NHS, and applications for nursing degree courses are up by 24 per cent.
<P>

<a name="00201w16.html_para12">I am pleased to tell my hon. Friend that we will be launching this year's national recruitment campaign on 28 February. The campaign will include high profile TV and press advertising, and will target those areas of the country with the most pressing vacancies.
<P>

<a name="00201w16.html_para13">The Government are also making progress on modernising services and modernising employment practice in the NHS to retain nurses. Through our national nursing strategy, "Making a Difference", the NHS is developing flexible and family friendly working practices; extending and improving investment in lifelong learning and professional development, and tackling violence and racism in the workplace.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00201w17.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 Continuing professional development (CPD) in general practice is important. Learning must be lifelong and cannot cease at the end of formal training. To provide the best possible service to their patients general practitioners should keep up to date with advances in patient care and continually review and improve their knowledge, skills and abilities. We will be issuing a paper on CPD in primary care, building on the many examples of good work already being done by GPs and extending these principles to all primary care staff.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00201w17.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 Extra Contractual Referrals (ECRs) were part of the unfair "two tier" internal market, and were abolished on 31 March 1999. They have been replaced by new arrangements for commissioning services--long term service agreements, specialised service agreements and out-of-area treatments.
<P>

<a name="00201w17.html_para0">Following the introduction of the new commissioning arrangements on 1 April 1999, the National Health Service Executive has received a small number of representations regarding the out-of-area treatment scheme. We are, of course, keeping the arrangements under review.

<P>
<a name="00201w17.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 Under the Out-of-area treatment (OAT) arrangements, each National Health Service trust has a main commissioner. The main commissioner health authority is funded for OATs through an annual non-recurrent adjustment to allocations. NHS trusts should be paid by their main commissioners in line with the profile agreed locally.

 North Essex Health Authority is in the process of reviewing its maternity services strategy for the whole of its area, with key stakeholders and users. There will be no changes made to existing maternity services until this strategy has been agreed. Any proposed changes to existing provision will be the subject of a full and open consultation.

It is for health authorities, in partnership with NHS trusts, primary care groups, local authorities and local stakeholders to determine how best to use their funds to meet national and local priorities for improving health and modernising services. The significant additional resources available will help them in this.

 Southend Community National Health Service Trust and Thameside Community NHS Trust will merge from 1 April 2000 following a period of statutory consultation which ended on 31 August 1999.
<P>

<a name="00201w17.html_para4">The benefits of merger of the two trusts are significant. Equity, efficiency and access to services should all be improved. Elimination of organisational barriers will provide a platform from which clinical services can be developed. Thus best practice can more easily and quickly be implemented in respect of integration of mental health and other services in community settings. Management should be better placed to liaise effectively with stakeholders within and outside the NHS. The new structure will also improve local flexibility to make future changes easier, as primary care groups and Primary Care Trusts mature and take on additional roles. In addition, savings from reduced management costs can be re- invested in direct patient care.

 NICE will secure a more rapid uptake of cost-effective innovations, eliminate the lottery of care, and help the NHS deliver the best possible patient care with the resources available. NICE's initial work programme was announced in November. Interim guidance on Relenza has already been issued. Appraisal guidance on hip implants, extraction of wisdom teeth, taxanes for breast and ovarian cancer, coronary artery stents, and new diagnostic techniques for cervical cancer will follow over the next three months or so.

<P>
<a name="00201w18.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The Government fund health and medical research in a number of ways.
<P>

<a name="00201w18.html_para2">The Medical Research Council (MRC)--which receives most of its income via grant-in-aid from the office of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry--funds medical research as part of the Government's funding of the science and engineering base.
<P>

<a name="00201w18.html_para3">It is the main agency through which the Government support research on the causes and treatment of disease.
<P>

<a name="00201w18.html_para4">The Department funds research and development to support its work on policy development and evaluation in health and social care. The Department also manages the National Health Service research and development levy which is used to support research and development of relevance to the National Health Service in hospitals, general practice and other health care settings, and to fund the NHS research and development programme.
<P>

<a name="00201w18.html_para5">During 1998-99 the MRC spent &#163;58 million on neurosciences and mental health research.
<P>

<a name="00201w18.html_para6">This research portfolio covers a wide range of areas in basic research that underpin the understanding of diseases and dysfunction of the brain, including cerebral palsy.
<P>

<a name="00201w18.html_para7">The national NHS research and development programme has funded a number of projects on cerebral palsy at a total cost of &#163;619,579. Expenditure for this work over the last five years is as follows.

<P>

<a name="00201w18.html_para8">Management of much of the research supported by the NHS research and development levy is devolved and details of expenditure at project level are not held centrally by the Department. For example, the Department provides support funds to allow work funded by others such as the Research Councils and charities to be conducted within the NHS. Local research projects may also be funded through NHS regional offices. The total spend on cerebral palsy research will therefore be greater than that shown for the national NHS research and development programme above.
<P>

<a name="00201w18.html_para9">The Department also funds the National Perinatal Epidemiology Unit at Oxford, whose programme includes work on cerebral palsy.
<P>

<a name="00201w18.html_para10">Project details of work directly funded by the Department or supported through the NHS research and development levy can be found on the National Research Register (NRR). This is available in the Library and most medical libraries on CD-ROM and on the Internet: http://www.doh.gov.uk/nrr.htm. The NRR lists a considerable number of projects related to cerebral palsy.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

As a consequence of technical obsolescence, IT disposals tend to have no resale value. The Department and its Agencies seek to maximise the use of existing technology where possible, and only dispose of IT equipment when it can no longer meet the Department's needs.<P>

The Department has incurred some additional expense to dispose safely of PCBs and Monitors but this cost is not readily distinguishable from other expenditure on waste disposal.<P>

Version 9.3.7 of the "ORACLE Financials" Resource Accounting and Management Information System has been superseded by version 10.7. The earlier version has been retained for accessing archived data. PSD upgraded their SUN Accounts system in March 1999. Although there was no cash benefit from the disposal of the old system and associated equipment, the Agency received a trade-in value of &#163;20,000 against the cost of the upgrade.
<BR>
Some non-critical software systems were capitalised on MAFF and Agency Accounts where material external costs had been incurred. These had no residual value, were not Millennium compliant, and have been written off from the accounts.

incur extra transport costs as a result of the withdrawal of the contract with West Devon Meats to slaughter cattle under the over thirty months scheme.  [101912]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00201w21.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 13 December 1999]:</i> There are no plans to provide such compensation. Neither was such compensation paid at the time of the previous tender. It is the responsibility of the producers to transport their Over Thirty Months Scheme (OTMS) animals from the farm to the point of slaughter. The Government's responsibility is to ensure that there is a sufficient number of access points into the scheme, and that they are well distributed having regard to the main production areas. The outcome of the tender for OTMS slaughtering services, together with the unchanged network of 170 markets registered to collect OTMS cattle (10 of which are in Devon), fully meet these requirements.

<P>
<a name="00201w21.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The United Kingdom's share of the EU Leader Plus Community Initiative is 106 million euro out of 2,020 million euro for the period 2000-06. The Member States receiving more funding than the United Kingdom are Germany, Greece, Spain, France, Italy and Portugal. The European Commission have said that allocations to Member States were based on allocations under previous programmes and objective criteria such as population in rural areas, utilised agricultural area and population density.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00201w21.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 The UK attaches considerable importance to the maintenance of adequate raw sugar supplies to the cane refining industry, which produces about half of our sugar. We therefore need to keep this consideration firmly in mind in forthcoming discussions about the EU sugar regime, and preferential access for cane sugar.

Progress is being made and labels are being changed. Although not produced in a form which can readily be published, the meat trade adviser's findings are made known as he discusses his progress regularly with the National Pig Association and other industry bodies.

 <i>[holding answer 25 January 2000]:</i> The Wildlife Incidents Investigation Scheme collects reports of wildlife deaths that may have been caused by rodenticides or other pesticides. All incidents accepted into the Scheme are investigated and the pesticide involved, if any, identified. The results of investigations may be used in a review of the pesticide approval and in enforcement action. In 1998, 49 cases were found to involve anticoagulant rodenticides.

 All meat and meat products, including processed and pre-packed pigmeat, imported from third countries are subject to veterinary inspection at designated Border Inspection Posts. All consignments are subject to documentary and identity checks and at least 20 per cent. of consignments are subject to physical checks. These checks are to ensure that conditions of import have been complied with and that the products have remained in a satisfactory condition during transport.
<P>

<a name="00201w22.html_para1">Meat and meat products originating in all EU member states, including the UK, are subject to strict hygiene rules laid down in EU law. Among other things, this sets out the licensing, structural and supervision requirements to be applied in all meat plants before they can be approved for trade with other member states. Member states to which meat and meat products may be dispatched are permitted to carry out random checks at destination but these are limited by virtue of the fact that there are no certification or pre-notification requirements for most consignments.
<P>

<a name="00201w22.html_para2">Ensuring that all member states comply with their Community obligations in properly implementing and applying EU hygiene rules is the responsibility of the European Commission, whose Food and Veterinary Office carries out regular programmes of inspection visits to all member states.

 The total allowable catch (TAC) of 81,000 tonnes agreed for 2,000 takes account of scientific advice from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) that the stock is currently outside safe biological limits and that fishing mortality should be reduced to prevent further decline in the Spawning Stock Biomass (SSB) in the short term. The ICES advice indicates that the maximum catch limit agreed provides a high probability that the SSB will increase to above the precautionary reference level of 150,000 tonnes over the next few years.

<a name="00201w22.html_para3">It can be seen that the North Sea TAC has moved up and down, while the West of Scotland TAC has steadily declined, reflecting scientific advice from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea on the state of the stock. The reductions agreed for 2000 take account of advice from ICES that the combined saithe stock is outside safe biological limits and that fishing mortality should be reduced to prevent further decline in the Spawning Stock Biomass (SSB) in the short term. The reduced TACs will help ensure that the SSB increases to more sustainable levels over the medium term.

 It is for the Environment Agency to determine its spending priorities for 2001-02 in the light of the planned &#163;1.5 million reduction in Grant-in-Aid in England. It is not possible for me to predict how the cut is likely to affect sea trout runs in the West Sussex area.

 <i>[holding answer 31 January 2000]:</i> I travelled to Rome in October 1997--at no cost to public funds--both for a private visit and to meet the Italian Finance Minister, Mr. Carlo Ciampi. In line with the requirements of the Ministerial Code no declaration to the Permanent Secretary was necessary.

<a name="00201w22.html_spnew8"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 The Government have introduced child tax credits in the WFTC and will introduce a separate children's tax credit from April 2001. The two credits have very different withdrawal mechanisms and without a clearer guide as to which should be applied it is not possible to answer the question.

 The EC Directive which provides for an optional, experimental, reduced rate of VAT applies only to a narrow range of labour intensive services. The Chancellor has no plans for its application to the equestrian industry.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00201w22.html_spnew11"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 The problems of tax fraud and international criminality, including tobacco smuggling, are matters regularly included in discussions which I and other members of the Government have with counterparts in other EU member states. These are underpinned by frequent operational and other contacts between officials in both the UK and other member states, together with the Anti-Fraud Unit of the European Commission.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what recent reports he has received on the extent of <i>(a)</i> Mafia and <i>(b)</i> other criminal organisations' involvement in tobacco smuggling in Europe and on the centres of control and operation.  [107499]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00201w22.html_spnew12"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 Treasury Ministers receive regular reports on tax fraud activity affecting a variety of sectors including tobacco. Some of this information is in the form of confidential and operationally sensitive advice, some is contained in published documents. A recent document in the latter category is the 1998 European Commission "Annual Report on the Fight Against Fraud" published on 19 November 1999, a copy of which is available in the House of Commons Library.

<P>
<a name="00201w23.html_spnew1"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 In 1998-99, total income tax liabilities are estimated to be around &#163;89 billion before allowances given as tax deductions at a fixed rate (such as the married couples allowance) and &#163;85.5 billion after these allowances. Lower rate, basic rate and higher rate liabilities, before the aforementioned allowances are estimated to be &#163;22.8 billion, &#163;41.0 billion and &#163;25.3 billion respectively.

 EC law does not permit a reduced rate of VAT for repairs to historic buildings. A recent Directive made provision for a short term experimental reduced rate for renovation and repairs of private housing, which could therefore cover some historic buildings.
