<a name="01107w01.html_wqn0"><B> Dr. Julian Lewis: </B> 
To ask the Solicitor-General if he will list the conditions to be met for material found in the archives of foreign intelligence agencies to be regarded by the Crown Prosecution Service as of evidential value in legal proceedings.  [136231]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01107w01.html_spmin0"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 Any statement in a document found in the archives of a foreign intelligence agency will be hearsay and inadmissible if the reason for tendering the evidence is to prove the truth of the content of the document, unless the document can be brought within one of the exceptions to the hearsay rule. The most important of these, as regards statements in documents, are found in a number of statutes, for instance the Criminal Justice Act 1988.

<P>
<P>
<a name="01107w01.html_wqn1"><B> Dr. Julian Lewis: </B> 
To ask the Solicitor-General what the Crown Prosecution Service's policy is on prosecution of cyclists for <i>(a)</i> riding on pavements, <i>(b)</i> failing to display lights at night, <i>(c)</i> riding without warning bells or horns and <i>(d)</i> ignoring red signals at traffic junctions.  [136257]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01107w01.html_spmin1"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 Pedestrians and road users should be able to travel safely. Cyclists must take responsibility to ensure the safety of others and where the facilities are available make use of designated cycle lanes and at other times use the roadways. When cyclists have failed to act in a safe way thereby causing or potentially causing danger to others, offences arising out of this behaviour (such as riding on a pavement, failing to display lights, and ignoring signals) will be considered for prosecution.
<P>

<a name="01107w01.html_para0">Where cases referred to the Crown Prosecution Service pass the evidential and public interest tests set out in the Code for Crown Prosecuters, a prosecution will be brought. There is no law stating that pedal cycles must be ridden with warning bells or horns and the Crown Prosecution Service cannot prosecute such cases.

<P>
<a name="01107w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. McNamara: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, pursuant to his answer of 23 October 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 20-21W, what the recommendations are of John Steele's report on implementation of recommendation 87 of the Patten report; how he plans to respond to each of the recommendations proposed; and what estimate he has made of the cost of implementing each recommendation.  [135792]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01107w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Mandelson: </B> 
 I received the report from John Steele on 27 October. It is being published today, and copies are being placed in the Library of both Houses. Copies are also being sent to all those parties with whom Mr. Steele had meetings.
<P>

<a name="01107w01.html_para1">The Government are grateful to Mr. Steele for taking on this sensitive review of the recommendation (recommendation 87) by the Independent Commission on Policing and for concluding his review so promptly. We welcome his comprehensive and thorough report. The Government are undertaking a detailed assessment of each of the specific proposals and these will form the basis on which the Government take forward implementation of this very important Patten recommendation.
<P>

<a name="01107w01.html_para2">In particular, the Government agree that a new fund should be established covering in scope deaths and injuries caused directly by terrorist violence against members of the police in Northern Ireland. The fund would help seriously injured police officers, and retired officers and their families, as well as police widows.
<P>

<a name="01107w01.html_para3">The Government will establish a Trust to administer the fund, on the basis proposed, as soon as possible.
<P>

<a name="01107w01.html_para4">The Government also accept the key recommendation that widows of police officers who were killed as a result of terrorist activity prior to 25 November 1982 should receive lump sum payments. We will look to see how these payments, along the lines proposed in Mr. Steele's report, can be made without undue delay.
<P>

<a name="01107w01.html_para5">The Government have already implemented the related recommendation, recommendation 88, that the Widows' Association should be given premises and a regular source of finance to run their organisation. The Widows' Association moved into new premises, and funding began, in September.

<a name="01107w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Rapson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what plans he has for the armed forces to undertake a joint exercise in Oman in Autumn 2001.  [137361]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01107w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 Exercise Saif Sareea 2 will take place in Oman in September and October 2001. This will be a major Joint and Combined exercise with the Sultan's Armed Forces. The exercise will demonstrate the Joint Rapid Reaction Force concept, which was a central pillar of our Strategic Defence Review by deploying, sustaining and recovering a Joint Task Force at medium scale to conduct an Out of Area Operation. It sends a very clear signal about our commitment to the Gulf region and will show Britain's ability to deploy rapidly a considerable force, with real punch, over large distances. The UK contribution will include a Naval Carrier Task Group, Armoured and 



<P>
<P><I>7 Nov 2000 : Column: 117W</I><P>
Commando Brigades and around 50 combat aircraft. The exact number of personnel taking part has yet to be finalised, but our contribution will be in excess of 20,000.

<P>
<P>
<a name="01107w01.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Ian Stewart: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will make a statement on the use of Sponsored Reserves.  [137548]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01107w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The first agreement for the use of what are familiarly known as "Sponsored Reserves" was signed on 27 October 2000 on behalf of the Meteorological Office and the RAF's HQ Strike Command. Introduced by the Reserve Forces Act 1996, this new form of reserve service extends the ability of the private sector and Government agencies to provide specialist support on operations as well as in peacetime. More properly known as special members of a reserve force, sponsored reservists are employed as civilians in peacetime and as volunteer members of a reserve force when deployed to support operations.
<P>

<a name="01107w01.html_para6">The Mobile Meteorological Unit (MMU) provides meteorological support to the RAF in peacetime and to UK and Allied Forces when these forces are operating away from their fixed bases. Some 60 staff of the MMU form a unit of the RAF Reserve. Members will be routinely called out on a rotational basis under the terms and conditions of employment developed from the abroad consultation process with Industry that followed the Reserve Forces Act's coming into force in April 1997. This agreement represents the first use of the SR concept by my Department and builds on the established working pattern of the MMU which has supported operations since 1962 with great distinction.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence, pursuant to the answer of 26 October 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 160W, regarding his Department's headquarters in Whitehall, which companies or consortia other than Modus Services plc were <i>(a)</i> invited to apply for the public-private partnership contract and <i>(b)</i> applied for the public private-partnership contract; what independent assessment was made of his Department's office requirements prior to the contract being signed; and if he will place in the Library a copy of the contract between his Department and Modus Services plc.

<P>
<a name="01107w01.html_spnew3"><B> Dr. Moonie </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 6 November 2000]:</i> As a result of advertisements requesting Expressions of Interest in December 1996, over 30 companies were issued a Preliminary Information Memorandum (PIM) in February 1997. Eight consortia responded to the PIM and six consortia were invited in mid 1997 to submit outline proposals for the public-private partnership project for the redevelopment of the Ministry of Defence Main Building in Whitehall.

<P>
<a name="01107w02.html_wqn0"><B> Dr. Cable: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence (1) if he will publish the bids received for construction of the four vessels under the ALSL performance; indicating how successful and unsuccessful bidders <i>(a)</i> met and <i>(b)</i> failed to meet his Department's selection criteria;  [136744]

<P>
<a name="01107w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hoon </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 6 November 2000]:</i> Four new Alternative Landing Ships Logistics (ALSL), replacing four LSLs, therefore represents a significant increase in capability. The current Landing Ships Logistic (LSLs) are mostly over 30 years old and of decreasing utility. The new ships will each have double the capacity of the old versions, and be able to offload troops into a potentially hostile environment twice as quickly, at a safer distance, in significantly worse sea conditions. We have always known that the LSLs would need replacing at some point; buying four ALSLs in this manner represents better value for money that running a fleet of two ALSLs and three LSLs and then buying more ALSLs closer to the LSLs' Out of Service Dates.
<P>

<a name="01107w02.html_para0">The bids received, the assessment markings and the prices are commercially sensitive and I am therefore withholding these details under Exemption 7 (effective management and operations of the public service) and Exemption 13 (third party's commercial confidences) of the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information.

This encompasses initial training (i.e. new recruits) and aspects of career training and Pre-Joining Training, i.e. courses immediately prior to a particular draft/appointment. These figures do not include costs of projections for Royal Marines or Naval Reserves but does include the NRTA HQ costs as these are considered to be a training overhead cost or projection.

 <i>[holding answer 6 November 2000]:</i> Both Customs and Excise and the Inland Revenue will deal sympathetically with any business in serious difficulty as a result of an unforeseeable event such as severe flooding. Deadlines applicable to the submission of VAT and other tax returns are prescribed in law but there is no liability to a penalty where the business has a reasonable excuse for failing to meet its obligations.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what guidelines are issued by the Inland Revenue regarding the tax treatment of married couples where a business partnership exists between husband and wife; if, in these circumstances, an investigation into the tax affairs of either husband or wife automatically triggers an investigation into the financial circumstances of the spouse; and if he will make a statement.  [135158]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01107w03.html_spnew9"><B> Dawn Primarolo </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 6 November 2000]:</i> The tax treatment of a business partnership between husband and wife is the same as the tax treatment of any other business partnership.
<P>

<a name="01107w03.html_para0">The Inland Revenue may open an inquiry into the partnership return and any or all of the partners' personal returns. The official guidance is that before they issue a notice of an inquiry into the partnership return, staff should review the returns of all relevant partners. Where staff decide that they need to check whether the partnership return is fundamentally incorrect, they will normally need to inquire into all of the individual partners' returns as well. This is to ensure that all risks of error or evasion in the partnership are looked at properly.
<P>

<a name="01107w03.html_para1">Where a partner's personal return is selected for inquiry on its merits, without an inquiry into the partnership return, then an inquiry into the spouse's return is not triggered automatically.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what changes have been made to the English comparator that forms the basis of the Barnett formula in each year since 1997; what consequential changes in allocations to <i>(a)</i> Northern Ireland, <i>(b)</i> Scotland and <i>(c)</i> Wales were made as a result; and what the cumulative effect of all such changes was in the current financial year.  [137027]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01107w03.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Andrew Smith: </B> 
 With regard to changes which have been made to the English comparator since 1997, the departmental comparability factors in the Barnett formula which were used in the 1998 Comprehensive Spending Review were set out in Annexe C of the Statement of Funding Policy published in March 1999. The factors which were used in the 2000 Spending Review were set out in Annexe C of the updated Statement of Funding Policy in July 2000.
<P>

<a name="01107w03.html_para2">The changes in allocations to Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales depend on changes in UK Government Departments' departmental expenditure limits, the relevant departmental comparability factor and the appropriate population share. Increases in the Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales budgets were announced in the 1998 Comprehensive Spending Review and 2000 Spending Review.
<P>

<a name="01107w03.html_para3">Spending in the current financial year determined in the 1998 Comprehensive Spending Review was based on comparability factors used in that review.

 We have said that local government will be reimbursed for the overall additional cost of the statutory minimum concessionary fare scheme, for which provision is made in the Transport Bill at present before Parliament. The Local Government Finance settlement will include an appropriate sum within the Environmental Protection and Cultural Services block, which will be distributed according to the relevant Standard Spending Assessment formula. The implications for individual authorities will depend on whether any concessionary fare scheme which they already provide meets the new statutory requirements, or if it does not what expenditure will be involved in bringing it up to the necessary standard.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01107w05.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 Our estimate of the overall annual extra cost in England of the statutory minimum scheme provided for in the Transport Bill is in the order of &#163;47 million. That amount is therefore being added to the lower tier of the Environmental, Protective and Cultural Services (EPCS) Standard Spending Assessment (SSA), which is taken into account in the calculation of revenue support grant allocations. An authority's SSA will increase by a share of the &#163;47 million that is broadly in proportion to its current share of the EPCS lower tier. The financial implications of the minimum standard will clearly vary from one local authority to another, according to whether an existing scheme is operated and if so what it provides.

 The Transport Bill provides for a statutory minimum local authority concessionary fares scheme for travel on local bus services. However, it is open to local authorities to offer schemes which provide for travel by taxi as an addition or an alternative to the statutory minimum scheme. In particular, schemes based on tokens, which can be used on taxis, can continue to be offered by local authorities, as an alternative to the statutory minimum. The necessary provision is contained in clause 145(6) of the Transport Bill, at present before Parliament.

NATS have now informed us that the revised forecast date on which the centre will come into operation may now be in the winter of 2007-08 rather than 2006-07. This is because NATS is considering the incorporation of additional software into the centre's systems. It is only because NATS are confident that the existing centre will be able to cope until this later date that they have the option of putting back the forecast operational date to allow the incorporation of these new functions.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what powers he has to regulate the cost of air travel from regional airports.  [136280]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01107w07.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 On routes within the European Economic Area (EEA), air fares are governed by EC Regulation 2409/92, under which there is a presumption that airlines are free to charge the fares they wish. However, the Secretary of State may require the lowest fully flexible fare to be withdrawn if it is excessively high to the disadvantage of users, taking into account airline costs, the whole fare structure for the route, and the competitive market situation.
<P>

<a name="01107w07.html_para0">In addition, EC Regulation 2408/92 allows a member state to impose a public service obligation (PSO) to protect services, which would otherwise not be provided on a purely commercial basis, on routes serving airports in peripheral regions and thin routes to any regional airport which is vital to the economic development of the region. The Regulation allows for PSO routes to be restricted to a single carrier, subject to an open competitive tender, and for the remuneration of operating losses incurred by carriers selected to operate these routes. PSOs may include a tariff obligation limiting fare levels or requiring concessionary fares for certain categories of passenger.
<P>

<a name="01107w07.html_para1">On routes outside the EEA, it is the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) which has the power to regulate air fares. The CAA's intervention is limited primarily to circumstances where passengers are being substantially overcharged as a result of an airline abusing a position of market power, normally because bilateral government imposed restrictions are preventing free market entry. The CAA's aim is to ensure that flexible on-demand travel is available at a price reasonably related to the cost of its provision, including a return on capital.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01107w07.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 The Environment Agency has powers under the Water Resources Act 1991, the Groundwater Regulations 1998 and the Anti-Pollution Works Regulations 1999 to take action where pollution is threatened or occurring. Under the Groundwater Regulations, for instance, it can prohibit, or place conditions upon, an activity such as quarrying where groundwater could be threatened. The exact measures which it might take would depend upon the circumstances of the individual case. Local authorities have a statutory duty to consult the Environment Agency when considering planning consents for quarries and are able to impose conditions to protect groundwater. Minerals Planning Guidance 2 "Applications, permissions and conditions" (1998) contains advice on this.

<P>
<P>

<a name="01107w08.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 I am pleased to be able to announce that the needs indices for the 2001-02 allocations have now been finalised after careful consideration of the responses to the Consultation Paper we issued in summer and a number of other representations we have received.




<P>
<P><I>7 Nov 2000 : Column: 141W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="01107w08.html_para4">We have, with one exception, made the proposed changes to the local authority stock condition indicator in the Generalised Needs Index (GNI)--the index used in allocation of resources to local authorities. These were supported in nearly all responses. The exception is on the relative weights given to the renovation and improvement elements where we have decided to base these on the relative costs of the work as suggested in a number of responses.
<P>

<a name="01107w08.html_para5">Several of the responses raised concerns over authorities' ability to fund either private sector renewal activity or provision of new affordable housing following the transfer of resources into the new Major Repairs Allowance (MRA), which is ring-fenced for use on council housing. In the light of these responses, I have decided to increase the shares of the private sector stock and new provision indicators in the GNI to 45 per cent.--up from 35 per cent. and 40 per cent. respectively in the Consultation Paper. These increases involve reducing the share of the local authority stock indicator to 10 per cent. but we intend to increase this in the next two years to reflect the extra resources in these years which are expected to be spent largely on improving council housing. The other significant issued raised in the responses concerned the overall reduction in the targeting of resources to deprived areas resulting from the introduction of the MRA. Specific targeting of resources to deprived areas is not appropriate in the MRA but I have decided to increase the level of targeting within the GNI from 20 per cent. to 30 per cent.
<P>

<a name="01107w08.html_para6">The introduction of the MRA and the related GNI changes lead to shifts in the distribution of resources. We will ensure that all authorities with housing stock receive a 2001-02 allocation (housing capital plus estimated MRA) which is at least 10 per cent. above their 2000-01 allocation unless there has been a significant fall in their relative performance or the number of council houses they own has fallen substantially through partial stock transfers or demolitions.
<P>

<a name="01107w08.html_para7">No changes were proposed or are being made to the Housing Needs Index used in allocation of resources to registered social landlords, beyond the usual annual data updating.

 My right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State has issued directions to Sport England under the National Lottery Acts requiring it to take into account a range of issues in formulating its criteria for Lottery funding and in assessing applications for such funding. In particular, the directions require Sport England to take into account the scope for reducing social and economic deprivation, and the promotion of sport for people from all sections of society. All of the requirements of these directions were taken into account by Sport England in the development of its Lottery Strategy published last year. The Strategy commits Sport England to allocating at least 50 per cent. of its Community Capital Projects Fund to areas of greatest need. Projects in these areas may also be eligible to receive higher proportions of Lottery funding. All projects submitted for Lottery funding must be of benefit to the local community and must show a demonstrable need for the facility.

 Approval for the demolition of the twin towers was given by the London Borough of Brent following an application for planning and listed building consent made by Wembley National Stadium Ltd. As the stadium has Grade II listed status, the application for listed building consent was accompanied by a full Heritage Study which considered the question of whether the stadium was capable of adaptation and the feasibility of retaining the twin towers. The new stadium will extend to the north of the existing stadium, and will be considerably higher than the towers if they were reconstructed and incorporated in the new design. In view of these considerations, and having taken into account the merits of the proposed replacement stadium, and wider community benefits, English Heritage, who are a statutory consultee for such applications, did not raise any objections to the application for listed building consent.

 <i>[holding answer 6 November 2000]:</i> The Disability Discrimination Act 1995 will provide disabled people with better service and facilities and it will also boost one of tourism's under-developed markets. It is not possible to estimate the cost of complying with the requirements of the DDA by type of property because each case will be different. I recognise the concern among small hoteliers about the potential costs of complying with the Act, but they are only required to make "reasonable" changes to their properties, which means the costs will be reasonable. There is a need for sector specific guidance on the sort of adjustments which are likely to be necessary and my Department is discussing with the English Tourism Council and other bodies how to meet this need.

 The new quality assurance system for hotels and guest accommodation was introduced in September 1999 by the English Tourism Council (ETC), the AA and RAC.

 The Department for Culture, Media and Sport is responsible for funding the English Tourism Council (ETC). In the current financial year the ETC is making over &#163;5 million of its &#163;10 million grant-in-aid available to support tourism in the English regions. Most of this is being passed to the 10 Regional Tourist Boards under individual funding agreements with the ETC, following a competitive bidding process. The remainder of this regional money is used by the ETC, for instance, for delivering regional services such as inspections under the national accommodation scheme (which have been contracted out to a single provider). Future levels of funding for tourism in the English regions will be decided during negotiation of the next three-year funding agreement between the Department and the ETC and in the light of any further bidding competition run by the ETC.

 The Government are currently in discussion with Legacy plc, in relation to Legacy's proposal for a high technology business campus at the Greenwich site. The Legacy proposal is currently being analysed by the Competition team in advance of any decision on preferred bidder status. An announcement will be made in due course. The New Millennium Experience Company (NMEC) is preparing plans for decommissioning the Millennium Experience from January 2001. That includes returning various assets in the exhibitions that are on loan or hired to their owners, removing any other items of value for sale, and preparing the Dome for its subsequent use. Legacy plc is in discussion with NMEC regarding the scope of decommissioning it would require if negotiations are successful.

 <i>[holding answer 6 November 2000]:</i> The Agency has repaired and maintained upstream floodbanks that provide flood protection to the town. Proposals for a scheme in the town were rejected in 1994 by the borough council. The Agency has since been working with the borough council and the residents to investigate more innovative solutions and identify a scheme that would be both practical to develop and acceptable to the town's people if it meets the Ministry's criteria within which the Agency has to operate.

However, considerable revenue expenditure has been made--more than &#163;1 million since 1996--to repair and maintain upstream floodbanks that provide flood protection to the town.

 The Welfare of Farmed Animals (England) Regulations 2000 (SI 2000 No 1870), which came into force on 14 August this year, regulate the conditions in which all cattle and calves should be kept, covering such things as accommodation, ventilation, lighting, feed and water, and inspections. Similar regulations will shortly enter into force in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Revision of our Code of Recommendations for the Welfare of Cattle is nearly complete and will reflect FAWC's advice on best practice on all-year housing; we shall shortly consult with all stakeholders on our draft. We have also commissioned a research project involving behavioural studies relating to the welfare of intensively managed dairy cows. And, through the agricultural consultancy ADAS, we run an extensive programme of guidance for dairy farmers.

 <i>[holding answer 6 November 2000]:</i> The reply given to my hon. Friend the Member for Heywood and Middleton (Mr. Dobbin) on 30 October 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 233W, referred to a recognition by Commissioner Fischler of the importance of traditional 



<P>
<P><I>7 Nov 2000 : Column: 151W</I><P>
landscape features, such as hedges, in implementing aid schemes. This recognition stems from the frequent and intensive contacts that MAFF Ministers and officials have had with the Commission over recent months and, as part of the initiative to simplify the administration of the Common Agricultural Policy, a change to the rules of the Integrated Administration and Control System (IACS) has now been proposed which would give it practical effect. The proposed rule change would allow United Kingdom farmers to continue, on a permanent basis, to treat field margins in the same way as they have done in the past so far as their inclusion in IACS claims is concerned and would remove the risk of environmental damage that might have resulted from strict application of "two metre rule". This change would also avoid imposing extra burdens of "red tape" on farmers or any adverse impact on their returns under the IACS schemes. The Government welcome this proposal and will press for its rapid adoption.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what changes there were in the average value of arable farmland in England from 1990 to 2000.  [136591]
<P>

<P>
<a name="01107w12.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Nick Brown </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 6 November 2000]:</i> MAFF's agricultural land prices series are derived from returns made to the Valuation Office Agency of the Inland Revenue. Arising from changes in the manner in which 



<P>
<P><I>7 Nov 2000 : Column: 152W</I><P>
the data were transmitted and compiled last year, there were some changes in definitions occasioning a break in the series. This break occurs in 1993; hence it is not possible to have a comparable series before and after that year. The latest available data refer to the year 1999 (and figures for this and the two preceding years are still provisional). The MAFF series are not defined directly for arable farmland but there is a categorisation by predominant grade of land. It is probably the case that Grades 1 and 2 land would be closest to arable land for most situations and this general assumption is made for the purpose of these valuations. The average price of Grades 1 and 2 farmland in England rose from &#163;3,617 per hectare in 1993 to &#163;7,172 in 1999, representing an increase in current (nominal) price terms of 98.3 per cent. The increase was not continuous and peaked in 1997 when the price was &#163;7,339 per hectare; it declined to &#163;6,941 in 1998, before rising somewhat again last year. In real (constant 1995 price) terms the overall increase for the period 1993 to 1999 amounted to 68.8 per cent.

 The Anti-Drugs Co-ordinator's second Annual Report is published today and copies have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses.
<P>

<a name="01107w12.html_para2">The report sets out progress during 1999-2000 in delivering our targets across the four aims of the Government's 10-Year Strategy which reflect the balance of our policies across all aspects of the drug misuse problem. Those aims are: helping young people to resist drug misuse; protecting our communities from drug related anti-social and criminal behaviour; increasing the numbers of drug misusers in treatment; and reducing the availability of drugs on our streets.
<P>

<a name="01107w12.html_para3">We have met most of our annual targets and are on track for our targets for 2002. Key achievements include: the establishment of the Drugs Prevention Advisory Service (DPAS), with nine regional teams to support the work of Drug Action Teams (DATs); establishment of a

framework for a holistic approach to drug education in schools through Personal, Social and Health Education (PSHE) which is now in the national curriculum for the first time--Ofsted reports indicated that 93 per cent. of secondary and 75 per cent. of primary schools now have a drug education policy; targeted prevention work for young people at risk through Health Action Zones; arrest referral schemes covering all custody suites in all police forces in England and Wales expected well ahead of our 2002 target; steady increase in drug misusers attending treatment services--around 7 per cent. over six months from March 1999 to September 1999; CARATs--the Counselling, Assessment, Referral, Advice and Throughcare programme for drug misusers is now available in every prison in England and Wales; and co-ordinated law enforcement activity leading to some &#163;1.2 billion of Class A drugs being prevented from reaching our streets--an increase of 33.5 per cent on the previous year; and an increase of 9.2 per cent. in the number of Class A trafficking groups disrupted--nearly double the target.
<P>

<a name="01107w12.html_para4">Good progress has been made, but there is still a lot to do. New money made available to the Anti-Drugs Strategy under the Spending Review for 2001 to 2004 will help us to do more to drive forward the Strategy's key targets for 2005 and 2008 and increase our proactive efforts to prevent and tackle drug misuse.

<a name="01107w12.html_para8">Since the Panel was set up in 1998, 450 members have asked to leave. The original members were recruited by MORI (contracted to run the Panel) using a pre-selected random sample in 714 sampling points at addresses across the United Kingdom. In order to ensure the correct number of young people joined the Panel, a booster survey was conducted among 16-24 year olds.
<P>

<a name="01107w12.html_para9">Since 1998, there have been two top-up recruitment exercises, both from a pre-selected ramdom sample of addressees, but stratified towards more deprived areas and those with a greater proportion of young people.
<P>

<a name="01107w12.html_para10">Although the proportion of original Panel members coming from ethnic minorities is representative of the UK population as a whole, it is too small to analyse their views in detail. We have, therefore, recruited 830 new members with ethnic minority backgrounds.
<P>

<a name="01107w12.html_para11">The Panel has a profile that is representative of the UK population in terms of age, gender, region and a wide range of other demographic indicators. Research results are benchmarked against other surveys that MORI carry out for other central Government Departments and local authorities and we have also commissioned a small study looking at representativeness of research carried out using the Panel; by comparing individual responses among those who took part in the most recent wave of research and in 1998 on service satisfaction questions.
<P>

<a name="01107w12.html_para12">A full evaluation of the effectiveness of the Panel in helping shape Government policy and how representative it now is will be carried out early in 2001. The results will be published.
<P>

<a name="01107w12.html_para13">Five major waves of quantitative research and several qualitative research projects have been carried out using the People's Panel. These have supported a number of policy initiatives. Summaries of the research results have been placed in the House Library and published on the internet. I shall send copies to the hon. Member.

 The Department's Office Instructions manual, a copy of which is available in the Library, contains an explicit requirement for all development assistance to comply with the Overseas Development and Co-operation Act 1980. If there was any question regarding the legality of an activity in the country concerned, this would be addressed as part of the appraisal procedure. All expenditure is subject to subsequent monitoring, accounting and audit processes to verify that funds are used for the purposes intended. External scrutiny of the Department's expenditure is carried out by the National Audit Office on behalf of the Comptroller and Auditor General.

<a name="01107w14.html_spnew1"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 Sector-wide approaches are considered after careful appraisal of a wide range of factors which include, in particular, the robustness and integrity of financial management systems. Where such systems have inadequate controls, separate procurement, disbursement and/or audit channels are used. Technical assistance associated with a sector-wide approach can include strengthening of the expenditure management, procurement, reporting, accounting and audit capacity of the sector concerned. Thus sector-wide approaches help deliver country wide improvements in health and educational provision and improved financial management.

<a name="01107w14.html_para3">It is important to note that "life awards" of DLA was never intended to guarantee benefit entitlement up to death. They were always subject to change where, for example, a person no longer continued to satisfy the rules of entitlement, or where an error had been made. The criteria for changing a DLA award were, and remain, the same as those that apply to changes of almost all Social Security benefits. The Government recognised that the "life award" terminology in DLA was in this respect unsatisfactory because it created uncertainty. In the Welfare Reform and Pensions Act 1999 the terminology was changed to bring it in to line with other benefits. Awards previously termed "for life" are now termed "indefinite". The Department routinely examines cases to make sure that people are still entitled.

<a name="01107w15.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Edward Davey: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will list the measures that have been taken to reduce out-patient and in-patient NHS waiting lists in the last year for hospitals serving <i>(a)</i> the Greater London Area and <i>(b)</i> the residents of the Borough of Kingston upon Thames.  [135778]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01107w15.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 Within the Greater London area, specific measures to reduce in-patient waiting lists have included the provision of additional theatre lists, weekend working, the recruitment of extra staff and collaborative arrangements with the private sector.
<P>

<a name="01107w15.html_para1">Measures to reduce out-patient waiting lists in London include the provision of more clinics, the implementation of good practice recommendations from the National Patients Access team such as establishing booking system for out-patients, close working with primary care to develop agreed referral guidelines to ensure that the right patients are referred to the right clinics. Other measures include expanding the range of professionals who can see and manage patients health needs through learning from the beacons initiative. We have also established a work programme with National Health Service trusts in London 



<P>
<P><I>7 Nov 2000 : Column: 164W</I><P>
to ensure best practice out-patient systems are put in place to reduce waiting times. All trusts have in place plans to improve waiting times for outpatients and a director responsible for implementing the plan.
<P>

<a name="01107w15.html_para2">These developments have resulted in a fall in the total number of London residents waiting for treatment by 29,000 from 167,000 to 138,000 (August 2000) since the General Election.
<P>

<a name="01107w15.html_para3">All these measures will have benefited residents of the Borough of Kingston upon Thames. In addition, local initiatives for in-patients have included Kingston Hospital running additional operating sessions including day case sessions at the weekend, the local health authority funding additional equipment and the appointment of a discharge co-ordinator. Finally Kingston and District NHS Trust has received capital funding to assist with the reduction in waiting lists. This has enabled the trust to buy additional equipment for use in out-patient clinics.

<P>

<P>
<a name="01107w15.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 We recognise that there has been an increase in the prescribing of Selective Serotonin Re-Uptake Inhibitor antidepressants. The Clinical Standards Advisory Group have indicated that depression still remains undiagnosed in too many cases and that treatment is often inadequate. A range of effective treatments should be available including appropriate drug therapy as well as psychological approaches. Treatment plans for particular individuals need to be developed in consultation with them and regularly reviewed.
<P>

<a name="01107w15.html_para4">A number of clinical guidelines and protocols for the management of depression have been developed. These include the consensus statement by the Royal Colleges of Psychiatrists and General Practitioners published in 1992.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what estimate he has made of the demand for liver transplantation arising from people who have contracted hepatitis C; and how this demand will be met.  [136162]

<P>
<P>
<a name="01107w15.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 Figures supplied by United Kingdom Transplant show that, for 1998 and 1999, 82 and 99 transplants respectively were performed on patients who had contracted liver failure as a result of hepatitis C infection. As of 3 November, 23 such patients are on the waiting list for liver transplant.
<P>

<a name="01107w15.html_para5">Liver transplantation is limited by the supply of organs. However, new and innovative techniques such as liver splitting are helping to increase the supply. Publicity campaigns are also an important factor in increasing the supply of organs for transplantation. The current campaign encourages people to join the National Health Service Organ Donor Register, to carry the donor card and most importantly to discuss their wish to be an organ donor after death with their family and friends.
<P>

<a name="01107w15.html_para6">In addition, there is growing experience and success with live related liver transplantation especially in children.

<a name="01107w16.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The information requested is not held centrally. The National Health Service Executive conducted a survey of violence in National Health Service trusts in England in 1998-99. The survey found that, on average, seven violent incidents were recorded each month per 1,000 staff. This is equivalent to approximately 65,000 violent incidents each year. The number of violent incidents varied by trust type. The average number of incidents in ambulance trusts was over twice the average for acute trusts: seven incidents every month per thousand staff working for ambulance services compared with three for the acute sector.
<P>

<a name="01107w16.html_para0">The survey did not reveal the causes of violent incidents. This information would be reflected in local prevention and reduction strategies, and held locally by individual National Health Service employers through local reporting procedures and identified through appropriate risk assessment measures. Details of the survey can be found in Health Service Circular 1999/229: 'Managing Violence, Accidents and Sickness Absence in the NHS', copies of which are available in the Library.
<P>

<a name="01107w16.html_para1">As part of the continuing NHS zero tolerance zone campaign, the NHS Executive developed further resource sheets to support staff working in those settings we know to be most at risk--namely in Mental Health, Community and Ambulance settings, and also in primary care. A "Resource Pack Update" was issued on the 3 October 2000 to assist managers and staff working in high risk settings and included guidance on:

 The National CJD Surveillance Unit investigate all cases of vCJD to identify common factors. All possible groupings of cases are being considered. Local health authorities are involved where localised investigations of groups of cases are appropriate. The Department is actively working with scientists from the CJD Surveillance Unit, health care specialists and others to draw up a protocol to investigate all suspected "clusters". One investigation has already been set up into the grouping of cases at Queniborough.

 <i>[holding answer 6 November 2000]:</i> Foods for children and babies are subject to the same legislation as applies to foodstuffs generally. In addition there are specific regulations controlling the composition, labelling and (in the case of infant formula only) advertising of infant formula and baby foods.

 <i>[holding answer 6 November 2000]:</i> The National Health Service Breast Screening Programme (NHSBSP) invites women aged 50-64 to be screened by mammography every three years, and women over 65 are eligible for screening every three years on request. A total of 88,119 women over 65 were screened in England in 1998-99, of which 954 were screened in Coventry. The Coventry screening programme covers Coventry, Warwickshire and Solihull.
<P>

<a name="01107w17.html_para2">The NHS Cancer Plan announced that the NHSBSP will extend routine invitations for screening to women aged 65-70 by 2004. Women aged over 70 will be offered free three yearly screening on request, as women over 65 are now. It is anticipated that the first breast screening programmes in England will start inviting women over 65 in 2001-02, with all programmes starting by 2004, benefiting 400,000 women each year.

<a name="01107w17.html_para3">Coventry Health Authority's Health Improvement Programme for 2000-03 identified tackling health inequalities as a key priority and has designated six areas of the city as health action areas.

 <i>[holding answer 6 November 2000]:</i> The Coventry Health Authority and the University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire NHS Trust approach to access to cardiac treatment and preventative services is in line with the National Service Framework (NSF) for Coronary Heart Disease (CHD). The local health community has identified key priority areas which will further promote fair and equitable access to treatment for heart disease. Actions are under way to implement the NSF for CHD at a local level in line with the key milestones set nationally.

<a name="01107w17.html_para13">During 2000-01, we provided funding of over &#163;1 million to the West Midlands to develop local services to prevent teenage pregnancy and support teenage parents. Specific initiatives include a Sexual Health and Drugs Outreach Work (SHADOW) project in Coventry that addresses sexual health, pregnancy and healthy lifestyles for young people. This will link to a one-stop shop, due to open shortly in Coventry city centre, to deliver a number of services such as Connexions, youth information and a general advice and counselling service for young people. A mobile sexual health and advice clinic has been set up in North Staffordshire, enabling young people to access services in youth and leisure facilities.

 <i>[holding answer 6 November 2000]:</i> This year, we have extended the recommended groups for influenza immunisation to include everyone aged 65 and over, irrespective of their underlying health, as well as younger people in established high risk groups. This increase has led to record numbers of vaccine being made available, nearly 11 million this year compared to 7.8 million last year, an increase of 40 per cent.
<P>

<a name="01107w18.html_para0">Unfortunately one of the manufacturers, Solvay, has encountered problems in growing a strain of the vaccine which has led to delays in some deliveries. Solvay have been in touch with the affected general practitioners to tell them details of any delays, but have confirmed that all ordered vaccine will be delivered by the end of November, in time to protect people this winter.
<P>

<a name="01107w18.html_para1">As part of the winter planning process, National Health Service employers are required to offer immunisation to all staff involved in the delivery of care and/or support to patients. Offers of immunisation by NHS employers are being closely monitored by the Department to ensure that all staff have been given the opportunity to be immunised.
<P>

<a name="01107w18.html_para2">Responsibility for occupational influenza immunisation rests with the employer and it should be provided through an occupational health service. It is up to individual NHS trusts to determine their own programme and fund the immunisation of their staff.

 My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary discussed his decision to respond positively to a North Korean proposal on establishing diplomatic relations with South Korean, US and Japanese counterparts and a number of EU colleagues. Ministers in the Netherlands, Germany, Belgium and Spain have since made similar announcements. The decision acknowledges progress in the dialogue between North and South Korea and between the US and North Korea and reaffirms British support for the engagement policy of South Korean President, Kim Dae-Jung, but it does not imply approval of the North Korean regime. We remain deeply concerned about human rights in North Korea, as well as Pyongyang's policies on weapons of mass destruction, missile proliferation and nuclear issues; and will use formal relations to continue pressing these issues.

Much depends on the ability of LDCs to respond to the new incentives but the build up of exports is likely to take time. Initial reform of the EU internal sugar and rice regimes is likely to take place over the next few years under pressure from international trade liberalisation agreements.

 Our policy is to press the Burmese regime at every opportunity to enter into substantive dialogue with democratic parties, including ethnic minorities, and to improve their appalling human rights record. In April this year we successfully persuaded EU partners to strengthen the EU Common Position on Burma by publishing the list of regime members subject to an EU travel ban, imposing a freeze on their funds held in the EU, and banning the supply of equipment that might be used for internal repression or terrorism. We believe continued pressure forces the regime to take note of the international community's concerns, as witnessed by their recent release of the British prisoner, James Mawdsley. We will continue with this policy: forthcoming opportunities include the UN General Assembly resolution, the ILO Governing Body, and the EU-ASEAN Ministerial meeting. We also support the work of Razali Ismail in his good offices roles as the UN Special Envoy for Burma.

 Pre-conflict population figures for Kosovo were far from exact. The 1991 census recorded some 45,000 Roma living in Kosovo, but their numbers may well have been considerably higher. The number of Gypsies (including Askali and Egyptians as well as Roma) is now estimated to be 30,000, although more may be present but unreported. The Pre-conflict Muslim population (Kosovo Albanians and Turks) was roughly estimated at 1.8 million. With the vast majority of the 860,000 refugees having returned to the province, their estimated numbers remain close to this figure. It is estimated that some 200,000 Kosovo Serbs were present pre-March 1999. In addition, Kosovo's Muslim Slave populations (Bosniacs and Gorani) stood at around 57,000 and 12,000 before the conflict and today number about 35,000 and 12,000.

 We welcome the major steps towards democracy taken by the Serb people first on 24 September by voting in massive numbers for change, and then on 5 October as their determination brought on the collapse of the Milosevic regime. We and our EU partners promised in September that we would respond rapidly with a rapid revision of our policy, if they took such a step. Now we are keeping our promise: lifting sanctions, supporting the re-integration of the FRY into international organisations, and providing European and bilateral assistance.

The most important task now is to end the violence and bring the parties back to the negotiating table. We have been working closely with all sides to get the Peace Process back on track and our engagement has been warmly welcomed. In the last month the Prime Minister has been in regular contact with regional leaders, and I have had a very constructive visit to Israel, the Palestinian Authority, Egypt, Jordan and Syria.

<a name="01107w22.html_para1">On 6 October in Warsaw the Prime Minister affirmed our strong commitment to a swift and successful enlargement of the EU. Enlargement will help make our continent more stable by integrating more countries into a Union that promotes the principles of democracy, good governance, the rule of law and respect for human rights. The Government are determined that there should be a breakthrough on enlargement under the Swedish Presidency. We are working with EU member states to commit themselves to a specific framework leading to an early end of the negotiations and accession.

 <i>[holding answer 31 October 2000]:</i> The information is not available in the form requested. The available information requested on pupil-teacher ratios and class sizes for the East Sussex region is shown in the following tables.
<P>

<a name="01107w22.html_para7">The latest infant class size data for September 2000 were published in a Statistical First Release "Infant Class sizes in England 2000" on 1 November, copies of which

<P><I>7 Nov 2000 : Column: 192W</I><P>
are available from the Library, or alternatively can be accessed from the Department's statistical website www.dfee.gov.uk/statistics. Figures from this release showed that since September 1998 6,065 five, six and seven-year-olds in East Sussex have benefited from the Government's infant class size initiative. As few as 2.3 per cent. of the relevant age group remained in infant classes of 31 or over. Some &#163;620 million is available to support the pledge, and allocations so far to East Sussex LEA amount to over &#163;4 million. This has helped to reduce the size of the average infant class in East Sussex LEA to 25.6 in September 2000 from 27.1 in September 1998.
<P>

<a name="01107w22.html_para8">The Government are delivering their pledge to limit infant classes for five, six and seven-year-olds to 30 or below early. When the Government came to power, there were nearly half a million children in large infant classes. By September 2000, this has been reduced to some 30,000 children.
<P>

<a name="01107w22.html_para9">January 2000 saw a fall in the size of the average junior class in England; and a continuing fall in the size of the average primary class, after rising for a decade. The size of the average secondary class in England, at 22, is still five below the average primary class. Secondary headteachers are receiving an average of &#163;50,000 this year (&#163;60,000 from April 2001) in direct grant to spend as they choose. If this were spent on recruiting teachers, the average secondary class size could be reduced by up to 0.8.

<a name="01107w23.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Wills </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 6 November 2000]:</i> DfEE's and others' projects have shown that schools already implement a wide range of Internet safety measures, which we have supplemented by creating the Superhighway Safety pack. It is a comprehensive guide to the whole range of safety measures which schools and parents can adopt. It covers acceptable use policies, home-school contracts, filtering systems, walled gardens, firewalls, monitoring, advice on setting up websites and information about pupils' physical well-being when using computers. As well as advice and guidance, the pack provides contact details for a wide range of appropriate sources of further information or resources.
<P>

<a name="01107w23.html_para1">The pack was created with valuable help from partners including Becta, NCH Action for Children, the Parents Information Network, the British Educational Suppliers Association and Disney. It was originally produced in 1999 and revised in September 2000, to include extra information such as the advice sheet "Parents making the Internet Safer". We also launched a new Safety website in September 2000 ("http://safety.ngfl.gov.uk") which carries all the information from the pack in an easy to use format.

 <i>[holding answer 6 November 2000]:</i> It is not possible to give an absolute cost of adjustments. We published research in March 1998 called "Integrating Disabled Employees", which reported that, where adjustments are needed, the majority cost less than &#163;50, with only very few estimated to have cost more than &#163;5,000. The findings were based on a small sample and are therefore not necessarily representative of all UK employers. Other research published in May 1999 entitled "Employment of Disabled People: Assessing the Extent of Participation", reported that only 11 per cent. of disabled people who are able to work (including those not currently in work) require some form of special equipment, aids or adaptations in order to work.
<P>

<a name="01107w23.html_para4">Access to Work pay grants towards additional costs for employing disabled people. Employers are expected to make a contribution when the person is already in work.

 Overall, the civil justice reforms are proving to be a success. A number of bodies have already provided their own independent opinion of the success of the reforms. The Association of Personal Injury Lawyers (APIL) and the Federation of Insurance Lawyers (FOIL) have provided helpful presentations to the Civil Justice Council.

<P>

<a name="01107w26.html_para0">The offender was convicted of unlawful sexual intercourse with a 14-year-old girl and was sentenced to 12 months' imprisonment. He was considered as a candidate for Home Detention Curfew in view of the exceptional circumstances that he was a registered blind person and it was his first offence. He had a suitable address and was judged at an enhanced risk assessment board to pose a low risk of re-offending. He was placed on the scheme on 11 July 2000 until his conditional release date of 8 September 2000. He successfully completed the curfew and is not known to have been arrested, charged or convicted of any further offence since.
<P>

<a name="01107w26.html_para1">Under existing arrangements, sex offenders subject to the 1997 Act may be released only in exceptional circumstances and then only with the personal authorisation of the Director General of the Prison Service. In this case, as in the other cases previously notified, I regret that this requirement was not followed by the establishment. Although I am satisfied in this particular case that the risk to the public was remote, I have asked the Director General for a report into the circumstances of the release.

This amendment will prevent the re-occurrence of any further errors of this kind as they will automatically be excluded on the local inmate database system (as in the case for other statutory exclusions, for example deportees).

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many charities were removed from the Charities' Register following an investigation under section 8 of the Charities Act 1993 in each year since the Act came into force.  [134439]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01107w26.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Boateng </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 31 October 2000]:</i> Removal from the Register is not one of the remedial or protective powers available to the Charity Commission under section 18 of the Act (which applies to section 8 investigations). The Commission's remedial powers include the suspension, removal and appointment of charity trustees, and the freezing of bank accounts. These measures are designed to protect the assets of a charity under investigation and ensure they are applied properly in the future.
<P>

<a name="01107w26.html_para5">In exceptional circumstances, where it is clear these statutory measures are insufficient to secure the charity's future the Commission can propose the transfer of assets to another charity and the winding up of the original charity. Historical statistics are not held centrally but in the six months April-September 2000, nine charities were removed in these circumstances and proposals to remove a further nine remain under consideration.

A copy of this publication is available in the Library.

The survey does not include data on the other requests.

 <i>[holding answer 6 November 2000]:</i> The information is not available in the form requested.

<a name="01107w27.html_para3">Any sexual or violent offence committed against a child might amount to abuse. It is not possible to identify child victims of abuse from the overall statistics.
<P>

<a name="01107w27.html_para4">Among the range of offences an adult might be charged with, in respect of a child, however, is the offence of indecent conduct towards a young child under section 1 of the Indecency with Children Act 1960. For 1999 the statistics for prosecutions and convictions were: 330 prosecutions and 217 convictions.
<P>

<a name="01107w27.html_para5">Similarly, there is no specific offence of stalking of children within internet chat rooms. It is not possible to say how many of the offences of "stalking" under the Protection from Harassment Act 1997 involve children using the internet.

<a name="01107w27.html_para6">However, information is given as follows, for offences under Section 2 and Section 4 of the Protection from Harassment Act 1997 in 1999.

 <i>[holding answer 30 October 2000]:</i> The Government believe that there is no single main source of illegal firearms in the United Kingdom. In particular, there is no evidence of organised and large-scale smuggling of firearms into this country. Interviews with criminals indicate that many firearms are obtained through informal contacts where their origins are not established.
<P>

<a name="01107w27.html_para9">The use of firearms in crime in this country is small in relation both to overall national crime figures and to other comparable countries. It may therefore be misleading to talk of any source of illegal firearms to be 'common' or to draw wider conclusions from particular incidents. Sources of illegally held firearms in recent years have included, for example: theft from legitimate sources; smuggling from abroad; conversion of deactivated or replica firearms to fire live ammunition; and 'trophies of war' brought back by returning service personnel. Individual firearms may remain in circulation for many years and their origins may be difficult to establish.

Bromley, three in Harrow and one in Hounslow. In all cases where front counter services have been withdrawn, a free 24-hour telephone service has been provided at the relevant police building with a direct link to the local police control room. This ensures that members of the public are still able to speak to a police officer or member of the civil staff at all times.
