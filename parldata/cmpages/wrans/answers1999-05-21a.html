 The details of bilateral expenditure in these sectors in 1997-98 and 1998-99 is available only for projects with a commitment of over &#163;100,000. (1998-99 figures are provisional.) Expenditure on such projects in areas (ii) (iii) and (iv) was as follows:

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food if he will make a statement on his Department's spending priorities for the remainder of the Comprehensive Spending Review period.  [85432]

<a name="90521w01.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Nick Brown: </B> 
 In my written statement to the House on 27 October 1998, <i>Official Report,</i> columns <i>156-58</i>, I set out the key financial implications of the CSR for MAFF. Since then there have been developments which have necessitated a reassessment of spending priorities in order to accommodate:
<P>

<a name="90521w01.htm_para2">

<BR>
(i) additional demands on the Department's budget which were not provided for in the CSR. These include the costs of the BSE inquiry and new policy initiatives like the proposed pet movement scheme; and
<BR>
(ii) the budgetary consequences of not being able to proceed with the sale of the new Convent Garden Market site. The CSR settlement assumed that we would sell this asset in 2000/01 and our capital allocation was adjusted accordingly. We will not be able to meet that timetable.
<BR>


<P>

<a name="90521w01.htm_para3">For the most part we have been able to accommodate the budgetary impact of these developments by making adjustments to the Department's own internal spending programmes. For example, we have been able to reprofile the expenditure on the new marine research vessel by delaying its construction by a few months. We have also found savings in the Department's capital building programme. And we are accelerating the disposal of unwanted assets in order to maximise receipts during the CSR period.
<P>

<a name="90521w01.htm_para4">However, these measures alone are not sufficient to contain the pressures on the Department's budget. In order to keep spending within the limits set by the CSR, I regret that I am having to make the following economies in addition to those set out in my statement of 27 October:
<P>

<a name="90521w01.htm_para5">

<BR>
(i) further cuts of &#163;2.0 million in 1999/2000, &#163;2.0 million in 2000/01 and &#163;3.0 million in 2001/02 in the Department's R&D budget. These cuts will put pressure on our research programmes and will require careful prioritisation. We shall be drawing up, and consulting widely on, a new strategy for R&D;
<BR>
(ii) a refocusing of the Department's land use planning work, which is carried out by the Farming and Rural Conservation Agency, to strengthen relationships with Government Offices, planning authorities and the Regional Development Agencies and integrate agricultural considerations (especially the implementation of the EU Rural Development Regulation) into wider Government policies affecting the rural economy and environment. This will produce annual net savings of about &#163;1.0 million in 2000/01 and 2001/02;
<BR>
(iii) a reduction of &#163;1.5 million in 2001/02 in the Department's grant-in-aid to the Environment Agency;
<BR>
(iv) closure of fisheries grant schemes. The schemes in question have been in place a long time: harbour grants since 1955 and marketing/ processing, port facilities and fishing vessel safety equipment grants since the late 1970s/early 1980s. They have served a valuable purpose and many have benefited from them over the years. However, in view of the pressures on the Department's budget the time has come to draw a line under these open-ended schemes. As of today, I am closing the harbour and fishing vessel safety equipment grants schemes to new applicants. There will be no further rounds of awards under the processing and marketing and port facilities grant schemes. In all cases, where commitments to funding have already been entered into they will be honoured.

 <i>[holding answer 5 May 1999]:</i> There are no plans for specific measures to support industries that remain on the US Administrations revised retaliation list over the banana dispute. The Government want an early resolution to the dispute and are encouraging the European Commission to come forward quickly with its analysis of options for revising the EU's banana regime. As well as a final settlement, we would also like an interim solution whereby the US retaliation was displaced by a form of compensation as preferred under the rules of the World Trade Organisation.
<P>

<a name="90521w01.htm_para6">This would lift the burden from those companies that are being hurt by a dispute that has nothing to do with them. It is also important to stress that there was never any intention of extending the cashmere scheme beyond the date on which the WTO authorised US retaliatory action. There would, therefore, have been no guarantee even for cashmere in respect of orders placed after 12 April.

<a name="90521w02.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Vaz: </B>

<P>

 As part of the general review of exemptions from financial services legislation, the Treasury has been looking at the exemptions from the Banking Act which:
<P>

<a name="90521w02.htm_para0">

<BR>
(i) allow industrial and provident societies (I&Ps) to take deposits from their members in the form of withdrawable share capital (WSC), in circumstances which would otherwise require authorisation by the Financial Services Authority; and
<BR>
(ii) allow retail co-operatives which are members of the Co-operative Deposit Protection Scheme (CDPS) to take deposits in the form of loans from the public.
<BR>


<P>

<a name="90521w02.htm_para1">The Treasury has decided to continue the exemption for WSC, subject to compliance with a code of practice which will require societies to make it clear to those subscribing for WSC that this is risk capital, where such issues rely on the exemption. The Treasury has today issued a consultation document on the proposal, and will make a further announcement after considering the responses.




<P>
<P><I>21 May 1999 : Column: 455</I><P>

<P>

<a name="90521w02.htm_para2">Following consultation with representatives of the Co-operative Union, the exemption which allows CDPS members to take deposits in the form of loans from the public will end when the current term of the CDPS comes to an end at the end of March 2000. Societies will repay such loans as they mature.

 The availability of osteopathy and chiropractic treatment within the National Health Service, as with any other form of treatment, reflects decisions taken by health authorities, trusts and primary care groups about the clinical and cost effectiveness of such services and the priority to be given to their provision in the light of local health needs. As primary care groups have only recently been established, we shall be studying the use that they make of all forms of complementary medicine.

 The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) provides financial assistance to students from the Commonwealth studying in the UK under two programmes; the Chevening Scholarship Scheme and the Commonwealth Scholarships and Fellowships Plan (CSFP).
<P>

<a name="90521w03.htm_para0">In 1996-97, 452 students from the Commonwealth received Chevening awards while 237 received new CSFP awards. In 1997-98 the figures were 214 and 79 respectively and in 1998-99 141 and 72.
<P>

<a name="90521w03.htm_para1">The figures for 1996-97 include awards funded by both the FCO and the Overseas Development Administration (ODA). The figures for 1997-98 and 1998-99 are for FCO funded awards only as in 1997 the ODA became a separate Government Department (the Department for International Development (DfID)). DfID continued to provide funding to both schemes for Commonwealth students in 1997-98 (240 Chevening and 239 CSFP awards) and 1998-99 (253 Chevening and 210 CSFP awards). Most Chevening awards are for one year only while many CSFP scholars are on PhD programmes, and study in the UK for up to three years.

<P>
<a name="90521w03.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Chris Smith: </B> 
 The provision for the Government Indemnity Scheme is made by the National Heritage Act 1980. The scheme facilitates public access to loans of works of art and other objects for public display made to museums, galleries and other such institutions by private owners and non-national institutions. It does this by indemnifying lenders against loss or damage to their loan. Loans covered by the scheme must be for public benefit. The scheme also covers loans of such objects for study purposes within borrowing institutions where this would contribute materially to the public's understanding or appreciation of the loan. Examples of this are enhancing interpretation or explanation to the public of objects or bringing into the public domain, the conclusions of any study.
<P>

<a name="90521w03.htm_para3">In the six month period ended 31 March 1999, the following undertakings to indemnify were given under section 16 by the relevant Departments for objects on loan to national and non-national institutions:

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence, pursuant to his letter to the hon.

 I am afraid that I cannot discuss intelligence received in confidence from another Government, as is recognised by exemption 1 of the Code of Practice for Access to Government Information. However, as we stressed at the time, we had the assurance of the United States Government that their decision to resort to military action was based on compelling evidence that the El Shifa factory was connected with chemical weapons development or manufacture.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what powers are available to Ministry of Defence police <i>(a)</i> to search civilian property, <i>(b)</i> to interrogate civilians and <i>(c)</i> to lay charges against individuals; from what legal authority officers of the MoD police derive their powers; what remedy is open to civilians who believe they have been subject to ill-treatment or abuse by MoD police officers; how many complaints have been made against MoD police in each of the past five years; and what were the results of such complaints.

<a name="90521w04.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 20 May 1999]:</i> Ministry of Defence Police officers derive their constabulary powers from the Ministry of Defence Police Act 1987. MOD Police officers have the same powers as their Home Department Police colleagues to search civilian property, interview civilians and lay charges against individuals, in respect of matters that come within their jurisdiction as defined in the 1987 Act. The MOD Police are subject to comprehensive disciplinary procedures, overseen by the Police Complaints Authority in the case of complaints made by members of the public.

<P>
<a name="90521w05.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 Over the next few months we will--in liaison with the Audit Commission and Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary--be analysing the audits and strategies produced by local crime and disorder reduction partnerships. We will issue reports on key issues, for example, the consultation process and target setting. The main aim will be to provide the partnerships with advice on good practice so as to help them become more effective.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90521w05.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The Crime and Disorder Act 1998 does not specify what categories of crime and disorder must be included in the audit and strategy which local partnerships must produce. However, existing Home Office guidance to partnerships makes clear that strategic priorities must be based on the local audit findings and consultation with the community. Therefore, where this process has identified road safety as a priority, we would expect it to be addressed in the strategy.

<P>
<a name="90521w05.htm_spnew8"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 All applications for consent to release a genetically modified plant must include a pre-planting environmental audit including details of the release site ecosystem including climate and fauna, details of any sexually compatible wild relatives or cultivated plant species present and the proximity of officially recognised biotopes or protected areas. All 373 existing field test sites for genetically modified crops have been subject to such an audit. There is no requirement for applicants to include a sub-surface impact analysis. The farm-scale evaluations will however include a sub-surface impact analysis as detailed in my earlier answer.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90521w05.htm_spnew9"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 We have no plans to regulate the wholesale newspaper delivery industry, but all users of commercial vehicles over 3.5 tonnes are required to have an operator's licence. This ensures the safe and proper use of goods vehicles and the protection of the environment around operating centres.
<P>

<a name="90521w05.htm_para0">The Government are keen that local authorities should approach their planning and transportation responsibilities in a well-informed and balanced manner, protecting the interests of local residents while promoting efficient freight distribution in order to support the vitality of the local economy.
<P>

<a name="90521w05.htm_para1">Our strategy for Sustainable Distribution, published on 2 March, proposes to develop the concept of "freight quality partnerships", particularly for urban areas. This will involve local authorities, the distribution industry and the local community working together in the development of a partnership agreement. The partnerships will provide a mechanism through which can be developed an understanding of local distribution issues and the associated concerns. Through the agreement, practical, constructive best practice solutions can be introduced which reconcile the need for the efficient and timely delivery and loading of goods and services with local environmental and social concerns regarding noise, disturbance, vehicle routing and pollution.

 None. The Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions decides himself appeals against local councils' refusal of consent to fell protected trees.
