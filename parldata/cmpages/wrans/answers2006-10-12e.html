This will be achievable by those undergoing Home Inspector training who have completed the appropriate parts of their training, as well as by other individuals who complete appropriate training through other routes.</p>

 Some inspectors have withdrawn from courses since the statement on 18 July, although others have joined courses since then. We also expect that some of those currently in training will wish to transfer to the new Domestic Energy Assessor course once it becomes available in February of next year. The most recent reasonably complete figures are for July when returns from the nine out of 11 assessment centres indicated that the number of Home Inspector candidates who entered training during July was 480. During the same month 318 trainee Home Inspectors formally withdrew from their courses.</p>

<i> [holding answer 9 October 2006]:</i> The Government have no plans to review the current limits on the amount of discount available to social tenants under the Right to Buy scheme. However, it has invited local authorities to consider offering those tenants who are unable to afford outright ownership the opportunity to purchase a share in their homes, under the new Social HomeBuy scheme which it introduced in April 2006. Local authorities may retain all the receipts from sales under Social HomeBuy, to reinvest in affordable housing.</p>

 There is no provision for an inquest which has been closed to be reopened. Under Section 13 of the Coroners Act 1988, however, any inquest whether by reason of fraud, rejection of evidence, irregularity of proceedings, insufficiency of inquiry, the discovery of new facts or evidence or otherwise may be quashed and a fresh inquest ordered by the High Court. In such cases which need permission from the Attorney General, the court will decide whether it is necessary or desirable in the interests of justice that another inquest be held.

As a result the database can only match between name, address and date of birth. If a voter has moved address since records began and has been summoned more than once it will not show as a match. Also it will not give details of jurors summoned to attend for service in a coroners court as coroners officers summon jurors locally and not through a central system.</p>

 The 2003 Laming inquiry into the death of Victoria Climbie identified the urgent need for better sharing of information between children&#146;s services, and every inquiry into a child&#146;s death before that has also done so. Since Lord Laming reported, substantial consultation with local service managers, practitioners and the public, supported by evidence from local authority Trailblazer projects, has identified the benefits that arise from introducing an information-sharing index in terms of safeguarding children more effectively and efficiently. Three independent research reports during 2004 supported the business case and have informed index design.</p>

The data were collected by matching child records from SSDA903 to death certificates. A special matching exercise was carried out for the 2002-03 data, so there was a low rate of mismatch. The normal data collection was used in 2003-04 and 2004-05, and it was not possible to uniquely identify one third of the records. Therefore results need to be treated with caution.<br>

 For those commencing courses after the introduction of variable fees in the 2006-07 academic year we expect average student debt of around &#163;15,000. Debts arising from student loans are very different from those from commercial loan products. Repayments are linked to income and only calculated on earnings over &#163;15,000. This means a borrower earning below this threshold does not have to make repayments. For example, someone earning the average graduate starting salary of &#163;18,000 will repay &#163;5.19 per week regardless of the amount borrowed. The Government subsidises the rate of interest on these loans to ensure that borrowers only repay in real terms what they borrowed, however long it takes them.</p>

 There are two types of student loans, the first of which, the mortgage-style loans scheme, ceased for new loans in 1998. A range of measures are  in place for accounts that fall into arrears. Attempts are made to contact the borrower by letter and telephone to establish borrowers&#146; circumstances, assign or re-assign them to the correct status and treatment, and to re-institute repayments where due. If appropriate, SLC will assign tracing and collection agents and, where necessary, take legal action.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_262"><a name="61012w0007.htm_para0"><a name="06101336010185">Income contingent loans, made since 1998, are collected through the tax system. The SLC works closely with HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) to identify borrowers to allow employers to make deductions, and HMRC to collect repayments through the self assessment process, when a borrower is earning over &#163;15,000. As part of this, the SLC regularly contacts those borrowers who are not currently repaying to confirm their details and check their employment status.</p>

 The Organisational Committee of the Peacebuilding Commission (PBC), of which the UK is a member, held its inaugural meeting on 23 June 2006. Since then it has met on several occasions to discuss administrative and procedural issues related to the establishment of the PBC. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Department for International Development anticipate that initially substantive discussions on conflict prevention, conflict resolution and rebuilding on individual post conflict situations will take place in the &#145;country-specific&#146; meetings. The first country-specific meetings will consider Sierra Leone and Burundi and are taking place in New York on 12 and 13 October. At a later stage when the PBC is more established there will be opportunities for it to look at these issues on a thematic basis. In the meantime, we hope the UN Peacebuilding Support Office will be collating lessons learned and best practice on some of these issues over the coming year.</p>

procedural issues. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Department of International Development have been working hard in New York, Burundi, Sierra Leone and within the EU to ensure the PBC is flexible, focused on priority peacebuilding issues and avoids the bureaucracy and politicisation that limits the effectiveness of some UN bodies. The provisional rules of procedure agreed by the PBC&#146;s organisational committee in June give the commission sufficient flexibility to achieve the goals set out for it in the world summit. However, a real assessment of its workings can only be made after substantive discussions on the first country cases, Burundi and Sierra Leone, have taken place on 12 and 13 October.</p>

 The Department has been developing a toolkit to help the national health service to implement the key points of the chief medical officer&#146;s tuberculosis action plan through effective commissioning and delivery of services. The toolkit will recommend that TB services should always follow the NICE clinical guidelines when treating patients including those with HIV or those who are otherwise immunocompromised. The NICE guidelines contain clear recommendations on the appropriate use of Mantoux tests and interferon gamma tests. Economic modelling was undertaken with various strategies from no action to a two-step strategy with either tuberculin skin tests (TST, which cover both Heaf and Mantoux tests) followed by interferon gamma testing, or serial interferon gamma tests. Of these options, the model provided most support, on grounds of cost-effectiveness, for a two-step approach with an initial TST, followed by an interferon gamma test to confirm positivity. The guideline development group members also supported this because of clinical utility and feasibility.</p>

 Supervision orders that are issued in other countries or jurisdictions, including the Isle of Man, do not have effect in the United Kingdom. However, the provisions of part 2 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003 provide that, when someone is convicted of a sexual offence outside the United Kingdom, the police can apply to a magistrates court for a &#145;notification order&#146;. A notification order has the effect of requiring the offender to register their details to the police as if they had been convicted of an offence in this country. To be made subject to a notification order, the offender must satisfy three conditions:</p>
<a name="61012w0013.htm_brev13"><a name="06101336011860"><ul><p class="tabletext">(i) they have been cautioned for or convicted of an offence comparable to one in schedule 3 to the Act, i.e. an offence which requires registration in the United Kingdom;</p>
</ul><a name="61012w0013.htm_brev14"><a name="06101336011861"><ul><p class="tabletext">(ii) the conviction or caution was received on or after 1 September 1997 (the date on which the sex offenders register came into force). Or the offender received his conviction or caution before that date but on one September 1997 was still serving his sentence for the offence; and</p>
</ul><a name="61012w0013.htm_brev15"><a name="06101336011862"><ul><p class="tabletext">(iii) the notification period has not expired.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_319"><a name="61012w0013.htm_para4"><a name="06101336010844">In 2004-05, the police in England and Wales obtained 22 notification orders from magistrates.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_320"><a name="61012w0013.htm_para5"><a name="06101336010845">The current guidance issued to the police is that, where they know the conditions are met, they should apply for a notification order; they do not need to demonstrate that the order is necessary to protect the public from the risk of serious sexual harm. Furthermore, if the conditions are met, then the legislation states that the magistrate must issue the order. Becoming a registered sex offender will also ensure that the authorities are required to establish arrangements for assessing and managing the risk posed by that offender.</p>

 At current cycle helmet wearing rates, making them compulsory would cause enforcement difficulties and without greater public acceptance could have an adverse effect on the levels of cycling. The Department believes that it is sensible for cyclists, and especially children, to protect themselves by wearing a cycle helmet, and we encourage them to do so. A review commissioned by the Department concluded that overall there is evidence that bicycle helmets can be effective at reducing the incidence and severity of head, brain and upper facial injuries and that they can be effective in reducing injury for users of all ages, though particularly for children. The report also concludes that there is evidence that compulsory helmet wearing may discourage some people from cycling, leading to decreased bicycle use.</p>

This is consistent with the Government&#146;s approach to company law reform of simplifying company law, reducing the regulatory burden on business and promoting effective shareholder engagement. The enhanced business review will meet key narrative reporting requirements and preserve the appropriate financial and other key reporting requirements of the OFR, specifically including information relating to employee and environmental issues, where these are relevant to an understanding of the business, while imposing considerably less cost than the operating and financial review. The new reporting regime demonstrates the Government&#146;s ongoing commitment to strategic forward-looking narrative reporting.</p>

 There are currently a number of special rules within the benefit system to take account of the particular circumstances of people with terminal illnesses. For example, there are special rules to help terminally ill people who are not expected to live longer than six months to receive immediate payment of higher-rate attendance allowance or the highest rate care component of disability living allowance without the need to meet the normal entitlement conditions. These claims are currently processed in an average of five to six days</p>
