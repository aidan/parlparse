<a name="30328w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Ancram: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what discussions he has had with the Spanish Government since 1 January on <i>(a)</i> the use of military facilities in Gibraltar and <i>(b)</i> Gibraltar's status in NATO; and if he will make a statement.  [104981]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30328w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Ingram </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 27 March 2003]:</i> My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence has not held formal discussions with his Spanish counterpart since December 2001. As close allies, we maintain contact on a wide range of defence/security matters. There has been no change to Gibraltar's status as a United Kingdom base. However, we have recently offered military facilities in Gibraltar to NATO for use in Active Endeavour, a NATO-led operation providing protection for allied non-combatant shipping in the Mediterranean.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30328w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Officials from the Ministry of Defence and the Department for International Development are currently discussing these matters. The precise scale of the task and the extent of the Armed Forces' responsibilities following operations in Iraq is being refined as this campaign develops.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30328w01.html_wqn4"><B> Paul Flynn: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what estimate he has made of the difference in the numbers of <i>(a)</i> fatal and <i>(b)</i> serious injury road accidents that would have occurred, had the UK adopted Daylight Saving of GMT/BST timetable in 1997.  [104766]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30328w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The potential road safety implications of a change to Single Double Summertime have been previously investigated. A Government commissioned report by the Transport Research Laboratory (TRL), published in October 1998, concluded that if clocks were put forward a further hour over both the periods i.e. October to March and March to October, thereby making the evenings lighter, there could be a saving of over 100 deaths per year. The potential savings have not been mentioned again since then. But we are therefore aware of the potential road safety benefits. However, a wide variety of issues would have to be considered very carefully if a move to Single Double Summertime was to be considered, of which casualty savings is just one.
<P>

<a name="30328w01.html_para0">Given the potential wide-ranging implications for Britain, the Department for Trade and Industry (DTI) leads on Single Double Summertime. That Department reviews the issues from time to time. DTI have no plans for a review at present, but when the time comes, DfT will advise DTI of its findings.

<a name="30328w01.html_sbhd4"><H3 align=center>Air Travel</H3>


<P>
<P>
<a name="30328w01.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. David Marshall: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what regulations there are as to the number of pieces, and sizes, of items of hand luggage which each passenger is entitled to take into the cabin of an aircraft.  [105006]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30328w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Airline operators in the UK are required to follow the safety requirements set by the Civil Aviation Authority to ensure the safe storage of hand luggage during a flight. These require that all hand baggage be adequately and securely stowed, that it does not impede access to emergency equipment and that the maximum placarded weight in overhead bins is not exceeded.
<P>

<a name="30328w01.html_para1">It is the operator's responsibility to establish baggage handling procedures that comply with these requirements, including as appropriate, any restrictions on cabin luggage.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30328w01.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Don Foster: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what statistics are collected on incidences of ill-health in the British population as a result of infection caused by travelling by plane.  [104488]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30328w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 None. The House of Lords Select Committee on Science and Technology's report on Air Travel and Health in November 2000 concluded that the risk of transmission of infection due specifically to being in the aircraft cabin environment was no greater than elsewhere, at least in relation to major illnesses, provided circulation and filtration systems are working properly. Systematic records of the numbers of passengers where health has been allegedly affected by air travel are, therefore, not kept.

<P>
<a name="30328w01.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Bercow: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what the cost was of <i>(a)</i> in-house canteen and <i>(b)</i> other catering services provided by the department in 2002.  [104262]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30328w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 My department came into being in May 2002. The department's catering services are contracted out, with the contractor recovering costs through the sale of services. Under the terms of the contract the department met the cost in 2002 of replacement equipment valued at &#163;10,000.

<a name="30328w01.html_sbhd6"><H3 align=center>ERTMS</H3>


<P>
<P>
<a name="30328w01.html_wqn8"><B> John McDonnell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport whether the Pendolino trains operated by Virgin plc will be fitted with ERTMS.  [104990]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30328w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Pendolinos will not be delivered with ERTMS already fitted but they have been designed to accommodate it.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30328w01.html_wqn9"><B> John McDonnell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport if he will make a statement on the progress of the introduction of ERTMS following the European Directive requirement that ERTMS be fitted on railway lines being upgraded; and if he will list those lines on which the system <i>(a)</i> has been and <i>(b)</i> has not been installed during upgrade.  [104991]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30328w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 In his written statement on 5 February 2003 the Secretary of State informed Parliament that he had accepted the Health and Safety Commission's advice that Level 2 of the European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS) is the best system for this country. This system, in a form suitable for the UK, is still at an early stage of development and not yet fitted to any UK line. Progress on UK development will continue through a single national programme that will be integrated and in step with European development of ERTMS and the associated specifications and operating rules.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30328w01.html_wqn10"><B> John McDonnell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport (1) when the installation of ERTMS will commence on high speed lines;  [104992]
<P>
<UL>(2) what arrangements have been put in place to ensure that ERTMS is fitted where there is future upgrading of railway lines.  [104996]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30328w01.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 A single national programme for the European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS) will be drawn together by the Strategic Rail Authority to allow focused UK development of ERTMS. Implementation will be in accordance with a proper and affordable migration plan and in line with future upgrading of railway lines wherever possible.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30328w01.html_wqn11"><B> John McDonnell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport if he will publish the national programme for the development of ERTMS; and what its budget is.  [104994]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30328w01.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The Strategic Rail Authority (SRA) is developing the programme. The SRA has &#163;5.875 million set aside for its development in the 2003&#150;04 budget.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30328w01.html_wqn12"><B> John McDonnell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport on what grounds he has rejected the setting of a statutory timetable for the installation of ERTMS as recommended by the Cullen report.  [104997]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30328w01.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 In his written statement on 5 February 2003 the Secretary of State informed Parliament that he accepted the Health and Safety Commission's (HSC) advice that the timetable for installing the European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS), contained in Professor Uff and Lord Cullen's joint inquiry into train protection systems, was not viable. A copy of the HSC advice is in the Library.

<a name="30328w01.html_sbhd7"><H3 align=center>European Transport White Paper</H3>


<P>
<P>
<a name="30328w01.html_wqn13"><B> Mr. Sayeed: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what impact he estimates the European Commission's White Paper: European Transport Policy for 2010: Time to Decide will have upon the <i>(a)</i> flexibility and <i>(b)</i> profitability of taxi cab drivers in the UK; and if he will make a statement.  [104541]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30328w01.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The Government do not envisage that the proposals outlined in the European Commission's White Paper will have any direct impact on taxi cab drivers in the UK.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30328w01.html_wqn14"><B> Mr. Sayeed: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport how his Department will incorporate the proposals made in the Commission's White Paper: European Transport Policy for 2010: Time to Decide into domestic legislation to ensure that road safety is improved.  [104542]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30328w01.html_spnew14"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The Commission has indicated that the new road safety action programme promised in the White Paper will be published soon. The programme is expected to identify the measures the Commission believes are needed to achieve its overall objective of 50 per cent. fewer deaths on European roads between 2000 and 2010. The White Paper indicated that the Commission would monitor progress towards the 2010 year target and, if by 2005 progress was unsatisfactory, would come forward with new proposals. As and when such proposals are tabled, the Government will consider them carefully to determine that legislation at the European level is both appropriate and proportionate.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30328w01.html_wqn15"><B> Mr. Sayeed: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport if he will ensure that the financial cost of the proposals in the European Transport Policy for 2010 White Paper will not be carried by drivers in the UK.  [104543]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30328w01.html_spnew15"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The White Paper provides insufficient detail of the Commission's future plans to determine precisely what impact they might have in the UK. We shall need to look carefully at any formal legislative proposals which emerge before determining our final position. But, at this stage, we do not envisage any significant costs will fall directly on UK drivers.

<P>
<a name="30328w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend and I are very much aware from the representations that have been made to us of the problems which customers and businesses are suffering as a consequence of the central line closure. We share their concerns about the considerable time it has taken to restore services and we recognise the great patience that those affected have already shown. Every effort must be made to minimise the continuing impact on Londoners. It is essential that, following the successful resumption of train services on the eastern part of the line on 14 March and, I am pleased to report, between Haling Broadway and Marble Arch on 24 March, the service is restored to other destinations. We will be keeping up the pressure for London Underground to deliver these improvements to the service at the earliest possible date.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what his estimate is of the reduction of incidents of signals passed at red as a result of the introduction of TPWS.  [104993]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30328w03.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The Health and Safety Executive's (HSE) monthly reports of signals passed at danger (SPADs) record the number of occasions each month that the Train Protection and Warning System (TPWS) is successfully activated. This is broken down between 'interventions' where TPWS initiates braking before any action is taken by the driver and 'activations' where the driver has already started breaking for the signal but the train is travelling too fast at the over-speed sensor or has passed the stop located at the signal at red. There will also be cases where TPWS intervenes to stop the train passing a signal at red but these will not be recorded as part of the monthly SPAD reports. Copies of the HSE reports are in the Library.
<P>

<a name="30328w03.html_para1">In the last 18 months there has been a 70 per cent. decrease in the most serious SPADs, although not all of this improvement is attributable to TPWS.

<a name="30328w03.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 None, as it is not possible for the driver to switch off the Train Protection and Warning System (TPWS).

 The Department organises a large number of events for different target audiences and purposes each year, ranging from small scale workshops to introduce practitioners to new procedures or initiatives, to larger scale events to promote policy initiatives or present the bigger picture of the Department's activities to external partners and opinion formers.
<P>

<a name="30328w05.html_para0">Examples of these during the past year range from a series of small local events to disseminate good practice in meeting the needs of autistic children, to a consultation exercise on 14&#150;19 education that involved 57 workshops for every secondary headteacher in England.

 The National Curriculum requirement is that all maintained secondary schools should offer one of the working languages of the European Union&#151;French, German, Italian, Spanish, Dutch, Danish, Finnish, Swedish, Modern Greek, Portuguese.

<P>
<a name="30328w06.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 There are no specific statutory mechanisms for resolving disputes between schools and local education authorities about the funding of PFI projects. There are general provisions in the Education Acts under which complaints against local education authorities, or disputes between local education authorities and school governing bodies, may be referred to the Secretary of State. It is of course open to LEAs and governing bodies to establish agreed local mechanisms for resolving disputes, and there is much to be said for this way of proceeding.

 We do not have data on the position of teachers on their pay scales by each LEA.

We are also centrally meeting the costs of the recommendations for threshold and supporting the costs for post threshold teachers in inner London at a further cost of &#163;30 million.

 Our strategy for combating benefit fraud focuses on making correct benefit payments in the first place; ensuring payments are adjusted as circumstances change; detecting when payments go wrong and taking prompt action to correct them with appropriate penalties to prevent a recurrence.
<P>

<a name="30328w06.html_para7">Jobcentre Plus is providing a more comprehensive and integrated service for all benefit claimants. One-to-one interviews create a personal environment where the full and accurate details of a claim can be established and customers can be reminded of their responsibility to notify us of changes to their circumstances.

 The Health and Safety Commission (HSC) and the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) are responsible for ensuring that risks to people's health and safety from work activities are properly controlled. However, the duty to ensure a healthy working environment for employees lies with employers, as set out in the Health and Safety at Work, etc. Act 1974. 
<P>

<a name="30328w07.html_para5">HSC/E has developed a cross-governmental long-term occupational health strategy, Securing Health Together. The strategy will raise workplace standards in occupational health, both preventing risk and promoting retention and rehabilitation. The strategy includes targets to cut the number of days lost due to work related-ill health and to improve the opportunities for rehabilitation. A key aspect of Securing Health Together is its focus on partnership working between HSE, other Government Departments, the devolved Administrations, local groups, trade unions, industry groups and professional bodies. More detailed information can be found in HSC's Strategic Plan 2001&#150;04 and HSC's Business Plan 2002&#150;03.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions how many people had their housing benefit restricted as a result of <i>(a)</i> single room rent and <i>(b)</i> local reference rent in each London borough in each year since 1998.  [105093]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30328w07.html_spnew9"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 Housing Benefit Management Information System data provided by local authorities show the numbers of tenants in the deregulated private rented sector whose claims to housing benefit are assessed under the local reference rent and single room rent schemes. These data do not distinguish between cases where rent is restricted following a rent officer determination and those where it is not (for example because the actual rent is sufficiently low, or the person claiming has transitional protection).
<P>

<a name="30328w07.html_para6">However, using information from rent officer statistics, it is possible to estimate the proportion of deregulated private rented sector cases referred by local authorities where housing benefit would be restricted if the overall claim was successful. The latest available estimates for the years 1997&#150;98 to 2000&#150;01 have been placed in the Library.

 The Department has commissioned research in the current wave of the Local Authority Omnibus Survey on the impact of the July 2001 changes to the single room rent restriction to Housing Benefit. The results of the research are expected to be available in the Autumn. The Local Authority Omnibus Survey covers all local authorities that administer Housing Benefit in England, Scotland and Wales.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions pursuant to his answer of 10 March 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 94W, on the state pension, what assumptions on take up of the pension credit he made in coming to his answer; what other assumptions not listed in the footnotes were made for the purpose of arriving at his answer; and if he will make a statement.

 In arriving at the answer previously given, the minimum income guarantee was assumed to remain in place at recent take-up rates; and the saving from not introducing pension credit was assumed to be worth &#163;2 billion in its first full year, based on a planning assumption of around 70 per cent. take-up by case load.

<P>
<a name="30328w08.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. McCartney: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State wrote to all MPs on 17 March outlining how we are planning to ensure Pension Credit take-on is completed successfully. To support the take-on of Pension Credit a marketing campaign has been developed that seeks to address the specific needs of pensioners and those who support them such as family and friends.
<P>

<a name="30328w08.html_para0">The core of the campaign involves contacting all pensioner households by direct mail and inviting them to make their applications by telephone. In this way we can support and complete the application form for them. The Pension Service will start writing to pensioner households to invite applications in April 2003 and plans to complete this activity in June 2004. This systematic approach will be supported by regional and national advertising around the launch of Pension Credit in October when it becomes payable.
<P>

<a name="30328w08.html_para1">By working with local partners the Pension Service will be able to help vulnerable pensioners or those who need to overcome barriers that might prevent them from applying.
<P>

<a name="30328w08.html_para2">To ensure pensioners do not lose out, a 12 month backdating provision will exist until October 2004. This will allow applications to be backdated to October 2003 where entitlement exists.

The trusts are St. Mary's NHS Trust Paddington, Barking, Havering and Redbridge NHS Trust, West Yorkshire Ambulance Service NHS Trust, John Radcliffe NHS Trust, East and North Herts NHS Trust and North Bristol NHS Trust. NHS trusts that use the services of NHS Professionals are recharged for these services and will also include these payments in their own accounts and financial returns. This results in the expenditure being double counted in the annual financial returns of NHS trusts and accounts for higher than average returns for trusts hosting NHS Professionals.

 Representatives from the four North Staffordshire primary care trusts met together with Stoke-on-Trent City Council and Staffordshire County Council over the last month to discuss arrangements for increasing the number of available beds in North Staffordshire. A series of measures has been agreed including extra funding from uncommitted joint health and social care funds. Five beds have also been made available at Weston Coyney Assessment Centre (a residential home covered by South Stoke PCT) and qualified professional support will be provided by the local PCTs through the intermediate care team.

Over the two years 2002&#150;03 and 2003&#150;04, &#163;66 million has been made available to fund intermediate care capital development schemes. This funding will deliver a total of approximately 1,800 additional intermediate care beds. Around 150 of these beds became operational by December 2002 and are therefore included in the December 2002 figures. Recent trends in the underlying growth in the number of intermediate care beds indicate that the NHS Plan target will be met.

This practice is often aligned with disparities between the life chances of families living in poverty, and those living in more affluent circumstances. The Sure Start initiative was established in April 1999 to tackle these inequalities from the earliest stages. As a part of this programme midwives are actively involved in working to help pregnant women and their partners to give up smoking. The aim is to achieve, by 2004 and in the 500 Sure Start areas, a 10 per cent. reduction in mothers who smoke during pregnancy.

<a name="30328w10.html_para12">Standards have also been under review since 1992, through the agency of the Confidential Enquiry into Stillbirths and Deaths in Infancy (CESDI) which is funded by the Department of Health. CESDI collects and analyses data on deaths in late foetal life and through infancy in order to explore any areas of sub-optimal care, and to use the findings to reduce the risk of deaths. Further consideration is being given to the collection of data on morbidity. CESDI reports are available in the Library and are also accessible on the CESDI website www.cesdi.org.uk/. Moreover continuing work on developing a Children's National Service Framework including maternity services will set national standards of care for ante-natal, intra-partum and post-natal services.

<a name="30328w11.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Bob Ainsworth: </B> 
 No estimates are available of the number of injuries caused in or close to nightclubs by glass bottles used in violence. However, the latest results from the British Crime Survey (BCS) estimate that a glass or bottle was used as a weapon in six per cent of all violent crime incidents. Research based on the 2000 BCS found that one in seven incidents of stranger violence and one in 10 incidents of acquaintance violence in pubs and clubs involved either a bottle or a glass.
<P>

<a name="30328w11.html_para3">We have no plans at present to introduce legislation to require the replacement of glass bottles with plastic. But we remain concerned about the high level of injuries that occur when glasses and bottles are used as weapons in drink-related situations in and outside licensed premises and other drinking establishments, and we intend to see that this problem is effectively tackled.
<P>

<a name="30328w11.html_para4">The Licensing Bill Guidance that has been published in draft by the Department of Culture, Media and Sport will make it clear that it will be open to the licensing authority (i) to impose conditions to address violence of this form if the police foresee problems, and (ii) where this form of violence has taken place on licensed premises, to impose a specific condition following a review of the premises licence. There will be a range of conditions that a licensing authority could impose on a premises, including one that they make use only of plastic vessels. In the most serious cases the licence itself can be revoked.

<a name="30328w11.html_para5">The Home Office published three research reports on alcohol-related crime on 25 March 2003. An evaluation of the "Tackling Alcohol-Related Street Crime (TASC) Project" in Cardiff and Cardiff Bay found that alcohol-related assaults were cut by 4 per cent. and targeted policing cut incidents by 41 and 36 per cent. in and around two specific clubs. This proves that effective steps can be taken to cut the amount of drunken violence.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what estimate he has made of the number of accidents caused each year by driving under the influence of drugs.  [104590]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30328w11.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Bob Ainsworth: </B> 
 Studies have shown an increase over recent years in the number of people killed in road accidents who have traces of an illegal drug in their body. Cannabis is by far the most commonly found. Traces of cannabis can, however, remain in the body for up to four weeks, long after it has ceased to have any effect. The extent, nature and duration of impairment in any particular case are not wholly certain. Driving while unfit through drugs, whether legal or not, is an offence under the Road Traffic Act 1988. The police receive training in Drug Recognition Techniques (DRT) and Field Impairment Testing (FIT) that can be carried out at the roadside to enforce this legislation. DRT allow officers more easily to assess impairment by the physical signs. FIT are simple divided attention tests which the police can ask a driver to take to assess his concentration and ability to perform easy tasks which an unimpaired

The prison service routinely collects statistics from establishments about self-inflicted deaths and self harm. After research had demonstrated a problem with under-reporting of self-harm, a new, simpler and standardised method for recording and reporting such incidents was introduced from 1 December 2002, which, when piloted, had been shown to produce more reliable data. The number of incidents of self-harm reported during the first three months the new form was in operation was 3143.

 <i>[holding answer 25 March 2003]:</i> Data relating to the national origin of the actual products consumed is not available. However, it is possible to calculate the UK production as percentage of the total new supply for use in the UK (home production plus imports less exports). This will, naturally, result in figures being greater than 100 per cent. for those products where UK production exceeds home consumption.

The UK argued for bringing the EU closer to world market conditions; supported the lines of the Commission proposals for reducing support; but argued against the proposed extension of dairy quotas to 2015. On rural development, the UK argued for a redistribution of modulated funds that would be fair and forward looking; we reiterated the case for flat rate modulation of direct payments and urged the Commission to look for ways of increasing the funds available for rural development programmes.

 <i>[holding answer 27 March 2003]:</i> It is unlikely that farmers would be able to tell whether badgers found on their land, either alive or dead, were suffering from, or had died of, bovine tuberculosis. At present there is no reliable live test to check for the disease in badgers. The presence of the bovine TB causative organism (<i>M. bovis</i>) is established by post-mortem examination and the bacteriological culture of samples.
<P>

<a name="30328w14.html_para2">Government are carrying out a badger culling trial in areas of the south and west of England to establish the role of badgers in transmission of bovine TB to cattle and to find out whether badger culling is an effective or sustainable control mechanism. There is insufficient evidence to sanction badger culling outside of the trial areas and this has been made clear to farmers. Defra has encouraged livestock producers to apply basic biosecurity measures to minimise contact between cattle and wildlife, for instance by raising feed and water troughs off the ground and securing farm buildings, particularly feed stores and cattle housing, against entry by wildlife.

We believe that the CHP support measures detailed in the draft CHP Strategy taken together with the measures recently announced in the Energy White Paper have the potential to significantly help the CHP industry and set us on course to meet the 2010 target.

<i>[holding answer 27 March 2003]:</i> The cost to Defra of sponsoring the Covent Garden Market Authority in 2001-02 was &#163;65,000. The Authority's balance sheet at 31 March 2002 shows assets totalling &#163;13,522,529.

<a name="30328w15.html_para0">The Covent Garden Market Authority is a public corporation established by Act of Parliament in 1961 to acquire the horticultural wholesale market then located at Covent Garden and to improve the facilities there. In 1966 a further Act made provision for the transfer of the market to its present site. Since 1990, it has been Government policy to disengage from the market. Its future is now being considered in the light of the report of the Review of London Markets commissioned by the Department and the Corporation of London last year.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30328w15.html_spnew15"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Under EU and national legislation it is mandatory to impose a local movement ban when FMD is confirmed. A national movement ban is discretionary. The current FMD Contingency Plan states that a GB wide national movement ban will be put in place immediately the first case of FMD is confirmed.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will make a statement on why average compensation values for cattle and sheep increased during the foot and mouth disease outbreak.  [104044]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30328w15.html_spnew16"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
: Average compensation values increased during the foot and mouth outbreak because, as the number of animals slaughtered increased, it was claimed the notional market value for the replacement stock rose, on the basis of supply and demand. It was further claimed as the supply was reduced, especially in some areas of the country, the market value went up. In the absence of a functioning market this is based on assumption and is clearly unsatisfactory. Under the Animal Health Act 1981, the professional valuers employed by the Department had to value the animals at the market value immediately before they were slaughtered. The issue of compensation mechanisms for livestock is under review as recommended by the Public Accounts Committee.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30328w15.html_spnew17"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Prophylactic (routine) use of vaccination against foot and mouth disease has been prohibited under European Union legislation since 1992. There is no available vaccine which can provide lasting protection against all strains of the virus.Under the proposal for a revised EU Foot and Mouth Disease Directive which is currently under negotiation, prophylactic vaccination would remain prohibited, but emergency vaccination would be an option from the start of any outbreak. Emergency vaccination would be used in conjunction with other control measures such as the slaughter of infected and suspect animals, movement restrictions and biosecurity. The Government's policy is that the use of emergency vaccination would be considered from the start of any future foot and mouth outbreak, and that preferably this would be vaccination to live.

<P>
<a name="30328w15.html_spnew18"><B> Mr. Morley: </B>

 Further to the statement in the response to the reports of the Foot and Mouth Disease Inquiries by the Government and the Welsh Assembly Government, the Department has undertaken a review of all seven mass burial sites. It has concluded that it needs to retain ownership or occupation, and responsibility for management and monitoring, of the five operational sites, that is, those where carcases remain buried, for the next 10&#150;15 years, or until the possibility of any potential risk to the environment or public health is sufficiently reduced.

<a name="30328w16.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The PSA agreement relating to fuel poverty reduction in England, is included under Defra's objective 5, which is to promote sustainable management and prudent use of natural resources domestically and internationally. The PSA target is ["to reduce fuel poverty among vulnerable households by improving the energy efficiency of 600,000 homes between 2001 and 2004".] Good progress has been made against that target with around 500,000 households having received assistance so far.
<P>

<a name="30328w16.html_para0">All surveyors are trained to either City and Guilds 6,176 or National Vocational Qualification (NVQ) level 2 for energy efficiency awareness. Eaga's surveyors are trained to HNC/HND level for technical knowledge for buildings e.g. cavity wall insulation requirements, and customer service skills is provided to NVQ level 2. TXU's surveyors receive in-house training for customer service, first aid and health and safety.
<P>

<a name="30328w16.html_para1">For the period June 2000 to October 2002, 28 private sector landlords were required to repay the costs measures installed under Warm Front.
<P>

<a name="30328w16.html_para2">The annual budgets published 30 November 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 765 were the amounts allocated to tackle fuel poverty in England for the 2000&#150;04 financial years, the bulk of which was to be spent on Warm Front. Expenditure on fuel poverty activity in 2001&#150;02 was &#163;202 million, of which &#163;197 million was spent on Warm Front. The level of funding for 2002&#150;03 for fuel poverty is &#163;167 million. The level of funding for 2003&#150;04 is still under discussion. However, the Government remain committed to meeting the PSA target of assisting 600,000 vulnerable homes by 2004 and the wider ranging requirements set out in the UK Fuel Poverty Strategy published November 2001, which, is underpinned, by the Warm Homes and Energy Conservation Act 2000. Under the Energy Efficiency Commitment for 2002&#150;05 (EEC), electricity and gas suppliers are required to meet targets for the promotion of improvements in domestic energy efficiency. We expect the costs of EEC for the next three years, which falls on the energy suppliers, to be around &#163;465 million. Capital budgets of local authorities and registered social landlord energy efficiency programmes are the responsibility of the Deputy Prime Minister.
<P>

<a name="30328w16.html_para3">The two Warm Front Scheme Managers were appointed following UK Public Procurement Rules and Regulations on the basis of price tendered. The recommendation to appoint Eaga Partnership and TXU Warm Front Limited was unanimously approved as offering best value by the Tender Selection Panel. The fees paid to the Scheme Managers consist of a fixed monthly element and a variable amount paid for each

<P><I>28 Mar 2003 : Column 474W</I><P>
household where work has been completed and invoiced. The level of expenditure on administration of the scheme is a matter of commercial confidentiality.
<P>

<a name="30328w16.html_para4">Assuming an average SAP increase of 19 points per property and based on the 1998 Energy Follow Up Survey data, it is estimated that the percentage of households in fuel poverty based on full income (including Housing Benefit or ISMI) and basic income (excluding Housing Benefit or ISMI) would fall to 9 per cent. and between 14&#150;15 per cent. respectively. This compares with 16.4 per cent. and 22.3 per cent. respectively at the time of issue of the UK Fuel Poverty Strategy. However, it should be noted that while some properties may receive measures leading to a smaller SAP gain others may achieve a greater gain.
<P>

<a name="30328w16.html_para5">The number of households eligible for Warm Front cannot be obtained from the information collected on benefits by the Department for Work and Pensions and the Inland Revenue. Figures on eligibility and take up of benefits are collected on the basis of benefit units, which may be a single person or a couple. Benefit units do not correspond directly to households as there may be more than one benefit unit per household, whether that is because an individual is on more than one benefit or more than one recipient of a benefit is occupying the same household.
<P>

<a name="30328w16.html_para6">The procedures used in estimating the take-up of a single benefit cannot be extended to combined benefits without making considerable assumptions/judgments. The figures produced would therefore be highly unreliable and due to the complexity involved would be achieved at highly disproportionate costs.
<P>

<a name="30328w16.html_para7">Estimates of take-up of individual income-related benefits (income Support, Minimum Income Guarantee, Housing Benefit, Council Tax Benefit and Income-based Jobseeker's Allowance) are produced by the Department for Work and Pensions . A report containing the latest statistics, entitled "Income Related Benefits Estimates of Take-Up in 1999/2000", is held in the Library.
<P>

<a name="30328w16.html_para8">In the UK Fuel Poverty Strategy, published November 2001, the Government gave a commitment to working towards a consistent definition of fuel poverty across the UK. Whilst some progress has been made, there is not yet uniformity.
<P>

<a name="30328w16.html_para9">In Scotland, the definition is now broadly in line with that agreed for England. One difference that remains is that the satisfactory heating regime for elderly and infirm households is set at 23&#176;C in the main living area compared to the English definition of 21&#176;C. The Welsh Assembly is still considering the position with respect to the definitions of income. They will monitor the number of households in fuel poverty using the same definition as in England. Northern Ireland's definition of fuel poverty will be subject to consultation.
<P>

<a name="30328w16.html_para10">We are currently carrying out a review of Warm Front to look what it has delivered; the issues faced such as the link between fuel poverty and eligibility for assistance under Warm Front, solutions found, examples of best practice and future priorities. A report of that review will be produced during 2003.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs pursuant to her answer of 11 March 2003, <i>Official Report,</i> column 1148W, on pesticides, for what reasons the use of metalaxyl and permethrin were rescinded by the EU; and for what reasons they remain approved in the UK.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30328w17.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 20 March 2003]</i>: Under Directive 91/414/EEC all pesticides which have been on the market since July 1993 will be reviewed to ensure they continue to meet modern safety standards. Decisions have already been taken to revoke the approval for a number of substances including metalaxyl and permethrin.
<P>

<a name="30328w17.html_para1">In the case of metalaxyl the main approval holder withdrew its support for commercial reasons in favour of a newer pesticide, metalaxyl-m. As a result other notifiers wishing to support the pesticide through the EU Review no longer had access to all the necessary data. The Commission, therefore, took the decision to withdraw metalaxyl at a meeting in October 2002. Once the Commission Decision has been published in the <i>Official Journal </i>Member States will have six months from the date of publication to withdraw approvals.
<P>

<a name="30328w17.html_para2">Permethrin was also not supported through the EU Review for commercial reasons. As a result approvals for permethrin were revoked in 2001 with the exception of forestry uses. In recognition of the fact that permethrin has important uses in forestry and there are currently no alternatives available the Commission has allowed this use only to continue until 31 December 2003 at the latest.

<P>
<a name="30328w17.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Every water company must set out their charges in a charges scheme, approved by the Director General of Water Services (Ofwat) before they may be implemented. Charges for the disposal of surface water have, in the past, been shared by all sewerage customers. The then Secretary of State issued guidance to Ofwat in 2000 under the Water Industry Act 1999, supporting the provision of rebates for customers whose surface water does not flow into public sewers. Ofwat report that all companies now offer rebates.

<a name="30328w17.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Director General of Water Services (Ofwat) as the independent regulator, regulates companies' charges. The then Secretary of State gave guidance to Ofwat under the Water Industry Act 1999, that bills should explain to customers each element of the charge and set out the separate costs for each of these. Ofwat has undertaken monitoring exercises to ensure that all companies do so.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30328w17.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Neither Ofwat nor the Government can require water companies to offer retrospective rebates of surface water drainage charges for past years, provided such charges were made in accordance with legal requirements in force at the time.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30328w17.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State meets water company representatives from time to time. At present, she has no plans to meet representatives from Anglian Water. Water companies charges are regulated by the Office of Water Services (Ofwat), which must, in turn, have regard to Government guidance. The guidance expects water charges to be fair and affordable, transparent and customer focused.
