<P>

 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development if he will make a statement on the significance for developing countries of completing the Doha trade round.  [157880]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40303w02.html_spnew8"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 The benefits of the Doha round for developing countries will depend on the final outcome at the conclusion of the negotiations. This was originally scheduled for January 2005 but it is unlikely with the collapse of the WTO ministerial at Cancun that this deadline will be met. It is widely acknowledge that multilateral trade reform can have significant benefits for developing countries. For example, the World Bank estimates that eliminating all barriers to trade in goods would generate an extra US$250 billion to US$620 billion in global income, up to half of which would go to developing countries. In terms of poverty reduction, this could lift over 300&nbsp;million people out of poverty by 2015.
<P>

<a name="40303w02.html_para2">Nonetheless, while the reforms may lead to aggregate gains in a country's economic welfare, they inevitably create losers. As well as undertaking studies on the effects of trade reform on livelihoods and food security of the poor segments of the population in developing countries, DFID is working with a number of developing country partners and through the multilateral system to link the trade agenda within countries' own development strategies. The intention is to ensure that liberalisation is accompanied by other policies to help maximise the economic opportunities for all and mitigate adverse impacts on poor households.

 The humanitarian impact of the conflict in northern Uganda is severe. About 1.4&nbsp;million people have been displaced across the region. Over the past 18 years, more than 20,000 children have been abducted by the brutal Lord's Resistance Army (LRA).
<P>

<a name="40303w02.html_para4">While the conflict persists, we will continue to play a strong role in addressing its humanitarian consequences. Over the last year we have provided &#163;8.4&nbsp;million of humanitarian assistance, which has been channelled through the World Food Programme, UNICEF and the Uganda Red Cross Society. In addition, we are supporting a number of programmes responding to the plight of children affected by the conflict. With our help, UNICEF and Save the Children Fund are improving the conditions for the large number of unaccompanied children who are sleeping in town centres at night to avoid abduction. We are helping to re-integrate ex-LRA child combatants with their families and local communities.

 DFID provides support to governments both directly and indirectly to develop programmes that promote employee ownership of business units. In South Africa, for example, DFID is providing a range of assistance to Government to support employee ownership of privatised enterprises. This has included assistance to the Department of Public Enterprises to incorporate employee share ownership schemes in its programme to divest the state-owned forestry company's holdings. DFID is also providing support to the Government of Serbia to implement its privatisation programme, which allows for employees to bid for up to 30&nbsp;per cent. of the shares in the companies.

 Few governments have as a policy objective privatisation programmes aimed specifically at enabling employees to buy and run businesses.

Our support includes assistance to governments to improve the legal and regulatory framework for enterprise; the development of financial institutions to increase the availability of finance needed to establish and operate businesses; and programmes to strengthen local management skills and business support services.

 The Department for International Development (DFID) does not give development assistance to North Korea; nor do we have any plans to start a bilateral programme there. DFID policy is to focus its human and financial resources on a manageable number of key country programmes where the UK has comparative advantage and expertise.
<P>

<a name="40303w04.html_para11">Since 1997, DFID has provided &#163;3,298,000 in humanitarian assistance to North Korea.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40303w04.html_spnew6"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 Insufficient energy supplies impact on the humanitarian crisis in North Korea. Power shortages prevent effective operation of water pumping stations, thereby reducing the overall supply of water. The diminishing supplies of fuel wood compounds this problem as families are unable to boil water before use, which in turn increases the prevalence of water borne diseases and diarrhoea and malnutrition worde. Fuel wood is also used for heating and cooking.

<a name="40303w04.html_para12">Nevertheless, energy is only one factor in the overall humanitarian crisis in North Korea, and the Department for International Development seeks to target its assistance in a way that will have the greatest impact.

<P>
<a name="40303w04.html_spnew8"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 Owing to the environment of secrecy and restrictions on agencies operating there, it is difficult to be certain of figures regarding the situation in North Korea. A joint study between the Government and the United Nations Children's Fund showed that 42&nbsp;per cent. suffer from chronic, or stunting malnutrition and 9&nbsp;per cent. of the population suffer acute malnutrition (compared with 16&nbsp;per cent. of children in the Democratic Republic of the Congo). The Food and Agriculture Organisation estimates that the North Korean food output falls short of need by 944&nbsp;thousand tonnes.
<P>

<a name="40303w04.html_para19">While significant improvements in nutrition rates have been observed through food aid and improved harvests, the international response has been marked by breaks in supply that leave aid beneficiaries vulnerable. Following a recent delay, food distribution has restarted and all but 600,000 core beneficiaries will receive cereal rations up until June.
<P>

<a name="40303w04.html_para20">It is important to tackle the problem of malnutrition through a balanced approach to its causes. Both DFID and the European Commission Humanitarian Office, are concerned that food aid currently accounts for 90 to 95&nbsp;per cent. of requested assistance, while poor water and sanitation increases the prevalence of water-born diseases and diarrhoea, which in turn worsens malnutrition. A significant proportion of the population of 22&nbsp;million have poor quality water and sanitation and only 52&nbsp;per cent. have access to safe drinking water.
<P>

<a name="40303w04.html_para21">DFID has recently agreed to provide &#163;1.023&nbsp;million in support of UNICEF's work in water, sanitation and primary health care (e.g. vaccinations and other essential medical supplies).

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs how many animals will be tested as a result of the proposed EU REACH legislation on chemicals; and if she will set out the basis for her estimate.  [155857]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40303w06.html_spnew7"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 The EU proposal on REACH requires information to be gathered on chemicals in order to provide the basis for protecting human health and the environment. This information may come from a number of sources, one of which is animal testing. The Commission has estimated that this draft Regulation will require data to be gathered on approximately 30,000 chemicals. Of these, 20,000 are thought to be produced or imported in quantities of less than 10 tonnes. At this tonnage the current Commission proposal requires 25 animals per chemical. It should be remembered that in most cases the tests are expected to demonstrate that the chemical concerned is safe and therefore involves no threat to humans or animals.
<P>

<a name="40303w06.html_para3">The Commission proposal would require further data as tonnage increases to reflect the greater potential human and environmental exposure. Under a worst case scenario, over 1,500 animals may be needed per chemical for those produced at over 1,000 tonnes (estimated from the testing requirements of the Regulation and OECD guidelines). The tests performed need to comply with the relevant requirements for the protection of laboratory animals set out in Directive 86/609/EEC where, among other things, methods used must be refined in such a way as to minimise the amount of suffering caused to the animals concerned. Further, the chemical industry already has some of this data and there are other sources of information such as modelling of data and grouping of chemicals to read-across data from one chemical to another, all of which will reduce the amount of new testing that will be required. If recent experience from a major testing programme in the USA were to be duplicated in Europe, the number of new animal tests that will need to be undertaken will be significantly lower than the number given above.
<P>

<a name="40303w06.html_para4">It is an overall objective, for the UK Government, in negotiating this Regulation, to ensure that animal testing is kept to the minimum necessary to protect human health and the environment. One of the ways we aim to do this is by applying an intelligent approach to testing.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs pursuant to the answer of 12&nbsp;February 2004, <i>Official Report</i>, column 1558W, on Animal By-products Regulations, what assessment has been made of whether adequate protection from rodents and birds might be achieved using suitable netting instead of solid walls in intermediate reception centres.  [156614]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40303w06.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 One of the requirements of the Regulation is that Intermediate Plants must have appropriate arrangements for protection against pests such as insects, rodents and birds. While netting may offer adequate protection against birds, it is not clear how it could offer sufficient protection against insects and rodents. However, we are prepared to consider in individual circumstances if an operator can demonstrate that it does offer such protection.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what estimate she has made of the levels of antibiotics being fed to animals; and what the figures were 10 years ago.  [156874]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40303w06.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 There are no comprehensive figures available on the usage of veterinary antibiotics in the UK. However since 1998 the Veterinary Medicines Directorate (VMD) has published figures on the annual UK sales of all veterinary antimicrobial products from 



<P>
<P><I>3 Mar 2004 : Column 946W</I><P>
1993 onwards. These have been published in a series of five reports, the most recent of which, published in November 2003, details reported sales between 1998 and 2002. All of these reports are available on the VMD website (www.vmd.gov.uk) or as hard copy direct from the VMD. It is generally accepted that the pattern of reported sales of veterinary antimicrobials directly relates to the pattern of their usage in the UK.
<P>

<a name="40303w06.html_para6">Due to a change in the methodology VMD used to calculate these figures, reported sales before 1998 are not directly comparable with those after 1998. However taken as a whole these figures provide a baseline of sales of antimicrobials over a 10-year reporting period. They show that over the last 10 years the total reported sales of therapeutic antimicrobials have remained broadly constant (ranging between 392 tonnes and 495 tonnes of active ingredient) except for a peak in 1996 (553 tonnes). Total reported sales in 2002 amounted to 457 tonnes of active ingredient, a slight reduction from 2001 (459 tonnes) and 2000 (462 tonnes).
<P>

<a name="40303w06.html_para7">Reported sales of antimicrobial growth promoters have reduced from their peak of 122 tonnes in 1995 to between 23 tonnes (1999) and 46 tonnes (1998) of active ingredient over the last five years. (It is known that there are some missing data for some years so changes may not be as significant as they appear.) This reduction probably partly reflects a reduction since 1999 in the number of active ingredients authorised for use as antimicrobial growth promoters. Reported sales in 2002 amounted to 27 tonnes, compared to 43 tonnes in 2001.

[157101]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40303w06.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Section 3 of the Protection of Animals Act 1911 allows a court to disqualify a person convicted of causing unnecessary suffering to an animal from having custody of any animal for such a period as it thinks fit. This can mean a lifetime ban from keeping animals. This legislation applies equally to farmers and other persons responsible for looking after animals.
<P>

<a name="40303w06.html_para8">Article 9 and Schedule 12 of The Welfare of Animals (Transport) Order 1997, as amended, set down the conditions under which authorisations may be granted for the transport of animals. In considering whether an applicant is a fit person to hold an authorisation the Minister may have regard to any relevant circumstances, including any offences involving animal welfare.
<P>

<a name="40303w06.html_para9">We are considering a new system of three tiers of offences under the proposed Animal Welfare Bill. The most serious offence would refer to those involved in the fighting of animals, the second would maintain the current offence of cruelty, whilst the third would impose a statutory duty to promote the welfare of animals kept by man. In addition, we intend to increase the effectiveness of the courts' power to disqualify.

<a name="40303w07.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Peter Atkinson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what progress her Department is making on its revision of the Country Code; and whether the revised code will require dogs to be kept on a short fixed lead <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;near livestock and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;during the bird breeding season on land to which the statutory rights of access to open country under the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 applies.  [156767]<P>

<P>
<a name="40303w07.html_spnew4"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 The duty to issue a code of conduct for the guidance of persons visiting the countryside lies statutorily with the Countryside Agency. The agency has been consulting widely on proposals for updating the code, which was last revised in 1981. The agency aims to publish a new code in the summer, which will include general guidance on legal responsibilities regarding dogs. The code will not introduce any new responsibilities.
<P>

<a name="40303w07.html_para6">The Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 itself requires people exercising the new right of access to keep dogs on short leads when in the vicinity of livestock, and on all access land between 1&nbsp;March and 31&nbsp;July. The Act also provides for local restrictions on dogs, including bans, where necessary, and allows landowners to exclude dogs for up to six weeks in any one year from fields or enclosures where lambing is taking place and for up to five years from land managed for the breeding and shooting of grouse.
<P>

<a name="40303w07.html_para7">The Countryside Agency has been seeking views on meeting its obligations under the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 to provide guidance for people using the new right of access and for people with an interest in land to which the new right applies. Information about the statutory requirements relating to dogs will be included in communications with the public when the new right of access is introduced.

 There is currently no requirement in European legislation for a horse traceability system for disease surveillance purposes, but both the Government and the horse industry consider that there is a need for a national equine database. Defra is therefore working with the industry to set up such a database that will help to implement the horse passports requirements, and underpin economic and animal health and welfare strategies for the horse and its role within the rural economy.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what plans she has for the establishment of a single agency to address legal and illegal imports of food.  [155392]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40303w08.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 In its response to the Reports of the Foot and Mouth Disease inquiries in November 2002, the Government said that there was a case for a single agency to oversee all aspects of the management of the legal trade in imported foodstuffs, but that we would first aim to secure a step change in the co-ordination and delivery of local authority inspection of imported foodstuffs and products of animal origin within one year. We will review the first year's program with the step change project, which has been co-ordinated by the Food Standards Agency and in the light of that consider the case for an agency later in the Spring.
<P>

<a name="40303w08.html_para0">Responsibility for anti-smuggling checks on illegal imports of food was transferred to HM Customs and Excise in April 2003. The Government have no plans for changes in those responsibilities.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will make a statement on the effectiveness of local authorities in the detection of illegal meat imports that have evaded customs and border inspections.  [155394]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40303w08.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Local authorities have made and continue to make seizures of products of animal origin inland. Central records do not differentiate between legitimate imports which now fail to meet relevant regulations, shipments that have entered the EU through other member states and any that may have evaded customs and border inspections in the UK.

 The nomination of personnel for manning control action is a unit responsibility. Before January 2001 lists of individuals approaching Manning Control Points were regularly issued to Commanding Officers by the Infantry Manning and Career Management Division. In January 2001 this practice ceased. However, it subsequently proved that the information needed could not easily be taken from the relevant local computer systems. Following requests from individual units divisional lists were therefore resumed in January 2004. Commanding Officers are not required to take any action unless they believe that an individual should be subject to manning control.

 The expenses incurred by the Missile Defence Centre (MDC) fall into the broad categories of running costs for the Centre itself and funding for specific technical work carried out in support of its objectives. In the period from the MDC's opening last July to the end of financial year 2003&#150;04 the Ministry of Defence expects to contribute some &#163;5.5&nbsp;million, while the estimated contribution by industry will be some &#163;2&nbsp;million.
<P>

<a name="40303w10.html_para6">The outputs expected from the MDC in 2003&#150;04 include: advice on missile defence issues; the development of models and databases to facilitate the formulation and evaluation of concepts for defending the United Kingdom against the ballistic missile threat; and the construction and testing of hardware elements of potential use to the United States Ballistic Missile Defence (BMD) programme. These outputs are intended to inform national BMD policy, establish a leading role for the UK in missile defence, and secure significant participation by UK industry in the US BMD programme.

 Our assessment of North Korea's ballistic missile threat was published in December 2002 in the public discussion paper on Missile Defence, a copy of which is held in the Library of the House. The paper is also on the Ministry of Defence website www.mod.uk. North Korea has some hundreds of SCUD short-range ballistic missiles and NO DONG medium-range ballistic missiles in service. It is estimated that North Korea has also exported at least 400 ballistic missiles.
<P>

<a name="40303w10.html_para7">North Korea is a State Party to the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention. North Korea has the infrastructure to support the development of chemical and biological weapons and we remain very concerned by persistent reports that it is pursuing programmes to develop WMD.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what assessment the Government have made of the impact of the proposals in the draft Gambling Bill on consumer debt.  [158317]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40303w11.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 The policy document published with draft clauses in November as Cm 6014 drew attention to the risks of people gambling sums which they could not afford, and to the measures to be included in the Bill to address these risks, which include powers for the Gambling Commission to regulate advertising, credit and inducements, as well as provision for gambling debts to become enforceable. These and other measures are intended to avoid the growth in gambling opportunities from being accompanied by growth in the incidence of problem gambling; but we have made no separate assessment in terms of consumer debt generally.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40303w11.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 We expect there to be an increase, not least because the proposals envisage abolition of the provision in the current law that casinos may be established only in specified permitted areas.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40303w11.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 The Regulatory Impact Assessment published in November with draft clauses as Cm 6014 noted that proposals which extended the choice and availability of gambling carried a risk of increasing problems in these areas, but drew attention to the 



<P>
<P><I>3 Mar 2004 : Column 963W</I><P>
effective system of licensing and regulation by a new Gambling Commission, with powers and resources not currently available, intended to address this risk.

<a name="40303w11.html_wqn4"><B> Sue Doughty: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what research her Department has assessed into the links between use of gaming machines by under 18-year-olds and the prevalence of gambling problems.  [158347]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40303w11.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 We have taken note of the research studies cited in the report of the Gambling Review Body (Cm 5206) and included in the survey of relevant research evidence which formed part of the 2003 report by Professor Collins for the Responsibility in Gambling Trust (a copy of which is available on the Trust's website). A number of these studies relate to gaming machine play by children and young persons.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what plans she has to commission a baseline study on the prevalence of problem gambling in the United Kingdom.  [158348]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40303w11.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 The results from the prevalence study which were published in 2000, and which were taken into account by the Gambling Review Body, provide the most recent baseline. We think that it would be desirable for a further study to be carried out before the provisions of the Bill are brought into effect.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what assessment she has made of the merits of adopting a harm-indexed approach to forms of gambling.  [158353]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40303w11.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 The draft Gambling Bill reflects the principle that the degree of regulation to be applied to different kinds of gambling activity should reflect the degree of regulatory risk which they involve, those risks being of harm to children and the vulnerable; unfairness to participants; or crime or disorder.

<P>

 Representations made to Government from the Greek Government have focused primarily on reuniting the Parthenon Sculptures in the planned new Acropolis Museum in Athens on a long term basis.
<P>

<a name="40303w12.html_para1">In giving evidence before the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee in June 2000, the Greek Government emphasised that their current case rested on the proposal for a change in location of the Sculptures, rather than ownership issues.
<P>

<a name="40303w12.html_para2">In October 2002, the Prime Minister of Greece presented the Prime Minister with a copy of a proposal for the Reunification of the Parthenon Marbles in Greece which suggested that the restitution of the Marbles be carried out in the form of a long-term loan from the British Museum to the new Acropolis Museum, "bypassing the issue of ownership".
<P>

<a name="40303w12.html_para3">The Government have stated that they consider the Parthenon Sculptures to be a matter for the Trustees of the British Museum who are independent of Government.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what recent discussions she has had with service providers on access to free-to-view, commercial terrestrial channels, via satellite; and if she will make a statement.  [157776]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40303w12.html_spnew3"><B> Estelle Morris: </B> 
 Until May last year, the BBC paid for "solus" viewing cards enabling customers who did not wish to pay a subscription to receive the public service broadcasting channels by satellite. However, following the move of its broadcast services to a new satellite, all of the BBC's digital channels are now available via satellite without the need for a viewing card. It has therefore stopped paying for the provision of solus cards.
<P>

<a name="40303w12.html_para4">Following representations from the Government last year, an agreement was reached between the other main broadcasters and BSkyB to ensure that existing solus card viewers could continue receiving the other public service channels after their current cards expired in 2003. Viewers were able to purchase a new card, valid until at least 31&nbsp;December 2005, for a one-off fee of &#163;20+VAT. This offer was extended until 31&nbsp;January 2004.




<P>
<P><I>3 Mar 2004 : Column 968W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="40303w12.html_para5">We understand that the broadcasters have no current plans to provide solus cards to new satellite customers. However, the Government remains committed to ensuring that analogue terrestrial broadcasting signals are maintained until everyone who can currently get the main public service broadcasting channels (BBC1 and 2, ITV1, Channel 4/S4C and Five) can receive them free-to-view via at least one of the digital platforms.

<P>
<a name="40303w12.html_spnew4"><B> Estelle Morris: </B> 
 The Government have already introduced free television licences for people aged 75 or over but have no plans to extend this concession to all pensioners. However, the arrangements for funding the BBC after the expiry of the Corporation's current Royal Charter at the end of 2006 are due to be considered as part of the Charter review process. The review will include a detailed examination of the concessionary arrangements.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40303w12.html_spnew7"><B> Angela Smith: </B> 
 All cardiac care inpatient services in local hospitals are consultant led. Cardiology nurses involved in the provision of cardiac services deliver essential elements of the patients' care, such as lifestyle advice in the case of cardiac rehabilitation. Their skills and knowledge allow for a more holistic approach to the care of patients.
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland if he will estimate the cost of local hospitals providing a mobile coronary care service involving <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;a senior house officer and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;nurses only.  [157340]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40303w12.html_spnew8"><B> Angela Smith: </B> 
 A number of different models currently exist for mobile coronary care units. Some are led by junior doctors, some by nurses and others by paramedics. Models of service delivery need to be flexible enough to respond to local needs including geography, demographics and existing service provision. Different types of vehicle are used and different grades of staff are involved, even within one discipline such as nursing. There is no average cost or typical unit. Any estimate of costs for a generic model therefore, whether led by doctors or nurses, would not be meaningful.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40303w12.html_wqn9"><B> Mrs. Iris Robinson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what actions doctors can take as part of a mobile coronary care service that cardiology nurses are unable to offer.  [157381]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40303w12.html_spnew9"><B> Angela Smith: </B> 
 Mobile coronary care units are staffed by cardiology nurses and/or junior doctors. There is no difference in the procedures that can be undertaken by a doctor and a nurse when involved in a call-out.
<P>

<a name="40303w12.html_para7">During call-outs the coronary care team has access to a telemedicine link with their base hospital, which allows them to obtain the opinion of a senior cardiac doctor if the need arises.

 New Targeting Social Need (TSN) is Northern Ireland's main policy for tackling poverty and social exclusion and has three priority areas which focus on Employment/Employ ability, addressing inequality in other areas such as health and housing and Promoting Social Inclusion.
<P>

<a name="40303w13.html_para1">The Promoting Social Inclusion (PSI) element of New TSN involves Departments working, both collectively and with partners outside Government to identify and tackle factors, which can contribute to social exclusion. One of the initial priority areas identified under PSI was the position of minority ethnic people in Northern Ireland.
<P>

<a name="40303w13.html_para2">A formal PSI Working Group was set up to develop a strategy to promote inclusion of minority ethnic people in Northern Ireland and to tackle racial inequalities. A Race Equality Unit was established in 2001 within the Office of the First and Deputy First Minister to oversee the development of the Race Equality Strategy. The Unit's role is to lead on action&#151;by Government and in partnership with external stakeholders&#151;to tackle social exclusion of minority ethnic people in Northern Ireland and racial inequalities. It maintains close links with the Home Office, the National Assembly for Wales, the Scottish Executive and the administration in Republic of Ireland.
<P>

<a name="40303w13.html_para3">A draft of the Strategy was published for consultation in February 2003. A finalised version of the Strategy, which takes account of the results of the consultation, will be published in summer 2004.

 Regular contact takes place with the Department of Culture, Media and Sport through an inter-departmental group on the Olympic bid and one of the issues discussed by this group is how the regions, including Northern Ireland, can benefit from the games. Northern Ireland has been suggested as a venue for the early rounds of the football tournament and there is also the possibility of hosting training and acclimatisation camps for competing countries prior to the Games. The Olympic Bid has also become a standing item on the agenda for the Sports Cabinet, which is attended by UK Sports Ministers, including the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport.

 There have been safety camera schemes similar to the initiative being piloted in Northern Ireland running in Great Britain for a number of years. In the two years of the Great Britain pilot, the number of people killed and seriously injured at camera sites fell by 35&nbsp;per cent.
<P>

<a name="40303w15.html_para1">The Northern Ireland Safety Camera Pilot Scheme has been in operation since July 2003 and it is too early to make a valid assessment of its contribution to the reduction of road deaths and serious injuries. There is, however, every reason to believe that there is potential for reductions in deaths and serious injuries in Northern Ireland similar to those in Great Britain.

<P>
<a name="40303w15.html_spnew2"><B> Angela Smith: </B> 
 Since 1998, the Government have allocated more than &#163;20&nbsp;million to victims' issues. More than &#163;7&nbsp;million of this has been allocated to the Northern Ireland Memorial Fund (NIMF). A number of other initiatives have also been funded. More than &#163;8&nbsp;million has been allocated for core and project funding to groups working in support of victims. Trauma centres have been established in Belfast and Omagh and Trauma Advisory Panels have been established in each Health Board Area. We are also raising awareness across the public sector about victims' needs, and the special sensitivities required when dealing with those who have experienced traumatic events.
<P>

<a name="40303w15.html_para2">Significant progress has been made in a relatively short period of time but more needs to be done. That is why I am currently working to develop the next generation of victims' policy. As part of this work I am engaged in a consultation process with victims and survivors and with experts and practitioners in the field to find out more about: victims' needs; to what extent existing initiatives, including the NIMF, are meeting these needs; what are the unmet needs; and where the priorities lie. The outcome of this process, which is ongoing, will inform decisions on future policy and funding.

 All District Councils in Northern Ireland provide a household waste recycling service. The level of provision differs according to each council's operational and budgetary constraints. In all cases, the Waste Management Plans of councils provide for the expansion of these services to maximise recycling and the diversion of waste from landfill.
<P>

<a name="40303w15.html_para3">Councils provide access to recycling facilities for a range of materials at Civic Amenity Centres. These usually include glass, cans and paper. Some centres also collect plastics, wood and green waste for composting.
<P>

<a name="40303w15.html_para4">Civic Amenity Centres are complemented in all council areas by the provision of 'bring facilities' in supermarket car parks or other public locations. These usually consist of glass bottle banks and can banks.

 The Office of Fair Trading (OFT) licence debt collection under the Consumer Credit Act 1974. The OFT publishes guidance which is intended to set out the type of behaviour that falls within the category of unfair business practices and which call into question fitness to retain or be given a licence. The most recent guidance on debt collection was published in July 2003.
<P>

<a name="40303w16.html_para6">The guidance does not specify what evidence must be provided to a debt collection agency before they take up a claim but it does state that "sending demands for payment to an individual when it is uncertain that they are the debtor in question" and "ignoring and/or disregarding claims that debts have been settled" are examples of unfair practices.
<P>

<a name="40303w16.html_para7">The guidance also makes it clear that the creditor remains responsible for third parties acting on their behalf and states that if they "choose to do business or continue to do business with third parties engaged in questionable fitness, then their own fitness will be called into question."

Some web-traders use these devices to show that they subscribe to voluntary codes of practice for electronic commerce. The Government encourage the development of self-regulatory approaches to electronic commerce as a light touch alternative to legislation.
<P>

<a name="40303w16.html_para12">The Enterprise Act 2002 empowers the Office of Fair Trading to approve consumer codes of practice. These arrangements apply to consumer codes generally; they could cover codes for e-commerce, but are not specific to such codes or to symbols and hallmarks used by web-traders.
<P>

<a name="40303w16.html_para13">The Trade Marks Act 1994 protects signs that are used to indicate the origin of goods, and the courts have confirmed that this law applies equally to the use of such signs on the internet.

<P>

<a name="40303w16.html_para16">The Department has participated in two reviews of the TrustUK scheme. These reviews concluded that TrustUK should switch from regulatory work to promoting best practice more generally.
<P>

<a name="40303w16.html_para17">In 2003, DTI decided to withdraw the secretariat services it provides to the TrustUK approvals committee. This decision took into account the pressure on DTI resources, recent changes to the legislative framework including the Enterprise Act 2002 (which sets out a new approach to codes of practice), and the Department's belief that TrustUK, as a private sector self-regulatory organisation, should be able to operate independently.

 In December 2002, the Small Business Service (SBS) published "Small Business and Government&#151;The Way Forward"&#151;a strategic framework for a government-wide approach to helping small businesses based around seven themes identified as key drivers for economic growth, improved productivity and enterprise for all. Government have used this framework to build a single, cross-government action plan for small business. The SBS published the Action Plan on 8&nbsp;January 2004.

 The Burmese Government have still to address effectively the international community's concerns over the use of forced labour in Burma. In 2002 and 2003 there was a worrying number of credible reports suggesting forced labour was widespread in Burma, especially in the border areas where the military presence remains high. At the International Labour Organization (ILO) Governing Body meeting on 20&nbsp;November 2003 the EU expressed grave concern at the Burmese Government's failure to take effective action on forced labour and stressed the need to fully implement the recommendations from the ILO High Level Team report of September 2001 without any further delay.

 In accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998, we are not in a position to give details of where the British nationals at Guantanamo Bay were detained prior to their transfer there. Exemption 15 of Part 2 the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information applies. British diplomats visited the British detainees in January 2002, February 2002, May 2002, November 2002, April 2003 and September 2003. Officials have questioned the British detainees about matters relevant to national security. The Government have a duty to protect the UK's national security. As far as we are aware, no British nationals or British residents have been permitted a visit from any legal representative.

The effectiveness of the organisation must be enhanced to ensure that the UN is able to meet the challenges currently facing the international community. Our priorities are a Security Council that deals effectively with the full range of threats to international peace and security: we welcome the establishment by the Secretary-General of a High Level Panel to look at this issue. We are supporting efforts to revitalise the General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council, and moves to reform the development agencies. We have also strongly supported Kofi Annan's 2002 proposals to improve the UN Secretariat and its budgetary procedures. We believe that these existing processes will lead to an organisation better equipped to meet current challenges.

<a name="40303w21.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 The minimum attendance requirement for EMA is only 12 guided learning hours per week, so the main evaluation of the pilot scheme has assessed impact on part-time as well as full-time study. We do not plan to extend EMA to those studying for less than 12 hours. The evidence from the evaluation also indicates that with EMA, young people are able to establish a better balance between part-time work and their studies.

School and LEA figures are also available in the school performance tables covering pupil value-added over the three years leading up to KS3. Similar information for each of these key stages was also published for the 2002 cohorts.

<P>
<a name="40303w22.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 Under health and safety legislation responsibility for fire safety, including the maintenance of fire alarm systems, rests with the employer. With community schools, community special schools, voluntary controlled schools, maintained nursery schools and pupil referral units, the employer is the local education authority. For foundation schools, foundation special schools and voluntary aided schools, the employer is usually the governing body. With independent schools, the employer is usually the governing body or proprietor.

<P>
<a name="40303w22.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The decision whether or not to offer particular subjects at GCSE is one for the awarding bodies which are independent commercial enterprises. They do not currently offer a GCSE in Kurdish. The Department has no power to prescribe that subjects outside of the statutory national curriculum should be available at GCSE. For some areas of study, such as Kurdish, which are likely to have a relatively low number of candidates, the cost of providing an examination would be an important consideration for the awarding bodies.

 As we said in our Skills Strategy White Paper, "21st Century Skills", we will create a new guarantee of free tuition for any adult without a good foundation of employability skills to get the training they need to achieve such a qualification at level 2. We intend that it will apply to those in the workforce or of working age&#151;including the economically inactive who are seeking those employability skills&#151;who do not already have a full level 2 qualification, and who commit to trying to achieve one. The Government already waive tuition fees for certain categories of adults receiving income-based benefits such as income support, housing and council tax benefits and those undertaking basic skills learning. Many colleges also offer free or discounted learning for other groups of people including those not on state benefits.

 There have been no discussions with universities on the opening of their sports facilities for out-of-hours community use. Higher education institutions (HEIs) are autonomous organisations and it is up to individual institutions to decide on the degree of public use of their sports facilities. This will vary depending on the type of facilities, the requirements of the local community and the needs of the institutions. However, I am aware that universities are already increasingly engaged in this type of activity.

 We are not aware of research into student drop-out rates in the poorest communities. However, the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) has found that levels of non-completion are correlated only very weakly, if at all, with social class after taking into account prior academic record (see HEFCE submission to the Education and Employment Committee, Sixth Report, 13&nbsp;March 2001, HC 124, page 121). Other research has reached similar conclusions. Examples include:

<a name="40303w23.html_para8">The UK non-completion rate has stayed broadly the same at around 17&#150;18&nbsp;per cent. since 1991&#150;92 and this fell to just over 16&nbsp;per cent. in the figures published in December 2003 by HEFCE.

<P>
<a name="40303w23.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 The retirement age of teachers is covered in the contract of employment between the teacher and their employer. Issues relating to contractual retirement ages are still under consideration in the light of the policy on encouraging longer working lifetimes in the Green Paper (GM 5865) "Simplicity, security and choice: Working and saving for retirement. Action on occupational pensions"; and considerations on how legislation on age discrimination under the EU Employment Directive EC78/2000 will be implemented in the UK.
<P>

<a name="40303w23.html_para10">The provisions of the Teachers' Pension Scheme are currently under review in consultation with representatives of teacher and employer associations. This review is being conducted in the context of proposals to increase the normal pension age (ie the age at which

scheme members can access an unreduced pension) to 65. It is proposed that the higher pension age would apply to new teachers from 2006 and to the future service of existing teachers from 2013. The impact on scheme costs of the increase in the normal pension age and any improvements that may be made to the existing provisions of the TPS will be assessed by the Government Actuary as options are worked up in consultation with teacher and employer representatives.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what assessment he has made of likely reasons for the increase in Income Support and Jobseekers's Allowance overpayments to non-pensioners owing to official error; and if he will make a statement.  [155892]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40303w24.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Pond  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 25&nbsp;February 2004]:</i> The loss from fraud and error in Income Support (IS) and Jobseeker's Allowance (JSA) reduced to 7.3&nbsp;per cent. in March 2003, compared to the 10.4&nbsp;per cent. September 1998 baseline figure. This is the lowest ever level of loss recorded and builds on our previous achievements. We have now reduced by 30&nbsp;per cent. the loss for people of working age receiving IS or JSA.
<P>

<a name="40303w24.html_para1">The Department estimates that the rate of overpayment in IS and JSA due to official error was 1.9&nbsp;per cent. of expenditure for the period April 2002&nbsp;March 2003. The equivalent figure in the previous year, for the period April 2001 to March 2002, was 1.8&nbsp;per cent.
<P>

<a name="40303w24.html_para2">The increase of 0.1&nbsp;per cent. is very small compared to the margins of sampling error around the two estimates. Furthermore, a change in the methodology between 2001&#150;02 and 2002&#150;03 increased the estimate of official error by 0.1&nbsp;per cent. In these circumstances we cannot conclude that there has been a real increase in the underlying rate of official error. Further details on the methodology change will be provided in the next National Statistics report which is due to be published in March 2004.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions when elements of the Regulated Social Fund have been increased and by how much in <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;cash and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;real terms; what research he has conducted on the cost of a simple, respectful and low cost funeral in each of the last six years; how many people have received funeral payments since 1997; and what the average award was in each year.  [157821]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40303w25.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Pond: </B> 
 Funeral payments from the Social Fund cover, in full, the cost of certain necessary charges; these include fees levied by burial authorities and crematoria. An additional sum is allowed for other funeral expenses, which give the person arranging the funeral the freedom to select items or services they consider appropriate. This additional sum was increased to a maximum of &#163;700 from 7&nbsp;April 2003.
<P>

<a name="40303w25.html_para0">The total average funeral payment in 2002&#150;03 was &#163;929. The amount awarded in many cases can be much higher but this is often offset by money available from the deceased's assets, which may be taken into account.

 The Commissioner carries out his statutory duties independently of government. He has no powers under the Data Protection Act to take legal action against "collectors", but he has been working closely with the Office of Fair Trading, local trading standards services across the country and various police forces to tackle the problem. The coordinated efforts of these bodies have resulted in a number of successful legal actions and continuing investigations.

(3) on how many occasions fees forwarded to the Information Commissioner by bogus collectors on behalf of data protection were from organisations which do not need to be registered; and what happens to such fees;  [157588]

 There are no nationality or residency requirements for using the courts in the United Kingdom. The availability of civil and criminal legal aid follows the same basic principle. Any individual, whether they are a UK citizen or not, may make an application for civil or criminal legal aid in any of the three jurisdictions within the United Kingdom (England and Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland). The applicant, however, must pass the relevant merits and means criteria for the civil or criminal schemes within the jurisdiction where the application is made, and, in addition, the legal proceedings for which legal aid is sought must have originated within that jurisdiction.

 The Commonhold and Leasehold Reform Act 2002 includes provisions that will make it mandatory for landlords to give leaseholders a notice specifying how much ground rent is required, when the rent is payable and what the consequences are of non-payment. The leaseholder will also be given a grace period for paying the ground rent, which will be not be less than 30 days or more than 60 days after the day of the notice.

<a name="40303w27.html_para1">On 25&nbsp;February, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and Local Government Association (LGA) announced nine Centres of Procurement Excellence to support authorities in implementing the National Procurement Strategy.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40303w27.html_spnew2"><B> Keith Hill: </B> 
 English Partnerships (EP) has budgeted in accordance with the contracts signed between EP, Meridian Delta Ltd. and Anschutz Entertainment Group in May 2002, to continue to pay core Dome management and maintenance costs until construction of the new arena starts. Similarly, while the arena is under construction, EP has budgeted for a reduced level of costs. Those costs will cease on practical completion of the arena. We are not in a position to give estimates of costs at this stage, as there are negotiations proceeding which are commercially confidential. However, once the transaction with Meridian Delta Ltd. and Anschutz Entertainment Group has gone unconditional, which is expected in June this year, I will update the House further and provide more information on the expected future level of costs.
<P>

<a name="40303w27.html_para2">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has regularly updated the House on costs incurred by EP in relation to the Dome, including its management and maintenance. The average monthly cost for management and maintenance of the Dome from January 2003 to December 2003 was &#163;221,000, including rates, utilities, security and EP staff costs.
<P>

<a name="40303w27.html_para3">All costs incurred by EP since it took over responsibility for the Dome in July 2001 and including the costs of the sale process will be recovered from the sale proceeds.

 Before applying for an anti-social behaviour order the police and local authority have a statutory duty to consult with each other.

 The Government do not routinely collect figures on the cost of credit card fraud, but the Association for Payment Clearing Services (APACS) estimates the cost of internet fraud in 2002 (the most recent figures available) to be &#163;28&nbsp;million accounting for 7&nbsp;per cent. of all card fraud losses.
<P>

<a name="40303w28.html_para3">The measures taken by Home Office to counter this include a recently launched website to combat fraud over the internet.

<P>
<a name="40303w28.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 I understand from the Association of Payment Clearing Services that the chip and PIN system is not used exclusively anywhere in the world. We cannot therefore draw on experience to say what may happen in terms of possible fraud migration to ATMs once Chip and PIN is fully implemented in the United Kingdom.
<P>

<a name="40303w28.html_para8">The upgrading of cash machines to chip and PIN technology is more secure because the user needs both the genuine card and the PIN. This is a major improvement on the magnetic stripe and PIN system where a fraudster could have used the PIN with a counterfeit card.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what methods counter-signatories will be required to use <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;to obtain fingerprints from applicants and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;to authenticate documents provided by applicants as set out in his consultation on new draft regulations for the Criminal Records Bureau.  [156059]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40303w29.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 The draft regulations, issued for consultation on 1&nbsp;December 2003, would require Registered Bodies, or their agents, to authenticate the identity of a Disclosure applicant by examining a combination of official or other documents (for example passports, driving licences and utility bills) which will help confirm the applicant's name, date of birth and current address. Counter signatories, or those carrying out identity checking on their behalf, should be alert for signs of tampering. The Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) has issued guidelines which identify suspicious signs to be on the lookout for when examining the documents commonly presented by applicants.
<P>

<a name="40303w29.html_para0">The draft regulations would not require counter signatories to obtain fingerprints from applicants. We have separately consulted on the Independent Review Team's proposal that applicants for the most sensitive positions should be required to submit their fingerprints with their Disclosure application.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40303w29.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 Since the inception of the Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) Registered Bodies have checked the identity of applicants for Disclosures. Being closer to direct contact with applicants than the CRB they are best placed to do so. We have proposed, in the consultation paper we issued in December, that Registered Bodies be made explicitly responsible for validating the identity of those for whom they seek Disclosures. The CRB has issued guidance to Registered Bodies to help them identify common official documents that may have been forged or tampered with.

checks is not recorded on the Disclosure application form they are rejected by the Bureau. In addition, as part of the proposed periodic audit of Registered Bodies, CRB staff will be checking to see that Registered Bodies properly discharge their responsibilities in this area. Furthermore, as part of their anti-fraud measures the CRB checks a sample of applications against lists maintained by the UK Passport Services and DVLA of fraudulently obtained passports and driving licences.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40303w29.html_wqn2"><B> Chris Ruane: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many domestic violence incidents were reported in the last 12 months, broken down by <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;police authority area, <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;local authority area and <i>(c)</i>&nbsp;basic command unit; and how many and what percentage of these incidents resulted in prosecution.  [156243]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40303w29.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 Domestic violence is not separately identified in the recorded crime statistics collected by the Home Office nor in the statistics of court proceedings, because the circumstances of the offences are not collected. While the number of incidents of domestic violence in England and Wales are measured by the British Crime Survey (BCS), figures are not available by police force area or at more local levels.
<P>

<a name="40303w29.html_para2">In the 2002&#150;03 BCS there were an estimated 501,000 incidents of domestic violence in England and Wales as a whole, 35&nbsp;per cent. of which were reported to the police. This is from the main face-to-face part of the survey and shows a decrease of 38&nbsp;per cent. since 1997.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40303w29.html_spnew4"><B> Caroline Flint: </B> 
 The Government are, in this financial year, providing &#163;1.5&nbsp;million specifically to support community action to help tackle gun crime. This is in addition to other funding, including through the Street Crime Initiative, to support community-based programmes that will help to tackle gun crime.
<P>

<a name="40303w29.html_para3">This work is on-going, but we will take stock, at an appropriate time, of the outcomes of the projects supported in order to inform future community-based action in this area. We will be developing a dedicated website to support those working to tackle gun crime, where we can provide information about existing programmes and spread examples of good practice.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what the police retirement age is; what plans he has to increase this; what estimate he has made of the cost savings that would accrue if the retirement age was lifted to 65; and if he will make a statement.  [156593]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40303w29.html_spnew10"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 There is no fixed retirement age for the police. Under the Police Pensions Regulations officers with at least 25 years' service may retire with an immediate pension from age 50. Officers may also retire with an immediate pension, irrespective of age, after 30 years' service, when they will have accrued maximum benefits. This means that an officer who joined at age 18&#189;&#151;the earliest age at which it is possible to start as a police officer&#151;is entitled to retire at age 48&#189; a with a full pension. Otherwise officers become eligible to retire with an immediate pension on reaching their compulsory retirement age, which ranges from 55 to 60 depending on the rank and force of the officer concerned. Officers with less than 25 years' service who leave the police with deferred benefits will receive their pension at age 60.
<P>

<a name="40303w29.html_para7">The Government are currently considering options for the modernisation of police pensions to make them more flexible and affordable for future entrants. We have launched a UK-wide consultation exercise on proposals for a new police pension scheme, to be introduced by April 2006. One of the key features of our proposals is the introduction of a minimum pension age of 55 for new entrants and the raising of the deferred pension age from 60 to 65 in line with the proposed rise in the normal pension age in other public service schemes.
<P>

<a name="40303w29.html_para8">Information is not available on the level of savings that would be involved if the police retirement age were to be raised to 65 for all officers. If such a calculation were carried out it is arguable that the cost implications

for operational effectiveness should also be taken into account. The Department of Work and Pensions Green Paper of December 2002, in proposing a normal public service pension age of 65, recognised that services like the police and the armed forces had specific needs which made a lower pension age appropriate for their members.

 The National Association of Health Stores (NAHS) and The Health Food Manufacturers' Association (HFMA) have challenged The Food Supplements (England) Regulations 2003 and The Food Supplements (Wales) Regulations 2003 on grounds that the underlying Directive is in part invalid because of incompatibility with Community law. They sought a reference to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) regarding the validity of the relevant parts of the Directive and then the quashing of the relevant part of the England and Wales Regulations.
<P>

<a name="40303w31.html_para4">At a hearing on 30&nbsp;January 2004 the judge gave permission for judicial review of the Regulations and ordered that there be a reference to the ECJ for a preliminary ruling in respect of the validity of the Directive. Formal reference to the ECJ is likely to take place around the end of February. I understand that the ECJ takes approximately 24 months to give a preliminary ruling; however the national court will request expedition by the ECJ.

<P>
<P>

 Using the definition in The Better Regulation Task Force's report, "Independent Regulators", there are 31 bodies with the right to inspect or regulate national health service hospital trusts in England. However, 18 of these are regulators of the professions, or professional bodies, whose inspection roles apply only to training which a hospital might provide.

 The Department's Public Service Agreement includes a target to increase the number of those supported to live intensively at home to 30&nbsp;per cent. of all those being supported at home or in residential care by March 2006.

[156350]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40303w32.html_spnew6"><B> Dr. Ladyman: </B> 
 In 2001&#150;02, councils received around &#163;320&nbsp;million in income from user charges for domiciliary services. This information can be found on the Department's website. This is assumed to rise to around &#163;350&nbsp;million in 2003&#150;04.

<P>

<a name="40303w32.html_para4">The costs in respect of publicly funded residents with incomes high enough to meet care costs are an estimate, in the absence of data. A comparison of local authority data on the numbers of older supported residents in independent sector care homes and Department for Work and Pensions data on the numbers of older recipients of the residential allowance suggests that around 20&nbsp;per cent. of older supported residents did not receive the residential allowance. This suggests that around 20&nbsp;per cent. of supported residents have incomes above &#163;168 per week, which is both the cut-off for receipt of residential allowance by older residents and the assumed level of hotel costs. This would amount to some 57,000 supported residents. If the average income of this subgroup&#151;for which data are not available&#151;was around &#163;200 per week, the annual cost of free personal care for this group would be around &#163;100&nbsp;million.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40303w32.html_spnew7"><B> Dr. Ladyman: </B> 
 Free personal care would not result in any savings to the Department for Work and Pensions' expenditure on disability benefits for older people receiving care at home. This is because receipt of local authority funded home care, unlike receipt of local authority supported residential care, does not trigger loss of disability benefits.

 As set out in the Mental Health Policy Implementation Guide (2001), assertive outreach teams do not need to be operational 24 hours per day, seven days per week, but provide evening and weekend cover.

 Reports on the effects of ultra-violet radiation (UVR) from the National Radiological Protection Board, the International Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation Protection and the British Medical Association conclude that there is no direct evidence that sunbed exposure causes skin cancer. By far the greatest source of UVR exposure is the sun. That is why we have taken measures to encourage the public to protect themselves and their children from the risks of unsafe exposure to the sun. We have, with key stakeholders, developed the SunSmart campaign, run by Cancer Research UK. The campaign was launched in March 2003 and funded by the United Kingdom Health Departments. Campaign leaflets and posters were sent to all general practitioner surgeries, secondary schools and health promotion units.
