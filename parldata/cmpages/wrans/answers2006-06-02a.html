The figures presented are in &#163; million and reflect nominal costs
for the whole of Great Britain. Figures relate to financial
years.  2. They are total amounts paid to beneficiaries,
irrespective of the source of funding, and include benefit spending
reimbursed by DWP, spending on rent rebates financed within local
authorities&#146; housing revenue accounts, and benefit spending
financed from local authorities&#146; general funds.  3.
They reflect the latest benefit-by-benefit estimate of out-turn, and
not the amounts voted by Parliament.  4. Figures for 1999-2000
onwards are on a resource accounting land budgeting basis. There may be
differences between figures quoted in these tables and those quoted in
Department for Work and Pensions accounts.  5. Some figures
for past years may have changed since previous publications owing to
the incorporation of more up-to-date information. Also please note that
from April 2003 responsibility for child benefit, guardians allowance
and child&#146;s special allowance has been transferred to Inland
Revenue.  6. Figures exclude asylum seekers from April 1999,
since when the National Asylum Support Service has reimbursed DWP for
benefits paid to asylum seekers.  7. This information is taken

service across the whole country which will be completed by 2008.
Pathways offers new IB customers early support from skilled personal
advisers and direct access to a &#145;Choices Package&#146; of
employment programmes and clear financial incentives to make work pay.

on a voluntary basis. Pathways is due to rollout in the Denton and

not put any users' incomes below basic income support levels or the

Administration Agency (AFPAA) rolled out Joint Personnel Administration
(JPA) to all 48,000 RAF service personnel throughout the world on time
and on budget. The event marked the culmination of five years system
design, development, integration and testing and bears testimony to a
very strong partnering agreement between MOD and EDS. The total cost to
date of JPA is &#163;116 million.</p><br><notus-date day="2" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>2 Jun 2006 : Column 43W</b><br><p><a name="06060519000578">The suitability of JPA was

approving the Main Gate Business Case. Prior to rollout, the readiness
for service was assessed by an independent Office of Government
Commerce Gateway
review.</p><p><a name="06060519000579">On JPA rollout
to the RAF there were a small number of technical issues which had not
manifested in the extensive testing carried out prior to its launch.
This resulted in the system operating much more slowly than anticipated
which greatly restricted the number of self-service users at any one
time. Over the course of the last six weeks these early problems have
been overcome and all users now have full access to the system. JPA has
performed satisfactorily on rollout to RAF professional HR
administrators and has delivered pay to the RAF with only a relatively
few discrepancies caused by the migration of data from the legacy
systems to JPA. Although the first few weeks following rollout has
generated a significant number of enquiries, no formal complaints have
been
received.</p><p><a name="06060519000580">Following
RAF rollout, the related provisional JPA dates for the RN and Army were
June and November 2006 respectively. However, in order to more closely
align JPA with Defence Information Infrastructure (Future) programme
requirements, current plans are that JPA will be rolled out to the RN
from October 2006 and to the Army from March 2007

the launch of the Government's Small Change Big Difference Campaign.

Watson:</b> A key element of the Ministry of
Defence's 'People Programme' concerns the health, welfare and sickness
absence of our civilian staff. From 1 June 2006, guidance will be
included on the Defence Intranet to encourage staff to consider healthy
choices in relation to lifestyle and diet. Guidance will be available
on giving up smoking, diet and maintaining a healthy weight, alcohol
consumption and exercise. Links will be provided to specialist websites
and Government initiatives including 'Small Change, Big
Difference'.</p><p><a name="06060519000875">As part
of the launch of these services, the Department is to hold a 'Health
Awareness Week' in early July. A series of events will be held around
MOD sites to promote a healthy lifestyle. MOD already has a thriving
Sports and Social Association and a number of workplace sports clubs
and gyms which staff can join at their own cost and in their own time.
MOD restaurants also provide healthy choices.</p><p><a name="06060519000876">Health is vital to operational
effectiveness and the armed forces have always had policies for health
promotion. A Health Promotion Action Plan was published last year prior
to the production of the Choosing Health White Paper covering issues
such as diet, tobacco and alcohol consumption and sexual health. There
is an expert panel on armed forces feeding which advises on diet and
has published &#147;Recruits' and Commanders' Guides to
Nutrition&#148;. These offer advice on diets and eating patterns
which are compatible with military requirements and health.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="06060519000029">Somme

day, the details of which have not been finalised. The main feature of
the commemoration will be a Service of Remembrance organised by the
Royal British Legion. It is expected that regimental associations and
cadets will be present. A British military band is being

Watson:</b>Encouraging staff to share
vehicles when travelling to work is dependent on the circumstances of
each site. For example, at Abbey Wood in Bristol, there is a scheme
offering 300 car-sharing priority parking spaces. There are also
informal schemes established on an individual basis. The Royal Navy
also encourage the practice through their intranet sites with schemes
in place at Royal Navy Fleet HQ, and at Portsmouth and Devonport Naval
Bases.</p><p><a name="06060519000881">Vehicle-sharing
is one of a number of measures that the Ministry of Defence encourages
as part its work on sustainable development and travel. These include
the use of both telephone- and video-conference facilities for business
meetings, and offering staff a pay advance to purchase bicycles and
public transport season tickets for commuting to their place of

consultation with a wide group of stakeholders and research with the
public. The research showed that a small fixed charge would not put
people off calling the service but would reduce the likelihood of the
service being abused. The Government, police and local authorities will
not profit in any way from the 10p fixed charge for calls to the single
non-emergency number. The charge will be retained by telecom providers
to offset the substantial cost of carrying
calls.</p><p><a name="06060519001056">This fixed rate
charge compares favourably with existing police and local authority
non-emergency numbers many of which are charged at 0845 call rates
which can cost as much as 10p per minute or more. Calls to 101 will be
10p per call regardless of length which means that callers are
protected against additional cost if their call is longer and more
complex.</p><p><a name="06060519001057">The tariff

Knight:</b> I do not have a tally of the number of complaints
which the Department has received about private finance initiative
contracts, but I will write shortly to you with this information. We
have been working consistently to improve the delivery of operational
private finance initiative contracts in response to problems that have
been brought to our attention. We have, for instance, provided
additional support directly and through Partnerships UK for those
schools and authorities which had contracts with Jarvis plc., and where
there were undoubtedly exceptional problems because of the financial
difficulties of that
firm.</p><p><a name="0606064000123">Ensuring
satisfactory delivery of the services included in a private finance
initiative contract is the responsibility of the authority which is
signatory to the contract. However, the Department is always happy to
advise and support where there are individual problems that cannot be
resolved locally. It also continues to work with Her Majesty&#146;s
Treasury and with other Departments to improve the delivery of public
services through private finance initiatives. This is done by a process
of continuous improvement of the contracts, and also by providing
additional support through the recently formed Operational Task Force.
This will support and intervene on wider structural issues like
benchmarking, market testing, payment mechanisms and
variations.</p><p><a name="0606064000124"><b><a name="0606064000925">Lyn

improvement is the high level of resources some schools and authorities
have to devote to maintaining their contracts. In March, Her Majesty's
Treasury published "PFI: Strengthening Long-term Partnerships", which
supported our own findings. Among its recommendations are that
authorities should plan to give a proper level of resources to

objective of the current trial is to assess whether a specially

of the proposed trials is to assess the snare. The study will follow
the principles laid down in the draft EU Directive on Humane Trapping
Standards whereby the humaneness of a trapping device is first assessed
under controlled conditions in pen trials before, if its humaneness is
deemed to be acceptable, field trials of the device are conducted to
confirm its humaneness and to assess its efficacy and non-target risks.

Bradshaw:</b> The Marine Fisheries Agency,
along with other fisheries administrations in the UK, operates systems
as required by EU legislation to monitor and control the activity of UK
fishing vessels to ensure quotas allocated to the UK are not exceeded.
This involves maintaining dedicated systems for the collection and
collation of information from vessel logbooks and landing declarations,
as well as information from sales notes from registered buyers and
sellers of fish. The information from UK systems is collated to produce
reports on the level of uptake of quotas that are updated on a daily or
weekly basis as appropriate. These reports are used by fisheries
administrations, producer organisations and other groups in the UK to
manage the individual quota allocations during each year. Monthly
reports are provided to the European Commission, with measures also in
place to check and validate information received by the Commission from
other member states on landings by UK vessels outside the UK. The
agency takes management action, as necessary, to control or close
activity in particular fisheries to ensure quotas limits are complied
with.</p><p><a name="0606064000349">The
risk weightings relate to enforcement of sea fisheries legislation. The
Marine Fisheries Agency aims to deploy 60 per cent. of its inspection
and enforcement resources to high risk fisheries, 30 per cent. medium
risk and 10 per cent. low risk. The specific risk weightings take
account of a number of factors, including the nature of the fishery,
the area and the type of fishing activity. For instance, we would
consider vessels fishing in an area and for a species for which
specific recovery measures have been introduced to be classified as
&#145;high risk&#146;. The agency is developing a computer model to
assist in analysing a wide range of factors to determine compliance
risks in fisheries for the medium to long term so that its resources
can be deployed and utilised to best
effect.</p><p><a name="0606064000350"><b><a name="0606064001052">Bill
