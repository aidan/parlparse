 UK tractor registrations, a broad indicator of the strength of the domestic market for agricultural equipment, have increased marginally in the first half of 2006. However, individual businesses may, to varying effects, have been affected in the short term by the cash flow issues faced by farmers as a result of the timing of payments under the 2005 single payment scheme (SPS).</p>

 The Government recognise that the Aarhus Convention is an important statement, at international level, of the rights of the public to be involved in decisions which have significant environmental effects. The UK&#146;s ratification of the convention, in February 2005, demonstrates our commitment to the importance of these principles. A comprehensive guide can be found on the DEFRA website at: http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/internat/aarhus/index.htm</p>

The EIU has produced leaflets and posters publicising peoples&#146; rights to access environmental information and provides detailed guidance on the DEFRA website at http://www.defra.gov.uk/corporate/opengov/eir/index. htm This also links to the Environmental Information Regulations 2004 (EIRs), the code of practice and the Aarhus Convention.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_166"><a name="60724w0001.htm_para1"><a name="06072411000050">The code of practice, (which was laid in Parliament in February 2005) and guidance have been revised to take responses to a public consultation into account.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_167"><a name="60724w0001.htm_para2"><a name="06072411000051">Additionally, the unit offers support to Government Departments and public authorities on EIRs. This support includes workshops to discuss how they can raise awareness within their authorities and provides an opportunity to share good practice. In 2003-04, the Government&#146;s sustainable development unit worked with the Department for Constitutional Affairs supporting the freedom of information (FOI) roadshows programme and gave talks to public authorities around the country explaining how to handle FOI and EIR requests.</p>

These measures include a capital grant scheme for biomass boilers, the establishment of a new Biomass Energy Centre to provide expert information and advice, further grant support for biomass supply chains, and a commitment to consider using biomass in the Government estate.

 On 12 June the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs announced new sustainable operations targets for the Government estate. Environmental management systems (EMS) are a key enabler in supporting improvements in operational performance on the estate, particularly in areas such as energy, water and waste. Therefore, the new targets included a commitment that all Government Departments should have an EMS in place, based, or modelled upon, a recognised system (such as ISO 14001, or the European regulation EMAS).</p>

 The Environment Agency (EA) is the principal operating authority with responsibility for flood risk management in England. DEFRA has provided &#163;141 million to the EA in grant in aid in 2006-07 up to the end of July. This supports capital improvement projects, maintenance and operation of existing infrastructure, and associated activities such as flood warning, public awareness of flood risk and advising planning authorities with respect to development in areas at risk of flooding.</p>

Over 3,000 schools are currently registered, including 500 schools that have achieved Green Flag status.</p>

 The A13 is the responsibility of the Secretary of State only between its junctions with the A1306 and A1089. We have no plans at present for improvements to this section of road. The remainder of the A13 is the responsibility of Southend on Sea borough council and Essex county council. Improvements to these sections of the road are therefore matters for these authorities. In his announcement of 6 July about Regional Funding Allocations, the Secretary of State approved entry into the programme of a scheme promoted by Essex county council for the improvement of the junction of the A13 with the A130 at Sadler&#146;s Farm.</p>

 The Highways Agency's economic analysis of the A303 Stonehenge scheme is based on an assumed start of construction in 2008. On this assumption, it is estimated that in the first year after construction (2013) of the published scheme there would be travel time savings of between &#163;3.495 million at low growth and &#163;6.317 million at high growth. In addition, there would be safety benefits (resulting from a reduction in accidents) of between &#163;2.035 million at low growth and &#163;2.211 million at high growth.</p>

 The Public Prosecution Service conducts all cases it prosecutes, including those on behalf of the Environment and Heritage Service, in accordance with the Test for Prosecution. That test is whether there is sufficient available evidence to afford a reasonable prospect of conviction and, if so, whether it is in the public interest to prosecute. If the evidential aspect of the test is met, there is a strong presumption that prosecution is in the public interest; the more serious the offence, or its consequences, the stronger the presumption. The cost of bringing a prosecution does not weigh in that consideration. The PPS may take into account, in assessing the public interest, whether the offence is of such a nature that it is likely that the court will impose only a very small or nominal penalty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_322"><a name="60724w0020.htm_para0"><a name="06072426003156">The cost-effectiveness of prosecutions is based on the overall efficiency of the PPS.

 By statute, certain offences require the consent of the Attorney-General or the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) in order for there to be a prosecution.

For example, in 2005-06, the mid-2003 population estimates were used.

 Planning guidance to local authorities on planning applications in areas of outstanding natural beauty (AONBs) is set out in Planning Policy Statement (PPS)7 Sustainable Development in Rural Areas. PPS7 states that AONBs confirmed by the Government have the highest standards of protection in relation to landscape and scenic beauty. Major developments (including mineral working) should not take place in these areas except in exceptional circumstances and applications for such developments should be subject to the most rigorous examination. Major development proposals should be demonstrated to be in the public interest before being allowed to proceed and will need to be assessed against the criteria set out in paragraph 22 of PPS7. However, it will be for local planning authorities to decide on a case by case basis whether exceptional circumstances exist which would allow them to grant planning permission for a minerals development in an AONB.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_355"><a name="60724w0027.htm_para0"><a name="06072519002445">No recent assessment of the impacts of mineral operations on residential areas or areas of outstanding natural beauty has been undertaken by my Department. Any adverse potential impacts of quarries will need to be considered by mineral planning authorities after applications for planning permission have been submitted. Mineral operators will need to demonstrate to local planning authorities in planning applications including (where appropriate) through the preparation of environmental impact assessments that their proposals are acceptable. Minerals Policy Statement (MPS)2 &#147;Controlling and Mitigating the Environmental Effects of Minerals Extraction in England&#148; stresses that mineral planning authorities should take account of the full range of social, community, economic and environmental issues relevant to the planning decision. Any adverse effects on local communities, environmental damage or loss of amenity must be kept to an acceptable minimum. MPS2 advises mineral planning authorities on the use of appropriate planning conditions, which must be capable of being monitored, to mitigate any environmental impacts. Where adverse environmental effects cannot be adequately controlled or mitigated through the design of proposals or the attachment of conditions, planning permission should be refused.</p>

 The Department for Communities and Local Government issued guidance to building control officers in England and Wales on 19 June, following its circular letter on 30 March in which we mentioned UKAS accreditation. We have since understood that UKAS accreditation was not possible since there was no adopted test method, so the Department wrote to LABC Services and the Association of Consultant Approved Inspectors on 19 June and referred them instead to the Approved Documents for Part L, Conservation of Fuel and Power, and Regulation 7 which sets out ways for assessing fitness for purpose for materials.</p>

This is not done on the basis of a single &#147;snapshot&#148; assessment but over a reasonable period of time given the nature of the condition. In this way we will take account of the effects of fluctuating and long-term conditions. Personal advisers have the freedom to waive or defer a work-focused interview where a claimant is unable to participate for good reason.</p>

We will be sensitive to each person's situation and take serious consideration of any medical advice given, such as that provided by a GP. Our services are delivered by personal advisers whose key motivating factor is the help they are able to offer. These advisers receive specialist training to give them the skills, knowledge, techniques and confidence to deal with customers whose circumstances include having a health condition or disability. If someone cannot reasonably participate in back-to-work activity because of their current health condition, they will not be required to do so. It is about people meeting with an adviser to discuss their circumstances and look for ways to improve the quality of their day-to-day living and perhaps begin to chart a route back to work.</p>

The report makes clear that both the public and private sector can provide good public leisure services for local communities where councils have taken decisions based on a robust options appraisal. It is important that councils, with support from Government, continue to get better at managing their leisure provision which is why I have asked Sport England to work closely with them in taking forward the Audit Commission's recommendations.</p>

In addition, I have charged Sport England with the task of driving forward work with local authorities to improve the quality of their sports facilities and service delivery.

 The framework for teacher training ensures that qualifying and newly qualified teachers, including those who support children with autism in mainstream schools, are aware of their responsibilities to children with special educational needs (SEN) and can plan effectively to meet these children&#146;s needs. Further, in-service training on particular SEN, such as autism, is a matter for schools and local authorities.</p>

We have commissioned the TDA to carry forward a range of initiatives designed to improve and strengthen the SEN skills and confidence of trainees, newly qualified and established teachers.

 In relation to questions 86889 and 86903, the Information Sharing Index will be designed to ensure a high level of physical and environmental security to protect against natural hazards that could interrupt service. Arrangements will be in place to enable operations to continue effectively, notwithstanding any system component failures. There will be an effective and tested contingency plan that would, for example, ensure that a back-up system is in place.</p>

There is also provision for records of young people who receive additional services&#151;for example, care leavers and those with learning disabilities&#151;to remain on the index, with their consent, up to age 25 in order to provide continued support in the transition to adult services.

ICS is a framework that provides a set of principles for case record management by local practitioners working with individual children in need (as defined under the Children Act 1989) and looked-after children. ICS is not itself an IT system, but it is IT-enabled to help practitioners carry out their key tasks effectively.</p>

It will enable schools and local authorities to target interventions where necessary to help pupils at risk of underachieving to fulfil their potential.

<p><a name="stpa_393"><a name="60724w0032.htm_para5"><a name="06072519003213">The Department recognises that early identification of need, early intervention and early co-ordinated support are key in improving outcomes for children with communication difficulties. As part of a major new &#163;250 million investment in improving the quality of the early years work force, the Department has identified training to support practitioners working in private, voluntary and independent sector settings in meeting the needs of disabled children and their families as one of four priority areas. This is new money and complements the training resources already available to local authorities through the General Sure Start Grant. The Department has also funded the development in partnership with 45 partnership areas of a wide range of practical resources and training materials through the Early Support Programme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_394"><a name="60724w0032.htm_para6"><a name="06072519003214">The Department is supporting a longitudinal study by the university of Warwick looking into the learning needs of a group of children with specific language and communication difficulties, the characteristics of the current provision made for them and its impact, their aspirations for the future and the ways in which services can best support them. The results of the study are due to be published in autumn 2006.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_395"><a name="60724w0032.htm_para7"><a name="06072519003215">Parental awareness of speech and language difficulties is of course very important. In 2005 the Department published a detailed and well received information booklet for parents on speech and language difficulties under the Early Support Programme. This resource was produced in close collaboration with specialist organisations in the voluntary sector and the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists. It explains how children normally develop communication, language and speech, how adults can help in this, the difficulties that can arise and how to seek help from professionals.</p>

Programme and we continue to look for opportunities to work in collaboration with relevant voluntary sector organisations. We have, for example, given grants for particular projects to the Association For All Speech Impaired Children (AFASIC), I CAN, the Aiding Communication in Education Centres and the Selective Mutism Information and Research Association (SMIRA).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_397"><a name="60724w0032.htm_para9"><a name="06072519003402">The Primary and Secondary National Strategies provide a range of support and guidance to schools and childcare settings on the teaching of English and the development of speaking and listening skills, including frameworks to help teachers meet the requirements of the National Curriculum. The primary framework for teaching literacy is currently being revised, and we are developing a statutory framework for care and learning for children aged between birth and five&#151;the Early Years Foundation Stage. Both of these documents will emphasise the importance of supporting children&#146;s development of speaking and listening skills from an early age. We have also rolled out a national training programme&#151;Communicating Matters&#151;for practitioners in early years settings, dealing specifically with children&#146;s language acquisition. This training, which relates closely to the curriculum guidance for the Foundation Stage, includes a module focused on support for children with additional needs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_398"><a name="60724w0032.htm_para10"><a name="06072519003403">Speech and language skills are assessed by teachers on an ongoing basis in all key stages including the Foundation stage. Speaking and listening is an explicit element of the overall subject level for English and it is reported within the overall subject level for English at the end of each key stage; it is not reported separately. In the Foundation Stage, it is reported within communication, language and literacy in the Foundation Stage Profile.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_399"><a name="60724w0032.htm_para11"><a name="06072519003404">The Department has also indirectly assessed levels of speech and language development in Sure Start Local Programme areas to monitor progress towards its targets in this area. This has been collected using the Sure Start Language Measure (SSLM), a parental report tool used to measure change in the language skills of two year old children in Sure Start Communities. SSLM data collected by Sure Start local programmes has shown that between 2001-02 and 2004-05 the proportion of children in Sure Start areas with a high word count score at age two and whose parents were not worried about their development rose from 70 per cent. to 74 per cent.</p>

The table shows an increasing proportion repaying each year as older cohorts earn more and pass the threshold. However, full cohorts did not enter repayment until 2002-03 onwards. These larger, new cohorts have a negative impact on the percentage repaying compared to the positive impact of the older, but smaller, cohorts.

 The special educational needs (SEN) code of practice provides advice to local authorities and schools on their statutory duties to identify, assess and make provision for children who have special educational needs, including children who are blind or partially sighted. The code sets out a graduated approach to providing support. Many children who are blind or partially sighted will have statements of SEN. All statements are reviewed at least annually. The purpose of the review is to consider a child&#146;s progress, to ensure they are achieving desired outcomes and, if necessary, to amend their statements to reflect newly identified needs and provision.</p>

Recently a further &#163;100 million per annum has been announced for both 2006-07 and 2007-08. Funds can be used for improving physical access, including adaptations for sensory disability such as improved colour schemes; access to the curriculum; access to written information in alternative formats. This encompasses information, communication technology equipment (both hardware and software).</p>

Figures for 1999-2000 to 2001-02 are drawn from section 52 (table 3) outturn statements which local authorities submitted to the DfES. Figures for 2002-03 onwards are taken from section 52 (table A) outturn statements. The change in sources is shown by the blank rows.<br>
<sup>(2)</sup> School based expenditure includes only expenditure incurred directly by local authority maintained schools. This includes the pay of teachers and school-based support staff, school premises costs, books and equipment, and certain other supplies and services, less any capital items funded from recurrent spending and income from sales, fees and charges and rents and rates. This excludes the central cost of support services such as home to school transport, local authority administration and the financing of capital expenditure. The pupil data are drawn from the DfES Annual Schools Census adjusted to be on a financial year basis.<br>
<sup>(3)</sup> From 2002-03 onwards the school based expenditure calculation is broadly similar to the calculation in previous years. However, 2001-02 and earlier years includes all premature retirement compensation (PRC) and Crombie payments, mandatory PRC payments and other indirect employee expenses, while from 2002-03 only the schools element of these categories is included. In 2001-02 this accounted for approximately &#163;70 per pupil of the England total, while the schools element of these categories accounted for approximately &#163;50 per pupil of the England total in 2002-03. Also, for some LAs, expenditure that had previously been attributed to the school sectors was reported within the LA part of the form from 2002-03 and would therefore be excluded from the school based expenditure calculation, though this is not quantifiable from existing sources.<br>
<sup>(4)</sup> Figures for the primary sector alone were not available until the inception of section 52 in financial year 1999-2000. The pre-primary figures are not sufficiently robust to use in this reply.<br>
<sup>(5)</sup> Secondary school based expenditure includes all expenditure incurred directly by local authority maintained secondary schools. It is not possible from existing sources to distinguish this expenditure between expenditure on 11 to 16-year-olds and expenditure on 6th form pupils attending maintained secondary schools.<br>
<sup>(6)</sup> Combined local authority and school based expenditure includes all expenditure on the education of children in local authority maintained establishments and pupils educated by the authority other than in maintained establishments. This includes both school based expenditure and all elements of central LA expenditure except youth and community and capital expenditure from revenue (CERA). Pupil figures include all pre-primary pupils, including those under fives funded by the authority and being educated in private settings (only available from 1999-2000), pupils educated in maintained mainstream schools and any other local authority maintained pupils. All pupil numbers are adjusted to be on a financial year basis.<br>
<sup>(7)</sup> Spending in 1997-98 reflects the transfer of monies from local government to central Government for the nursery vouchers scheme. These were returned to local government from 1998-99.<br>
<sup>(8)</sup> Figures prior to 1999-2000 exclude any expenditure on service, strategy and regulation.<br>
<sup>(9)</sup> The expenditure data for 1999-2000 onwards reflect the return of grant maintained schools to local authority maintenance.<br>
<sup>(10)</sup> &#145;&#151;&#146;denotes figures are not available or have not been scored on a consistent basis<br>
<sup>(11)</sup> Figures are rounded to the nearest &#163;10.<br>
<sup>(12)</sup> Cash figures are converted to 2005-06 prices using the 30 June 2006 gross domestic product (GDP) deflators.<br>

 The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) does not discriminate on grounds of age. From October 2006 staff below Senior Civil Service grades will no longer have a mandatory retirement age in DWP.

The Department takes seriously its responsibilities for managing attendance and has developed a supportive policy and procedures for managing sickness absences.

They are guaranteed interviews in selection exercises if they meet the minimum criteria for the post. All applicants are offered reasonable adjustments at all stages of the selection exercise. When a disabled person is successful at the selection exercise our Human Resources teams work closely with occupational health to ensure that any adjustments needed, to either the workplace environment or the post, are put in place quickly to enable the person to commence work without delay. Workplace adjustments are given priority to facilitate moves. Should volunteers be called for to move jobs, or compulsory moves required, the same adjustments are made for any disabled people included in these moves.</p>

1. Projections of numbers receiving savings credit in the future are subject to a range of uncertainties and a number of factors including policies on uprating different benefits, and assumptions on rates of take-up.<br>
2. The assumptions applied here are consistent with those that underpin published long-run expenditure projections, and are applied to projections of the number of pensioner households estimated to be eligible for the savings credit.<br>
3. The projections of recipients of the savings credit under the current system and the reform proposals are calculated by applying assumed rates of take-up, care should be taken when interpreting these projections. In particular data deficiencies make it difficult to be confident in the split between the number of people who may be in receipt of only the guarantee credit and those who may be in receipt of both the guarantee credit and the savings credit. Also the projections are sensitive to the assumed take-up rates.<br>
4. Estimates of the proportion of pensioner households eligible to the savings credit are the mid-points of projections taken from two separate micro-simulation models. Modelling of the reform proposals does not assume any increase in private saving from the introduction of personal accounts, which would further reduce the numbers eligible for the savings credit.<br>
5. The projections of the number and proportion of pensioner households eligible for the savings credit are sensitive to modelling assumptions and to projected changes in the distribution of pensioner incomes.<br>
6. The projections of the number of pensioner households eligible for the savings credit are derived from the projected proportions eligible and projections of the number of pensioner households in Great Britain.<br>
7. The reform projections assume: continued earnings uprating of the standard guarantee credit; the savings credit maximum is uprated by earnings from 2008 and then by prices from 2015; earnings uprating of the basic state pension from 2012; measures to improve coverage of the basic state pension described in the White Paper.<br>
8. The projections under the current system assume that basic state pension is uprated in line with prices and the standard guarantee credit with earnings each year. It should be noted that there is a government commitment to uprate the standard guarantee credit with earnings until 2008. Treasury projections for the current system assume price uprating of the standard guarantee credit beyond 2008.<br>
9. Estimates are calibrated to the mid-points of the 2004-05 National Statistics range estimates of non-eligibility to pension credit, which adjust 2004-05 Family Resources Survey data to take account of possible biases in reporting. Although the estimates here are not presented as ranges, they are subject to a margin of uncertainty.<br>
10. The projections are rounded to the nearest 50,000. Totals are rounded separately so components may not sum to totals.<br>

 The following table shows the number of all individuals living in households which are situated in either rural or urban areas of England and with household incomes below the 60 per cent. threshold of the contemporary median. The threshold of 60 per cent. of median household income is the most commonly used in reporting trends in low income. The figures are on a before and after housing costs basis for the years 1996-97 to 2004-05. The urban/rural marker information is not available on a consistent basis on the data for Scotland and Wales.</p>

These are described in the following table. THOR will record only those cases where the individual has access to an occupational physician or which are serious enough to be referred for hospital assessment. Many clinicians reporting to the network do so only one month in twelve, meaning that only a proportion of all cases will be recorded.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland how many <i> (a)</i> EU foreign nationals and <i> (b)</i> non-EU foreign nationals have been employed in (i) each department in Northern Ireland and (ii) the Northern Ireland Office in each of the last five years; what vetting procedures are in place for each category of staff; and whether this includes liaison with foreign law enforcement agencies.

 Recruitment Service of the Department of Finance and Personnel has responsibility for providing a vetting service for all employees appointed to the Northern Ireland Civil Service (NICS).</p>

Approximately 95 per cent. of all appointees are required to satisfy a Basic Check level which consists of an identification check as well as a Criminal Record Check (CRC). The CRC, which is undertaken by the Criminal Records Division of the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI), identifies all instances where an individual has either been convicted of an offence or where a criminal case is pending.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_501"><a name="60724w0046.htm_para1"><a name="06072546000207">A small number of posts within the NICS may require enhanced vetting. In addition to those checks carried out under Basic Check, enhanced vetting, which is undertaken by the NI Security and Vetting Unit of the NIO, includes an assessment of an applicant's credit and pecuniary history and an assessment of the individual as a security risk.</p>

 The simulated average district rate for 2006-07 is 0.00258 or &#163;2.58 per &#163;1,000 of capital value, while the regional rate is simulated to be 0.00340 or &#163;3.40 per &#163;,000 of capital value. This gives an overall average rate of 0.00598 or &#163;5.98 per &#163;1,000 of capital value. This estimate simulates what domestic rates would have been in 2006-07 had capital values been in place.

 There are measures in the draft Coroners Bill which will assist coroners to operate more effectively, in particular the appointment of a Chief Coroner to provide national leadership and to introduce national standards, including on the timely hearing of inquests. The Chief Coroner will have oversight of the workload of coroners and, subject to the views of relatives and other interested parties and taking account of the requirements of the new coroners charter for bereaved people, he or she will be able to reallocate cases to reduce the length of time it takes for an investigation to be completed. The Chief Coroner will make an annual report to the Lord Chancellor on the performance of the coroner system and, in turn, the Lord Chancellor will ensure the report is laid before Parliament. A Coronial Advisory Council will also be appointed to provide advice, and make recommendations, to the Chief Coroner and Lord Chancellor on any matters relating to the operation of the coroner system.</p>

 In the event that a complainant is unable to resolve the matter with the coroner, a complaint about the personal conduct of a coroner can be made to the Office for Judicial Complaints. Coroners were brought into the remit of the disciplinary provisions of the Constitutional Reform Act 2005 on 3 April 2006. Regulations made under the Act, entitled &#147;Judicial Discipline (Prescribed Procedures) Regulations 2006&#148;, set out the responsibilities of the Lord Chancellor and Lord Chief Justice, and the Office for Judicial Complaints, with regard to the handling of complaints and the discipline of judicial office holders.

Dorset, Gloucestershire and Wiltshire area will be determined in due course as part of the annual financial planning cycle.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_539"><a name="60724w0052.htm_para2"><a name="0607263000086">Under the provisions of the Courts Act 2003, Section 4, the Lord Chancellor may make orders altering the HMCS areas but, before doing so, must consult any Courts Board(s) affected. This process has been invoked and each of the existing Court Boards have been invited to express their views by 31 July 2006. It is anticipated that the separate Courts Boards for Dorset, Gloucestershire and Wiltshire will continue to operate in their current form until the end of FY 2006-07. Meanwhile, arrangements will be made to select members for a new single Courts Board which will correspond to the amalgamated Dorset, Gloucestershire, Wiltshire area. This will be done in close liaison with the Chairmen and Members of the existing bodies. Delivery of the service to court users in Dorset (as with Gloucestershire and Wiltshire) will not be affected by the re-structuring, and support to the judiciary at bench and court level will remain as it is now.</p>

While the precise management structure for the amalgamated area cannot be determined until a new Area Director has been appointed in October 2006, it is likely that re-structuring will directly affect only a very small number of senior management posts and those more junior staff who directly support them, leaving the courts operational staff unaffected. It is anticipated that this will be achieved through a combination of redeployment, natural wastage and targeted voluntary redundancy. Trades Unions will be consulted, at every stage.</p>

 I have no plans to make an announcement on the budget for the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO). The Commissioner's budget is derived from two sources. His data protection work is funded by notification fees payable under the Data Protection Act 1998. His freedom of information work is funded by grant in aid. On 18 April 2006, Baroness Ashton announced to the Constitutional Affairs Select Committee that an additional &#163;550,000 in funding would be provided to the ICO. This means that the total grant in aid for the ICO for 2006-07 is &#163;5,550,000.</p>

 My Department does not hold information on the magistrates courthouse closures which occurred prior to 1995. The following table provides details of the magistrates court closures (broken down into <i> (a)</i> rural and <i> (b)</i> non-rural areas) which took place between 1995 and 2006. HM Courts Service is committed to improving the standard of facilities provided to court users and in delivering greater value for money by increasing courtroom utilization.

This will make sure the progress in converting communal television systems is tracked and that the right messages go to private and social landlords and to managing agents and other representatives. It will also be important to make sure that tenants are aware of what is happening, something Digital UK will do as part of its wider communications campaigns.</p>

 Different aspects of the performance of the 149 public library authorities in England have been assessed, on a different basis, for DCMS since 1998. There was no formal assessment by the Department before then.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_565"><a name="60724w0058.htm_para1"><a name="0607263001365">Though the terms &#147;excellent&#148; and &#147;good&#148; have been part of the assessments of public library authority performance carried out for DCMS, there is no direct comparison between these different types of assessments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_566"><a name="60724w0058.htm_para2"><a name="0607263001366">Annual Library Plans were introduced in 1998 to improve the planning processes of library authorities. The scoring methodology was refined over time until they were discontinued in 2002-03 by which time 64 per cent. of authorities were producing plans that were assessed as good or excellent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_567"><a name="60724w0058.htm_para3"><a name="0607263001367">Library position statements were introduced in 2003-04 to assess the extent to which authorities were engaging with key messages that emerged from the Framework for the Future national public library strategy document. Authorities that were assessed as &#147;excellent&#148; in overall Comprehensive Performance Assessment (CPA) terms; or &#147;excellent&#148; in CPA &#147;Leisure and Libraries&#148; terms and &#147;good&#148; overall were exempted from having to provide position statements. Additionally, authorities assessed as having provided an excellent position statement in 2003-04 were exempted from having to produce one in 2004-05. Therefore, there is no straight read across for the two years. However, of those authorities making submissions by the end of 2004-05, 87 per cent. were assessed as having presented good or excellent position statements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_568"><a name="60724w0058.htm_para4"><a name="0607263001368">The Public Library Standards originated in 2001-02 to introduce performance measurement for library authorities in England. They now form part of the Comprehensive Performance Assessment Culture Block. The basis of assessment for authorities&#146; performance against the standards has evolved across the period so it is not possible to make straight comparisons. In 2004-05, authorities were assessed on the number of standards they had passed. Details of each of the 149 authorities&#146; performance appear in the Public Library Statistics 2005-06 Estimates and 2004-05 Actuals published by the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy.

 All investment in medal potential for London 2012 is channelled through UK Sport, the Government's lead agency on high performance sport. UK Sport allocates Exchequer and Lottery funding solely through its World Class Pathway programme to the National Governing Bodies for Olympic and Paralympic sport, based on a range of factors including regular assessment of athlete performance at major international competitions. It is for those Governing Bodies to determine whether funding should then be provided for high performance sport through their clubs and associations.</p>

 Television licences for respite care arise principally in relation to the Accommodation for Residential Care (ARC) concessionary scheme. As part of BBC Charter Review, the Government re-examined anomalies within the existing concessionary arrangements, with a special focus on the ARC scheme. In the March 2006 White Paper, the Government acknowledged the shortcomings of the scheme but noted that proposals for change focused on individual anomalies rather than ways to improve the scheme as a whole. Previous changes to correct individual anomalies have done little to improve the scheme as a whole and have tended to create new problems. We therefore have no plans to amend the scheme, or to introduce a separate concessionary scheme for respite care accommodation.</p>

 We believe the agreement between the US and India on nuclear arrangements can make a significant contribution to energy security, development, economic and environmental objectives for India and the international community, as well as representing a net gain for the non-proliferation regime.

This is an important element of the G8 plan of action on climate change, clean energy and sustainable development.</p>

 DFID uses a range of different aid instruments, from direct support to countries to funding through multilateral agencies. It is therefore not possible to break down spending on individual communicable diseases; however it is possible to separate out AIDS from other communicable diseases.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_693"><a name="60724w0066.htm_para3"><a name="06072644000495">DFID&#146;s spend on communicable diseases apart from AIDS in 2004-05 was &#163;80 million. Recording AIDS-specific expenditure is difficult because there are a range of sectors which have an impact on the epidemic, including health, education, social development and good government. There are also a range of instruments used to channel AIDS-related development spending. DFID has been working with the Joint UN Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and others to review and improve these expenditure calculations. While refinements to the methodology are still in progress, DFID has reported a provisional bilateral expenditure of &#163;350 million on AIDS for the period 2004-05.</p>

Functioning systems are crucial for effectively tackling diarrhoeal diseases, pneumonia and vaccine preventable disease epidemics as well as HIV, TB and malaria. In 2004-05, the UK provided more than &#163;360 million to support health services through our country, regional and research programmes and provided a further &#163;110 million for health through multilateral assistance to World Health Organisation (WHO) and UN agencies.</p>

 In Southern Africa, the overall picture on food production shows a marked improvement this year compared to the 2004-05 growing season, when DFID spent more than &#163;67 million to deliver emergency assistance to up to 11 million affected people. Urgent humanitarian needs are unlikely this year, except in Zimbabwe, where needs remain pronounced.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_696"><a name="60724w0066.htm_para6"><a name="06072644000500">Malawi and Zambia are reporting excellent harvests this year, with projected maize production figures for both countries almost double the volumes recorded in 2005. This should feed into more stable prices and improved access in the coming months. Production in South Africa has decreased sharply this year&#151;a result of depressed prices in 2005 in the domestic market&#151;but carryover stocks from last year are high. The food security outlook for the coming year is worst in Zimbabwe. Although food production is up on last year&#146;s levels, more than 1 million Zimbabweans still require sustained assistance to help them meet their food requirements.</p>

In Niger, where populations continue to struggle against the legacies of last year&#146;s crisis, up to 1.8 million people are currently facing acute difficulties in the ongoing hungry season, with up to 400,000 malnourished children expected to require nutritional therapy this year. In Mauritania, the hungry season is judged to have started early, with up to 400,000 facing acute levels of food-insecurity, particularly in the south. DFID currently has an ongoing humanitarian and hunger-related programme of assistance for the Sahel worth &#163;4 million this year.</p>

Elsewhere in West Africa, localised problems of food-insecurity affecting relatively few people (particularly in Guinea and Guinea Buissau) are the exception to an otherwise positive prognosis, with good rainfall expected to lead to an above-average maize crop in August.</p>

In Kenya, overall prospects for the current main cereal crop are favourable, but in Somalia, the outlook is poor and output is expected to be reduced for the third consecutive year. In Eritrea, the picture is mixed. In Ethiopia, the prospects are generally good apart from in parts of the south east. The UN estimates that 7.5 million people are in need of urgent humanitarian assistance in drought-affected areas. In each of these countries high levels of malnutrition and starvation have been demonstrated among children over the past year. The areas and communities where this occurs should be the priority for food aid assistance, and humanitarian assistance more generally. DFID has committed more than &#163;46 million of humanitarian assistance to the response since the end of 2005.</p>

<i> [holding answer 18 July 2006]:</i> DFID uses international data from the World Bank and the United Nations to assess progress towards the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in the countries in which it has a programme. It is not possible to assess progress towards the MDGs in countries where data on performance in key sectors is missing or incomplete. In such countries, DFID will identify other ways to measure progress. For example, DFID might use targets contained in partner government national strategies as the basis on which progress is assessed. In some countries, sample surveys conducted through DFID projects or by other agencies provide useful data on which assessments of progress can be made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_710"><a name="60724w0067.htm_para1"><a name="06072644000595">DFID is working with many partner countries and with international institutions to improve the quality of the data that are available to measure progress, so that the number of cases of incomplete or missing data are reduced.

Fifty seven empty food containers leased by UNRWA have also been damaged at a cost of &#163;31,000.

 When returned medicines have been sent abroad to developing countries in the past, they have caused a number of problems in receiving countries.

The UN estimates that approximately 1.7 million people require relief assistance in Somalia. The main rains have been better than last year, but still a long way short of the quantities and distribution needed to produce a satisfactory harvest and recovery of pasture. The UK is currently the second biggest donor of humanitarian assistance having committed &#163;13.2 million since the onset of the drought.

The ability of agencies to access and deliver assistance to affected populations has become increasingly difficult because of banditry, inter-SLA factional fighting and attacks on civilians and NGO staff. In North Darfur, the recent fighting between SLA factions has led to an estimated 15-18,000 people displaced, adding to the 250,000 displaced since the start of 2006. While humanitarian indicators (health, mortality, malnutrition etc.) have remained relatively stable in the internally displaced persons (IDP) camps, the oncoming rainy season and the increasing instability threatens to undermine the progress made.</p>

Water will be an important issue that they will consider when formulating their plans, which will be presented to donors at a pledging conference in October. The UK has provided technical experts for the JAM and &#163;360,000 for its administration costs. The JAM&#146;s conclusions will shape our future support for Darfur.

DFID has urban water and sanitation projects in Ghana, Nigeria, India and Bangladesh and our International Division supports the Water and Sanitation for the Urban Poor to deliver sustainable water and sanitation to low-income urban and peri-urban communities. DFID is committed to doubling spending on water in Africa to &#163;95 million by 2008 and a further doubling to &#163;200 million by 2011. We are now actively involved in seven African countries (Ethiopia, the DRC, Malawi, Mozambique, Rwanda, Tanzania and Zambia), up from only two years ago; and through our funding of other agencies&#146; programmes, we reach many other countries.

 DFID currently has two programmes supporting civil society in Iraq in promoting women&#146;s rights and equality issues, among other aspects.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_749"><a name="60724w0068.htm_para10"><a name="06072644000711">Our &#163;5 million Civil Society Fund supports international (mainly UK) Non Governmental Organisations to work with Iraqi counterparts. As part of this we are working with Women for Women International in Iraq to build women&#146;s leadership capacity, awareness of rights and the capacity to transfer knowledge and skills to the community more broadly. The Civil Society Fund also provides funding for the Women&#146;s National Commission&#146;s Internship project, which is working with women to engage with the Iraqi Government, by contributing to better and more inclusive, policies affecting women.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_750"><a name="60724w0068.htm_para11"><a name="06072644000712">Our &#163;7.5 million Political Participation Fund works directly with a range of Iraqi civil society organisations to help them engage in the political process and has supported a number of Iraqi women&#146;s groups in improving the political awareness and participation of women in Iraq&#146;s constitutional processes, including its recent elections.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_751"><a name="60724w0068.htm_para12"><a name="06072644000713">We have not funded specific projects in Iraq on domestic violence prevention.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_753"><a name="60724w0068.htm_para14"><a name="06072644000715">DFID supports the role of women in all aspects of Afghan society. The strategy we are working towards is the Interim Afghan National Development Strategy (I-ANDS).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_754"><a name="60724w0068.htm_para15"><a name="06072644000716">The I-ANDS recognises gender as a key cross cutting theme. Development of the full ANDS will ensure that these important issues are adequately addressed across the board. DFID are also funding the Government&#146;s National Programmes which include support to enhancing the role of women at community level. For example, the National Solidarity Programme ensures that women are engaged in determining community development priorities through the formation of Community Development Councils. We also support the Micro-finance Investment Support Facility of Afghanistan (MISFA), currently working in 18 provinces and plans to be active in all 34 by end of 2007. 80 per cent. of MISFA&#146;s beneficiaries are women.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_755"><a name="60724w0068.htm_para16"><a name="06072644000717">DFID supports equal rights for all the citizens of Afghanistan. At the national level we provided support to the drafting of the new constitution, which has successfully protected the rights of women and minority ethnic groups before the law. DFID provided significant funding for the Presidential and Parliamentary elections which have been a milestone for Afghanistan. A wide choice of candidates existed from a variety of ethnic, social and political backgrounds. A high number of women also registered as candidates and participated as voters (43 per cent. of voters were women).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_756"><a name="60724w0068.htm_para17"><a name="06072644000718">DFID has not funded specific projects that target domestic violence in Afghanistan. However the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO), through the Global Opportunities Fund is sponsoring a number of projects specifically designed to increase women&#146;s access to justice, improve their living standards, promote women&#146;s equal participation in governance, create a professional network of women&#146;s rights organisations and promote access to information through the radio.</p>

 Expenditure on advertising by the Department procured through Central Office of Information (COI) for 2000-01, 2001-02, 2002-03, 2003-04, was &#163;9.4 million, &#163;6.1 million, &#163;1l.5 million, &#163;4.1 million. Figures exclude VAT. The following table contains details. The Department does not hold information on other campaigns centrally, including those by non-departmental public bodies (NDPBs), and to do so would entail disproportionate cost. In addition to provide information against each entry on the intended audience and purpose of the campaign, would again entail disproportionate costs.</p>

This definition is used to measure take-up of the dynamic range of services available to residential and business consumers that are classed by the industry as broadband and to make comparisons with other European countries.</p>

On 1 April 2005 we launched &#145;Connecting the UK: the Digital Strategy&#146;. The strategy outlines the policy focus towards stimulating effective take-up and use of ICT.

Broadband prices are falling and speeds are increasing. As new technologies emerge, consumer choice increases, making broadband a more accessible and popular option. Broadband is available to 99.8 per cent. of households. I also understand that it is likely that the target set by the Telecommunications Adjudicator, for 1.5 million lines to be unbundled from the local loop network by April 2007, will be met by the end of 2006.</p>

 Power producers are strongly incentivised to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from all aspects of electricity production through the European Emissions Trading Scheme, which incentivises all installations it covers to reduce emissions in response to a carbon price. It is up to each installation to determine what measures it may take to reduce its emissions, which may include those attributable to transmission and distribution losses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_799"><a name="60724w0071.htm_para8"><a name="06072644001040">In addition, power producers are specifically incentivised to reduce transmission and distribution losses through the requirement on all power producers using the transmission system to pay on a cost reflective basis. This aims to reflect the costs generators impose on the network to transfer electricity to where it is required. With 2 per cent. of electricity conveyed over the transmission network lost, through noise and heat, there is an environmental as well as economic case for having generation near to the main centres of electricity demand and the transmission charging system reflects this.</p>

 Price controls for the period 2005-10, which set the operational and capital expenditure for the 14 electricity distribution networks, were agreed between the regulator (Ofgem) and the distribution network operators in January 2005. Ofgem has to allow the networks sufficient revenue to invest in their businesses to deliver licence conditions, which include having safe and reliable networks. At the same time, Ofgem seeks to keep costs down for consumers. The reliability of the distribution networks in Britain has improved, with power cuts relating to underlying performance (i.e. taking out major storms) down by 16 per cent. since performance incentives were introduced in 2002.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_824"><a name="60724w0073.htm_para0"><a name="06072644001223">For the 2005-10 price control, &#163;5.7 billion has been allowed for investment in the distribution networks.

Growing economic prosperity, the development of a market economy and rising standards of living will contribute to this process as well and are already well under way in the countries.</p>

Patient counts are based on the unique patient identifier HES1D. This identifier is derived based on patient's date of birth, postcode, sex, local patient identifier and NHS number, using an agreed algorithm. Where data are incomplete, HESID must erroneously link episodes or fail to recognise episodes for the same patient. Care is therefore needed, especially where duplicate records persist in the data. The patient count cannot be summed across a table where patients may have episodes in more than one cell.<br>

Data have been provided for 2004-05 and 2003-04 only as data from earlier years are not comparable as a time series in the requested format due to boundary changes of SHA's.<br>

 The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) follows a standard process when developing its guidance. This process encourages bodies representing health professionals to register as consultees. Consultees can submit written evidence, comment on the appraisal documents and appeal against the appraisal committee's final recommendations. All NICE guidance is subject to public consultation on the NICE website and any clinician can log on and give their comments in this way. Two clinical experts nominated by the consultee organisations give their expert personal view by attending the initial appraisal committee discussion  <br>

 Under the General Food Law Regulation (EC) 178/2002, it is illegal to place any food on the market if it is unsafe, that is, injurious to human health or unfit for human consumption. The regulation also requires food manufacturers to inform immediately both the Food Standards Agency (FSA) and their local authority of any food assessed to be potentially harmful to health. The food must then be withdrawn from the market and, if necessary, recalled from consumers.

<p><a name="stpa_938"><a name="60724w0088.htm_para7"><a name="06072657001775">The energy efficiency partnership for homes holds a fuel poverty strategy group and during 2005-06 has held cross-partnership seminars to encourage the take up of fuel poverty initiatives by the partnerships 12 other main working groups. The work of the fuel poverty strategy group is further facilitated through its two sub-groups, of which one is a health sub-group which funds the health housing and fuel poverty forum, initiated in 2005.</p>

More recently, in June 2006 the south east region has held round table discussions on how to take this work forward at national, regional and local levels.</p>

The same investigation in Dr Wakefield&#146;s own laboratories showed no evidence of measles virus in bowel tissue from autistic children. Several properly conducted studies that include control groups, have failed to find measles virus persisting in the blood cells of autistic children and therefore we believe that there remains no convincing epidemiological or virological evidence for measles, mumps and rubella playing a part in causing autism.</p>

 The NHS Litigation Authority (NHSLA) forecasts in advance the likely claims expenditure and number of new claims reported to the schemes, neither of which is controlled by the NHSLA. The major impacting factor on the NHSLA&#146;s resource limit is the level of claims reported to the schemes. In 2005-06 fewer claims were made than forecast, meaning fewer new provisions and therefore an underspend in resource terms. As a consequence, NHSLA actuarial advisors reviewed the incurred but not reported provisions which led to a reduction in the resource requirement in year.</p>

 Hospitals have for more than 70 years been able to recover the costs of providing treatment to the victims of road traffic accidents where the injured person successfully claims personal injury compensation from the person responsible for causing the injury, through their insurer. However, the Road Traffic (NHS Charges) Act 1999 introduced a streamlined, centralised recovery scheme, operated by the compensation recovery unit, part of the Department for Work and Pensions, on behalf of the Secretary of State. Recoveries since that scheme was introduced in April 1999 are as shown in the table.</p>

 No assessment has been carried out centrally.

 The Government take the problem of identity fraud very seriously. There is no single offence of identity fraud. On seven June 2006 we brought into force sections 25 and 26 of the Identity Cards Act 2006 which created new criminal offences of being in possession or control of false identity documents. These offences relate to a wide range of identity documents, including passports, driving licences, ID cards and immigration documents. The maximum penalty is 10 years imprisonment for an offence of possession with intent to use the document for establishing registrable facts about another person, such as name, address, date of birth and other personal details, and two years imprisonment for possession without reasonable excuse. Investigation of offences under these provisions is already under way and statistics on the number of prosecutions and convictions will be published in due course.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1027"><a name="60724w0099.htm_para9"><a name="06072657003853">There is also a range of other criminal offences to combat identity fraud. These include, for example, the offences in the Theft Acts of 1968 and 1978 of obtaining property by deception (property includes money), obtaining services by deception and obtaining a money transfer by deception. The number of these offences that were committed using a false or stolen identity is not recorded centrally and it is not possible to provide such figures for Humberside or any other area. However, identity theft and identity fraud questions were incorporated into the British Crime Survey in 2005 and the results should give us more information on the number of victims and the types of fraud that are being committed.</p>

 An initial assessment of vulnerability of under-18 offenders is carried out, before sentence, by the youth offending team . Figures provided by the Youth Justice Board show that during the period April 2004 to March 2005 the number of young people who were assessed as vulnerable in this way and subsequently placed in a young offender institution was 3,370. All young people placed in a secure training centre or a secure children's home are considered vulnerable, either on account of their age or because of other risk factors.</p>

The youth offending team's assessment is therefore only a starting point.

 Partnership working is central to the delivery of Home Office business. The National Community Safety Plan provides a clear statement of community safety priorities for local partners. Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships (CDRPs) are well established as the primary local delivery vehicle for community safety work. Earlier this year, the Government published a review of CDRPs, with the aim of further improving their effectiveness and strengthening their accountability to the communities they serve. Partnership working is also at the heart of neighbourhood policing. As part of the neighbourhood policing initiative the police will work with local partners and communities to tackle local priority issues. At the national level, the Home Office is working with stakeholders to ensure that neighbourhood policing is integrated into the wider community safety agenda.</p>

Partnership working is also essential for the National Refugee Integration Forum (NRIF). This body brings together 32 individuals with a range of experiences and perspectives in delivering refugee integration, and is tasked to review our work and ensure that we are delivering on the action plan set out in the strategy.</p>

 We have already made good progress on reducing the bureaucratic burdens on police officers by cutting nearly 9,000 unnecessary forms; civilianising posts; rolling out the penalty notice for disorder scheme; and ensuring that forces have the best scientific and technological support like video identity parades and electronic fingerprinting.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1041"><a name="60724w0101.htm_para0"><a name="06072657004373">The Government introduced a measure in 2003 to record the amount of time that police officers spend on frontline duties in order to help to maximise the time spent on their core roles of preventing and reducing crime. More police officer time was spent on front line duties in 2004-05 (64.1 per cent.) than in 2003-04 (63.6 per cent.) and we are determined to see this improvement continue, with police authorities setting robust targets for improvement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1042"><a name="60724w0101.htm_para1"><a name="06072657004374">The Home Office expects that the police service can increase this to a national average of around 72 per cent. in 2008. This will be a gain in time on frontline duties equivalent to an extra 12,000 police officers. To support this, police staff numbers have grown substantially over the last few years. In September 2005 there were 71,967 police staff, an increase of 18,956 (nearly 36 per cent.) since 1997.</p>

 No. The police funding formula was reviewed in 2005. It was concluded that data used in the tourism indicator were out of date. The use of more recent information was considered but this was unsatisfactory for inclusion in the new police formula.</p>

 The prevalence of mental health problems among prisoners is considerably higher than for the general population. The most reliable evidence comes from the 1997 ONS study of psychiatric morbidity among prisoners which found that 90 per cent. of prisoners have at least one significant mental health problem, including personality disorder, psychosis, neurosis, alcohol misuse and drug dependence (Singleton et al, 1998).</p>

Of these 85 per cent. had been in the Army, four per cent. in the RAF, and 11 per cent. in the Navy. However, there are no estimates available of the proportion of veterans in custody who have mental health problems.</p>

 The policy on the use of mechanical restraints is contained in the Prison Service&#146;s national security framework. Any use of restraints is based upon a thorough security risk assessment of the individual prisoner and this includes pregnant women.

 Information on the average custodial sentence lengths for determinate sentences for these offences is contained in the table.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1064"><a name="60724w0105.htm_para1"><a name="06072657005512">Under the Criminal Justice Act 1991, those sentenced to determinate sentences of four years or more are eligible for parole half way through their sentence. If parole is not granted then release occurs at the two-thirds point of the sentence (or at a subsequent parole review if earlier). Release, when it occurs, is on licence and subject to supervision up to the three-quarters point (or to the end of the sentence in the case of some sex offenders), and they are liable to recall if they breach any of the licence conditions. All offenders risk serving the rest of their sentence in custody if they commit another offence before the end of the original sentence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1065"><a name="60724w0105.htm_para2"><a name="06072657005513">The Criminal Justice Act 2003 introduced new arrangements for the release on licence of determinate sentence prisoners. They apply only to offences committed on or after 4 April 2005. A new indeterminate public protection sentence was introduced. Those offenders judged to be dangerous, and who have committed serious sexual or violent offences, can be kept in prison until the parole board judges it is safe to release them. If they have committed less serious offences they may serve a determinate sentence followed by an extended period on licence after release of up to eight years for sexual offences and five years for violent offences.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1066"><a name="60724w0105.htm_para3"><a name="06072657005514">Unless considered dangerous, those sentenced to 12 months or more will be released on licence at the halfway point of their sentence. They will remain on licence, subject to a recall if they breach the conditions of their licence, for the entire remaining period of their sentence instead of to the three-quarter point as under the 1991 Act.</p>
