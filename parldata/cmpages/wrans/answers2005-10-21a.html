 Project D154 involves the upgrade of nuclear facilities at Devonport and consists of three phases. The Phase 1 contract ran from 1993 to 1996 and allowed Devonport Management Ltd. to continue with concept and design development work for the facilities during ongoing negotiations for the Phase 2 prime contract. It was originally envisaged that the construction work would begin in 1996, with completion in 1999, but this was not achieved, primarily due to protracted contract negotiations. The Phase 2 contract was awarded in March 1997 and construction work began in 1998. The estimated date for completion of the contract was April 2004, including an end date for the construction work of January 2002.

<a name="stpa_18">During 2001 it became clear that the approved maximum cost for Phase 2 would be exceeded and Treasury approval for an increase in funding was granted in October 2001, allowing the Phase 2 contract to be renegotiated and re-scoped. The existing target date of January 2002, for completion of the key facilities for Vanguard Class submarines, was achieved. Work to complete the Primary Circuit Decontamination Building is expected to be completed in November 2005, in time for use during HMS Victorious&#039;s overhaul. In addition, while some of the work required to upgrade the overhaul and refuel facilities in support of attack submarines (Swiftsure and Trafalgar Classes) was completed by March 2002, elements of the work were transferred to the final phase, Phase 3, as part of the contract re-negotiations.

 It is a condition of all contracts between the Ministry of Defence and its prime contractors that they are placed in the name of &quot;the Authority&quot; which is defined as the Secretary of State. Thus the procurement powers of the Secretary of State are vested in the terms and conditions of the contract. In normal circumstances, those powers are exercised through the prime contractor as appropriate, because there is no direct contractual relationship between MOD and its sub-contractors. If it were to intervene directly, MOD would undermine the contractual responsibilities of the prime contractor. It is principally the responsibility of the Department&#039;s prime contractors to select and manage the performance of their subcontractors.

 The Government&#039;s Skills Strategy, reaffirmed in the White Paper published on the 22 March, sets clear priorities for public funding to support adults without a platform of skills for employability. However, we also recognise the importance of higher level skills, and the Skills Strategy White Paper set out measures to strengthen support for provision at Level 3 and above. Given that higher levels of qualifications have higher rates of return for employers and individuals, it is also important that this should be reflected in the relative contributions employers and individuals make to the costs of such training.

 Further education funding recognises the benefits to learners in completing their planned studies and the Learning and Skills Council&#039;s (LSC) funding methodology rewards institutions with higher retention rates. The LSC&#039;s agenda for change funding reform proposals include a simpler and less bureaucratic method of recognizing retention in calculating funding. I have no plans to ask the LSC to remove consideration of retention as a funding principle.

<br>&nbsp;<br><i>21 Oct 2005 : Column 1267W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
in 2003. The purpose of the pilots is principally to test certain aspects of the teaching of phonics such as determining an appropriately fast pace, and exploring different models of support to schools and ways of enhancing parental involvement. The pilots are not seeking to examine the evidence for different phonics teaching methodologies currently available; Jim Rose&#039;s independent review of the teaching of early reading will look at those wider questions.
</p>


<p>

<a name="stpa_46">The content of &quot;Playing with sounds&quot; builds on advice given in previous PNS publications and represents the Strategy&#039;s latest guidance to schools. The content of the phonics pilots is therefore the same as the advice given by the Strategy. Where it differs is that it explores a more rigorous and systematic application of these approaches with greater emphasis on the &quot;Playing with sounds&quot; resource, and more direct guidance on teaching phonics and the application of phonics across the curriculum. It also tests whether children can learn all 44 phonemes, including the long vowel sounds, by the end of the foundation stage, as part of a rich and relevant early years curriculum

The precise consultancy model will be determined locally drawing on local capacity of leading practitioners. Participating schools and settings will receive guidance materials produced by the Primary National Strategy.

The 20 local authorities involved in the pilot will each decide on which schools and settings should take part, supported by colleagues from the PNS, based on several factors. These include their capacity and commitment to engage with the pilot throughout the school or setting; a need to improve children&#039;s outcomes in communication, language and literacy, while already having at least a satisfactory quality of teaching in the foundation stage; and the potential for at least two of the 10 schools/settings identified in the authority to become leading practice schools/settings which can build long-term capacity in early reading in the authority area.

There is also a dental access centre in Peterborough. PDS contracts are expected to increase dental registrations by 20 per cent. In addition, one new practice opened in May 2005 and one further new PDS practice is due to open in the next six months. There are also plans for an existing dentist to open a new branch in a deprived area of the city.

Notes:<br>

1. The drop in registrations between September 1997 and September 1998 is mostly attributable to the reduction in re-registration period from two years to 12 months.<br>

2. Most personal dental service (PDS) schemes that have registrations have a re-registration period in excess of 15 months, so the figures for PDS schemes are generally higher than they would have been for the same attendance pattern under general dental service (CDS).<br>

3. Prison contracts have not been included in this analysis.<br>

4. A dentist with a GDS or PDS contract may provide as little or as much NHS treatment as he or she chooses or agreed with the PCT.<br>

5. The Dental Practice Board has no information concerning the amount of time dedicated to NHS work by individual dentists.<br>

6. The areas have been defined using practice postcodes within the current boundaries.<br>

 Contraceptives are not provided in prisons.

<p><a name="st_135"><a name="51021w16.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Thomas </b> 
<i>[holding answer 17 October 2005]:</i> The first replenishment of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria concluded with the UK-hosted Replenishment Conference on 5&#150;6 September 2005. Donors pledged US$3.7 billion for 2006 and 2007. This represents more than half of the US$7.0 billion <sup>1</sup>  that the Global Fund estimated it needed for these two years. The money pledged will enable all existing Global Fund grants to be renewed (estimated need $3.3 billion <sup>1</sup> ) and provide a modest launch pad (estimated $0.4 billion) for new programmes.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51021w16.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_104">The UK pledged &#163;100 million to the fund for 2006 and &#163;100 million for 2007 at the Replenishment Conference. This represents a doubling of our previous pledge for these two years. The &#163;200 million amounted to 10 per cent. of the US$3.7 billion pledged at the Replenishment Conference. The EU (member states and the EC) is the largest contributor to the Global Fund and pledging more than US$2 billion for 2006 and 2007. The EU therefore continues to show very strong leadership in tackling AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. As President of the EU, the UK drafted an EU statement highlighting the need for the Global Fund to continue to improve its performance and to be well funded.

 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what studies he has commissioned on the impact of non-agricultural market access on the sustainability of forests in developing countries.  [19840]</p>




<p><a name="st_137"><a name="51021w16.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Thomas: </b> 
 DFID has not commissioned studies on the impact of non-agricultural market access on the sustainability of forests in developing countries. However, the European Commission has commissioned a report on the forest sector under its work programme on &quot;The sustainability impact assessment of proposed WTO (World Trade Organisation) negotiations&quot;. The final report of the forest sector study, dated June 2004, is available on the website of the Institute for Development Policy and Management of the University of Manchester: http://www.sia-trade.org/wto/Phase3B/Reports/ForestFR19June05.pdf.

<a name="stpa_107">The broad conclusions of this study are that:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_185">Tariffs on forest products are low (average trade-weighted tariffs are less than 5 per cent.).</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_186">Further reductions will not affect consumption and production a great deal, certainly not as much as population and economic growth. Much trade is already governed by regional agreements where tariffs are close to zero.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_187">Overall, the environmental impacts of further tariff reductions are likely to be small. However, where governance is poor the social and environmental consequences of liberalisation could be significant.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_188">Further liberalisation of agricultural trade will have a bigger impact on forests than the liberalisation of the forest products trade. This is because of the scale of agricultural trade, the scope for significant tariff reductions and the effects of conversion of forest lands to agricultural use. The product groups that affect forests most significantly are: oil palm, soybean, beef, rubber, cocoa and coffee.</p>

In addition, the UK Government have been a key donor to the Global Fund to fight AIDS, TB and malaria (GFATM) and has committed &#163;359 million through to 2008.
