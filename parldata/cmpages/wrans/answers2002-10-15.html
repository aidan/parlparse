To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, pursuant to his answer of 16 July 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, column 175W, on overseas territories, to what extent the overseas territories differ in their system for the collection and publication of statistics; and which publish details within these statistics that constitute national income accounts.  [71569]<P>

<P>
<a name="21015w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 22 July 2002]:</i> There is no common method used throughout the UK Overseas Territories for the collection and publication of statistical information. Of the economically significant Overseas Territories, Anguilla, Bermuda, British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Falkland Islands, St. Helena and Turks and Caicos Islands regularly produce and publish details within these statistics that constitute National Income Accounts. Gibraltar has recently published a compendium of statistics after a gap of several years.

 I spoke to the Israeli Ambassador on 23 July to express the concern of the Government and the House about the Israeli attack in Gaza and the deaths of innocent civilians. I said it was unacceptable and counterproductive, as my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary had earlier told the House. HM Ambassador in Tel Aviv conveyed the same views to the Israeli Prime Minister's office.

[74481]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21015w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 The certificates I signed pursuant to section 28 (2) of the Data Protection Act 1998 relating to SIS and GCHQ provide evidence that the exemption from those provisions of the Act that are specified in the certificate are required for the purpose of safeguarding national security. The certificates identify the personal data to which they apply by means of general

<P><I>15 Oct 2002 : Column 528W</I><P>
descriptions and are expressed to have prospective effect, in accordance with section 28 (3). The certificates are used in the context of any legal challenge to the application of the section 28 exemption, such as appeals brought before the Information Tribunal under section 28 (4) or 28 (6). There have been no appeals against the certificate in respect of SIS and there have been two against the certificate in respect of GCHQ, which are still extant.

[74657]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21015w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The current legislation under which passports are issued is the British Nationality Act 1981, as amended by the British Overseas Territories Act 2002.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21015w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The British Government has a treaty commitment to allow the US to use BIOT until at least 2016, and then for a further 20 years unless prior notice is given. We have told the Government of Mauritius that the Chagos Islands will be ceded to Mauritius when they are no longer required for defence purposes, subject to the requirements of international law.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what the Government's policy is on the claims of Mauritius and the Seychelles to the Chagos Archipelago of British Indian Ocean Territory.  [74192]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21015w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The British Government has sovereignty over the Chagos Islands. Mauritius is the only other state to have a claim to sovereignty. The British Government has told the Government of Mauritius that the Chagos Islands will be ceded to Mauritius when they are longer required for defence purposes, subject to the requirements of international law.

This extended the mandate of the UN's peacekeeping force in Western Sahara (MINURSO) until 31 January 2003. It underlined the validity of the Settlement Plan, which provided for a referendum on the future of Western Sahara, while noting the differences between the parties in its implementation. It supported the efforts of the Secretary General and his Personal Envoy to find a political solution to the dispute. The Council expressed its readiness to consider any approach that provided for self determination and urged the parties to cooperate fully with them.




<P>
<P><I>15 Oct 2002 : Column 530W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="21015w01.html_para2">The Fourth Committee of the General Assembly recently debated the question of Western Sahara and agreed a resolution by Consensus debated on 4 October 2002.

<P>
<a name="21015w01.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 I can add nothing to that which I gave my hon. Friend on 23 July 2002. It is a longstanding Government policy not to comment upon intelligence matters. As I said to my hon. Friend in the House on 23 July 2002, I am informed that after the bombing of Pan Am 103, all reports of PFLP-GC funding that emerged were investigated and none was found to have any connection to the Lockerbie attack.

Exercise of the Sharia penal code is, however, entirely under the control of the relevant States.

 A Tripartite Commission was set up under the auspices of the International Committee of the Red Cross to establish the whereabouts of Kuwaiti and other nationals still missing since the occupation of Kuwait. So far, the Iraqis have provided information sufficient to close only three files. 605 Kuwaiti and other nationals are still unaccounted for. Since January 1999 Iraq has refused to attend Tripartite Commission meetings, and has thereby effectively obstructed progress. The UK, along with other members of the Tripartite Commission, continue to meet regularly. Despite our and others' efforts to convince Iraq of the humanitarian nature of this issue, Iraq still refuses to co-operate with the process.

The final outturn for 1998&#150;1999 shown in the table was the same as the estimated figure contained in the HCDC Report. For the years 1999&#150;2000 onwards, we have obtained figures from Surgeon General's Department (SGD) (covering SGD and the four medical agencies), single Service Medical Directorates General, HQ British Forces Germany, the Institute of Naval Medicine and the Centre for Aviation Medicine. The budgets for primary care have been disaggregated down to unit level and these figures could therefore only be provided at disproportionate cost. Some historical figures cannot be provided as contemporary records are no longer available.

1. Expenditure for 1992&#150;1993 and 1993&#150;1994 cannot be provided since figures ceased to be published in the Statement on the Defence Estimates after 1991 when budgets were disaggregated and contemporary records are no longer available.<P>

2. Figures for 1994&#150;1995 and 1995&#150;1996 are the cost of the DMS estimated by Defence Cost Study 15(DCS15). The figures contained in the DCS15 report included primary care costs, estimated at #83.5 million for 1994&#150;1995 and #81.1 million for 1995&#150;1996. These have been removed here to allow accurate comparison with the figures for the subsequent years.<P>

3. Figures for 1996&#150;1997 to 2001&#150;2002 comprise the costs of the Surgeon General's Department and the four medical agencies (the Defence Secondary Care Agency, Defence Dental Agency, the Medical Supplies Agency and the Defence Medical Training Organisation), the single Service Medical Directorates General, the Institute of Naval Medicine, the Centre for Aviation Medicine and British Forces Germany. Except for British Forces Germany, the figures exclude primary care costs. Figures for Germany cover secondary care for Army and RAF personnel and primary care for Army personnel from 1996&#150;1997 to 2000&#150;2001 and both Army and remaining RAF personnel in 2001&#150;2002.<P>

4. Except where advised above, primary care costs cannot be provided without disproportionate effort as they are disaggregated and are embedded in individual units' budgets.<P>

5. It should be noted that although the Ministry of Defence has changed accounting systems to include full Resource Accounts in financial year 2001&#150;2002 (which include costs of fixed assets etc, not reported previously), the figures contained in the table have been adjusted to allow comparison with the previous years.<P>

 The Helsinki Headline Goal has been broken down into 144 capability targets, of which 104 had been met following the Capabilities Improvement Conference in November 2001. Of the 40 shortfalls, about half may be resolved by improved management of existing forces. For the rest, a European Capability Action Plan (ECAP) was launched after the conference, comprising multinational panels tasked with suggesting possible solutions. Where a permanent solution is not possible by the end of 2003, interim solutions should be addressed. The European Council in Laeken in December 2001 agreed that the European Union was now able to conduct some crisis management operations and would be in a position to take on progressively more demanding operations as the assets and capabilities at its disposal continue to develop. There is no intention to create a standing EU force: existing national or multinational forces will be made available to the EU on a case by case basis when required for an operation.

 Plutonium is the only fissile material produced in reactors.

Ministry of Defence has sufficient stocks of plutonium (as announced in SDR) to meet foreseeable needs. The UK supports the need for a Fissile Material Cut-off Treaty which would ban the production of fissile material for explosive purposes. Chapelcross MAGNOX reactors currently produce tritium for the national nuclear deterrent. BNFL has announced its decision to close Chapelcross by March 2005. Sufficient stocks of tritium are held to meet the needs of the Trident programme. Any decision on a replacement source of tritium, should one be required, will not need to be taken for many years.

It was considered that regular combat boots would be appropriate, given the expected temperatures, for the main exercise phase during the autumn. Temperatures were, however, significantly higher and a useful lesson learnt has been that for future deployments, in such temperatures, it would be appropriate for all troops to be issued with desert combat boots.

 The SA80 modification programme has significantly improved the reliability and performance of the weapon. Extensive trials were carried out in severe climatic conditions including the desert, the arctic and the jungle; these trials confirmed the newly modified weapon's superior capabilities. More recent trials and demonstrations in Afghanistan and Oman have established beyond doubt that the weapon is highly accurate, reliable, and that it can be effectively maintained in an operational environment.

 The European Security and Defence Policy seeks to strengthen Europe's military capabilities and to support the EU's Common Foreign and Security Policy, while enabling a better and more coherent European contribution to NATO. It gives the EU the ability to take military decisions, and to take control of crisis management operations where NATO as a whole is not engaged.

<P>
<a name="21015w08.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 In the last 12 months, approximately 28 per cent. of the food supplied to the armed forces by the Ministry of Defence's food supply contractor, ''3663,'' was purchased overseas. This figure includes foods that are not produced in this country and others that have to be purchased overseas for Service personnel serving abroad, due to export or customs restrictions. Of the food purchased for use in Operational Ration Packs only 14 per cent. is purchased overseas.

 139 out of a total of 140 Ministry of Defence properties in the constituency of Taunton were sold to Annington Homes Limited (AHL), as part of the sale and leaseback of Service Families' Accommodation in November 1996. 41 of these properties have since become surplus to requirements and been handed back to AHL. 99 properties are currently available for Service families. MOD has not arranged the demolition of any properties in Taunton. The future of properties released to AHL is a matter for that company.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what investigation was held into the death of Sapper Alfred Graham Manship of 26 Amphibious Regiment Royal Engineers in 1992 in Osnabruck, West Germany; how long the investigation took; when the investigation ended; who conducted the investigation; what the conclusion of the investigation was; and if he will make a statement.  [73822]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21015w08.html_spnew8"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The Special Investigation Branch of the Royal Military Police (SIB RMP) was responsible for investigating the death of Sapper Manship in Osnabruck, Germany, in 1992. The investigation began when the SIB RMP was informed of Sapper Manship's death in the early hours of Monday 6 April 1992 and was completed on 16 April 1992. The investigation was led by an experienced SIB RMP investigator of the rank of Staff Sergeant and, as for all SIB RMP inquiries, was overseen by the Officer Commanding the SIB RMP Detachment. The investigation concluded that there was no evidence to indicate foul play and that Sapper Manship had taken his own life.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what the period of time was between the discovery of the body of Sapper Alfred Graham Manship of 26 Amphibious Regiment Royal Engineers in 1992 in Osnabruck, West Germany and <i>(a)</i> a doctor being called to attend the scene and <i>(b)</i> a doctor arriving on the scene; and if he will make a statement. [73820]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21015w08.html_spnew9"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 Sapper Manship's body was discovered by another soldier at approximately 0237hrs on 6 April 1992. The emergency services were summoned and a doctor attended the scene at around 0255hrs. Sapper Manship was declared dead at the scene at 0258hrs.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence whether the weapon of Sapper Alfred Graham Manship of 26 Amphibious Regiment Royal Engineers was found to have been fired when examined after his death in 1992 in Osnabruck, West Germany; and if he will make a statement.  [73821]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21015w08.html_spnew10"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 Following the certification of death of Sapper (Spr) Manship, his weapon was recovered from the scene and handed to the Class 1 Armourer at 25 Regiment Royal Engineers for examination. The practice of submitting weapons subject to investigation to qualified personnel outside the unit in whose charge they are is standard for Royal Military Police (RMP) investigations.
<P>

<a name="21015w08.html_para6">In the statement recorded from the Armourer, he opined that the weapon was found to be serviceable and no faults could be discovered in its mechanical function. The Armourer did not make any specific reference to whether the weapon had been fired.
<P>

<a name="21015w08.html_para7">RMP enquiries established that Spr Manship had been issued with an SA80 Assault Rifle, plus 30 rounds of ammunition for his guard duty. The batch number of the spent ammunition recovered from the scene was found to be that of the ammunition issued to Spr Manship. In view of this, the location of the wound site, and all other enquiries conducted, the RMP investigating officer concluded that the submission of

<P>
<P>
<a name="21015w08.html_spnew11"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 Sapper Manship died on 6 April 1992 from a single gunshot wound to the head whilst on guard duty at Woolwich Barracks, Osnabruck, Germany. Following the subsequent Post Mortem Examination, Sapper Manship's body was repatriated to Scotland from Germany and the Procurator Fiscal was informed of the death. Under the legislation which allows for the holding of a Fatal Accident Inquiry, the Procurator Fiscal will only hold such an inquiry where the death occurred in Scotland or on an offshore installation, aircraft or ship. Since the death did not occur within Scotland, the Procurator Fiscal did not hold an inquiry in this case; this decision was not within the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Defence.

 The cost over the first five years since the closure of the site of clearing explosive ordnance has been in the region of #1.7 million. A further #371,000 has been spent on preparation of Land Quality Assessments and remediation.

 Each year all service personnel serving in Northern Ireland, including members of the Royal Irish Regiment, are reminded in unit orders of the Army's policy regarding participation in political activities and demonstrations.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21015w09.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 I believe that the structure you refer to is the temporary water tower on Slievebracken Mountain, Forkhill. It was not a surveillance tower. The Ministry of Defence has crown immunity with regard to planning permission and there was no consultation carried out with locally elected representatives or community organisations. As military personnel carried out the work on this temporary structure there were no costs involved other than those for the construction materials, the cost of irrecoverable items being estimated at some #3,500.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21015w09.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 There are no specific rules that govern the carriage of personal mobile phones by members of the Armed Forces on operational duties; and the use of personal mobile phones during deployments and operations is at the discretion of the local Commander. Joint Service Publication 440 details the regulations concerning the security classification of information that can be discussed on mobile phones. It also authorises commanders to prohibit the use of mobile phones on Ministry of Defence sites and in locations denoted as ''Hazardous Areas'' or in areas containing classified communications equipment. Additionally, although there are no specific sanctions for the misuse of mobile phones, commanders may restrict their use in a geographic location or for a specific period of time for operational reasons. The mechanism for enforcing this is through Theatre Standing Orders. Service personnel who fail to comply with published Standing Orders or with a lawful command would be subject to disciplinary action under normal disciplinary procedures, enforceable through Queen's Regulations.

 <i>[holding answer 17 July 2002]:</i> Monitoring of discharges is mainly the responsibility of the operator and so the majority of the costs of monitoring discharges from Windscale (which has been known as Sellafield since the early 1980s) would have fallen to BNFL and its predecessors. No information is held by the Department or by the Environment Agency about the costs of monitoring by operators.

 <i>[holding answer 19 July 2002]:</i> The Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) Regulations 1997 (as amended) include incentives for businesses to minimise the amount of packaging they use and actively encourage the reuse of packaging. Packaging which is being reused carries no obligation after its first obligated trip. By increasing the amount of packaging reused, producers are therefore able to reduce their costs of compliance. By placing a tonnage obligation on producers, the Regulations also encourage them to reduce the amount of packaging used.
<P>

<a name="21015w10.html_para7">In addition, the Packaging (Essential Requirements) Regulations 1997 include a requirement that packaging must be minimal subject to the safety and hygiene of the packed product to the consumer. The Regulations are enforced by local Trading Standards Officers, <i>and two examples of prosecution under these regulations are known to the Department</i>.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment has been made of the need for compulsory insurance as part of the EU Environmental Liability Directive regime to give polluters a greater incentive to avoid environmental damage.  [72493]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21015w11.html_spnew1"><B> Alun Michael </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 23 July 2002]:</i> The European Commission's draft Directive on Environmental Liability requires Member States to encourage the use by operators of any appropriate insurance or other forms of financial security.
<P>

<a name="21015w11.html_para1">Compulsory insurance is one possible means of financial security and was covered by the Government's public consultation which ended on 24 May 2002, and in the extended partial regulatory impact assessment (COM (02) 17). A mechanism such as this could support both the prevention and remediation aspects of the proposed Directive, with insurers offering policies on the basis of best environmental practice. It would also ensure that a source of funding was available for the remediation of damage, should it occur.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="21015w11.html_spnew2"><B> Alun Michael </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 23 July 2002]:</i> No specific assessment has been undertaken of the inclusion of the permit and state of the art exceptions. The extended partial regulatory impact assessment submitted to Parliament (COM (02) 17) did consider the implications of removal of the permit exception, to inform the UK negotiating position in preparation for any moves by other Member States to remove it.
<P>

<a name="21015w11.html_para3">This assessment revealed that removal of the permit exception could have two conflicting effects: a damaging effect upon business certainty and the ability of operators to obtain financing, whilst secondly providing an incentive for operators to treat permit conditions as a minimum requirement, and therefore take further precaution in their activities to minimise their risks.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what recent research her Department has evaluated regarding the spread of ragwort; and what action her Department has taken to <i>(a)</i> combat the spread of ragwort and <i>(b)</i> publicise knowledge of its spread.  [74397]<P>

<P>
<a name="21015w11.html_spnew3"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 In 2001, the former MAFF commissioned an ADAS research project to review ragwort and its control with particular reference to horses. This included a study of the factors influencing the spread of ragwort, such as changes in land use, changes in agricultural policy and climate change. The study confirmed that these factors may influence the spread of ragwort. However, it concluded that there was insufficient scientific data to allow evaluation of the extent to which the prevalence of ragwort had increased as as result of them.
<P>

<a name="21015w11.html_para5">Defra investigates complaints about the spread of ragwort and other injurious weeds covered by the Weeds Act 1959 where there is a threat to farmed land or land used for the keeping of horses as part of a diversified farm businesses. When a complaint is received the occupier of the land will be asked to take action to clear the weeds. If this fails to resolve the problem, Defra has statutory powers under the Weeds Act to arrange for the weeds to be cleared and to recover the cost from the occupier of the land. In the majority of cases, complaints about ragwort are resolved through co-operation and persuasion, without the need to take legal action.
<P>

<a name="21015w11.html_para6">The spread of ragwort along the sides of roads and on railway land is of particular concern to many people in the countryside. I have recently written to the Highways Agency, Local Government Association and Railtrack reminding them of the serious problems that can be caused by ragwort and urging them to ensure that they take effective clearance action.
<P>

<a name="21015w11.html_para7">This year we have also revised guidance on the Weeds Act and two updated Defra leaflets are available. ''The Weeds Act 1959&#151;Preventing the spread of harmful weeds'' gives general advice about the operation of the Weeds Act and ''The Weeds Act 1959&#151;Guidance note on the methods that can be used to control harmful weeds'' provides technical advice on the control of ragwort and other injurious weeds. Both leaflets can be found on the Defra website and hard copies can be obtained from Defra publications.

 The United Kingdom attaches high importance to the commitment to restore fish stocks and will be seeking to secure this by 2015 under the Common Fisheries Policy.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what ecological surveys have been conducted by <i>(a)</i> English Nature and <i>(b)</i> his Department in respect of the sites identified for development as asylum accomodation centres to determine the presence of protected species; if the Government will publish the reports; and what further plans the Government have to commission such surveys.

<P>
<a name="21015w12.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 I understand that there are Home Office proposals to build asylum seeker accommodation centres on surplus land at three sites; the Defence Storage and Distribution Centre near Bicester (Oxfordshire), RAF Newton (Nottinghamshire) and Throckmorton Airfield (near Pershore, Worcestershire).
<P>

<a name="21015w12.html_para0">It is not the Department's role, or English Nature's, to commission or undertake ecological surveys of potential development sites. As with any planning proposal, it will be for the relevant planning authority to ensure that potential impacts on protected species are identified and considered, including requiring the developer to undertake ecological surveys where appropriate.
<P>

<a name="21015w12.html_para1">English Nature's role is to provide advice to the planning authority and also to the developer on the nature conservation issues.

<a name="21015w12.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Government is committed to moving rapidly towards a more sustainable, competitive and diverse farming industry. Key to this is reform of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), where we want to phase out market price support and production controls, reduce direct payments and decouple them from production. We are also seeking to shift towards the CAP's ''second pillar'', expanding the opportunities available for targeted support for rural development and agri-environment schemes. In this context, we welcome the proposals brought forward by the Commission as part of the CAP mid-term reviews.
<P>

<a name="21015w12.html_para3">In England, the schemes covered by the England Rural Development Programme play a significant role in delivering the Government's objectives for sustainable production and land management, including those listed in the question. These schemes are the Environmentally Sensitive Areas Scheme, the Countryside Stewardship Scheme, the Organic Farming Scheme, the Hill Farm Allowance, the Woodland Grant Scheme, the Farm Woodland Premium Scheme, the Rural Enterprise Scheme, the Vocational Training Scheme, the Processing and Marketing Grant and the Energy Crops Scheme. The budget for the Programme is #1.6 billion over the period 2000&#150;2006. Similar schemes specific to Welsh needs operate within the Rural Development Plan for Wales, the total budget for which is #450 million over the same period.

 Data are available for England and Wales only on a quarterly basis. The level of farm bankruptcies and insolvencies tends to be in the order of a few hundred a year (as at June 2002 there were approximately 210,000 main and minor agricultural holdings1). The annual number of total insolvencies in the last five years (1997&#150;2001) was 240 which is nearly 40 per cent. lower than the average number in the previous 5 years (1992&#150;1996). In 2001, the total number of insolvencies rose by 14 per cent. Quarter 1 figures are available for 2002 and show a 9 per cent. increase over the same period for 2001.

<a name="21015w12.html_para9">In the Department of Health's ''National Suicide Prevention Strategy for England'', published in September 2002, farmers (and agricultural workers) are identified as a high risk occupational group. A suicide prevention strategy for England has been formulated by an expert advisory group through consultation with mental health professionals, researchers, survivors of suicide attempts, the voluntary sector, and others with relevant experience. The target is to reduce the death rate from suicide and undetermined injury by at least a fifth by the year 2010. The implementation plan will be the responsibility of the National Institute for Mental Health in England (NIMHE).

<a name="21015w13.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Common Agricultural Policy payments are made to producers and exporters on the basis of set eligibility criteria, regardless of whether they are from urban or rural areas. There are many traders in urban areas who receive CAP export subsidies. But by definition, the majority of recipients of direct production subsidy payments are from rural areas. Structural Funds are distributed on the basis of need: in the case of Objective 1 the criterion is an area whose population earns less than 75 per cent. of the EU average income. This applies equally between urban and rural areas.

 Flood management is a devolved responsibility. Records are kept of grant payments (and, for local authorities, supplementary credit approvals) made by this Department directly to the flood and coastal defence operating authorities (Environment Agency, local authorities and Internal Drainage Boards) in England only. They are recorded at the level of individual payments and payee (in the case of the EA this is at Flood Defence Committee level) and the project to which they relate. It is possible to group payments, to total expenditure on a particular project, for all local authorities or on coast protection schemes for example, where the Department's payments database supports this.
<P>

 The transhipment of fish stocks, subject to quota, between Community fishing vessels and receiving vessels has to be notified to the competent authorities of the Member States concerned in accordance with provisions of Article 11 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2847/93, as amended. Separately the Receiving of Trans-Shipped Sea Fish (Licensing) Order 1982, as amended, prohibit the trans-shipment of pelagic sea fish onto non-fishing vessels within British fishery limits unless the receiving vessel is licensed. For the purposes of this Order pelagic sea fish are defined as mackerel, herring, sprats, pilchards and horse mackerel. Additionally UK fishing vessel licences prohibit the transhipment of any fish between under 10 and over 10 metre vessels.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what recent estimate she has made of the size of the UK fishing workforce <i>(a)</i> within the fleet and <i>(b)</i> in dependent industries.  [73868]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21015w13.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The most recent information available on the numbers of fishermen in the United Kingdom are for the situation in 2000 as drawn from surveys carried out by the Sea Fisheries Inspectorate in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, and the Sea Fisheries Protection Agency in Scotland. The survey showed a total of 14,645 fishermen in the UK in 2001.
<P>

<a name="21015w13.html_para2">It is difficult to estimate the level of employment in dependent industries. This is due to it being difficult to define accurately which industries are involved, and in many cases these industries are not uniquely dependent on the fishing industry. The Department and the Sea Fish Industry Authority are currently jointly carrying out research into the relationship between jobs in fishing and jobs in the rest of the UK economy, with the results expected to be available within the next two to three months.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21015w13.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 At 30 June 2002 there were some 7020 licensed UK fishing vessels. Comprehensive information about the beneficial ownership of UK fishing vessels is no longer maintained. However it is estimated that some 117 vessels are wholly or partly foreign owned. A significant proportion of the fleet is nomadic and it is not practical to break down the above numbers in terms of ports of anchorage.

<P>
<a name="21015w13.html_wqn10"><B> Mr. Hayes: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what the total tonnage was of the <i>(a)</i> white water and <i>(b)</i> blue water fishing fleet of the UK in (i) 1972, (ii) 1997 and (iii) 2002; how many vessels there were; and how many personnel were employed at sea.  [73858]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21015w13.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The information requested, where available, is given in the table below. The white water fleet has been taken as those UK fishing vessels that are 10 metres or less in overall length, with the blue water fleet taken as those UK fishing vessels greater than 10 metres overall length. Data on the numbers of fishermen is not available in terms of type of vessel, only on the basis of those employed full time or part time, which is given in the table.
<P>

<a name="21015w13.html_para3">Available vessel data for 1972 are not comparable with data for later years. Statistics for the active fleet in 1972 understate the overall size of the fleet; the registered fleet exceeded the active fleet by about 3,000 vessels in 1990 when the earlier statistical series was replaced. Similarly, the basis used to measure the tonnage of vessels in 1972 (Gross Registered Tonnage) 



<P>
<P><I>15 Oct 2002 : Column 575W</I><P>
is not comparable with that used in later years (Gross Tonnage), and generally results in smaller estimates of the tonnage of vessels.

<a name="21015w14.html_para1">The Landfill Directive is due to ban the disposal of tyres to landfill from mid-2006 by which time alternative ways of handling those tyres currently landfilled will need to be in place. At present 30 per cent. of used tyres are landfilled. However, the Government is supporting a number of research and development studies aimed at developing end markets for used tyre products which should become commercially available before the ban comes into effect. We do not anticipate, therefore, an additional burden on local authorities.

 Tax is a matter for the Chancellor of the Exchequer and all parts of the tax system are kept under review as part of the Budget process. Cross departmental discussions on the tenancy related fiscal measures mentioned in the Policy Commission report on the Future of Farming and Food and the Plymouth University Report on the Agricultural Tenancies Act 1995 have taken place. Further discussions will take place as appropriate prior to the publication of the Government's strategy for sustainable food and farming in the autumn, which will include a full response to the Policy Commission recommendations.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21015w14.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The report of the Policy Commission on the Future of Farming and Food recommends that Defra should revisit the definition of agriculture used in tenancy legislation and suggests a broader definition might remove a potential obstacle to business development. The Government is keen to ensure that the legislative framework governing farm tenancy arrangements does not act as a barrier to tenant farmer participation in diversification activities. We are therefore considering this recommendation carefully and the conclusions reached will be made known in the autumn when the Government publishes its strategy for sustainable food and farming, incorporating a response to the Policy Commission's recommendations.

In July it was confirmed that the moth is now present in parts of Wimbledon. We have conducted a joint survey of the area and surrounding local Boroughs, and the Forestry Commission has placed baited pheromone traps at selected ports and towns in the south of England. So far the moth appears to be confined to the Wimbledon area but further spread is considered inevitable.

 The Physical Agents (Vibration) Directive is a health and safety measure which is designed to protect workers from diseases such as vibration white finger and back pain. The Directive was adopted by the Council of Ministers on 21 May 2002. The Health & Safety Executive (HSE) took the lead on behalf of the UK Government in negotiating the terms of the Directive.
<P>

<a name="21015w15.html_para6">The HSE carried out a Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) (including a cost/benefit anaysis) as soon as the German Presidency presented the proposal for this Directive in January 1999. The RIA considers the impact of the Directive on UK industry as a whole. 



<P>

This was updated in January 2001 after political agreement was reached in Council. Copies of the RIAs are available in the House of Commons Library.
<P>

<a name="21015w15.html_para7">The UK has played a leading role in maintaining the Common Position on the terms of the Directive in the face of more restrictive amendments proposed by the European Parliament. As a result the terms of the Directive should allow farm workers to use their tractors for at least 7 to 8 hours each day. Furthermore the provision allowing exposure to Whole Body Vibration (WBV) to be averaged over a 5 day period should allow one or two long days to be offset by low exposure on rest days. In addition the WBV exposure limit value for farmers will not come into effect until 2014&#151;12 years time. The long transitional period should allow equipment design to be improved and old equipment to be replaced.

 <i>[holding answer 19 July 2002]:</i> The Government has not sought any external advice on these matters. However, I am aware that the Bill's promoters sought legal advice on whether having a 30 per cent. improvement as a principal aim would have conferred a lesser obligation than a statutory duty to achieve this level of improvement, and whether it would have imposed any legal requirements on the Government to fund new obligations on local authorities.
<P>

<a name="21015w16.html_para0">We have received our own advice on the implications of having a 30 per cent. improvement in domestic energy efficiency as a principal aim in this Bill. These implications, including those for the Government and local authorities of any energy efficiency targets that the Secretary of State might set, how targets might be achieved, any constraints this might place on local authorities and the potential role of other energy efficiency programmes, have, of course, been discussed with other Government Departments. The Government is committed to funding fully the cost of any new obligations placed on local authorities, although this is not a legal obligation.
<P>

<a name="21015w16.html_para1">The Department has also received correspondence setting out a wide range of views on this and other aspects of the Bill, including from the Local Government Association, local authorities, trade associations, energy efficiency and fuel poverty groups and members of he public.

 Most of the Resolution's proposals are already covered by existing UK legislation, including the Radioactive Substances Act 1993 (as amended) and the lonising Radiations Regulations 1999. Many of the measures proposed in the Resolution are mirrored in the draft Euratom High Activity Sealed Sources Directive, which is currently being negotiated.

 The business requirement for an interactive data input and editing system has been included within the scope of the HM Customs and Excise e-Business Programme, to simplify the current technology and business processes. It represents better value for money for government while ensuring that businesses, including those involved in intra-Community trade, are offered simpler and more convenient ways to transact.

<a name="21015w18.html_spnew8"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 At the G8 Summit, in June, progress was made towards a more coherent approach to tackling global poverty. In particular, members welcomed the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD). The G8 undertook to establish enhanced partnerships with African countries whose performance reflects the NEPAD commitments. This will focus efforts on countries that demonstrate a political and financial commitment to good governance and the rule of law, investing in their people, and pursuing policies that spur economic growth and alleviate poverty. The G8 will match African countries' commitment by promoting peace and security in Africa, boosting expertise and capacity, encouraging trade and direct growth-oriented investment, and providing more effective official development assistance. In addition, the G7 agreed in June to contribute their share of an extra $1 billion to finance the shortfall in the HIPC initiative.
<P>

<a name="21015w18.html_para5">At the Annual Meetings of the IMF and World Bank in September, further progress was made. In particular, the IMF reaffirmed its role in helping poor countries address the challenge of meeting the Millennium Development Goals by supporting economic reforms aimed at accelerating growth and reducing poverty. The Fund recognised that there may be a need to consider mobilising new resources if high demand for concessional financing continues, and stressed the importance of sound macroeconomic frameworks that can respond flexibly to changes in the external environment; identifying ways to encourage higher and sustainable growth; good governance; improving public expenditure and financial management systems; and using poverty and social impact analysis more systematically, and building country capacity in this area. In addition, the Bank and Fund reaffirmed the commitment to implement the HIPC initiative and finance it fully to help countries overcome the burden of unsustainable debt.

<a name="21015w18.html_para6">At the Development Committee meeting of the World Bank, commitments were made towards better coordination and cooperation amongst development partners and by effective alignment of donor support with country strategies.

<a name="21015w18.html_para7">Improving tenure security and access to land through appropriate land reform is a key element of the World Bank's Rural Development Strategy. Secure tenure and shelter for the poor are also important components of the Bank's urban programmes. The Bank is supporting land reforms in Latin America; throughout Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union; and in Asia, efforts appear to have been generally most effective in relation to poverty reduction. The Bank is preparing to re-engage with land reform in Africa (Ghana, Malawi, Niger, South Africa and Uganda).

<a name="21015w18.html_para8">The Department for International Development (DFID) is actively engaged with the World Bank in Africa to improve the effectiveness of Bank operations in land reform. In the other regions DFID seeks to support and improve the impact of World Bank interventions at policy level and through complementary support to development partners. The Bank is in the final stages of completing a major review of its work on land reform, to be captured in a Policy Research Report. DFID have contributed to the process, seeking to strengthen the linkage of Bank lending for land reform with improved livelihood opportunities for the poor and with nationally owned poverty reduction strategies.

 The government has made a commitment to reduce the number of children in low-income households by at least a quarter by 2004, as a contribution towards the broader target of halving child poverty by 2010 and eradicating it by 2020.

 The Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise ''STEPS'' competition was announced in August 1998. The two Departments' contract with the Mapeley consortium was signed on 6 March 2001 after a full procurement exercise.
<P>

<a name="21015w20.html_para1">A joint Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise press release dated 9 March 2001 inadvertently referred to assets being transferred to Mapeley Ltd, a UK registered company, rather than Mapeley STEPS Ltd which is registered in Bermuda. Subsequently, a separate press statement has corrected this. Ministers were not aware of the registration of Mapeley STEPS Ltd at the time of the March 2001 press notice.
<P>

<a name="21015w20.html_para2">The STEPS contract with the Mapeley consortium provided for the payment of #220 million to the Departments together with a further #150 million to be reflected in lower service prices.

However, the competition to establish which bidder offered best value for money included rigorous examination of all factors relevant under the appropriate UK and European rules. By convention, the tax affairs of individual companies are not disclosed to Ministers. No separate assessment has been made of the effect of the tax status of Mapeley STEPS Ltd.

 For the number in receipt of the working families' tax credit, I refer my hon. Friend to my answer to my hon. Friend the Member for Jarrow (Mr. Hepburn) on 16 January 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, column 293W. Information about the children's tax credit (CTC) is not available by constituency.

 Poverty is a complex multi-dimensional issue, affecting many aspects of children's lives&#151;including income, health, housing, the quality of their environment and opportunities to learn. There is therefore no single measure of the number of families with children that have moved out of poverty in the Paisley North constituency.

 My hon. Friend, the Minister of State for e-Commerce and Competitiveness at the Department of Trade & Industry announced on 26 June the letting of framework agreements by the Office of Government Commerce (OGC) to enable the public sector to buy broadband services more effectively; and the setting up of a Regional Broadband Unit.
<P>

<a name="21015w22.html_para6">The frameworks procurement is underway and contracts are expected to be awarded next spring. The Regional Broadband Unit will be operational in November 2002. As part of the Unit, an OGC team will provide procurement assistance to the public sector. In addition, a DTI team of regional broadband advisors will ensure that public sector broadband procurement has the maximum impact on regional economic development.

 Innovations in the financial services industry are providing new products and varied delivery channels to increase consumer choice in banking services. However, specific groups can still be vulnerable to financial exclusion and that is why the Government is involved in a number of initiatives aimed at increasing access to financial services. Rural areas in particular should benefit from a programme of work to deliver banking services through the Post Office. A number of banks already have agency agreements with the Post Office, allowing their customers to withdraw cash and make deposits at post offices&#151;an extension of the coverage of banks and services provided is planned. The development of universal banking services at the Post Office, from April 2003, will also significantly increase the accessibility of banking services.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21015w25.html_spnew1"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 The most recent estimate of loss in revenue to the Exchequer resulting from the duty rebate given to ''red diesel'' is approximately #3.3 billion in each of the past three years, based on the difference between the duty rate for rebated gas oil and that for heavy oil used as a road fuel. Such estimates for kerosene currently do not exist.
<P>

<a name="21015w25.html_para1">The estimates for red diesel represent the maximum cost to the Exchequer since they do not allow for a reduction in demand that might be expected if the full duty rate were levied on red diesel.
<P>

<a name="21015w25.html_para2">It is our policy to review rebates and reduced rates as part of the Budget process. In making his judgment, the Chancellor of the Exchequer will consider all relevant economic, social and environmental factors.

 The Government's papers, ''A New Future for Communications'' published in December 2000, and ''Consultation on Media Ownership Rules'' published in November 2001, confirmed that we planned to bring forward legislation to allow religious bodies to hold a local digital sound programme licence. Both papers invited further views on whether the restrictions on ownership of other terrestrial licences by religious bodies should be relaxed. We received approximately 14,500 (6,500 and 8,000 respectively) responses from MPs, organisations and members of public, virtually all of which, broadly supported the lifting of the current restrictions.

 We have encouraged the gambling industry to support the charitable trust which it has established with a remit to fund both research into problem gambling and services for its treatment. The trust has already made good progress towards the target of #3m a year which was proposed by the Gambling Review Body; and my officials have been helping the trust to develop a sound strategy for improving prevention and treatment provision. Looking ahead, we have also made clear our intention to include in legislation to reform and modernise the regulation of gambling in Great Britain both: <i>(a)</i> reserve powers to require licensed gambling operators to fund this work; and <i>(b)</i> an obligation on them in any event to comply with a code of practice on social responsibility, to be published by the new Gambling Commission when established. We intend that one of the Commission's duties should be to keep the regulatory requirements under review in the light of evidence about problem gambling and to consider whether adjustments may be required accordingly.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21015w26.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 Under the Charities Act 1993, sports clubs which are set up as charitable industrial and provident societies are considered to be exempt charities and are therefore unable to register with the Charity Commission. However, charitable industrial and provident societies are already eligible for the tax advantages of charitable status without having to register with the Commission.
<P>

<a name="21015w26.html_para2">It is possible to set up an industrial and provident society as a non-charitable organisation and clubs which have chosen to do this would be eligible to register with the Charity Commission as community amateur sports clubs with charitable status.

We remain committed to the introduction of preserved rights to the ARC concession for existing beneficiaries, when the social mix or the level of warden cover in their sheltered housing change, and we intend to bring forward amending regulations as soon as we can. However, it is important that in doing so we do not create any new anomalies or unnecessary administrative burdens.

 Magistrates' Courts Committees have a responsibility for the collection of a range of debts imposed by Magistrates' courts and the Crown Court, as well as other agencies. Debt collected includes not only fines, but also fees, compensation, confiscation orders, legal aid contributions and some maintenance orders. It is not possible to separate out only fines from the total, nor those imposed by Magistrates' courts and still outstanding.
<P>

<a name="21015w27.html_para6">The total ''arrears'' of debt at 31 March 2002 (which relates to England and Wales) was #246 million. However, most fines are paid by instalment, by agreement with the court, while the ''arrears'' figure reflects the fact that technically all of a debt is due immediately, whether or not an instalment order has been made.

 The Office for the Supervision of Solicitors (OSS), the Law Society's complaints handling wing, is already subject to independent scrutiny by the Legal Services Ombudsman. The Lord Chancellor has no current plans to instigate a further review of complaints handling, however he has warned the OSS that unless swift and substantive improvements are made across the board, he will not hesitate to implement his reserve powers which allow for the establishment of a Legal Services Complaints Commissioner. In addition, he has announced recently a review of the framework for regulating legal services. The first step in the review will be to decide what it should cover in terms of services and providers and what issues it should address.

 My noble and learned Friend the Lord Chancellor, issued a Consultation Paper, ''In the public interest?'', in July, seeking evidence to enable the Lord Chancellor's Department to address concerns expressed in the Office of Fair Trading Report, ''Competition in Professions''. The Lord Chancellor keeps the detailed selection process for appointment of Queen's Counsel under constant review and has introduced a range of recent changes to improve the openness and accountability of the system.

 Of the complaints received the most common theme was delay. The PGO has, in the course of major restructuring, and a move out of central London, lost a large number of experienced staff. It is now taking steps to restore service levels, including: a local recruitment campaign, intensive training courses, re-siting of case files adjacent to case work teams, a reconfiguration of the new telephone system and the introduction gradually of an electronic records management system to replace the largely paper based one.

 I assume that my hon.

The joint paper was attached to the second part of the United Kingdom's response to the European Commission's questionnaire to Member States' Governments about the implementation of the Directive. The first part of the Government's response was submitted to the Commission on 14 June. I am placing copies of both parts of the response, including the joint paper, in the Library.
<P>

<a name="21015w28.html_para2">It would be difficult to identify which Member State was responsible for making a particular proposal, since initial proposals were often significantly amended in the course of discussion. Moreover, identifying the source of the proposals would be inconsistent with the accepted convention that one Member State should not reveal another Member State's negotiating position.
<P>

<a name="21015w28.html_para3">The responses to the Commission's questionnaire will inform the report that the Commission are preparing on the implementation of the Directive. The Government hopes that, in preparing their report, the Commission will give serious consideration to the United Kingdom's response, including the joint paper. I understand that the Commission's present objective is to produce the report by about the turn of the year.

 There is an on-going programme of training for all staff in the Disability and Carers Service, which includes a one-day module on Disability Awareness encompassing a range of disability issues, including deaf awareness, together with two specialist one-day modules for Decision Makers covering Mental Health and Learning Disability issues. There is a commitment to review the scope of the Programme with a view to extending the specialist modules for Decision Makers to other impairments in due course.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions if he will make it the policy of his Department to ensure that every deaf person who needs assistance with completing a disability living allowance or attendance allowance claim form and who cannot access the telephone form completion service is entitled to a home visit instead.

 The Disability and Carer's Service policy, in accordance with the Disability Discrimination Act 1995, ensures accessibility of information for all disabled people. If a deaf person requires help to complete a benefit claim form for Disability Living Allowance or Attendance Allowance and cannot use the telephone forms completion service, which includes text phone facilities, we would arrange an interview with the appropriate interpreter present. The interview could take place at the nearest Social Security office but, if this presents difficulties for the customer, we could arrange for it to take place at home.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions for what reason disability living allowance and carers allowance are not available to the parents of children with nut allergies.  [73901]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21015w30.html_spnew2"><B> Maria Eagle: </B> 
 Children with nut allergies are not precluded from entitlement to Disability Living Allowance, and neither are their parents precluded from receiving Invalid Care Allowance for looking after them. But they must meet the usual qualifying conditions for the benefits. For Invalid Care allowance this means that the carer must not be engaged in full-time paid employment and must provide regular and substantial care for a least 35 hours per week to a severely disabled person receiving either the middle or highest rate of the Disability Living Allowance care component. To qualify for that component, a severely disabled child must have a need for attention, supervision or watching over by another person which is substantially in excess of the needs of an able-bodied child of the same age.

<P>
<a name="21015w30.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. McCartney: </B> 
 Women born between 6 July 1950 and 5 October 1950 will attain state pension age after 6 April 2010, and will therefore be able to pass on up to 50 per cent. of their SERPS.
<P>

<a name="21015w30.html_para0">This is because their state pension age is over 60 as part of the equalisation of state pension age.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21015w30.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Nicholas Brown: </B> 
 We have reformed Incapacity Benefit (IB) and Severe Disablement Allowance (SDA) in order to provide more support to young people disabled early in life who have never had the opportunity to work.
<P>

<a name="21015w30.html_para1">From 6 April 2001 young people whose incapacity begins before the age of 20 (or 25 for those continuing in education until age 20) may qualify for IB even if they have not satisfied the contribution conditions. Existing SDA recipients under the age of 20 on 6 April 2001 were automatically transferred to long-term IB in April 2002. We estimate that around 175,000 young people will benefit from the change over time.
<P>

<a name="21015w30.html_para2">Depending on their circumstances people receiving IB can qualify for help with the cost of NHS treatment on the grounds of low income. They may also be entitled to 



<P>

Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit. Social Fund crisis loans are available to people who are without resources, irrespective of their benefit status, to prevent serious damage or risk to health or safety in the event of an emergency or a disaster. A variety of local government schemes and benefits are also available to people on low incomes. Details of these schemes are not held centrally.
<P>

<a name="21015w30.html_para3"><P>

<a name="21015w30.html_para4">We recognise that some young people who transfer from SDA to IB will no longer have automatic entitlement to this help but many in this group will already be considerably better off as a result of the changes we have introduced and it would be unfair to treat these people differently to other IB recipients.

 We set ourselves a firm Public Service Agreement target to make a 10 per cent. reduction in the level of fraud and error in Income Support and Jobseeker's Allowance by March 2002. By September 2001 we had achieved a 24 per cent. reduction&#151;more than double the target.
<P>

<a name="21015w30.html_para7">We have now announced an increase in our target for reducing fraud and error in Income Support and Jobseeker's Allowance for working age customers by March 2004, from 25 per cent. to 33 per cent., and we maintain our longer-term commitment to a 50 per cent. reduction by March 2006. We have also announced a new target of a 25 per cent. reduction in fraud and error in Housing Benefit by 2006.
<P>

<a name="21015w30.html_para8">In April we introduced a range of measures using powers taken in the Fraud Act 2001 which will help us tackle fraudsters. For example, investigators can now request information from banks and utilities to find evidence of fraud and they have stronger powers to tackle employers who collude with their staff to defraud the benefit system. We now also have the power to remove benefits from those people who persistently abuse the system.
<P>

<a name="21015w30.html_para9">These new powers will help us continue our fight to make sure that the right benefits go to the right people. They are also sending out the clear message to fraudsters that they will not get away with it.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21015w32.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. McCartney: </B> 
 Compulsion already exists in the pensions system. Most employees employed people are required to contribute to the Basic State Pension and, in the case of employees, to the State Second Pension unless they are contributing to a private pension and are contracted out of the state scheme.
<P>

<a name="21015w32.html_para4">We recognise the role pension providers play in encouraging individuals to save for a pension. The UK has a tradition of voluntary pension provision by employers and the implications of moving away from that would have to be considered fully before such a step was taken. We continue to believe that the best route for pension saving is via the employer and with the introduction of stakeholder pensions most employees have access to a good value pension at the workplace.

The changes were publicised through a press release issued by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to the media in relevant countries in Europe. In addition, we have taken steps to ensure that this information is available on the Department's website and in the new edition ot the Winter Fuel Payment leaflet, and have issued a factsheet to embassies in those countries affected. We will also be writing to people who have contacted the European Commission, claimed or recently enquired about Winter Fuel Payment for people who have moved to another EEA country or to Switzerland.

 We have been successful in encouraging employers to support and participate in the New Deal. Over 99,000 employers have signed up to the New Deal and many more have taken on New Deal participants without signing up for the programme.
<P>

<a name="21015w33.html_para2">We recognise the central role employers have to play in achieving our goal of creating and sustaining employment opportunities for all, and we are continually seeking to involve employers even further in the New Deal.
<P>

<a name="21015w33.html_para3">This year we have taken steps to improve the flexibility of the New Deal to encourage employers to recruit more participants. For example, we have given employers more flexibility in the training they provide for New Deal clients. Employers can now give New Deal clients their own in-house training instead of having to offer external training which may not meet the needs of the job. Later this year we will be introducing ''Recruit'' into the New Deal for Young People. This will give small employers more payment flexibility in the Employment Option.

<a name="21015w34.html_spnew0"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 At the Summit in Kananaskis, last July, the G8 leaders reaffirmed their commitment to ensuring the full financing of the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative. The G8 agreed to provide their share of up to an additional US$1 billion for the HIPC Trust Fund. This will help meet the current shortfall in the financing of the Initiative, and ensure that those countries whose debt positions have worsened because of the global economic slowdown and falls in commodity prices will get enough debt relief to enable them to exit the HIPC process with sustainable levels of debt.
<P>

<a name="21015w34.html_para0">At the Annual Meetings of the World Bank and the IMF held at the end of last month in Washington, the international community welcomed the continued progress made on the HIPC Initiative, and reconfirmed their commitment to its implementation and full financing. Some donors, including the UK took the opportunity to pledge their firm support for the HIPC Trust Fund. The UK announced a bilateral contribution of US$95 million plus its share of any EDF contribution to the Trust Fund. This is in addition to the US$306 million which we have already committed. Germany are contributing US$100 million and Sweden US$21 million. The US are considering a contribution of US$230 million, many other countries said they would announce their contributions later this month.

This places burdens on developing country administrations coping with the different demands and procedures of different aid delivery mechanisms.

<a name="21015w34.html_para2">A major outcome of WSSD is that it reaffirmed many of the commitments made at recent global conferences, including New York, Doha and Monterrey. In particular the text agreed at WSSD endorsed the Doha commitment on issues to be considered in the new trade round. This sends a strong signal for the need to reduce perverse subsidies (such as agricultural subsidies) as well as other obstacles to development such as high tariffs, tariff peaks and tariff escalation.

 At the recent World Summit on Sustainable Development, participants reaffirmed their commitment to reducing the debt burden of the poorest most indebted countries. The Summit supported the Monterrey Consensus on external debt, recognising the need for the speedy implementation of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative and the full financing of the HIPC Trust Fund to help the Multilateral Development Banks meet their share of HIPC costs. Since then, at the Annual Meetings of the World Bank and IMF, Ministers stressed the urgency of meeting the financing shortfall, which could be up to US$1 billion, and called on donor countries to make firm pledges and contributions as soon as possible. Savings from debt relief are used towards the financing for the poverty reduction strategies that HIPC countries are developing with civil society and donors. However, debt relief alone, no matter how generous, cannot ensure that the Millennium Development Goals will be met. This will require substantial additional donor resources as well as other measures, such as improvement of health through the Global Fund to combat HIV/AIDS, TB and Malaria, increasing the availability of education through higher quality and quantity of spending, and trade reform.

<a name="21015w34.html_spnew4"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 The World Summit on Sustainable Development placed poverty eradication at the heart of efforts to achieve sustainable development. The central focus of this Government's policy on international development, first set out in the White Paper on International Development in 1997 and reaffirmed in the second White Paper in 2000, is a commitment to the internationally agreed target to halve the proportion of people living in extreme poverty by 2015, together with the associated targets including those relating to water and sanitation.
<P>

<a name="21015w34.html_para3">My Department's strategies for achieving the international development targets in the water sector are set out in the March 2001 paper ''Addressing the Water Crisis&#151;healthier and more productive lives for poor people''. DFID has been at the forefront of efforts to promote international acceptance of the new sanitation target agreed internationally at the World Summit on Sustainable Development. Better management of water resources, access to safe water and basic sanitation with hygiene promotion are key contributors to poverty reduction and other development objectives.

 The Plan of Implementation agreed at the World summit on Sustainable Development provided a strong reaffirmation of the agreement on a ''development agenda'' at the 4 Ministerial Conference of the WTO at Doha, Qatar. The commitments made in Doha and again at the WSSD can potentially generate significant benefits for developing countries. The Ministerial resulted in an agreement on the need to reduce (with a view to phasing out) subsidies and barriers to trade in agriculture. Agreement was also reached on continuing negotiations on service and commitment to tackle tariff peaks, high tariffs and tariff escalation as well as non-tariff barriers to manufactured goods. The declaration on TRIPS recognised the need for a flexible interpretation of TRIPS to enable developing countries to protect public health during crises such as the HIV/AIDS pandemic Southern Africa.
<P>

<a name="21015w34.html_para4">The outcome of Doha represents a real achievement for developing country negotiators. As a recent joint paper on Market Access by the World Bank and IMF points out, estimates of the welfare gains from eliminating barriers to merchandise trade, range between $250 billion and $620 billion annually with about one-third to one-half accruing to developing countries. This is several times what developing countries receive in development assistance.
<P>

<a name="21015w34.html_para5">However, this is not yet a Development Round &#150; it is a development agenda and is only the beginning of negotiations. To make it a real Development Round we will need to work to ensure that these commitments made become a reality.

 Latest forecasts from the World Bank suggest that globally, meeting the Millennium Development Goal of halving the proportion of people living in extreme poverty by 2015 is attainable. There has been progress. The proportion of people living on less than $1 a day in the developing world fell from 29 per cent. in 1990, to 23 per cent. in 1999.

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development, pursuant to the letter to the hon. Member for Linlithgow of 25 February, what discussions she has had with the Pan African Tsetse and Trypanosomiasis Campaign, the FAO and the Inter-African Bureau of Animal Resources on Tsetse control and eradication programmes; and if she will make a statement.  [74194]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21015w36.html_spnew3"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 On 9 and 10 September 2002, DFID hosted a meeting in Edinburgh under the aegis of its Animal Heath Research Programme, entitled ''Tsetse Control&#151;the Next 100 Years''. The meeting brought together representatives of over thirty stakeholder organisations to the Pan African Tsetse and Trypanosomiasis Eradication Campaign (PATTEC), including DFID, senior officials of the Inter-African Bureau of Animal Resources, the International Atomic Energy Agency, the wider research community, the European Commission and PATTEC itself.
<P>

<a name="21015w36.html_para2">The Regional Co-ordinator of PATTEC, Dr. John Kabayo, has asked to meet DFID's Chief Natural Resources Adviser when he is next in London. Apart from this we are not aware of any formal request from PATTEC to hold discussions with bilateral donors, although we have made it clear that we would be pleased to discuss the campaign's preliminary proposals at a technical level.




<P>
<P><I>15 Oct 2002 : Column 661W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="21015w36.html_para3">DFID is in regular dialogue with the FAO's Animal Production and Health Division and with the Inter-African Bureau of Animal Resources through our ongoing programmes of support to those organisations. Neither has substantively raised the issue of PATTEC with us.
<P>

<a name="21015w36.html_para4">We remain unconvinced that the scientific and economic theories for the eradication of tsetse flies from Africa on which PATTEC's original proposals were founded are yet proven. Our view is that efforts should focus on tsetse and trypanosomiasis control rather than eradication for the foreseeable future. This is consistent with the consensus of the Edinburgh meeting and more recent statements by the Programme Against African Trypanosomiasis (PAAT) and by PATTEC.

 The principal UN agencies working in Iraq with the Oil for Food Programme are UNDP, UNICEF, UNOPS, WFP, WHO, UNESCO, UNOCHI, UNHCR, FAO, UNIDO and Habitat. My Department does not give any of these agencies earmarked funding for their Iraq programmes, but supports most of them globally.

 On 4 September, Robin Jeffrey, the Chairman of BE informed me that the company was considering whether or not it could continue to meet its obligations and sought to initiate discussions over possible funding. On 5 September BE announced that it had initiated discussions with the Government about possible immediate financial support and to enable a longer term restructuring to take place. My Department issued a separate statement on that day confirming that these discussions had started. BE's statement also said that if discussions over financial support were not successful

''the company may be unable to meet its financial obligations as they fall due and therefore the company may have to take appropriate insolvency proceedings''.

<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="21015w38.html_para1">The Government's overriding objectives are to ensure the safety of BE's nuclear plant and security of electricity supplies while protecting the interests of the taxpayer. My assessment was that immediate and sudden insolvency proceedings could pose a serious risk to nuclear safety and security of supply. It is essential for the safe operation of BE's nuclear power stations that the company has access to sufficient resources for it to fulfil its obligations under the nuclear, environmental and commercial regulatory regimes under which it operates. We have also been in discussions with the industry regulator, Ofgem about the risks that an unplanned shut-down of BE's plant may pose to security of supply.
<P>

<a name="21015w38.html_para2">Having regard to nuclear safety and security of supply, I decided with the agreement of the Treasury to provide BE on 9 September with a loan of up to #410 million in respect of its working capital requirements and cash collateral for trading in the UK and North America. This was a short-term loan, for the period until 27 September pending clarification of the company's financial position. No commitment was given about support beyond that period.
<P>

<a name="21015w38.html_para3">During that initial period it became clear that it would not be possible to have a full understanding in detail of the company's position in a way that would enable choices to be made about future restructuring options. Following discussions with the company and its advisers, and in agreement with the Treasury, on 26 September I announced an extension to the loan, now increased in value up to a maximum of #650 million. The loan has been extended until 29 November in order to give sufficient time to clarify the company's full financial position and to come to a clear view on the future options for the company.

<P>

<a name="21015w38.html_para4">In agreeing and extending the loan I have sought to build in the greatest safeguards to the taxpayer. The loan is cross-guaranteed by the BE group as a whole, and is backed by security given by BE plc and its principal subsidiaries. In administering the loan we have set out strict criteria and operational arrangements which are being managed by our accountancy advisers, Deloitte and Touche.
<P>

<a name="21015w38.html_para5">In view of the urgency in this case, we have sought and obtained from HM Treasury a Contingencies Fund advance of #500 million to finance the loan, and subsequently a further advance of #150 million to fund the extension of the support. It is my intention to seek Parliamentary approval for the loan through a Winter Supplementary Estimate in order to provide the authority for this loan and hence repay the Contingencies Fund. It was not possible to give the House advance warning of the need to use the Contingencies Fund. The case was urgent and I judged it would clearly be contrary to the public interest to delay expenditure until Parliamentary approval to the Supplementary Estimate could be given, in view of the risks that immediate and sudden insolvency posed to nuclear safety and security of supply. The urgent need for the loan and extension were, however, communicated to the Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee.
<P>

<a name="21015w38.html_para6">These arrangements have been given in compliance with the European Commission rules on Rescue and Restructuring aid and have been notified to the European Commission as rescue aid.

<a name="21015w39.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 The Government is currently consulting UK business, unions and others on the impact of the proposed directive. We remain concerned that, as currently drafted the proposed directive would impose disproportionate cost and administrative burdens on business, and would reduce routes into employment for many workers. Our initial estimate of the cost to user undertakings of the proposed Temporary [Agency] Workers Directive, as currently drafted, is in the range from #250 million to #402 million, as stated in the Regulatory Impact Assessment, which is available in the Libraries of the Houses. It is estimated that 21 per cent. of these costs would be borne by the public sector and 79 per cent. by the private sector. In addition, it is estimated that there are costs in the range of #80 million to #194 million which would be borne by private sector employment agencies.

 Total electricity generation from renewables and wastes in 2001 amounted to 10,099 GWh, 38 per cent. of which was from large scale hydro generation. Large scale hydro generation was 21 per cent. lower than in 2000 because of a low level of precipitation in the catchment areas, especially in winter 2000&#150;01. As a result, renewable sources provided 2.6 per cent. of the electricity generated in the United

<P>
<a name="21015w39.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 As I explained in introducing the Renewables Obligation Order 2002 on 6 March, (Third Standing Committee on Delegated Legislation, column 4), prospects of achieving a level of 5 per cent. by the end of 2003&#151;a date proposed in a 1999 DTI consultation document&#151;have been heavily dependent on the pace of new commissioning of projects awarded contracts under the Non Fossil Fuel Obligation (NFFO) and the comparable arrangements for Scotland. In practice, even with the Government's action to allow locational flexibility for NFFO contracts, the pace of new commissioning has been somewhat slower than had been hoped. As I said in March, the indications are that the target of a 5 per cent. contribution from renewables to electricity supplies will be delivered late.
<P>

<a name="21015w39.html_para7">The Renewables Obligation, which came into effect from 1 April 2002, introduces new arrangements to ensure the long-term expansion of renewable energy in the UK. The Obligation is set to run for twenty-five years, and will provide an incentive for renewable energy expected to rise to some #1 billion per year by 2010&#150;11. It is backed by #260 million direct Government support for renewables over the next three years. The Obligation is set at increasing levels for successive years, rising from 3 per cent. for 2002&#150;3 to 10.4 per cent. for 2010&#150;11. The level of the Renewables Obligation is 4.9 per cent. for 2004&#150;5 and 5.5 per cent. for 2005&#150;6.

 Every electricity system has to have some spare capacity to deal with peaks and troughs in demand.

<a name="21015w40.html_para1">The consultants employed by the PIU found that, as a rough rule of thumb, while the share of electricity supplies contributed by intermittents (for example, wind energy) remained below about 5 per cent., the system costs would be insignificant.

 Although the debate on the future of European cohesion policy post-2006 has already started, very few national governments have so far committed themselves to a particular position. The Government intends to play a full part in this debate and we will shortly be launching a consultation to inform our position.
<P>

<a name="21015w40.html_para14">The debate has to be seen in the context of the Government's objective to improve regional and national economic performance. Following the 2002 spending review, the Government agreed a new focus for regional policy: to improve the economic performance of all regions and over the long term to reduce the persistent gaps in growth rates between them. The Government is committed to pursuing the necessary policies to achieve this target.
<P>

<a name="21015w40.html_para15">A key issue informing the Government's position in the debate will be the added value of the Structural Funds i.e. the extent to which this source of funding has delivered benefits over and beyond those which could have been achieved through national measures. We are collaborating with other Departments and the Devolved Administrations on research into this and other issues.
<P>

<a name="21015w40.html_para16">Cohesion policy has always been focused on the poorest parts of the EU and the forthcoming enlargement will therefore require a fundamental review of the policy and its application. It is clear that in future there must continue to be transfers from the richer states to the poorer, and in particular to the candidates currently negotiating for accession. However, it is too early to draw any conclusions about the overall size of the Structural Funds budget, the priorities it should address or the future distribution of the Funds amongst the Member States.

 As the White Paper explains, on current estimates the total undiscounted cost of cleaning up the nuclear legacy is some #48 billion. Of this figure, 43 per cent. is the projected cost associated with decommissioning, and 47 per cent. is the projected cost associated with the processing, storage and final disposal of waste and the environmental restoration of radioactively contaminated land.

 Post Office Ltd will take forward an urban network restructuring programme whose objective will be to ensure that subpostmasters have the opportunity to build a viable business as well as to provide modernised and improved facilities which meet customers' needs and expectations and are in the right location for the local community. The programme will involve a significant number of urban post office closures over the next three years, but it is not yet known precisely how many. In rural areas, the Government has committed that there should be no avoidable post office closures before at least 2006. There has been a sharp fall in the number of rural closures.

 After 2005, as now, I expect gas to be supplied to the UK market by private companies operating in a competitive market. Government's role is to work with industry through PILOT to maximise the economic benefit to the UK of its own oil and gas resources, and with the Governments of exporting countries to set a political framework to facilitate commercial agreements between companies in the UK and in other countries. Energy security is central to energy policy and will be addressed in the forthcoming Energy White Paper.

 None. However the Department for International Development has been funding the World Bank Research Programme on Trade in Services since 1997 and is due to continue doing so until 2004. This programme aims to generate and draw together data and research on the impact of services liberalisation, with a view to improving services trade policy formulation and facilitating the services negotiations at the WTO. One of the central components of the programme is the creation of a database on measures affecting trade in services. The programme also includes a number of policy research projects, the results of which are available on the World Bank website (http://wwwl.worldbank.org/wbiep/trade/services.html_overview).

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what representations she has received against the inclusion of water services in GATS; and if she will make a statement.  [72187]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21015w43.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Hewitt </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 23 July 2002]:</i> Over the past months, the Government has received a number of representations from Members, organisations and members of the public against the inclusion of water services in the GATS on the grounds that this would lead to forced privatisation and deregulation of these services, to the detriment of the poor.
<P>

<a name="21015w43.html_para1">The Government understands these concerns, but does not believe that the GATS will lead to such outcomes. The GATS is a bottom-up agreement, meaning that individual WTO Members decide for themselves whether, to what extent, and when to open up services where they think this will be beneficial. To date, no WTO Member has made a GATS commitment relating to pure drinking water (although some commitments have been made in relation to waste water treatment).
<P>

<a name="21015w43.html_para2">The European Community believes that improvements in the supply of water, which are needed in many poorer developing countries, can be achieved by involving the private sector in partnership with governments, given limits on public funding. One of the key outcomes from the recent World Summit on Sustainable Development was a new global target to halve, by 2015, the proportion of people without access to basic sanitation, in support of the Millennium Development Goal to halve the proportion of people without access to clean water. The EC sees the GATS as a logical complement to these commitments.




<P>
<P><I>15 Oct 2002 : Column 688W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="21015w43.html_para3">It may be that some WTO Members will decide that it is in their interest to involved the private sector in the funding and/or provision of their water services in order to increase investment and relieve over-stretched resources. They may also decide to open this sector to foreign companies. The aim of GATS commitments would be to ensure that such access is offered on fair and non-discriminatory terms.
<P>

<a name="21015w43.html_para4">Should WTO Members choose to liberalise in this way, nothing in the GATS can prevent them from regulating to ensure that prices charged are affordable, or to secure other universal service obligations. Nor can the Agreement pressure them into a specific public or private service delivery model. Moreover, the EC's requests purposefully highlight the importance of liberalisation being underpinned by domestic regulatory framework designed to ensure the achievement of public policy objectives.
<P>
<P>
<a name="21015w43.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Simon Thomas: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if she will make it her policy to call for a comprehensive review by the WTO of the impact of increased service liberalisation, especially on water services, before implementing GATS; and if she will make a statement.  [72190]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21015w43.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Hewitt </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 23 July 2002]:</i> The Government has said on previous occasions that we fully support an impact assessment of the liberalisation of trade in services. WTO Members have already agreed to make this an on-going aspect of the current GATS negotiations at the WTO, and through the European Community we are participating actively in discussion on this issue in WTO Council for Trade in Services. We are also funding research by the World Bank that aims to generate and draw together data and research on the impact of services liberalisation in a wide range of countries, with a view to improving services trade policy formulation and facilitating the current negotiations.
<P>

<a name="21015w43.html_para5">As regards implementation of GATS commitments in the UK, we will shortly consult fully on the requests being made of us in order to assess the potential impact of responding to these requests.

 The sustainability of the built environment and the materials from which it is constructed is a key component of our Rethinking Construction strategy for the construction industry. The sustainable use of materials is dependent on a wide range of factors such as embodied energy, renewability, manufacturing process emissions, designed use, social costs, recycling, reuse and end of life disposal.

 A number of anti-dumping and anti-subsidy measures are in force against several steel products from various Eastern European countries. In addition, definitive safeguard measures introduced by the EU to guard against trade diversion as a result of the US safeguard measure announced in March include products from Eastern Europe. The EU also has agreements with Russia and Ukraine applying quantitative restrictions to imports of certain steel products from these countries.
<P>

<a name="21015w45.html_para0">These measures have been taken to protect EU industry from unfair trade practices that harm EU industries or, in the case of the safeguard measure, to prevent a damaging surge of imports into the EU.

 Stone, being a heavy product incurs high transportation costs and has little import penetration within the UK. Most stone used in the UK travels less than thirty miles from its point of extraction to its point of use and less than 2 per cent. is imported. Over half those imports are from within the EU, subject to EU regulation and freedom of movement within the economic area. Stone forms a very small part of the goods and products imported to the UK and it would not be cost effective to monitor their origins. We do, however keep close contact with stone industry trade associations and discuss issues including imports.

 We have an extensive programme of action to support and promote cycling. As part of their Local Transport Plans, local authorities are now expected to develop and deliver local cycling strategies. These strategies are currently being audited by the National Cycling Strategy Board for England, with help from a new team of experts based in the regions. We have also recently announced the first tranche of awards from the new national Cycling Projects Fund, from which we are supporting 138 projects at a cost of #2.18 million.

<P>
<a name="21015w47.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Under the Transport Act 2000, our standard minimum requirement for concessionary travel in England ensures half fares for pensioners and disabled people on local buses, with a free pass. Local authorities may make more generous provision, including free travel, at their discretion. From 1 April 2003 men aged 60 and over will benefit from existing schemes.

<P>
<a name="21015w47.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The Transport Act 2000 (and the GLA Act 1999 as amended by the Transport Act) provides for the Secretary of State to issue statutory guidance to local authorities, including the London Boroughs, which they must take into account when deciding whether someone is eligible for concessionary travel under the disability criteria. Blind or partially-sighted persons are listed in guidance issued last year as one of the seven eligible categories of disabled persons. The guidance can be viewed at www.dft.gov.uk/itwp/consult/cf/disabled/index.htm.
<P>

<a name="21015w47.html_para0">The Transport Act 2000 provides for a statutory minimum 50 per cent. discount on local bus services for elderly and disabled people in England and Wales. Many local authorities, including those in London, choose to offer better schemes and under the Act are still free to do so.
<P>

<a name="21015w47.html_para1">In London, the Greater London Authority Act 1999 (GLA 1999) requires the 33 London local authorities to agree arrangements for concessionary travel for their elderly and disabled residents with Transport for London annually. This scheme is known as the Freedom Pass. It provides free travel on buses, tube and rail services for all blind people meeting the disability criteria in the statutory guidance.

* ''Trading'' vessels are those which carry cargo or passengers for commercial purposes. The remainder of the fleet consists of vessels, which are deemed to be ''non-trading''. Examples of non-trading vessels are dredgers and trawlers, but vessels which were constructed for ''trading'' purposes can also come into this category, if they have been converted to a non-trading use, e.g. storage or a floating restaurant.<P>

estimated costs of the project have already been taken into account by the Rail Regulator in determining Railtrack's income requirements, an element of that income will have been supported by public funding to train operating companies using the line which has flowed through to Railtrack in the form of access charges, and by public funding for network grants paid to Railtrack.

 The Strategic Rail Authority commissioned a study of the wider strategic options for services on the East-West corridor. This confirmed that viable options exist for services on the Oxford-Milton Keynes corridor, but found little evidence that services east of Bedford would be economically viable or provide value for money if supported by public funds. However, the SRA is exploring with Network Rail and other relevant parties options for keeping parts of the East-West route in railway ownership and safeguarding potential infrastructure alignments in the West Coast and East Coast Main Line upgrades.

 The Rail Passengers Council (RPC) is required to publish an annual report to the Chairman of the Strategic Rail Authority, whose responsibilities include protecting passenger rights. The overall number of complaints handled by the RPC between 2001 and 2002 rose by around 3 per cent., from 14,149 to 14,528. This increase was not uniform, with some areas, such as the Southern and Midlands regions, experiencing a fall in complaints. The main causes for complaints this year were train performance and service quality, redress and reimbursement and facilities and service at stations.

 Section 206 of the Transport Act 2000 requires the Strategic Rail Authority (SRA), in formulating its strategies, to consult the Scottish Ministers, the National Assembly for Wales, the Rail Regulator and other such persons as it thinks fit. Beyond this, the Secretary of State's Directions and Guidance to the SRA make clear that he expects the Authority to carry out the appropriate level of consultation with those likely to be affected by its actions. The SRA has also published its policy on consultation, which can be found on its website. We see no reason to impose further statutory consultation requirements on the SRA.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21015w51.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The Highways Agency, responsible for motorways in England, has no plans to plant the majority of central reservations. Since 1990 central reservations have been designed and constructed as hard surfaced areas often with integral drainage channels and cable ducts for lighting. These areas are in a hostile environment which is subject to the effects of de-icing salt, turbulence and dust and not suited for growing plants.




<P>
<P><I>15 Oct 2002 : Column 718W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="21015w51.html_para2">Planting is considered viable only in wide central reservations where the total width is 10 metres or more and a healthy plant environment can be maintained. Where central reserve planting does exist in narrow central reserves there are high maintenance costs involving traffic management, replacement planting and pruning. These activities also result in delays to road users and potentially put operatives at risk from working close to live traffic.

<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>As you may be aware, the White Paper ''A New Deal for Trunk Roads'' published in July 1998, identified a need for the West Midlands to North West Conurbations Multi Modal Study (MIDMAN). As part of a combined package of transport solutions, the study has identified a number of highway improvements including widening the M6 Motorway to 4 lanes up to Junction 20 and re-modelling Junction 20 to make it multi-directional. A steering group made up of regional stakeholders, including the Highways Agency and the North West Regional Assembly (NWRA), has considered these improvements.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Agency voiced their concern that the proposed Junction 20 improvements had not been adequately assessed against an alternative proposal to upgrade the A556 to motorway standard, which was considered as part of the A556/MIDMAN Study. The steering group therefore asked the Agency to carry out further technical work and report back to the NWRA. Subsequently, the Agency commissioned consultants to produce the A556 Area

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what the cost to the Vehicles Inspectorate of operating the Smoky Vehicle Hotline was in each of the past four years; what the estimated cost is for the present year; and if he will make a statement.  [74704]<P>

 The smoky vehicle hotline is one of several services provided by the Vehicle Inspectorate through its general enquiry unit. Hotline calls may also be made to the Inspectorate's area offices. For these reasons I cannot give an individual cost for the service. The costs are met within the total operational costs of the agency.

The number of calls actionable by the Inspectorate, that is those calls which relate to ''O'' licensed vehicles and which contain sufficient information for the vehicle and operator to be identified, are also shown. The Inspectorate does not record the number of vehicles inspected due to an unsatisfactory response to a letter from the Inspectorate following a complaint to the smoky vehicle hotline. However, this does not indicate that no action is taken. Follow-up action may take the form of a fleet check and this enforcement activity would be recorded separately.

 Developers have prepared a proposal for a new single runway airport set in the Severn Estuary (Severnside). Our analysis suggests that a new airport there would only be viable if Cardiff or Bristol airport, or both, were to close or become congested to the point of capacity. Our forecasts under all scenarios indicate that this is unlikely to occur within the forecasting period. With the investment required to establish such a facility and with spare capacity available at Cardiff over the next 30 year period it is unlikely to be commercially viable in its own right and could only be considered as an option, if at all, for other policy reasons.

<a name="21015w53.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Paragraph 11.4 of the <i>The Future Development of Air Transport in the United Kingdom (South East)</i> main consultation document makes clear that the option of a fifth runway to reduce night-time noise impacts was appraised.
<P>

<a name="21015w53.html_para4">This runway was considered for use only by night-time arrivals from the South-West, to avoid overflying towns such as Gravesend and Tilbury. The results of this analysis is presented in the SERAS <i>Stage Two Appraisal Findings report</i>, paragraphs 11.8.7 to 11.8.10. These suggest that, for movements other than arrivals from the South West, the night-time noise impacts would be minimised by using a combination of the parallel runways.

 As part of the South East and East of England Regional Airports study (SERAS), an appraisal was made of direct and indirect effects arising from habitat loss, damage or disturbance to species and habitats arising from the construction, presence and operation of the proposed new airport option. This included an initial assessment of the impacts on birds and other wildlife. A summary of the methodology adopted is outlined in the <i>SERAS stage two appraisal findings report</i> (section 6.7).

To ask the Minister for the Cabinet Office what resources the Government are allocating to emergency planning over one period covered by the Comprehensive Spending Review, broken down into annual budget totals.  [73772]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21015w54.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Alexander: </B> 
 The Government has allocated #19.038 million Civil Defence Grant to local authorities in England and Wales for each of the years 2003&#150;04, 2004&#150;05 and 2005&#150;06.
<P>
<P>
<a name="21015w54.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Francois: </B> 
To ask the Minister for the Cabinet Office, what steps Government is taking to prevent local authorities from spending emergency planning funds on other areas.  [73775]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21015w54.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Alexander: </B> 
 The Civil Defence Grant provided to local authorities in England and Wales is a specific grant that must be used for emergency planning. The financial accounts of local authorities are audited to ensure this.
<P>
<P>
<a name="21015w54.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Francois: </B> 
To ask the Minister for the Cabinet Office, for what reason the Government reduced the Civil Defence Grant budget for emergency planning in 2002.  [73776]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21015w54.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Alexander: </B> 
 The Civil Defence Grant budget was not reduced for 2002&#150;03. The Government allocated #18.97 million to local authorities in England and Wales for 2002&#150;03, which was the same amount as in the previous year.

[74496]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21015w54.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Alexander: </B>

<a name="21015w54.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Alexander: </B> 
 In April 1997, there were 148,800 permanent Civil Service staff working in London and the South East. By April 2001, this had fallen to 144,550, representing a 1.4 per cent. reduction in the number of staff based in these areas. However, overall the remaining regions have seen an increase in the number of permanent Civil Service staff during the same period.

To ask the Minister for the Cabinet Office (1) if ministerial special advisers are fixed-term workers within the scope of the EU Fixed-Term Workers Directive;  [73683]
<P>
<UL>(2) what assessment he has made of the impact of the EU Fixed Term Workers Directive on the employment of special advisers, with particular reference to the provision that fixed term contracts will become permanent after four years.  [73819]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21015w55.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Alexander: </B> 
 Special advisers are temporary civil servants appointed under Article 3 of the Civil Service Order in Council 1995. The Government's view is that they cannot be employed on a permanent basis on the grounds that they have been recruited outside the Civil Service rules of fair and open competition, and they are not required to be politically impartial or serve a future Administration of a different political party. Special advisers are employed on fixed term contracts for the purposes of the Fixed-term Employees (Prevention of Less Favourable Treatment) Regulations 2002 but the Government believes that special advisers' contracts cannot be converted to permanent ones by virtue of Regulation 8. Employing special advisers on a temporary basis is justified on objective grounds due to the special nature of their employment.

 Where an application has been finalised, the only circumstances in which it may be reopened are where there has been such a change in the victim's medical condition that an injustice would occur if the original decision were allowed to stand, or where the applicant has died as a result of the injury. In such circumstances, a case may be reopened more than two years after the date of the final decision, on the basis of evidence presented in support of the application to reopen, provided that it can be considered without a need for further extensive enquiries.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department (1) if it is his intention to institute a right of appeal for persons reaching the age of majority who make an application to the CICA/CICB for review of an award granted to them as a child when the application for such a review is refused by the authority;  [72790]

<UL>(2) what plans he has to amend the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme in respect of children who have been sexually abused.  [72791]<P></UL>

<P>
<a name="21015w56.html_spnew2"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 Following a major public consultation exercise launched in 1999, the Compensation Scheme was thoroughly reviewed in 2000, and a number of improvements were made which came into force from 1 April 2001. These included significant changes to the tariff descriptions and levels of award relating to the physical and sexual abuse of children. In view of that recent review and consequent changes, there are no plans for further amendment to the Scheme at this time.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what businesses have employment links with prisons; and what role the Government plays in cultivating these links.  [66649]<P>

<a name="21015w56.html_spnew4"><B> Hilary Benn </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 4 July 2002]:</i> The Prison Service has employment links with a wide range of businesses and other organisations. These include commercial contracts to supply goods and services, and providing employment for prisoners whilst in custody, including in engineering, woodwork, clothing, laundries and light assembly, which can lead to continued employment for prisoners on release. In addition, with our support and involvement the Prison Service is developing its wider links with employers, the Confederation of British Industry, other employer and industry organisations, and Sector Skills Councils to help increase the number of prisoners getting jobs after release. In particular, its Custody to Work initiative is focusing on sectors in which existing or developing prison work and training activity overlap with feasible job opportunities for released prisoners. These include construction, catering, industrial cleaning, warehousing and distribution, and call centres.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what education and training facilities are available in prisons; and what assistance is given to prisoners in getting a job on release.  [66648]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21015w56.html_spnew5"><B> Hilary Benn </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 4 July 2002]:</i> Our aim is to provide learning opportunities for prisoners which will enhance their chances of getting a job on release and help them resettle back in the community. All prisons have to provide a core curriculum of basic skills, social and life skills, information technology and preparation for work and are expected to meet basic skills targets. We have recently widened these targets to enable prisons to be more responsive to the range of prisoners' needs.
<P>

<a name="21015w56.html_para2">Prisoners also have access to a range of vocational training courses, including construction, catering, industrial cleaning, motor mechanics, engineering and hairdressing. We are investing #20 million over the next two years to develop and modernise education and training so that it better fits the needs of the individual prisoner and the external employment market.
<P>

<a name="21015w56.html_para3">Many establishments provide services to help prisoners find employment on release, often in partnership with Jobcentre Plus, the National Probation Service or voluntary sector organisations. These include jobsearch training and support, and the piloting in eight prisons from Summer 2002 of new technology giving access to Jobcentre Plus information on employment vacancies across the country. The Prison Service Custody to Work initiative, with #30 million earmarked for 2001&#150;04, is geared towards increasing employment and training outcomes for released prisoners through the development of such resettlement activity.

<P>

<a name="21015w56.html_para4">In a survey in November and December 2001, 24 per cent. of sentenced prisoners nearing release said they had a job to go to on release and six per cent. a training place. A copy of Home Office Research Findings 173&#151;''Jobs and homes: a survey of prisoners nearing release'' is in the Library. These findings suggest we have discharged the commitment we made in Autumn 2000 to double the proportion of prisoners getting jobs on release against the 10 per cent. baseline suggested by previous research. We have now set the Prison Service a target of increasing by 1,700 by April 2003&#151;from an estimated 26,500 to 28,200 a year&#151;the number of prisoners getting jobs or education or training places after release.

 Communications data may be supplied voluntarily for specified purposes (e.g. investigation of crime) under the Data Protection Act 1998. A more tightly controlled regulatory regime for access to communications data will be provided for under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 (RIPA). Chapter II of Part I of the Act explains the duties and responsibilities placed upon each party involved in the process, and creates a system of safeguards reflecting Article 8 of the European Convention of Human Rights (ECHR). The overall regime will be subject to oversight by the Interception of Communications Commissioner.

Currently if a prosecution is not proceeded with or a person is acquitted by the courts, the fingerprint record is weeded from NAFIS once the result is recorded on the Police National Computer. In light of the changes in the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001, further proposals are under consideration in relation to the system to allow for the retention of fingerprints on NAFIS in such cases.
<P>

<a name="21015w58.html_para1">The Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001 changes to PACE have been subject to Judicial Review. On 12 September 2002 the Court of Appeal ruled on the cases of S & Marper <i>v.</i> Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police that the new legislation did not breach the European Convention on Human Rights.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what criteria his Department follows for <i>(a)</i> initiating deportation proceedings under the Immigration Act 1971 and <i>(b)</i> initiating denaturalisation proceedings under the British Nationality Act 1981.  [74750]<P>

<P>
<a name="21015w58.html_spnew3"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 A person who is not a British citizen is liable to deportation on the grounds that this would be conducive to the public good, or if another person to whose family he belongs is being deported (limited to the spouse and any minor dependent children of the person being deported). He or she may also be deported following a recommendation made by a court under section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1971.
<P>

<a name="21015w58.html_para4">Before any decision to deport is taken, all relevant factors are taken into account, including: age; length of residence in and strength of connections with the United Kingdom; personal history, including character, conduct and employment record; domestic circumstances; criminal record; compassionate circumstances; and any representations received on the person's behalf (paragraph 364&#150;367 of the Immigration Rules (HC395 as amended)).
<P>

<a name="21015w58.html_para5">The criteria for deprivation of citizenship are set out in section 40 of the British Nationality Act 1981. The grounds are that the person either obtained his nationality by fraud, has shown himself to be disloyal or disaffected towards Her Majesty, has unlawfully traded or communicated with an enemy in time of war, or has been sentenced within five years of becoming British to at least 12 months imprisonment.

 The Immigration and Nationality Directorate notified Mrs. Nikolova's representatives on 1 October 2002 that she had been granted indefinite leave to remain.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

Figures are rounded to the nearest five.<P>

1 includes reconsideration cases in 2000 or 2001 where an asylum decision by the Secretary of State is later required to be reconsidered as a result of additional information or significant changes in current circumstances and country information.<P>

2 Data for 2000 may include some cases decided under the backlog criteria.<P>

(p) Data are provisional and subject to change.<P>

I regret that there are currently no estimates of the number of persons who have entered Britain illegally or remained in Britain after being refused asylum. The Research Development and Statistics Directorate of the Home Office has commissioned research to look at the methodology of sizing the illegal population and is due to report next year.<P>

consume alcohol on duty unless specifically authorised to do so or it becomes necessary for the proper discharge of police duty. It is for chief officers to determine local policy on the consumption of alcohol and tobacco on police premises and in administration areas and on the consumption of tobacco by police officers on duty outside police premises.
<P>

<a name="21015w59.html_para4">The Prison Service's policy is that no person shall bring alcohol into a prison without the permission of the Governor. Staff are not permitted to consume alcohol whilst on duty, and it is a disciplinary offence to do so. Prison Service policy on smoking is contained in Instruction to Governors 16/1996, Work Place Smoking Policy (a copy of which can be found in the Library) and Governors are required to develop local policies which reflect the guidance in the Instruction. The Instruction advises Governors to impose a ban on smoking in office accommodation including single occupancy offices, corridors, staircases, etc. It does not, however, give advice regarding staff on duty outside prisons, but local policies should address that issue.

 I have had detailed discussions with the Director General of the Prison Service on the implications of the ruling for internal disciplinary procedures. On 14 August, following consultation with Governors, we laid before Parliament amendments to the Prison and Young Offender Rules. The changes strengthened some of the existing punishments, and also provided for independent adjudicators to hear the most serious cases. The adjudicators will be able to impose additional days as a punishment. Prisoners in hearings before the independent adjudicators will have a right to legal representation. Until the end of March 2003, the Lord Chancellor has agreed that District Judges may act as adjudicators. They began hearing cases on 7 October. We shall decide on longer term arrangements in the light of their work.

As a result of this investigation, a number of recommendations were made concerning the use of the baton round, all of which have been welcomed by the Force. North Wales Police inform me that the baton round was fired from approximately six metres (19ft/20ft) during the incident.

<a name="21015w60.html_para0">The Plan provides for a more structured approach to promoting good design as early as possible in the procurement process, whether it is through the Private Finance Initiative (PFI) or publicly funded. The outcome of this should be that designers are more carefully selected for their technical skills and capabilities, and contractors are engaged earlier to make a greater contribution to design and specification, and enabling greater value for money to be achieved.

 The cost of re-marks are usually borne by students' schools and colleges. The awarding bodies will not accept requests for re-marks from candidates, or their carers or from any third party, except in the case of private candidates. The awarding bodies offer a fast track re-mark service to be completed in 30 days, standard remarks should be completed within 40 calendar days. Oxford, Cambridge and RSA (OCR); and the Assessment and Qualifications Alliance charge #20.80 for the re-mark of a specification unit under both the fast track and standard services. Edexcel charge #30 for a fast track re-mark of a specification unit and #25 for a standard re-mark. Schools are not invoiced until the outcome of a re-mark is known. They are only charged if the grade does not change.

 A new system of academic review has just been introduced by the Quality Assurance Agency for universities in England. Under this system, students will be encouraged to comment on their learning experience including the quality of pastoral support. QAA reports will include both students' views and their own findings.

 Students from lower-income families do not make any contributions to their tuition fees and have not therefore been affected by their uprating since 1998/99 in line with inflation. Any parental contribution to fees and maintenance is assessed on the basis of parental income and is shared between those children in the same family who are eligible for student support. By dividing the parental income by the number of children who are currently

 Officials in my Department receive information about the performance of the CRB on a regular basis. When interim arrangements to allow people to be appointed in advance of receipt of a Disclosure were first introduced from 24 May, the letter to Local Education Authorities stated following advice from the CRB that: ''the CRB are confident that their problems will be resolved and that all relevant Disclosures ....will have been issued before the start of the Autumn term.'' During June and July information provided by the CRB continued to indicate that they expected to clear the backlog of applications by the end of August, and to achieve the service standard of issuing Enhanced Disclosures within 3 weeks of receipt of the application by that point. During August it became increasingly uncertain whether the CRB would achieve that, and my officials enquired if the checks needed for staff at the beginning of term could be identified and given priority. In discussion with my officials on 21 August officials of the Bureau stated that they had identified approximately 22,500 outstanding applications for checks on education staff and were confident that the Bureau could clear most of these by 4 September, although it was possible that they might not be able to complete some where more information was required. Bureau officials also said that the actual checking process would be completed by the start of the new term, and that it would be possible to courier results to

Lists of term start-dates were requested from Local Education Authorities for the purpose of prioritising the processing of applications. On 27 August the CRB was asked to agree a form of words to be included in my Department's letter to Local Education Authorities, and agreed the following text:

In order to assist this process, and ensure that priority is given to those posts that will be most critical to the smooth running of schools in your LEA at the beginning of term, it is strongly recommended that each LEA provides the CRB with the following list of information as a matter of urgency, if you have not already done so:</FONT></UL>

 Admission arrangements for infant and primary schools, including the timing of admission to school, are matters for the admission authority. For most schools this is the Local Education Authority but for some it is the Governing Body.

<a name="21015w63.html_para0">Many schools which admit children before compulsory school age do so initially on a part-time basis, particularly for the younger four year olds.

Although the Government has not specifically assessed the impact of phased or part-time intake to reception classes, in September 2001 we published a summary of independent research into the effects of children starting school at different ages. This reported that research on the school starting age and summer born children is inconclusive.

<P>
<a name="21015w63.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 The School Teachers' Review Body will be making recommendations early next year to the Secretary of State on this and other pay matters. The Government is aware that some schools have difficulties in retaining good, experienced teachers in inner London. The Secretary of State has asked the Review Body to give special attention to that issue. The Government does not, however, support further high, across the board increases next year covering the London Allowance areas, though does not rule out an increase in line with inflation. The value of the allowance has already increased by over 35 per cent. since 1997. The recruitment and retention issues across the London Allowance areas are complex. Schools are best placed to use their existing pay flexibilities to target the teachers they need. In addition, Stephen Twigg has been appointed as Minister for London schools, and the Secretary of State will shortly be appointing a London Schools' Commissioner to work alongside him. Their work will naturally take account of teacher recruitment and retention issues in London.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21015w64.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 About 1,000 schools are using software provided by a company called Micro Librarian Systems (MLS), which gives purchasers an option to use thumb printing to identify individuals for the purposes of schools' library management systems. Key features of the prints are converted into a numerical code for recording on the system. MLS has given officials in the Department a demonstration of their software and we understand that, while the number could, with difficulty, be re-created, the original print itself is not stored and cannot be reconstructed.
<P>

<a name="21015w64.html_para0">The Office of the Information Commissioner have confirmed that they are of the view that the current use of the software developed by MLS is compatible with the principles of data protection, given the existence of safeguards against wider use of the thumb prints than is necessary for the purpose for which they are being collected in schools. The data should be deleted once a

pupil leaves a school in accordance with the fifth principle of data protection that ''personal data processed for any purpose or purposes shall not be kept for longer than is necessary for that purpose or those purposes''.
<P>

<a name="21015w64.html_para1">Ultimately, it is for schools to decide whether they wish to use this software or not and, if so, whether they wish to use the thumb print technology as part of it. If they do decide to use it, the OIC has stressed that schools should seek the consent of parents. We would add that schools should seek the consent of pupils where appropriate. MLS also strongly recommends in its literature to schools that they should contact parents to advise them of the technology and their intention to use it before beginning the registration process. In schools that do use the software with the thumb print option, there are alternative means of access for those pupils who choose, or whose parents choose, not to use the thumb print option, so they are not disadvantaged.

[74284]<P>

<a name="21015w64.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 The Department for Education and Skills will make guidance available on sections 11 and 12 of the Education Act 2002 which allow school governing bodies to form companies to provide services and to procure goods and services. Guidance on purchasing for schools is already available separately from the Department. School companies will operate under the provisions of the Companies Acts and will submit audited accounts to Companies House. The regulations on school companies will provide for a supervising local education authority to receive accounts from the company and to request further information where necessary. School companies will not be subject to inspection by other statutory bodies.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21015w64.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 Teachers in maintained schools are subject to national school teachers' pay and conditions based on recommendations made by the independent School Teachers' Review Body (STRB). Teachers at the top of the main pay scale can apply to ''cross the performance threshold'' by providing evidence of competency in five nationally agreed teaching standards. The aim of the performance threshold is to encourage and reward good teaching and to help make teaching a more effective and attractive profession. Passing the threshold means a permanent move to an ''upper'' pay scale. In practice, this mean a salary 



<P>
<P><I>15 Oct 2002 : Column 773W</I><P>
increase of about #2,000. The criteria for moving through the upper pay scale is developed by individual schools.
<P>

<a name="21015w64.html_para2">FE colleges, including sixth form colleges, are run by independent corporations and unlike schools, there is no national pay agreement in the sector. There is a nationally recommended pay scale agreed by employer representative bodies and the unions but pay arrangements in the sector are diverse. This reflects colleges' ability to agree annual pay rises and conditions of employment with their staff in the context of local priorities and the overall resources available to them.
<P>

<a name="21015w64.html_para3">In consultation with the Association of Colleges, the Sixth Form Colleges' Employers' Forum and the FE unions we have introduced the Teaching Pay Initiative (TPI) to help colleges modernise pay arrangements and to recruit, reward and retain teachers excellent teachers. For sixth form colleges, the arrangements for TPI (referred to as the Professional Standards Payment) are very similar to those in schools, with a prescribed payment of #2,000 to the eligible teachers who meet the required standards. In general FE colleges, there are national guidelines within which payments must be determined, rewarding the achievement of qualifications, continuous professional development, advanced practitioner status and measures to modernise pay arrangements. General FE colleges have the flexibility to determine the precise levels of TPI payment made to their staff. It is for individual colleges to decide whether to consolidate TPI awards into pensionable pay.
<P>

<a name="21015w64.html_para4">We have recently announced the extension of the TPI to non-teaching staff in colleges.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21015w64.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 From September this year, all those training to be primary teachers receive training to teach PE as an integral part of their programme. This should ensure that more new primary teachers are suitably prepared to deliver the primary PE curriculum. Initial teacher training providers can also choose to offer trainees additional specialist training in PE or other subjects if they wish. However, the change in the requirements for primary teachers means that there should be no need for any supplementary courses of the kind offered for secondary teachers. These courses are aimed at providing graduates with the full range of knowledge and skills needed for the more specialised secondary PE curriculum.
<P>

<a name="21015w64.html_para5">Professional development also has an important role to play, and DfES and DCMS are working together to deliver a joint PSA target to enhance sporting opportunities for 5&#150;16 year olds, by increasing the percentage of children who spend at least 2 hours a week on high quality PE and schools sport, within and beyond the curriculum, to 75 per cent. by 2006. Subject to final detailed decisions on the 2002 spending review settlement, we aim to support additional training for teachers and others in PE and school sport.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills how much funding the Government provides towards promoting internet access in schools in the last year in classrooms; and what programmes the Government funds that promote the use of the internet.  [73846]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21015w65.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 The Government made available #245 million through the Standards Fund in the last financial year (2001&#150;02) for information and communications technology (ICT) in schools. This includes funding for equipment and content as well as for the Internet. Statistics published on 29 August tell us that over 99 per cent. of all schools in England were connected to Internet at April 2002 and that computer to pupil ratios are now one computer for every six secondary school pupils and one computer for every 9.7 primary school pupils.
<P>

<a name="21015w65.html_para3">The main programme to promote the use of the Internet in schools over the last four years has been the National Grid for Learning strategy which is now part of the overall ICT in Schools Programme.

<a name="21015w65.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 The information is not available.
<P>

<a name="21015w65.html_para4">It is estimated from a recent sample survey of schools that over 99 per cent. of both primary and secondary schools in England were connected to the internet at 31 March 2002. The sample size was not large enough to support regional estimates.
<P>

<a name="21015w65.html_para5">Information for England 2002 was published in Statistical First Release 19/02 ''Survey of Information and Communications Technology in Schools 2002: Provisional'', which is available on my Department's web-site www.dfes.gov.uk/statistics and from the Library.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what measures are in place to improve the secondary education of students and the recruitment of teachers.  [73838]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21015w65.html_spnew6"><B> Estelle Morris: </B> 
 <i>Investment for Reform</i>, published in July, sets out our intentions for reforming the secondary education system. A record #12.8 billion increase in education investment over the next 3 years, together with measures in the Education Act 2002 will provide a firm basis for further reform and improvement, and higher standards.
<P>

<a name="21015w65.html_para6">A range of measures has been introduced to boost teacher recruitment. From September 2000, #6,000 training bursaries have been paid to eligible students on postgraduate courses that lead to qualified teacher status. For those who train in and then go on to teach in shortage subject areas a #4,000 ''golden hello'' payment is made after induction has been completed. These measures helped to ensure that there were 29,045

new entrants to initial teacher training courses in 2001&#150;02, more than any year since 1994 and 1,330 more than 2000&#150;2001.
<P>
<P>
<a name="21015w65.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Wiggin: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what tests are used to assess whether secondary schools are improving; and if she will make a statement on the methodology of these tests.  [73839]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21015w65.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 Secondary school performance and improvement are assessed on a number of bases, including the performance of their pupils in public examinations (GCSEs/GNVQs). Increasingly, we are also taking account of pupil performance in the end of Key Stage 3 tests, both in its own right and as an indicator of the ''value added'' by schools during Key Stage 3 and Key Stage 4. The 2002 performance tables will include two value added measures for secondary schools nationally, in addition to the raw examination results published normally.
<P>

<a name="21015w65.html_para7">The principal means of assessing achievements at the end of compulsory education is the GCSE. GCSEs are assessed through a combination of coursework and terminal examination. GCSE specifications have to meet the requirements of the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority's (QCA) subject criteria. A Code of Practice sets out the principles and practice for the assessment and quality assurance of the GCSE qualifications. It helps to ensure grading standards are constant in each subject across different awarding bodies and different specifications year on year.
<P>

<a name="21015w65.html_para8">The National Curriculum Key Stage 3 tests are developed by QCA on behalf of the Secretary of State. These tests provide a measure of pupils' progress in English mathematics and science at the end of Key Stage 3. They help teachers and parents to see what children have achieved compared with other children of the same age and with national standards, based on eight levels of attainment in the National Curriculum.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills how many children were excluded from state primary and secondary schools at each of the key stages in each of the last five years; and what percentage of each of these totals of exclusions children were recognised as being on the autistic spectrum. [73967]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21015w66.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Stephen Twigg: </B> 
 The available information is shown in the table. Information collected centrally on permanent exclusions does not record the Key Stage of the pupil or the type of special educational need. Guidance from the Department makes clear that, other than in the most exceptional circumstances, schools should avoid permanently excluding pupils with statements of special educational needs. The guidance also requires head teachers to say, when reporting exclusions to Discipline Committees and Local Education Authorities whether the pupil has special educational needs, either with or without a statement.

 The Department makes monthly threshold payments to local education authorities so that payments can be made to schools as soon as they return a funding claim form. Authorities are also able to make payments to schools or teachers before receiving payment from the Department. This means that there should not be delays in schools receiving the Threshold Grant.

 It is the Department's policy not to publish figures about individual schools unless the schools concerned have had the opportunity to check or confirm that information. The pupil figures provided in the reply given on 9 July, <i>Official Report</i>, column 820W were published as part of the Primary and Secondary School Performance Tables; these figures had been checked by the schools.

<a name="21015w67.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 Officials continue to take seriously their responsibilities as managers of the Department's contracts, not only with Capita but with all our delivery partners. As soon as we became aware of the issues emerging from Individual Learning Accounts we took immediate steps to ensure that they did not apply to any of the Department's other contracts with any of our delivery partners. We have also taken further steps to ensure that ongoing assessment of the risks associated with delivery of contracted outputs is a standard part of what the Department's contract managers do. A comprehensive and wide ranging Supplier Management Project is seeking to embed that commercial competence across the Department as a whole and is one of our key improvement priorities.

 Beta interferon and glatiramer acetate are available on the National Health Service for the treatment of people with multiple sclerosis (MS) under the ''risk-sharing scheme''. The scheme, which came into operation on 6 May 2002, allows such treatments to be prescribed on the NHS to patients who meet the criteria set out by the Association of British Neurologists. All pharmaceutical companies involved have agreed terms for the supply of their products under the scheme. Patients will be monitored to confirm whether the drugs are working and costs to the NHS will reduce if patients do not benefit as expected.

 Frozen embryos are stored in centres licensed by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA). Storage must be in accordance with the conditions of the licence, which include compliance with the HFEA's code of practice. The code of practice is regularly reviewed and laid before Parliament. The HFEA carries out a full inspection of each centre before a licence is given and every three years thereafter. In the interval there are annual inspections of specific aspects of the centre's work. A case involving alleged irregularities in frozen embryo storage is currently subject to court proceedings.

 The Government expert advisory committee on the microbiological safety of blood and tissues for transplantation did consider the importation of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) in 1998.

 The Medicines Control Agency already ensures that the United Kingdom's blood services meet European good manufacturing practice standards. In addition, the new European Blood Directive will, when adopted, require the accreditation of all blood establishments to ensure common standards of safety and quality in blood and blood components across all Members States and the reporting of serious adverse reactions attributable to the safety and quality of blood and blood components.
<P>

<a name="21015w70.html_para8">The UK serious hazards of transfusion (SHOT) reporting system has had safety monitoring of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and methylene blue treated FFP in place for five years.

 Plasma is currently imported from the United States for the production of plasma products, as a precaution against the theoretical risk of vCJD transmission.

 As an added precaution against the theoretical risk of vCJD transmission, the Government's expert advisory committee on the microbiological safety of blood and tissues for transplantation (MSBT) has recommended importing single unit fresh frozen plasma (FFP) from the United States. On 15 August 2002 the Government announced that imported FFP would be used for new-born babies and young children born after 1 January 1996.
<P>

<a name="21015w70.html_para12">On the advice of MSBT, US sourced FFP will be virally inactivated using methylene blue (MB) treatment. MB has been administered in medical practice since 1900, and in much larger doses, many thousand-fold, than the National Blood Service (NBS) will be using. NBS will be removing more than 90 per cent. of MB before the FFP is issued to National Health Service hospitals. MB is a registered medical device under the Medical Devices Directive and has a European safety (CE) marking.

 The judgement by the competition commission appeal tribunal, in the case of Bettercare versus the Director General of Fair Trading, found that purchasing by a public body, in certain circumstances, is an economic activity carried out by an undertaking and therefore may be subject to the provisions of the Competition Act 1998. The judgement reflected a particular set of circumstances and is not of general application. In broad terms, the Competition Act is concerned with anti-competitive agreements and abuse of dominant market positions. We would not expect councils to be acting in ways that are inconsistent with the Competition Act. The Government's White Paper <i>Modernising Social Services</i> made clear that councils should apply best value principles when securing social care services, whether those services are directly provided or purchased from a private or voluntary sector organisation.

 The national strategic implementation programme for delivering 21 Century information technology support for the National Health Service, published by the Department in June 2002, sets out the actions required to meet the targets of the NHS Plan. A key element in this programme is the development of the integrated care records service (ICRS), which seeks to address the problems caused by the incompatibility of health and social service systems.
<P>

<a name="21015w71.html_para0">Over the last two years, the Department has also commissioned a number of projects that have sought to identify and provide practical solutions to the problems of integrating health and social care systems. Two of the projects within the electronic records development and implementation programme (ERDIP), supported by the NHS information authority, have developed joint records for use by all members of community mental

<a name="21015w71.html_para1">These issues are also being progressed through the information strategies which support the national service frameworks, particularly those relating to mental health, older people and children's services.

 We published <i>Hepatitis C Strategy for England</i> for consultation on 14 August 2002 in recognition of the importance of hepatitis C as an important public health issue, as highlighted in the Chief Medical Officer's infectious disease strategy, <i>Getting Ahead of the Curve</i>. The strategy sets out the current situation and proposals to improve the effectiveness of prevention, diagnosis and treatment services for hepatitis C.
<P>

<a name="21015w71.html_para2">Following consultation, it is intended that the strategy will form the basis of an action plan, as proposed in <i>Getting Ahead of the Curve</i>. This will serve as a clear framework setting out actions that need to be taken by Government, the National Health Service and others to intensify efforts to tackle hepatitis C.

<P>
<a name="21015w71.html_spnew12"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 The Committee on Medical Aspects of Food and Nutrition Policy (COMA, 2000), assessed the effects of folic acid on birth defects, such as neural tube defects (NTD), and estimated that fortification of flour with folic acid at a level of 240 micrograms per 100g could reduce the incidence of NTD affected pregnancies by 43 per cent. In terms of other countries, mandatory fortification has been implemented in the US, Canada and Chile. Recent research in some US States has linked the policy with a fall in the incidence of NTD. However, 



<P>
<P><I>15 Oct 2002 : Column 800W</I><P>
the level of fortification in other countries varies considerably from that recommended by COMA and therefore the results may not be directly comparable.
<P>

<a name="21015w71.html_para3">There is epidemiological evidence that increasing dietary folate may reduce blood levels of homocysteine, an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD).

<a name="21015w71.html_para4">I have no plans at present to refer the matter of links between folic acid, homocysteine levels, and cardiovascular disease to the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21015w71.html_spnew13"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 The decision on this complex issue requires careful consideration of both the benefits and the possible risks of fortification. The options are currently being considered, in the light of the recommendations of the Committee on Medical Aspects of Food and Nutrition Policy (COMA, 2000); responses to the consultation process, carried out in 2000; and advice from the Food Standards Agency.

 The electronic transmission of prescriptions between general practitioner practices and community pharmacists is just one element of a wider programme to modernise pharmacy services and the issue of prescriptions. The aim is to implement a new national prescriptions service that supports improved information on individuals' past and current medication, the move from paper based prescriptions with handwriting to secure electronic prescriptions with digital or graphical text and better decision support with integrated access to online drug dictionaries. There will be many building blocks that make up the whole national prescriptions service and at an infrastructure level the electronic transfer of prescriptions and prescription messaging together with connections and computers for pharmacists will be essential.
<P>

<a name="21015w72.html_para3">The benefits of a national prescriptions service are then considerable. They will include: 
<P>

<a name="21015w72.html_para4">safer prescribing to save lives and reduce harm by automatic checks on drug interactions and dosage, and less errors arising from illegible or incomplete prescriptions
<P>

<a name="21015w72.html_para5">a more convenient service for patients with easier and faster repeat prescriptions and choice over where they would like to collect their prescriptions
<P>

<a name="21015w72.html_para6">better medicines management and the dramatic reduction of fraud and loss of money that can be put into patient care.

 The Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) has recently reviewed the currently available data relating to possible neurotoxicity of thiomersal (a mercury-containing compound) in vaccines and advised that there is no evidence of harm caused by doses of thiomersal in vaccines, except for sensitisation reactions. The CSM concluded that the risk: benefit balance of thiomersal-containing vaccines remains overwhelmingly positive.
<P>

<a name="21015w72.html_para8">The Institute of Medicine (IOM) in the United States also published a detailed review of the evidence relating to possible neurotoxicity of thiomersal in vaccines in October 2001. The IOM review also concluded that the evidence did not support a causal association between thiomersal contained in vaccines and neurodevelopmental disorders. These findings were consistent with the CSM conclusions.

Neither of these studies supports an association between thiomersal exposure through the UK programme and neurodevelopmental disorders in children. The results of these studies have been made available to the Department and a summary of the findings is available in a Report to The US Congress which will be placed in the Library.

 The serious hazards of transfusion (SHOT) reports provide a comprehensive picture of serious transfusion complications in the UK. The fifth annual SHOT report (published April 2002) showed an increase in participation to 92 per cent. of eligible hospitals. Participation in the scheme has been encouraged by guidance to the National Health Service, most recently in HSC 2002/009&#151;(''Better Blood Transfusion&#151;Appropriate use of blood'') http://www.doh.gov.uk/bbt2/009hsc2002). This asks Chief Executives of National Health Service trusts to ensure participation in the SHOT scheme by December 2002.
<P>

<a name="21015w74.html_para8">SHOT is currently collaborating with the new National Patient Safety Agency (NPSA) whose core function is to improve the safety of NHS patient care by promoting a culture of reporting and learning from adverse incidents and professional errors without fear of personal reprimand.

<P>

<a name="21015w74.html_para10">United Kingdom FFP is already a very safe product. To minimise the risk from viruses, it is made only from previously tested blood donors.

 The NHS Plan for investment and reform identifies the need to put in place a robust management and support framework to deliver national standards of care.

 At the end of August, #85 million had been allocated to 101 schemes proposed by National Health Service trusts for improving their decontamination facilities. These schemes included purchasing new equipment, upgrading the buildings used for reprocessing and purchasing new surgical instruments to facilitate the centralisation of reprocessing. This, together with contributions from the NHS trusts themselves, amounted to an investment of some #107 million. Similar bids worth another #10 million were still being considered.

<a name="21015w76.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Lammy: </B> 
 The delivery of electronic records is being taken forward in implementing the national strategic programme <i>Delivering 21st Century IT&#151;Support for the NHS</i> which was announced by my noble Friend, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State (the Lord Hunt of Kingsheath) following the publication of <i>Delivering the NHS Plan</i> on 11 June 2002. One of the key aspects of phase one of the programme requires all primary care trusts and National Health Service trusts and hospitals to implement elements of electronic patient records by December 2005.
<P>

<a name="21015w76.html_para12">To support the NHS toward delivering this vision the Department in July 2002 published for consultation the <i>National Specification for the Integrated Care Records Service</i> to take forward the life-long heath record service. The key feature of the programme is the shift to a more corporate, national approach to deliver information technology in the NHS. This represents a step-change from the current arrangements whereby systems are typically provided for individual organisations in each health care sector. For electronic records this change means that there will be a national approach to procurement resulting in services conforming to national standards, which will include record structure and some content standards. The resulting services will be able to inter-operate with emerging national services such as the electronic staff record and the health record infrastructure. The aim being to ensure that all electronic record systems are fully compliant with national standards and specifications by December 2007.

 New and large-scale procurement projects in central Government are subject to gateway reviews. The process examines a project at critical stages to provide assurance that it can progress successfully to the next stage. The review provides project teams with advice and guidance from fellow practitioners and in order to maintain the integrity of the advice, this is held to be completely confidential by both parties. The gateway review process is not an audit.
<P>

<a name="21015w77.html_para9">No action plan with the Office of Government Commerce is routinely produced as a part of the gateway review process and none has been agreed in this case. However they do make recommendations to the senior responsible officer, in this case Sir John Pattison, on good practice in key areas such as programme management and involving key stakeholders. The national programme is taking their key recommendations on board as appropriate to help prepare for implementation and the next stage in the gateway review.

 Improving patients' experience of emergency care is essential. In light of this, reforming emergency care was launched in October 2001 supported by #118 million investment. It sets a long-term programme of reform supported by extra investment and new capacity to address one of the public's key concerns about the National Health Service&#151;waiting in Accident & Emergency.
<P>

<a name="21015w78.html_para0">Concerted action is being taken to further improve the quality of and waiting times in Northwick Park A&E. The A&E department is now receiving targeted support through the Modernisation Agency's intensive support team (IST).
<P>

<a name="21015w78.html_para1">Action already taken to improve the way emergency admissions are managed, including an increase in capacity of 21 beds has already drastically reduced very long waits for beds over the last six months. In addition NUCare, which is an innovative joint scheme run by the trust and local primary care trust, is speeding up care for patients with less serious illness or injuries by bringing GPs and community services into A&E.
<P>

<a name="21015w78.html_para2">Over seven out of ten patients now spend less than four hours in total in the A&E. There is still a long way to go and no room for complacency but the combination of local action by the trust and its health community with the support of the IST is laying the ground work for real improvements to the patient experience.

<a name="21015w78.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 The report, published on 4 September, of an expert working group set up by the Medical Research Council (MRC) at the request of the Department concluded that there was no firm evidence linking water fluoridation to cancer or to hip fractures. But the group recommended that a comparison be made between the amount of fluoride that the body absorbs from water supplies in which it occurs naturally and those to which it has been added artificially.
<P>

<a name="21015w78.html_para3">We are, therefore, taking immediate steps to commission a project on the absorption of fluoride. The Department is finalising the specification for a research project to compare the body's absorption of naturally occurring and artificially added fluoride, and will shortly be inviting tenders. The MRC group concluded that if new studies show that the uptake of fluoride from artificially fluoridated water is substantially higher than from naturally fluoridated water, then further investigation of the long term effects of fluoridation on hip fractures will be needed.
<P>

<a name="21015w78.html_para4">The group also recommended that an updated analysis be made of the data on fluoridation and cancer rates, and suggested that any new studies on the causes of bone cancer could easily include an assessment of exposure to fluoride. The Chief Medical Officer and the Chief Dental Officer will be advising on the action we should take on this and the remaining recommendations in the MRC group's report.

 The main Government agency for research into the cause and treatments of disease is the Medical Research Council (MRC) which receives its funding via the Department of Trade and Industry. Asthma is a priority area for the MRC. It supports a wide range of research projects looking at asthma ranging from basic research to applied clinical studies. The MRC spend in the area in 2000&#150;01 was approximately #3 million.
<P>

<a name="21015w78.html_para8">The Department funds research to support policy and the delivery of effective practice in the National Health Service.

<a name="21015w80.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Tony McNulty: </B> 
 Following devolution, housing policy in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland is a matter for the relevant devolved administrations.
<P>

<a name="21015w80.html_para7">Regional Planning Guidance requires planning bodies to strategically examine housing need, including the need for affordable housing, across their areas. We also expect local authorities to plan to meet their housing needs.
<P>

<a name="21015w80.html_para8">However, we recognise the need for more affordable homes in England, and have substantially increased resources to address this. Funding for the Housing Corporation's Approved Development Programme (ADP) for next year will be #1.2 billion, almost double the figure for 2000&#150;2001. This should deliver 22,700 homes next year.
<P>

<a name="21015w80.html_para9">My right hon. Friend, the Deputy Prime Minister will return to the House at the turn of the year with a comprehensive long-term programme of action to tackle supply and demand issues, as promised in his statement of 18 July, <i>Official Report</i>, Hansard, (col. 438).

<P>
<P>
<a name="21015w80.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Tony McNulty: </B> 
 We are concerned about abuses of the Right to Buy scheme and we have commissioned research into their scope and extent. The results will be available by the end of this year. We are considering what can be done about such abuses, but we have no plans to end the Right to Buy scheme.
<P>

 Responsibility for housing in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland is a matter for the relevant devolved administrations.
<P>

<a name="21015w80.html_para11">For England we have set a Public Service Agreement target to bring all social housing up to a decent standard by 2010.
<P>

<a name="21015w80.html_para12">To help ensure delivery against this target we have set up a Delivery Unit to work with Government Offices and the Housing Corporation to ensure local authorities and housing associations quantify the level of non-decent housing in their stock and put in place a strategy for dealing with the problem, backed up by a very significant increase in resources since 1997.
<P>

<a name="21015w80.html_para13">The emphasis on delivery is paying dividends and we are on track to meet our interim target of bringing a third of the worst social housing up to a decent standard by 2004.

<P>
<a name="21015w80.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Tony McNulty: </B> 
 The number of London Lettings released by the operation of the scheme in recent years are listed in the table below. This represents a useful contribution to easing pressure on social housing in London.
<P>

<a name="21015w80.html_para14">The number of households rehoused under the Seaside and Country Homes Scheme by property size are as follows. Figures prior to 1996&#150;97 are not held centrally and could only be provided at disproportionate cost. For 1999&#150;00 (when the management of the Scheme was moved from North British Housing Association to HOMES) figures are not available by property size.

<a name="21015w80.html_spnew21"><B> Mr. Tony McNulty: </B> 
 We are currently running three research projects relating to the Housing Health and Safety Rating System (HHSRS). The first, which began in January 2001, is to develop the statistics to support the system, and is being carried out by Warwick University with the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. The second, which began in August 2001, is an evaluation project, by DTZ Pieda, to identify the practical lessons to be learned from the publication of Version 1 of HHSRS in July 2000. The third, which began in September 2001, is to produce the guidance needed to assist local authorities in the application of HHSRS specifically to houses in multiple occupation, and is being carried out by the Building Research Establishment. Reports on these projects are expected to be published by the end of this year. This work will inform the production of Version 2 of HHSRS, which we expect to commission in time for publication next autumn as part of a comprehensive package of guidance.

<a name="21015w80.html_spnew22"><B> Mr. Tony McNulty: </B> 
 No such assessment has been carried out by the Government. However, local authorities in their role as strategic housing authorities are required to assess the type of accommodation required in their areas. Local authorities may also require a proportion of affordable housing as part of new developments, often built by Registered Social Landlords (RSLs) and funded by the Housing Corporation. RSLs must ensure that bids for capital investment in social housing fit with local authority and regional priorities and the Housing Corporation's National Investment Strategy.
<P>

<a name="21015w80.html_para21">Over the next ten years, the Government will encourage councils and housing associations to set their rents to within 5 per cent. of the levels given by a national formula that reflects a property's size, location and condition.

For people purchasing a home in South West England during 2001, total mortgage payments averaged 17.44 per cent. of their income.

 The 2002 spending review settlement has provided an extra #1.4 billion for housing. This will help to provide well-designed, affordable homes where they are needed, improve stock conditions in both the social and the private rented sectors, and tackle low demand through significant funds for the pathfinder projects. My right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister is giving careful consideration to the best use of this additional funding to deliver sustainable communities. My right hon. Friend has said that he will report back to the House at the turn of the year.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister where responsibility will lie for <i>(a)</i> police, <i>(b)</i> waste disposal and <i>(c)</i> fire services in new unitary authorities.  [73354]<P>

<a name="21015w82.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Nick Raynsford: </B> 
 The Regional Governance White Paper, <i>Your Region, Your Choice</i>, published in May, sets out the Government's plans to establish unitary local authorities in place of existing county and district councils in those regions where people vote in a referendum for elected regional assemblies. In any region where the Government decides that a referendum should take place, the Boundary Committee for England will carry out a review and recommend the best unitary arrangements for the two-tier parts of that region. A referendum will then be held to see whether people support the creation of an elected assembly. The new unitary arrangements will be implemented if&#151;but only if&#151;a majority of those voting in the referendum voted for an elected regional assembly.
<P>

<a name="21015w82.html_para0">Where new unitary arrangements are introduced, we would expect that existing police authorities would remain in place. Appointments to these authorities would be made either by unitary districts or by the unitary county council, depending on the new unitary structure.
<P>

<a name="21015w82.html_para1">There are currently combined fire authorities in former county areas which have only unitary local authorities; and also in areas where there are one or more unitaries, district councils and a county council. 



<P>
<P><I>15 Oct 2002 : Column 845W</I><P>
Where changes lead to district-based unitaries in future, we would expect there to be a combined fire authority, but where they lead to a unitary county with no existing or new district-based unitaries, we would expect the county council to remain responsible for providing fire services. This is without prejudice to our consideration of any recommendations on the organisation of the fire service that Professor Sir George Bain's recently announced review might make.
<P>

<a name="21015w82.html_para2">Waste disposal is currently a responsibility of county councils and would become a responsibility of unitary authorities where these are established in future in regions that have an elected assembly.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister if he will make a statement on the outcome of the consultation on the White Paper on Regional Governance.  [74098]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21015w82.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Nick Raynsford: </B> 
 The White Paper <i>Your Region, Your Choice</i> formally invited comments on stakeholder involvement with elected regional assemblies; the closing date for responses was 31 August 2002. But the White Paper also offered the opportunity for general views to be submitted&#151;there is no deadline for these views and comments are still being received.
<P>

<a name="21015w82.html_para3">To date, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has received around 1,100 representations on the White Paper, of which around 200 offered comments on stakeholder involvement with elected assemblies
<P>

<a name="21015w82.html_para4">In addition, we have received around 1,500 postcards in support of the Cornish Constitutional Convention campaign for a referendum on establishing a Cornish Assembly.
<P>

<a name="21015w82.html_para5">We are currently undertaking detailed assessments of stakeholder responses, and of general responses to the White Paper. These will be published on the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's website later in the year. We 



<P>
<P><I>15 Oct 2002 : Column 846W</I><P>
will then set out our further proposals on stakeholder involvement, taking into account views expressed in the consultation.
<P>

<a name="21015w82.html_para6">It remains the case that we intend to introduce a Bill to provide for referendums and associated local government reviews as soon as Parliamentary time allows, with the aim of enabling the first referendums to be held during this Parliament.

<P>
<a name="21015w82.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Nick Raynsford: </B> 
 Information about turnout for those referendums which local authorities hold voluntarily is not held centrally and could only be provided at disproportionate cost. The average turnout in binding referendums which councils held between June 2001 and October 2002 on whether or not their area should have a directly elected mayor was 29 per cent., within a range of 10 per cent. to 64 per cent.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what plans his Department has to encourage the provision of more affordable housing in rural communities.  [73831]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21015w82.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Tony McNulty: </B> 
 The Government recognises that there is a shortage of affordable housing in many rural towns and villages. The need can be for both homes to rent and to buy.
<P>

<a name="21015w82.html_para7">We expect all local authorities to develop housing strategies and to develop local housing need assessments as part of their long-term plans. We believe that judicious use of their planning powers can deliver more affordable housing.
<P>

<a name="21015w82.html_para8">By next year, we expect to deliver around 9,000 affordable homes annually in rural areas, including 3,000 in small settlements. Of these, a proportion will be for low-cost home ownership.
