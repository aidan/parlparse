<p><a name="st_0"><a name="51101w01.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Thomas: </b> 
 DFID has warehouses in three locations containing relief supplies including tents, plastic sheeting, tarpaulins and jerry cans. The warehouses are located in Marchington (UK), Dubai and Miami to ensure rapid deployment to disaster prone areas. DFID do not stockpile medical supplies because this is best managed by specialist agencies such as the World Health Organisation and suppliers of medical relief items which keep stockpiles that are readily available and can be used following a disaster. DFID&#039;s own stockpiles augment those of multilateral agencies such as the UN and Red Cross Movement.

These include: identification of possible consumer detriment, whether there is a reasonable prospect of the OFT being able to find sufficient further evidence to reach an infringement decision, the type of alleged infringement, aggravating or mitigating factors due to the conduct of the undertakings, the precedent value in taking such a case (including whether or not the potential breach is within one of the OFT&#039;s published priority themes) and whether the division is best placed to take the case forward.

<p><a name="st_22"><a name="51101w02.html_spnew6"><b> Ms Buck  </b> 
<i>[holding answer 28 October 2005]:</i> The design and use of traffic signs is specified in national regulations so that signs will be used consistently and safely. No-entry signs are safety critical signs that are used with physical barriers or to prevent conflicts and collisions between opposing streams of traffic. The combination with Except buses&quot; plates has been permitted for contraflow bus lanes in one-way streets or other bus-only facilities that it is clearly not appropriate for other vehicles to use. We do not believe that cyclists should be encouraged to cycle past no-entry signs, and the use of except cycles&quot; plates with no-entry signs is specifically prohibited by the Traffic Signs Regulations and General Directions (TSRGD). There are other sign designs available to indicate routes that cycles and buses, but not other motor vehicles, can use.

<p><a name="st_68"><a name="51101w07.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 DEFRA has conducted a six-month field trial in order to identify potential welfare issues when tagging goats. The trial involved double tagging 125 goats with a range of different tag types. This was done to maximise the data available and the trial was not specifically designed to compare the welfare implications of single versus double tagging. In any event, the results of the trial are currently being been analysed.

<a name="51101w07.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_54">The Department have also conducted research on best practice in tagging goats within the UK and in other EU member states. The critical success factors appear to be use of an appropriate tag (size, shape, weight, pin length, etc.) for the breed of animal, the correct placement and application of the tag and high standards of hygiene. The environment in which animals are kept is also factor determining retention rates, which have an impact on animal welfare.

<a name="stpa_55">Although DEFRA is concerned about the possible welfare impact of the mandatory tagging of goats, my officials have uncovered numerous examples of keepers who have encountered few or no welfare problems when

 Price negotiations between producers and processors, or processors and supermarkets are a private commercial matter in which the Government cannot and should not get involved, provided competition rules are respected.

 The Cabinet Office&#039;s code of practice on consultations states that

</p>
<ul>

</p>


<p>
<a name="51101w08.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_65">The Government are aware that for businesses with obligations under the packaging regulations to be able to plan ahead, new targets need to be made public as soon as possible before the beginning of a new obligation year on 1 January. We are also aware of the need to make changes to the legislation before the House rises in December if the legal provisions are to be in place by 1 January. Ensuring that this timing is met has been the Government&#039;s prime objective this year. In 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>1 Nov 2005 : Column 886W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
addition to consulting on changes to the regulations, the Government are in the process of consolidating the original 1997 regulations with the subsequent amendments. It was clear that if we had consulted for 12 weeks, we would have jeopardised our ability to announce new targets and other changes and make new regulations before the start of the next obligation year. The Government therefore consulted members of the Advisory Committee on Packaging, the industry body which represents packaging industry views to Government. They recognised the problem and agreed that the main objective was to get the changes announced as early as possible and the changes in place. For these reasons, we consulted for six weeks.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51101w08.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_66">The proposals on conditional approval and scrutinising scheme operational plans were put forward because discussions with industry suggested that compliance schemes and large producers may not at present be placing sufficient focus on meeting the 2008 directive targets and on the planning and action that they need to take now in order to do so. The changes put forward were therefore designed to shift the focus onto the 2008 directive targets.

<p><a name="st_75"><a name="51101w08.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 The Government proposed in the Consultation Paper on Meeting Directive Targets in 2008&quot; published earlier this year, to apply an additional level of resource to the scrutiny of compliance schemes&#039; and large producers&#039; operational plans, over and above that which the agency is currently and will continue to be, required to do.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51101w08.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_67">This proposal was widely supported by those consulted and so the Government have commissioned consultants to build an IT based scrutiny system which, together with a qualitative assessment, will allow the operational plans to be considered in terms of their ability to meet the next packaging directive targets, both individually and in aggregate. The Government believe that the additional scrutiny is necessary to ensure a longer term focus on the actions producers and schemes will have to take to ensure that their compliance allows the UK to meet its directive targets in 2008.

 The Department is aware of interest in high oleic oil crops . A very small area (200 hectares) of sunflowers is currently grown in the UK for non-food uses, but due to climatic restrictions, they are not currently suited to wide scale production in the UK. Similar high oleic oil traits, with their potential positive health and industrial oil benefits can be found in oilseed rape cultivars and these may prove to be a more suitable route for UK farmers to access these potential new markets. The National Non-Food Crops Centre (NNFCC) is an authoritative source of information on the use and implementation of non-food crop products and technologies and can provide farmers with advice.

 No specific assessment of this aspect of Cathedrals&#039; financial circumstances has been made.

The remaining need is for smaller grants for medium sized cyclical repairs. In 2005&#150;06, the scheme is providing &#163;1 million to assist cathedrals with their outstanding repair needs.

 Apart from the national museums and galleries, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport does not allocate funding directly to any of its sectors. Instead money allocated to it by Parliament is channelled through our various non-departmental public bodies who are responsible for deciding how and where it is spent. For instance the Arts Council has allocated &#163;1.45 million to a number of organisations in Milton Keynes over the last five years, as well as &#163;20 million in capital for the Milton Keynes Theatre and Art Gallery. Similarly Sport England have allocated &#163;800,000 in revenue and &#163;1 million in capital funding and English Heritage &#163;251,000 in revenue funding. Some of the funding which these and other of our NDPBs spend in the surrounding area will also have benefited Milton Keynes.

The findings were fed into the revised national framework guidance published in March 2005.

 All ground based masts are already subject to planning control so that if the local authority considers that the development will pose a serious threat to amenity, it is able to refuse approval. For masts over 15 metres in height a planning application is required. For masts under 15 metres in height a prior approval application is required.

 The Ministry of Defence has funded an independent study of the reproductive health of UK veterans of the 1990&#150;91 Gulf Conflict through the Medical Research Council (MRC). The findings of the study, which was undertaken by researchers from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, have been published in medical/scientific journals and are on our website at: www.mod.uk/issues/gulfwar/research/health.htm

<a name="stpa_126">The Military Health Research Advisory Group of the MRC considered the findings. They advised that there is little more to be learnt from reproductive studies on these veterans and that they did not expect to be making any new recommendations for further research in this area. We are guided by that advice.

<p><a name="st_192"><a name="51101w20.html_spnew2"><b> Hazel Blears  </b> 
<i>[holding answer 18 October 2005]:</i> The Government deplore all violent crime and are undertaking an extensive programme of action to tackle it; this has the effect of preventing homicides since in many cases homicide results from the escalation of other kinds of violent crime.

<a name="51101w20.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_150">The Government recently introduced the Violent Crime Reduction Bill which will introduce measures to tackle guns, knives and alcohol-related crime, all of which, again, will contribute to the prevention of homicide. The Bill contains measures which will tackle gun crime (such as introducing tougher manufacturing standards to ensure that imitation firearms cannot be converted to fire live ammunition), knife crime and binge drinking which can lead to very serious violent crime which may culminate in homicide.

<a name="51101w20.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_151">There are record numbers of police officers to enforce the law&#151;around 140,000&#151;and 6,300 community support officers (CSOs) on our streets. The Government&#039;s approach has helped drive up detection rates for these crimes. Detection rates are high (98 per cent. for homicide in 2004&#150;05) and the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) are continuing work to improve investigative methods and to spread good practice to ensure that offenders are detected, brought to justice and prevented from re-offending.

<i>[holding answer 26 October 2005]:</i> The decision to take military action against Iraq was not taken lightly. Whatever past divisions there have been over the decision to take military action, there is now a broad international consensus, expressed in United Nations Security Council Resolution 1546, that we and the rest of the international community should work with the Iraqi Government to help achieve a democratic, secure and prosperous Iraq, which poses no threat to its neighbours. We will not be in a position to quantify what benefits and disbenefits have accrued to the UK until our job in helping the Iraqi people is done. It is clear, however, that if the UK with the international community maintain their commitment to the goal of a democratic, secure and prosperous Iraq, there will be net benefit to the British people.

The Iraqi people&#039;s enthusiastic participation in the January elections and the constitutional referendum on 15 October demonstrates Iraqis&#039; appetite for a democratic process which can deliver accountable and effective government.

<a name="stpa_174">On reconstruction, the Iraqis are in the lead on coordinating donor support. The UK is playing its part. The Department for International Development has so far committed more than &#163;417 million to humanitarian and reconstruction in Iraq, and has spent more than &#163;275 million. There have been significant achievements despite all the challenges: there is a stable economy with low inflation; more power is generated; more people have access to drinking water and sewerage systems; there has been a decline in disease rates for malaria, polio, measles, and mumps; an independent media is flourishing; and 2,500 NGOs are registered with the Iraq Transitional Government.

We currently run projects to rebuild Iraq&#039;s military, police and the prison services in the South East of Iraq, and projects to increase the governance capacity of the Ministry of the Interior in Baghdad. We are doing all we can, along with the rest of the international community, to support the Iraqi security forces in their efforts to improve their capacity and effectiveness in tackling the security situation.

<a name="stpa_202">Since 1991, the Department has commissioned a twice yearly survey to understand parents&#039; knowledge of immunisation, attitudes towards immunisation and experience of immunisation services. Since the start of the survey more than 25,000 parents&#151;mostly mothers&#151;have been questioned and their responses fed back into the programme. Our results suggest that mothers are more strongly influenced by the perceived risk of a vaccine, rather than assessing the overall risks/benefits of vaccinating or not vaccinating their child. This is be because mothers are no longer aware of the risk from the diseases that vaccination protects against.

2. Time waited (days)&#151;time waited statistics from hospital episode statistics (HES) are not the same as the published waiting list statistics. HES provides counts and time waited for all patients admitted to hospital within a given period, whereas the published waiting list statistics count those waiting for treatment on a specific date and how long they have been on the waiting list. Also, HES calculates the time waited as the difference between the admission and decision to admit dates. Unlike published waiting list statistics, this is not adjusted for self-deferrals or periods of medical/social suspension.

<a name="stpa_266">The apparent discrepancies between the two data sets during the period 1996&#150;97 to 2000&#150;01 reflect different data collection methodologies. For instance, the Daycare Facilities Survey (DCFS) treats Out of School/Holiday Club places in a different manner to the Ofsted/LA figures. The DCFS counted a Holiday Club place that is available during each school holiday as three places (one at Easter, one in the summer, and one at Christmas) whereas the Ofsted/LA figures would consider it as just one place. The DCFS childminder places count methodology itself underwent major revision between 1991&#150;92 and 1992&#150;93, which explains the sudden leap in the figures there.

Resources for post-16 education and training are allocated by the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) to local authorities, further education colleges and other providers to enable all young people a place in education or training. The LSC also supports a network of specialist colleges for learners with severe learning difficulties and/or disabilities and supports some young people who learn at home because their medical condition does not allow them to attend school or college. Parents of young people can receive advice from the Connexions Service about the types of provision that may be suitable for their children.

The TDA will be reviewing these standards as part of its new responsibilities. Induction training materials on SEN for teaching assistants working in both primary and secondary schools are available, as is introductory training for other support staff, which contains a discrete module covering inclusion, SEN and disabilities. The standards for higher level teaching assistants (HLTAs), for which the IDA is also responsible, require HLTAs to know the legal definition of SEN and be familiar with guidance about meeting SEN given in the SEN code of practice.

 The consultation on higher education applications is primarily about increasing fairness in the system. It argues that an improved application system may encourage some students to apply who otherwise would not have considered higher education as a destination, but it does not attempt to quantify any increase in applicant numbers. Instead, we have put forward a number of important proposals for reform that are driven by a shared desire to make the higher education application system fairer for all students. They do this by giving applicants better information about their higher education options so that they make better targeted applications; by not basing admissions decisions on predicted examination grades, more than half of which are wrong; and through an extended system to allow students whose results are better than expected to apply to other institutions or courses with the safety net of their conditionally offered places to fall back on if necessary. The consultation explains that it is possible to introduce such reforms by 2008&#150;09 and that they might pave the way for a further reformed system of post-qualification applications in the longer term.

 A commission of the Secondary Heads Association (SHA) published a report in November 2004 that found the reasons for a system of post-qualification applications to higher education overwhelming&quot;. That report was a timely one, coming just as Sir Alan Wilson was beginning his work to consider how a post-qualification application system might be implemented. Three members of the SHA group that had prepared that report sat on Sir Alan&#039;s national Consultation Group that was prominent in helping to develop the present proposals for reform. Sir Alan&#039;s report, which forms the current consultation document, acknowledges fully the SHA work and adopts some of its rationale for post-qualification applications and in particular the practical concept of the two-stage approach which is described in detail in the consultation document.

The Low Pay Commission (LPC) is the statutory body whose role is to advise and make recommendations to the Government on the national minimum wage (NMW). The LPC report states that the NMW has had no significant adverse effects on business and employment creation. However, the report notes that the NMW is likely to have the most impact in those regions with the highest proportions of low paid employment, namely the North East, the East Midlands, Wales and Northern Ireland.

 I am encouraged by the increase in recycling levels within Northern Ireland, between 2002 and the last financial year. The municipal waste recycling rate more than doubled, increasing from 8.9 per cent. to a figure of 18.2 per cent. The household recycling rate increased from 10 per cent. to 18.2 per cent. The overall amount of household waste collected for recycling and composting increased by over 90 per cent. All district councils achieved increases in the household recycling rate and two district councils achieved a household recycling rate of almost 40 per cent.

This will help secure energy from biomass, waste, geothermal, solar and tidal stream power sources and will also encourage scope for the use of bio-fuels. Furthermore, it will, in turn, raise innovation and skills levels and also offer significant opportunities for the creation of new rural businesses involved in renewable energy supply. Additionally, householders will be assisted to incorporate renewable energy within their homes thereby reducing both their dependence on fossil fuels and also overall energy costs.
