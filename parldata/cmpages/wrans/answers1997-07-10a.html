To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department in what circumstances communication costs for a blind, visually impaired or deaf person standing in <i>(a)</i> European, <i>(b)</i> parliamentary and <i>(c)</i> local authority elections may be exempted from the limits from the candidate's personal election expenses. [7087]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70710w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 There is no statutory provision to exempt such costs at parliamentary or European parliamentary elections. The limit of &#163;600 on a candidate's personal election expenses does not apply at local elections.

 Guidelines for hon. Members making representations in immigration cases have been published by the Immigration and Nationality Directorate and were most recently updated in April 1994. Officials who handle immigration cases raised by hon. Members are trained and have instructions about these guidelines. My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary and I are currently considering issuing new guidance and will be holding a seminar for hon. Members who would like a more detailed explanation of immigration work.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70710w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 I am given to understand that, following the hon. Member's telephone call to my private office on 4 July, it was agreed that he would discuss Mr. Iqbal's immigration status with Mr. Iqbal himself and members of his family on 5 July and make further contact with my private office if he wished to make representations about the case.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what guidance he intends to give as to the meaning of the word "urgency" in section 97(3) of the Police Act 1997. [6924]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70710w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 The urgency of any case will depend upon individual circumstances and commonsense. It will be a matter for the authorising officer to assess whether the authorisation needs to become effective immediately and the Commissioner notified subsequently. The Commissioner will consider the reasonableness of that decision and may quash any authorisation or renewal which he believes has not reasonably been given.

 The Commissioner informs me that the investigations into the alleged offences by Mr. Aitken are continuing. This investigation is an operational matter for the Commissioner. I am therefore unable to comment on the details.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70710w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 Court proceedings data collected centrally do not record the amount or value of items stolen. Therefore it is not possible to estimate the savings that would accrue if all theft cases involving less than &#163;500 were dealt with summarily.

<a name="70710w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 Court proceedings data collected centrally do not record the amount or value of items stolen.
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department when model byelaws will be in place to enable local authorities to control drinking in public places. [7440]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70710w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 A model byelaw, prohibiting the consumption of intoxicating liquor in designated places within a local authority area after a request to stop by a police officer, has been available to local authorities since October 1990.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70710w01.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Beith: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many probation officers there are; how many are currently seconded to the Prison Service; and what are the projected figures over the next five years.[7216]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70710w01.html_spnew9"><B> Ms Joyce Quin: </B> 
 The number of probation officers at 31 December 1996 (the latest date for which figures are as yet available) was 7,313, of which 543 were working in prisons. The previous Government's spending plans for the probation service, as set out in the Home Office Annual Report 1997, envisaged expenditure of &#163;428 million in the present financial year, falling to &#163;425 million next year and &#163;417 million in 1999-2000. We shall maintain central government support at the planned level this financial year, and consider what level of funding the probation service needs in future years, in order to provide community sentences which are effective and which command public confidence, as part of the comprehensive review of spending on Home Office services. It is then for individual probation committees to determine the number of probation officers which they can employ within total available provision to carry out their responsibilities under the Probation Service Act 1993.
<P>

<a name="70710w01.html_para4">The number of probation officers seconded to the Prison Service in future years will depend on the outcome of the comprehensive spending review and of discussions between governors and chief probation officers about the number of officers necessary to support effective throughcare in prisons, within governors' overall budgets.

 We have advised museum trustees that there will be an overall reduction of 12.7 per cent. in the contribution the Ministry of Defence makes to the funding of regimental and corps museums from April 1998. At current prices, this will mean that the 65 regimental and corps museums in mainland Britain will be required to share a reduction of &#163;138,466 per annum from that date.

 One of the aims of the Strategic Defence Review is to ensure that the Armed Forces are properly equipped to undertake the tasks asked of them. Our procurement plans will therefore be considered as part of the Review, including projects already on contract.
<P>

<a name="70710w04.html_para0">However, during the review there will be no moratorium and projects where contracts have already been placed will continue. Decisions on major equipment programmes not yet under contract will be considered on their individual circumstances in relation to progress with the Review.

 The information requested is not yet available.

 The total procurement cost of the Nimrod 2000 replacement maritime patrol aircraft is around &#163;2 billion. The Department's internal plans represent projections and assumptions which inform advice to Ministers on the affordability of particular elements of the Defence programme. Accordingly, I am withholding the information requested under exemption two of the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information. In addition, disclosure of some elements of this information could prejudice the competitive position of the Department in future negotiations with contractors and reveal commercially confidential data. Accordingly, exemptions 7 and 13 of the Code also apply.

 The Ministry of Defence programme for dealing with the Year 2000 Computer Problem is led by the Director General Information and Communication Services (DGICS). The programme complies with guidelines issued by the Cabinet Office and CCTA Year 2000 Public Sector Group which call for costed programmes to modify or replace affected systems to be in place by October of this year with all work on critical systems completed by 31 December 1998. DGICS heads a coordination group of MOD Top Level Budget Holders to direct the programme. Projet managers have been appointed throughout the Department to oversee work on systems in their respective areas of responsibility. A Year 2000 awareness campaign has been mounted and private sector computing assistance is being provided to Year 2000 projects. It is too early to say what the final costs might be, but work to identify and cost the necessary remedial measures is on schedule to be completed by

However, we believe that farmers should be looking to finish their clean cattle at under 30 months of age and thus to sell them onto the market rather than into the OTMS. The Beef Assurance Scheme nevertheless provides an outlet for clean cattle from low risk, late maturing herds to be finished and sold at up to 42 months of age.

I am sorry that we do not have figures for cases in 1987. However, figures for 1990 and for 1994 and subsequent years are given in the attached tables. For each court and for each year I have shown both the number of cases called in each category and the number of these cases in which evidence was led.
<BR>
I hope this information is helpful.

 In February 1995 guidance was issued covering NHS responsibilities for meeting continuing health care needs. Health and Local Authorities were asked to agree eligibility criteria and a multi disciplinary assessment determines whether the health or local authority takes the lead in an individual's care. This applies also to those patients with learning disability. Detailed guidance on the care of learning disability patients is contained in the Welsh Mental Handicap Strategy 1983. Guidance was reissued to both health and local authorities in May 1996 following the major reorganisations which took place in both structures.

<i>Letter from Leigh Lewis to Mr. Terry Rooney, dated 10 July 1997:</i><i></i>
<P>

<a name="70710w10.html_para7">As the Employment Service is an Executive Agency, the Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your question about Jobplan, Restart Courses, Workwise and Worklink, 1-2-1 and Project Work. This is something which falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of the Agency.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>
<BR>
The information you have requested on Jobplan, Restart Courses and Workwise (known as Worklink in Scotland) is given in Table 1.
<BR>
Information about 1-2-1 and Project Work is given in Tables 2 and 3 respectively. However, we do not hold the information in the format in which you have requested it.
<BR>
It may help if I explain that during 1-2-1, jobseekers are offered concentrated help with an Employment Service adviser during a series of up to six caseload interviews. Figures for referrals to 1-2-1 are therefore shown as 'Cases Opened'. Information on the number of caseload interviews each jobseeker attends or completes is not collected. Whilst they can attend up to six, this is dependent on whether they achieve a positive outcome before the final interview.
<BR>
For Project Work, the reason that the information is not available in the form you have requested is that this pilot consists of two parts. The first part, which begins with a Restart interview with an adviser, is a period of intensive help during which participants are offered the full range of programmes available to long term unemployed people as well as a series of caseload interviews with an adviser. If the person is still unemployed at the end of the period of intensive help, they are required to attend a work experience programme with a provider. Separate information for the same cohort on the number of people referred to a Project Work provider is not available. The outcomes reported therefore relate to both parts of the pilot.
<BR>
I hope this is helpful.

Information on the number of Adjudication Officers' decisions and opinions, and disallowance rates, is contained in a published document entitled "Analysis of Adjudication Officers' Decisions". This provides information on all of the labour market entitlement and sanction questions arising on claims. Copies of this document are held in the Library of the House.
<BR>
Unfortunately, information is not available in the form you request. However, it may be helpful if I explain that a total of 763 sanctions were imposed in 1996/97 for:
<BR>
refusal of a place on a training scheme or employment programme,
<BR>
failure to attend a place on a training scheme or employment programme,
<BR>
giving up a place on a training scheme or employment programme,
<BR>
losing a place on a training scheme or employment programme through misconduct, and
<BR>
neglect to avail of a place on a training scheme or employment programme.
<BR>
Schemes and programmes included in this definition are Jobplan Workshops, Restart Courses, Workwise, Worklink, and Project Work. Employment Service statistics do not identify the number of sanctions relating to each programme, nor do they differentiate between two week and four week sanctions.
<BR>
The total number of sanctions imposed in 1996/97 for refusal or failure to carry out a Jobseeker's Direction was 215. It is not possible to say whether any of these related to employment programmes.
<BR>
There is no specific sanction relating to failure to attend 1-2-1 interviews, but entitlement to Jobseeker's Allowance can be lost if a person fails to attend, without good cause, any Employment Service advisory interview. The total number of sanctions on these grounds during 1996/97 was 110.
<BR>
I hope this is helpful.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what estimate she has made of the number of people aged 18 to 24 years who will face a benefit sanction of 100 per cent. of their jobseeker's allowance at any time during the first full year of operation of the welfare-to-work proposals.

<a name="70710w11.html_spnew3"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 Loans are made with the expectation that they will be repaid. Older students are less likely to repay loans, because of the shorter time they will work after graduation. But they are more likely to have access to other funds, such as savings or commercial loans.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment if he will make a statement on the funding methodology for young people on New Deal who are participating in the employment option. [7690]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70710w11.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Andrew Smith: </B> 
 Employers will be offered a subsidy equivalent to &#163;60 a week for 26 weeks, if they recruit a young person who is eligible for the New Deal. They will be required to provide training, or to release the young person for training, for one day a week. Funding of &#163;750 per person will be made available. The young people recruited in this way will be full employees, in regular work, and will be remunerated accordingly.
<P>
<P>
<a name="70710w11.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Paice: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what targets he is setting for the outputs of the New Deal. [7686]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70710w11.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Smith: </B> 
 In due course, we will be setting and publishing targets through the Employment Service's 1998-99 Annual Performance Agreement.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what action will be taken against young people who consistently refuse to participate in New Deal.[7687]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70710w11.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Smith: </B> 
 All four options under the New Deal will be designed to provide opportunities of genuine quality to help young people improve their employability and get into work. As rights and responsibilities go together, there will be no fifth option on full benefit. Benefit sanctions will be applied to those young people who are assessed by an Adjudication Officer to have unreasonably refused to take up a place on an option notified to them by an employment officer. Persistent refusal could result in a succession of sanctions.
<P>
<P>
<a name="70710w11.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Paice: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment how the New Deal for young people will be linked to modern apprenticeships; and what is his policy towards the development of national traineeships.[7688]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70710w11.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Smith: </B> 
 Progression to a modern apprenticeship may be an appropriate next step for some of the young people aged 18-24 who achieve NVQ level 2 qualifications as part of their participation in the New Deal.
<P>

<a name="70710w11.html_para1">Our view is that national traineeships, which focus chiefly on 16 and 17-year-olds and build on the design principles of the successful modern apprenticeships, will play an important part in achieving the objectives of Target 2000. It is vital that we improve substantially on current levels of participation and achievement to NVQ level 2 post 16 if we are to ensure that young people are qualified for the jobs of the next century. Target 2000 provides the broad policy framework for that, and the work based route has a vital role to play.

 The following table shows by LEA the percentage continuing in school at age 16, the first year after the end of compulsory education. The percentage will be comparatively lower in LEAs where 16 year olds can transfer to a sixth form college or a tertiary college. Others will continue their education and training in further education colleges or in the workplace.

<BR>
The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your question about extending the criteria for attendance at Jobclubs. This is something that falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of the Agency.
<BR>
Normally, a jobseeker must be continually unemployed for a period of at least 26 weeks before they become eligible to join a Jobclub. However, breaks in this period (for example, for short term work or holidays) can be discounted provided that this does nto exceed a total of 28 days.
<BR>
There are no plans at present to change the eligibility criteria for this programme.

I hope this is helpful.

 There are two stages to the application process to enter the personal medical services pilot scheme under the National Health Service (Primary Care) Act 1997. Firstly an expression of interest should have been made by 1 May followed by a formal application. Everyone who has submitted an expression of interest to pilot new contractual arrangements will receive individual feedback on their proposal from their local health authority and will be given the opportunity to re-visit their proposal in light of comments made. A formal application to enter into a personal medical services pilot will need to be submitted to health authorities before 1 November. Applicants will be notified as to whether their application has been approved before the end of December.

 The latest figures on the number of cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease, including new variant CJD, in the United Kingdom were published in a Department of Health press release on 7 July 1997, copies of which have been placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="70710w15.html_para3">The numbers of deaths recorded from sporadic CJD in England and Wales has increased from about 10 per year at the beginning of the 1970s to about 35 per year in the 1990s. No increase in the annual number of cases in Scotland and Northern Ireland is evident since 1985 (when figures became available). Most of the increase has been in the over 70 age group. The increase is thought to be most likely due to improved ascertainment rather than a real increase in the incidence of disease.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70710w16.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Milburn: </B> 
 In 1992-93 the dental fee scale that was in place was delivering a higher target net income than the Doctor and Dentists Review Body (DDRB) had recommended. Since January 1994, the way in which dental remuneration is set has changed; the DDRB has recommended a percentage uplift in the fees. Despite the increase in fees from 1994, changes to the complexity and volume of work done under the General Dental Service have meant that treatment costs in 1996-97 have only returned close to 1992-93 levels.

 Primary responsibility for taking forward developments and negotiations on this directive rests not with the Department, but with the Department of Trade and Industry. The Department has not carried out research into the human health implications of the directive. The European Parliament is due to give its first Opinion on the draft proposal next week, and the draft is likely to be amended further by the Commission. When the terms of the proposals to be put to Council of Ministers are known, we understand that the DTI will be undertaking further studies.
<P>

<a name="70710w16.html_para0">However, in relation to the human health implications of the draft proposal, we should add that whilst the patent system is designed to encourage research by providing a limited monopoly to allow companies to recoup their investment, a patent only gives its holder rights to prevent others from using an invention.

The 1:50 drawings have been produced by Dartford and Gravesham NHS Trust and signed off by the trust's clinical staff.

 The trusts with prioritised Private Finance Initiative schemes which have been offered funds from the support scheme are shown in the list.

Therefore, the amount of support being offered to each trust is commercial in confidence. However the total cost of the support scheme is not expected to exceed &#163;9 million a year, less than 1 per cent. of the total National Health Service capital budget.

 Those trusts unsuccessful in achieving priority status have been asked to cease any further action on their Private Finance Initiative projects and stand down their private sector partner if they have selected one. These schemes will be eligible for consideration by the National Health Service Executive's Capital Prioritisation Advisory Group.

The Secretary of State for Social Security has asked me to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question asking about the Benefit Integrity Project.
<BR>
The Benefit Integrity Project was set up in response to the recent Benefit Review of Disability Living Allowance (DLA). Over the next two years, specially trained staff will make enquiries by postal questionnaire or home visit in around 425,000 cases to establish whether DLA is being paid correctly.
<BR>
Disability Living Allowance will only be withheld from customers who, without good reason, persistently fail or refuse to complete and return the postal questionnaire issued by the Benefit Integrity Project. A reminder and a warning letter, both allowing extra time to comply or respond and offering help and advice, will be issued before benefit is withheld.




<P>

All staff, including those involved with the project, receive customer service training. If a customer makes a reasonable request, either by letter or telephone call, for extra time to complete the questionnaire, it will be allowed.

<a name="70710w18.html_para3">The Secretary of State for Social Security has asked me to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question asking how many malicious calls and well intended but unfounded calls were made to the Benefits Fraud Hotline in the last year; what is each as a percentage of the total number of calls; and what was the average cost of investigating each such call.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>
<BR>
Calls to the Hotline are not collated in the format you have requested. It may be helpful if I explain that since its introduction on 5 August 1996, the National Benefit Fraud Hotline received 243,556 calls up to the end of May 1997. Of this number 57,139 calls were from customers without information to report. These include callers requesting an update on a previous call and wrong numbers.
<BR>
The remaining calls undergo a sift process. Each case is scrutinised to establish whether a fraud investigation is appropriate. 186,417 calls have provided information which has been referred to Benefits Agency fraud staff for further scrutiny. So far, 148,071 referrals have been checked and of these 58,095 cases have been discarded with no further action undertaken. The remaining 89,976 cases have been referred for further investigation. The number of calls which so far have led to the detection of fraud is 11,597, which has generated weekly benefit savings of &#163;35m. There are currently 53,356 calls on which results are outstanding.
<BR>
Discarded referrals include a proportion relating to malicious and well intended but unfounded calls as well as those reporting information already investigated and referrals not containing enough information to carry out an investigation. The number of discarded cases represent 24 per cent of the total number of calls received by the Hotline. Although we do not record the average cost of investigating these type of cases, it is possible, in broad terms, to estimate the average cost of an investigation based on the major components of fraud activity. It should be emphasized that investigations are diverse in nature, complexity and length. The average cost of an investigation is &#163;43.

<BR>
The Secretary of State for Social Security has asked me to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question asking what plans she has to simplify the initial claim form for Disability Living Allowance (DLA).
<BR>
In April 1997, following extensive consultation, a new claim pack designed specifically for claims made in respect of children was introduced. A revised DLA adult claim pack is currently being widely tested with a planned release date of October 1997. The same changes will be reflected in the Attendance Allowance claim pack.
<BR>
Whilst the claim pack gathers detailed information about the needs arising from disability and is necessarily lengthy, the main objective is to enable all customers to describe fully the effect of their disabilities. They are now also asked to provide details of who they feel is the best professional person for us to approach, should further evidence be required.
The Benefits Agency has a commitment to produce forms which are of a high standard and all forms are subject to regular review.

<a name="70710w19.html_spnew0"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 Continuous enrichment monitoring is one of a number of techniques which can be used in the safeguarding of centrifuge enrichment facilities. Selection of the particular techniques to be used is made on a case-by-case basis taking into account facility specific considerations. Operation of the continuous enrichment monitor (CEMO) at Urenco's Capenhurst facility has shown the equipment to be cost-effective and reliable for confirming the non-production of highly enriched uranium (HEU). Technical discussions are currently taking place concerning the more widespread application of the technique.

In order to meet this requirement, Lord Simon has of course resigned as Chairman and as a director of BP. (He has also resigned all his other directorships.) Furthermore, he is not involved in any of the DTI's business which covers BP activity, nor does he receive any papers which have a bearing on BP. This removes any possibility of conflict of interest between his former involvement with BP and his current responsibilities at the DTI.

<P>
<a name="70710w23.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Gordon Brown: </B> 
 The overriding policy considerations that have determined the Government's approach to the student loan debt sale are as follows.
<P>

<a name="70710w23.html_para1">The Government is committed to the development of a wide range of public-private partnerships which involve a transfer of risk to the private sector. This sale will shift much of the default risk to the private sector who have much more experience in dealing with credit risks. The sales will enable the markets to establish a clearer understanding of student loans and could in future encourage financial institutions to play a more direct role in the provision of student support.
<P>

<a name="70710w23.html_para2">In addition, the Government was elected on the basis of a manifesto pledge to work within the spending plans already announced for the next two years. This, and our 



<P>
<P><I>10 Jul 1997 : Column: 608</I><P>
other economic pledges on inflation and taxes, were designed to create the conditions for economic stability and a platform for sustained growth.
<P>

<a name="70710w23.html_para3">Going ahead with the student loan debt sale has a critical role in enabling us to keep this pledge. The public spending plans we have inherited include substantial sales of student loan debt in 1997-98 and 1998-99. Given the tightness of our plans generally and in particular the priority we want to give to education programmes, the Government has decided to proceed with the sale.
<P>

<a name="70710w23.html_para4">These overriding objectives were paramount in the decision to proceed with the debt sale. The Government accepts that this will result in the payment of subsidies to purchasers of the debt but intends to accept the most competitive bid following a competitive tendering process. The size of the continuing subsidies cannot be predicted in advance. We will ensure that we achieve the most competitive outcome consistent with these objectives.

 The Treasury established a year 2000 project in July 1996 with the objective of ensuring that its IT systems are, or will be, year 2000 compliant. The project is managed by the Head of IT services supported by a project team of six. Work undertaken by staff on year 2000 is in addition to their other duties.
<P>

<a name="70710w23.html_para5">The programme of work follows the recommended approach identified by the Central Computer and Telecommunications Agency (CCTA). In line with CCTA's milestone dates, the Treasury has carried out an audit of its systems and will be providing, by October 1997, fully costed plans for undertaking the work needed.
<P>

<a name="70710w23.html_para6">Any costs associated with this work will be met from within existing plans.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will introduce legislation to enable the National Audit Office to investigate the use made of public funds after they have been paid to contractors where there is suspicion that commissions have been improperly paid; if he will authorise research into the powers available for this purpose in the United States; and if he will make a statement. [6683]<P>

<P>
<a name="70710w24.html_spnew0"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 The Government has no plans to introduce legislation in this area, and my right hon. Friend the Chancellor has no plans to make a statement. Any question of illegality would be a matter for the responsible authorities. Officials in my Department will look at the situation in the United States in this respect as the hon. Member suggests.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will change the rules governing PEPs so that AIM stocks are eligible for inclusion. [7322]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70710w24.html_spnew1"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 We have no plans to do. Shares dealt in on the Alternative Investment Market (AIM) may qualify for the tax reliefs available for investment in unlisted companies. These include inheritance tax relief, capital gains tax reinvestment relief and reliefs under the Enterprise Investment Scheme and Venture Capital Trust Schemes. It follows that AIM shares cannot be held directly in PEPs, which are intended for listed shares and securities: they can, however, be held indirectly in PEPs by collective investment through qualifying unit and investment trusts.

Following the Review of the Valuation Office as a Next Steps Agency in 1995, we are committed to further enhance efficiency and effectiveness through, among other things, the streamlining of our network of local offices. These efficiencies which amount to some 30% over 5 years have already been reflected in our forward plans and expenditure projections.
<BR>
The new Valuation Office structure is designed to enable us to:
<BR>
improve quality and levels of service
<BR>
become more flexible and responsive to clients' needs and changing workloads
<BR>
concentrate our work processing functions within fewer locations via a new computer system
<BR>
reduce management layers and develop teams dedicated to specific clients or type of work.

Car parking will be provided in Liverpool and Manchester for essential car users at a cost of around &#163;825 per space per annum and &#163;1100 respectively but the closure of the Warrington office reduces the Agency's overall running cost.
