To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, pursuant to her answer of 18 January 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, column 508W, on departmental expenditure, whether the figure provided was net of the additional annually managed spending that was incurred because of the refinancing scheme; and if she will make a statement.

 The savings figure quoted in my answer of 18 January 2002 was net of the additional annually managed spending that was incurred because of the refinancing scheme.
<P>

<a name="20304w01.html_para0">The capital spend, together with interest, will be recovered through future loan repayment flows to ECGD.

 <i>[holding answer 1 March 2002]:</i> Ministers and civil servants meet many people as part of the process of policy development and analysis. All such contacts are conducted in accordance with the Ministerial Code, the Civil Service Code and Guidance for Civil Servants: Contacts with Lobbyists. Some of these discussions take place on a confidential basis, and in order to preserve confidentiality, it is not the normal practice of Governments to release specific details of specific meetings with private individuals or companies.

 Oftel's broadband brief published in February 2002 states that 60 per cent. of UK consumers and businesses are within the area of a DSL enabled exchange, and that 90 per cent. of those can obtain ADSL services with current technology. In addition, cable networks pass approximately 50 per cent. of UK households, providing an alternative route to broadband.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if she will make a statement on the value and effectiveness of regional knowledge transfer initiatives.  [38520]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20304w01.html_spnew15"><B> Ms Hewitt </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 28 February 2002]:</i> My Department sponsors a number of targeted programmes which seek to help business access and use knowledge gained from research in British and overseas universities and research and technology organisations. We also provide support to help the science base grow its capability to interact with business and realise the business opportunities offered by science. For example, the Higher Education Innovation Fund (HEIF), which incorporates the earlier Higher Education Reach-Out to Business and the Community Fund (HEROBC), has incorporated a regional assessment alongside other criteria.
<P>

<a name="20304w01.html_para2">As the earliest HEROBC projects have only been running for just over two years it is still too soon for full evaluation. Early indications suggest that these initiatives are helping to improve the capacity of higher education institutions to carry out knowledge transfer.

We also provide support to help the science base grow its capability to interact with business and realise the business opportunities offered by science. Each of these programmes is evaluated on a regular basis and, if necessary, the programme may be amended or terminated if it fails to achieve its targets.
<P>

<a name="20304w01.html_para3">I am presently conducting an intensive review of the totality of business support within DTI which will further ascertain whether there is scope for improving the effectiveness of all our programmes, including those dealing with knowledge transfer. The results to date indicate that business end-users are broadly satisfied with the aims and effectiveness of knowledge transfer programmes but that there is scope for reducing their number to reduce confusion and to increase critical mass of the major programmes.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what assessment she has made of the effect of the waste electrical and electronic equipment directive on the illegal disposal of waste goods; and if she will make a statement.  [38124]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20304w02.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="20304w02.html_para0">The directive on waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) is still in draft. We are currently at Common Position stage, and for this reason we have not yet made any such assessment.
<P>

<a name="20304w02.html_para1">The directive requires distributors to take back waste electrical goods free of charge to the end user. This take-back provision may be in-store, on delivery or through an alternative arrangement, eg kerbside collection. Furthermore, the directive requires members states to ensure that users are given necessary information about the return and collection systems available to them and about their role in contributing to re-use, recycling and other forms of recovery of WEEE.
<P>

<a name="20304w02.html_para2">We therefore believe that the directive will make a positive contribution to increasing the amount of waste electrical goods recovered and recycled and we see no reason to anticipate an increase in the illegal abandoning of WEEE in public places.

To ask the Solicitor-General what research has been undertaken to address the observations made in Cm3960, summary of the report, paragraph 19, concerning the downgrading of crimes.  [35960]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20304w02.html_spmin0"><B>The Solicitor-General</B> 
 <i>[holding answer 14 February 2002]:</i> Sir Iain Glidewell noted statistical evidence showing that charges are sometimes downgraded. He found no evidence that downgrading happens when it should not; but he recommended that the Inspectorate should examine cases of downgrading during inspections and research into the reasons why charges are downgraded.
<P>

<a name="20304w02.html_para3">Following publication of the report the CPS Inspectorate (which has subsequently become independent of the CPS, reporting directly to the Attorney-General), has regularly devoted a section of its biennial reports on all CPS areas to downgrading of charges and the application of common charging standards agreed between the police and the CPS. In his Annual Report for 1999&#150;2000, Her Majesty's Chief Inspector noted that in some 22 per cent. of cases to which charging standards applied the police had selected inappropriate charges. In almost all cases, the inspectors agreed that the CPS had then applied the charging standards correctly, usually to downgrade but sometimes to upgrade the charge.
<P>

<a name="20304w02.html_para4">In the recently published "Review of the Criminal Courts of England and Wales", Sir Robin Auld refers to this research as part of the justification for recommending that the CPS should assume from the police a greater responsibility for determining the charges at the outset of criminal proceedings.

<P>
<a name="20304w02.html_spnew4"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 No penalties have been imposed, possessions distrained or criminal proceedings commenced for failure to comply with the legal requirements governing climate change levy. This reflects our commitment to improve compliance through education rather than by penalising with enforcement action during the introduction of the levy.
<P>
<P>
<a name="20304w02.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Lidington: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer (1) what assessment he has made of the impact of the climate change levy on the British plastics industry;  [38589]
<P>
<UL>(2) what review he has carried out of the compliance costs to British industry of the climate change levy in the light of experience since 1 April 2001;  [38617]
<P>
(3) what steps he has taken to consult <i>(a)</i> business organisations and <i>(b)</i> individual companies about the impact of the climate change levy since its introduction.  [38588]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20304w02.html_spnew5"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 As part of the normal process of contact with business, the Chancellor and the Treasury ministerial team have met with a variety of business organisations and individual companies since 1 April last year, and have heard a variety of representations on tax, including climate change levy, and on other matters.
<P>

<a name="20304w02.html_para5">The levy package is expected to be broadly revenue-neutral for both industry and the service sector as a whole. However, the effect on any individual company or sector will depend on a number of factors, including their level of energy efficiency, use of renewables and CHP, and the extent to which they make investments which qualify for enhanced capital allowances.

 The UK has presented a strong case backed by robust evidence to the European Commission in support of the climate change levy dual-use exemption. We continue to press the Commission strongly for an early and favourable decision in the matter.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he plans to extend liability for the climate change levy to <i>(a)</i> voluntary aided schools, <i>(b)</i> foundation schools and <i>(c)</i> city technology colleges.  [38585]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20304w02.html_spnew7"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 Eligibility for exemption from the climate change levy (for fuel for domestic or non-business use by charities) mirrors eligibility for the reduced rate of VAT on fuel and power. Exemption from the levy for voluntary aided schools, foundation schools and city technology colleges therefore depends on their having charitable status. There are no plans to change this.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will make a statement setting out the Government's intentions concerning the relationship between enhanced capital allowances available for energy-saving technologies under the climate change levy and the enhanced capital allowances for tackling climate change and improving air quality which are proposed under the Green Technology Challenge.  [38562]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20304w02.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 As part of the climate change levy package, the Government introduced a scheme of enhanced capital allowances (ECAs) for investments in qualifying energy-saving technologies. The Green Technology Challenge consultation revealed strong support for offering ECAs on a wider range of energy- saving technologies. As stated in PBR 2001 the Government propose to introduce further ECAs in this area and these will be incorporated into the existing ECA scheme.

<P>
<P>

 Energy used in lime kilns is currently treated as being exempt from the levy. This concession has been agreed to last for a period of four years, and reflects a misunderstanding before the start of the tax that energy was being used for non-fuel purposes. When tax becomes chargeable, the fuel used in lime kilns will be eligible for 80 per cent. levy discounts.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20304w06.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. McCartney: </B> 
 There has been a long-term decline since the 1960s in both the coverage and number of occupational schemes. Provision peaked in the 1960s. There is also a trend away from final salary schemes towards defined contribution arrangements, although by far the majority of scheme members remain in salary-related schemes. We welcome the fact that many employers voluntarily continue to provide pensions for their staff, whether it is through defined benefit provision or defined contribution provision.
<P>

<a name="20304w06.html_para0">The reasons for the long-term changes to occupational pension provision are complex. People are living longer. There has been a relative decline in the sectors that traditionally offer occupational pensions and an increase in self-employment. Lower expected stock market returns, ending of contribution holidays, and an increase in complexity of regulations imposed since the late 1980s have all contributed.
<P>

<a name="20304w06.html_para1">But the Government are acting. We are seeking better regulation through the simplification review; better products through the introduction of stakeholder pensions (with 637,000 individual sales within their first eight months) and the Sandler Review of personal investment products; and to reward saving through the Pension Credit.

 The information is not yet available, however, figures from the Association of British Insurers (ABI) state that around 640,000 stakeholder pensions had been sold up the end of December 2001 representing over &#163;1 billion of new pension premiums. Over 310,000 employers had designated a stakeholder scheme for their workforce by that date; a compliance rate of about 80 per cent. achieved within three months of the requirement coming into force.
<P>

<a name="20304w07.html_para4">Stakeholder pensions have also helped to stimulate the wider pensions market. In 2001, new regular premium pensions business rose by 52.5 per cent. over the preceding year to a total of &#163;2.4 billion. Over the same period, single premium pension business rose by 2.7 per cent. to just over &#163;50 billion.
<P>

<a name="20304w07.html_para5">The aim of our long-term pension reforms is to give everyone access to a good value pension arrangement, so that they have the chance of a decent income in retirement. Stakeholder pensions are part of those reforms. Targets for a particular type of pension are not appropriate. The suitability of a stakeholder pension for any individual is a matter for them to decide in the light of their particular circumstances.

 The Ministry of Defence has not conducted any investigation of the mortality of ex- members of staff at CDE Nancekuke since the 1970 report from the Registrar General that concluded that there were no excess deaths or any differences in the cause of death compared to the national population.

 The process of splitting DERA, into Dstl and QinetiQ, was based on the key objective to identify the functional requirements and capabilities needed by each organisation to achieve their future business goals. DERA and the Ministry of Defence experts worked closely together in late 2000 to identify which divisions, teams and individuals were required by which organisation, and the final division aimed to provide each organisation with skills that were both balanced and adequate to achieve sustainability.

We are confident that the PPP process, which is still ongoing, will strengthen links between military and civil technology and improve the transfer of bright ideas from the private sector and academia.

 <i>[holding answer 28 February 2002]:</i> The Department for Education and Skills, in partnership with the Department of Trade and Industry, supports knowledge transfer through projects in higher education funded under the Higher Education Innovation Fund, which incorporates the earlier Higher Education Reach- Out to Business and the Community Fund. Many of the projects funded under these initiatives introduced new organisational and structural arrangements intended to lead to systematic and sustainable improvements in relationships between higher education institutions and business. As the earliest projects have only been running for just over two years it is still too soon for full evaluation. Early indications suggest that these initiatives are helping to improve the capacity of higher education institutions to carry out knowledge transfer.

 The Youth Cohort Study shows that around nine in 10 young people who achieve two or more A-levels by 18 progress to Higher Education by the time they are 21. The differences in participation rates between different social classes largely reflect differences in prior attainment. A research study into the factors affecting participation in HE by different social class groups (which focused on those with, or seeking to get, entry-level qualifications) found that finance is one of a number of concerns people had when they were deciding whether or not to attend university. However, among those who had decided against going to university the main reasons were not related to the likely costs involved but because they wanted to start work or because they did not need a higher education qualification for their chosen career.

<a name="20304w11.html_para6">Not all students who enter higher education do so directly after leaving full-time education at age 18; for example, some spend a period in employment before returning to study, and others take a gap year to broaden their experience.

<P>
<a name="20304w12.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 I am advised that Ofsted employs 2,651 staff, including 216 HM Inspectors of Schools. Of these, over 1,900 are engaged in the regulation of child care and many others are involved in inspections of colleges, local education authorities and initial teacher training providers. Ofsted also employs on a temporary basis around 800 additional inspectors who carry out occasional work in specific areas across the range of Ofsted's remit. In addition, 7,633 school inspectors are contracted to, or employed by, inspection contractors to undertake school inspections under section 10 of the School Inspections Act 1996. Other bodies, such as local education authorities, employ people who monitor and inspect schools, but details are not collected centrally.

 The United Kingdom (UK) works with other law enforcement agencies in Europe with Europol to tackle people trafficking from Europe to the UK. Europol has no executive or operational powers and no capabilities to gather evidence. It is intelligence based and offers a range of products and services to operational law enforcement teams in the European Union. These include analytical support for both strategic and tactical developments and a forum to process requests for assistance in UK investigations with connections in other European Union member states and candidate countries. There is ongoing operational work which is supported by Europol.
<P>

<a name="20304w13.html_para0">Another link between UK law enforcement and overseas partners is through the establishment of Project Reflex, a practical multi-agency taskforce on organised immigration crime. Led by the National Crime Squad (NCS), Reflex was set up in March 2000 and brings together all the key agencies, including the Immigration Service, the National Criminal Intelligence Service (NCIS), the security and intelligence agencies and key police forces including the Metropolitan police, Kent and the British Transport police. Under Reflex, a central tasking forum has been established to plan and co-ordinate multi-agency operations. It is now well established and the NCS is currently co-operating with overseas law enforcement partners on the disruption of organised criminal groups intent on trafficking.

In that regard we have

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department how many community fines were cancelled in the west midlands up to and including the year ending September 2001.  [36121]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20304w15.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Wills: </B> 
 There are two types of non-custodial sentences: fines and community penalties. If a community penalty is breached the offender is brought back before the court for whatever action the court deems appropriate. This could mean that the court imposes further hours on the order or an additional condition. Alternatively it could result in the order being revoked and the offender instead receiving a term of imprisonment if such a sentence was available for the original offence. 1,398 community penalties were revoked in the west midlands in the year 2000.
<P>

<a name="20304w15.html_para14">A fine may be cancelled (remitted) in whole or in part by the courts if circumstances have changed since the conviction. A large proportion of financial penalties cancelled are where a defaulter is imprisoned for wilful refusal or culpable neglect to pay, or where a defaulter is already serving a prison term for a separate offence.
<P>

<a name="20304w15.html_para15">Statistics on the number of fines cancelled are not kept. The value of all impositions, including fines, cancelled in the West Midlands Magistrates Courts Committee area amounted to &#163;7,643,470 in the year ending September 2001.

 More than 3,000 British nationals are currently in prison overseas and looking after their welfare is one of our Consular staff's key duties. They visit prisoners at least once a year, more regularly in many cases. If necessary, we raise individual cases with local authorities to ensure that British prisoners' welfare is adequately provided for, and their human rights respected, in accordance with international standards. This includes pressing for proper medical treatment if a prisoner falls ill.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will give <i>(a)</i> the targets for 2010 and <i>(b)</i> the biennial interim targets for each sector of industry now taking part in a climate change agreement.  [38612]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20304w20.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The targets for 2010 and for the intervening milestone years are set out in each of the 44 sector agreements which have been placed in the Library of the House and are on the DEFRA website. The website also contains an explanatory document&#151;Climate Change Agreements; Sectoral Energy Efficiency Targets.
<P>

<a name="20304w20.html_para3">The targets are expressed in different units in the different agreements. To aid understanding the attached table presents this information in terms of percentage energy saving over the base year for that sector. The differences in magnitude of the targets reflect the differences in scope for energy efficiency measures, taking into account savings already made, and a wide range of conditions in the sector.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, pursuant to her answer of 15 January 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, column 275W, on asbestos, what differentiations she has made between white and blue asbestos waste, including asbestos cement.  [39231]<P>

<P>
<a name="20304w21.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 28 February 2002]:</i> There are hazards associated with all types of asbestos waste. We do not, therefore, distinguish between white and blue asbestos and as I said in the answer I gave on 15 January, all types of asbestos waste have been classified as special waste in Great Britain since 1996 and in Northern Ireland since 1998.

 <i>[holding answer 28 February 2002]:</i> We currently expect that the first results of the Farm Scale Evaluations for certain spring-sown herbicide tolerant genetically modified crops will be published in a peer reviewed scientific journal in the summer of 2003. The independent Scientific Steering Committee, which oversees the evaluations, will publish its advice to Government at the same time.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will make a statement on her policy towards growing genetically modified crops.  [39274]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20304w21.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 28 February 2002]:</i> The Government have an open mind about genetically modified (GM) crops. Our first priority is to protect human health and the environment. No GM crop can be grown in the environment for research or commercial purposes without prior assessment and approval in compliance with the European union regulatory regimes.
<P>

<a name="20304w21.html_para0">In addition, the Farm Scale Evaluation research programme will provide information about the effect, that the management practices associated with GM herbicide tolerant crops might have on farmland wildlife, when compared with weed control used with equivalent non-GM crops. There will be no commercial growing of GM crops until the evaluations are completed and only then if the crops and associated farming practices are assessed as causing no unacceptable impact on the environment. The results of the evaluations will enable a more informed decision to be taken about the possible use of this technology.

a statement on her Department's policy on deregulation in the agriculture industry; and if she will list the regulations removed since May 1997.  [33375]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20304w21.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Department implements the Government's policy on better regulation. This is regulating only when necessary, doing so in a light touch way, consistent with policy objectives, and reducing regulatory burdens where possible.
<P>

<a name="20304w21.html_para2">Regulatory reform can included changes to primary and secondary legislation and administrative procedures. The process was started through implementation of the recommendations of the 1999 Red Tape Reviews and the Better Regulation Task Force's Review of Environmental Regulations and Farmers. This has led to the streamlining of processes and procedures for example by implementing a simplified procedure for granting "own-use" approvals for imports of pesticides with a reduced fee, by streamlining intervention procedures, and by better co-ordinated cattle inspections. The Government's Regulatory Reform Action Plan announced on 4 February contains further proposals for reform by the Department.
<P>

<a name="20304w21.html_para3">The Department does not hold a comprehensive list of deregulatory changes made since 1997. However, in the last two months the Department has achieved the removal of complex rules applying to sheep produced groups and their replacement by simpler general rules as part of the changes to the CAP sheep regime agreed at the December 2001 Agriculture Council, and the removal of a requirement in Commission regulations on arable crops for testing of farm-saved rapeseed for glucosinolate content, estimated to result in savings to farmers of about &#163;1 million. The Regulatory Reform Action Plan provides a basis for recording all such changes systematically from now on.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment she has made of the impact of the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive on the amount of waste electrical goods illegally abandoned in public places.  [38123]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20304w21.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The Directive on Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) is still in draft. We are currently at Common Position stage, and for this reason we have not yet made any such assessment.
<P>

<a name="20304w21.html_para4">The Directive requires distributors to take back waste electrical goods free of charge to the end user. This take- back provision may be in-store, on delivery or through an alternative arrangement, eg. curbside collection. Furthermore, the Directive requires member states to ensure that users are given necessary information about the return and collection systems available to them and about their role in contributing to re-use, recycling and other forms of recovery of WEEE.
<P>

<a name="20304w21.html_para5">We therefore believe that the Directive will make a positive contribution to increasing the amount of waste electrical goods recovered and recycled and we see no reason to anticipate an increase in the illegal abandoning of WEEE in public places.

<a name="20304w22.html_para3">Figures are not held centrally on the number of council dwellings in disrepair in 1997 which have now been brought out of disrepair. However, we are committed to improving the condition of social housing. In July 2000, the Government set targets to ensure that all social housing meets set standards of decency by 2010 and reducing the number of households living in social housing below these standards by a third between 2001 and 2004. Most of this reduction will take place in deprived areas. We currently estimate that we are on track to meet the 2004 target which should mean 550,000 more units of social housing of a decent standard by 2004.

 <i>[holding answer 26 February 2002]:</i> National policy on rural exception sites is set out in Planning Policy Guidance Note 3: Housing and my Department's circular 06/98: Planning and Affordable Housing. It allows local planning authorities to adopt rural exception policies for the release of sites for small-scale residential development within or adjoining existing villages where planning permission would not otherwise be given. Under the rural exception policy an authority must be satisfied that any application to build housing would meet a local need not being achieved through existing plan policies, and that it could remain as affordable housing to meet local needs in perpetuity.

 Members of the boards of registered social landlords (RSLs) have the same fiduciary duty to the RSL as any company director and, if the RSL is a charity, the same duty as any other charity trustee. The consequences of failing to meet their duties will also be the same.
<P>

RSLs' governing bodies are expected to provide leadership and control and, among other things, to protect public investment in the sector. Where an RSL falls short of its obligations, the corporation has statutory powers to take action.

 The establishment in April 2000 of the infrastructure companies, which are subsidiaries of London Underground Limited, enabled shadow running of the proposed arrangements which would operate under the PPP. The infrastructure companies have the benefit of such leases of infrastructure as are appropriate and necessary in order for the infrastructure companies to perform their contracts with London Underground Limited. Ensuring the necessary arrangements are in place is a matter for London Underground Limited and the infrastructure companies.
<P>

<a name="20304w23.html_para2">The leases give the infrastructure companies sufficient interest in the infrastructure to enable them to carry out their obligations under the contracts.

 Officials have been studying the Department's oversight of the way in which the Jubilee line extension project was carried out, with a view to providing advice to Ministers on lessons learned for the Government's role. This work is continuing and its conclusions will be submitted to Ministers. The Secretary of State's agent, Ove Arup, produced an end of commission report on the JLE project. Copies are available in the Libraries of the House.

This is being extended to include the Northern Ireland Department of Regional Development. The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) provides secretariat support to RIAC, and is also currently represented at meetings by two senior officials. RIAC normally meets quarterly.

<a name="20304w24.html_para1">RIAC's activities prior to April 2001 were reported in successive editions of the Chief Inspector of Railways' Annual Report, copies of which are in the House Library. Since April 2001, RIAC has considered and provided the HSC with advice on aspects of all the recent public inquiry reports. Following a review of RIAC and the recommendations of Lord Cullen's public inquiry, its role was refocused in November 2001 to provide strategic advice to the HSC. Hence, at its most recent meeting in January 2002, RIAC considered HSE's draft railway regulatory strategy, and a negotiating strategy for the draft railway safety directive, both of which have subsequently been agreed by the HSC.

 The 2002&#150;03 local government finance settlement meant that, taken as a whole, district councils in Surrey received a grant increase of &#163;2.75 million (2.3 per cent.) which translates into an SSA increase of &#163;3.67 million (3.7 per cent.) All of these authorities benefited from our guarantee that districts would get grant increases of at least the rate of inflation.

 The Government will take into account in setting the spending totals in the Spending Review the additional cost on local government overall of the Travel Concessions (Eligibility) Act 2002. Provision will be included in the 2003&#150;04 general grant for local authorities, and it will be for councils to decide their spending priorities in the light of their responsibilities and the wishes of their electorate. It is not possible to identify provision for a particular responsibility within general grant, and the grant for individual councils will not, in any case, be available until the provisional local government finance settlement is announced at the end of the year.

<a name="20304w25.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 Part 1 of the Local Government Act 1999 (best value) imposes a general duty on local authorities to make arrangements to secure continuous improvement in the way in which their functions are exercised, having regard to a combination of economy, efficiency and effectiveness. Section 15 of the 1999 Act provides the Secretary of State with a wide range of intervention powers to secure an authority's compliance with part 1. For example, he may direct the local authority to carry out a review of the function or to contract out the function. The Secretary of State also has the power, in cases of serious failure, to assume responsibility for a function and nominate a person to undertake it on his behalf.

<a name="20304w25.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 The Housing Inspectorate, part of the Audit Commission's Inspection Service undertakes scrutiny of local authorities' housing functions, including their statutory homelessness duties. The Minister for Housing and Planning is notified by the Chief Inspector of Housing of any inspection which concludes that a service is poor, and the Secretary of State has intervention powers which he can use if he is satisfied that the authority is not complying with its statutory best value responsibilities. For the years 2001&#150;01 and 2001&#150;02 local authorities were required to assess their performance against Best Value Performance Indicator 67, the proportion of homelessness applications decided upon within 33 working days. Local authorities are also encouraged to set appropriate local performance indicators.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Safety is a high priority for the Highways Agency and we welcome the initiative that the AA has recently taken in alerting drivers to the need to take care when using the strategic road network. The Agency's network is one of the safest in the world and, since 1998, the number of those killed and seriously injured on these roads has been reduced by more than 400. However, there is no room for complacency. The Government's Ten Year Plan for Transport sets a target for measures to be taken to further reduce the number of people killed or seriously injured on the strategic road network by a third by 2010, with a 10% reduction in the slight casualty rate.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We are aware of the safety issues highlighted by the AA and, on certain stretches of the trunk road network we have taken, or are planning, steps to improve them. We are delivering 100 small improvement schemes, half of which are aimed specifically at improving safety at locations on the trunk road network, in addition to the programme of major improvements, eight of which are expected to be completed by March 2003. We have regular meetings with the AA and other representative road user groups at which these issues are discussed.</FONT></UL>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The AA identified the A5 between Daventry and Rugby as the 11th most dangerous route in Britain. Since 1999, when data for the AA's survey was collected, a safety scheme between Kilsby and Weedon has been completed. This involved providing improved signing and road markings and the introduction of a Police speed check area. Accident data from January 2000 to August 2001 shows that there has been a noticeable reduction and, although it is still too early to fully assess this reduction, early indications are encouraging. In addition, we propose to install speed cameras in the Watford Gap area and that the speed limit there be reduced to 50 mph.</FONT></UL>

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions, pursuant to his answer of 10 January 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, column 986W, on asbestos, if he will give a breakdown of his estimate of the compliance cost of the proposed new duty to manage the risk from asbestos to include the <i>(a)</i> cost of replacement materials, <i>(b)</i> devaluation of property, <i>(c)</i> premature demolition of property affected, <i>(d)</i> cost of collection and disposal of asbestos cement, <i>(e)</i> replacement of blue asbestos water pipes and <i>(f)</i> legal costs.  [39242]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20304w25.html_spnew9"><B> Dr. Whitehead </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 28 February 2002]:</i> The Health and Safety Executive included the cost of the replacement materials in the estimated removal costs provided with the consultation document. The cost of replacement materials varies by type and location of asbestos. The research the Executive commissioned for the proposals indicates that reinstatement costs could be in the region of 35&#150;45 per cent. of the calculated removal costs. On this basis total reinstatement costs would be between &#163;230 million and &#163;290 million for the asbestos that is actually removed as a result of the proposals. These reinstatement costs include labour costs. These costs were included in the original overall cost estimates.
<P>

<a name="20304w25.html_para4">The Health and Safety Executive do not believe there will be any significant devaluation of property values following reinstatement if asbestos is removed or adequate management of asbestos remaining in place. Any on-going management costs are expected to be only a small fraction of annual building maintenance costs.
<P>

<a name="20304w25.html_para5">The Health and Safety Executive do not expect these proposals in themselves to result in any premature demolition. Other factors, such as the overall desirability of the property, are likely to play a more significant role in any decision to demolish. Under existing legislation, an asbestos survey has to be undertaken and asbestos has to be removed under controlled conditions before a building is demolished.
<P>

<a name="20304w25.html_para6">It is not possible to breakdown any cost by type of asbestos.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions if he will impose a national standard for the issue of pilotage exemption certificates.  [39820]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20304w26.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The Pilotage Act 1987 assigns to competent harbour authorities the responsibility for deciding the qualifications required of applicants for pilotage exemption certificates. They have to consider skill, experience and local knowledge and, where appropriate, knowledge of English. We have no plans to change this. However, we have proposed to develop with the ports industry guidelines on the way this task might be undertaken: our aim is to assist authorities with advice on agreed industry practice. These guidelines would support the Port Marine Safety Code.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20304w26.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The issue of pilotage exemption certificates is a matter for the competent harbour authority. I understand from the authority for the Humber that 40 new pilotage exemption certificates were issued in 2001, compared with 35 in 2000. These are the latest readily available figures. There is always a turnover of certificate holders since crews change on vessels regularly using any port. I understand that almost all the new certificates were replacements of additional certificates issued in these circumstances.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20304w26.html_spnew4"><B> Dr. Whitehead: </B> 
 There are a number of different categories of fire authorities in England and Wales. Broadly speaking, these divide into 34 single-purpose authorities and 16 county fire authorities, where the fire service is provided by the county council as one of a range of services. Single-purpose fire authorities are best value authorities in their own right. For county fire authorities the duty of best value applies at county council level. No overall assessment is available of the costs incurred by fire authorities on the best value process. It would not be feasible to apportion costs incurred by county councils in respect of best value for the fire service.

 Parish and town councils provide a recognised role for involvement specific to people in rural areas, not only for local authorities in predominantly rural areas but also for those in areas which include some rural elements. Accountable parish and town councils can make an important contribution to the work of local strategic partnerships, for example feeding into the establishment of the long-term vision and identifying local priorities to be contained in the community strategy. The role that parish and town councils play should be a matter for local discussion between those councils and the relevant local strategic partnership. The Government produced guidance on local strategic partnerships in March 2001, and on the related subject of preparing community strategies in December 2000.

However, where this is not possible, for example where there are structural constraints, HMRI are prepared to consider proposals from operators for selective door opening.

 It is not possible to list securities on a 'non-recognised investment exchange', but I assume that my hon. Friend's question relates to AIM and OFEX.
<P>

<a name="20304w29.html_para5">The admission of securities to trading on AIM and OFEX does not currently trigger requirements in terms of the Listing Particulars Directive (which would be repealed by the Prospectus Directive). The Prospectus Directive, as drafted, would stipulate that the admission of trading of securities to trading on a regulated market would trigger a requirement for a prospectus. AIM is currently a regulated market but OFEX is not.
<P>

<a name="20304w29.html_para6">However, the position in respect of both AIM and OFEX could change depending on the changes made to the definition of 'regulated market' in the new Investment Services Directive.
<P>

<a name="20304w29.html_para7">Three aspects of the prospectus Directive, as drafted, could give rise to additional costs for companies that seek or obtain admission to trading on AIM: the precise content requirements of both the registration document and the full prospectus; the approval process for prospectuses; and the provision for mandatory shelf registration.
<P>

<a name="20304w29.html_para8">We take very seriously the possibility that the Prospectus Directive might increase the regulatory burden for UK companies.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer (1) if HM Customs and Excise plans to review its policy on the prosecution of offenders detected by road fuel testing units;  [38549]
<P>
<UL>(2) what the policy of HM Customs and Excise is in deciding whether an offender detected by a road fuel testing unit should have his seized vehicle restored or the seizure should be maintained.  [38550]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20304w31.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 HM Customs and Excise have a wide range of sanctions available to deal with offenders detected by road fuel testing units, including prosecution. Customs current vehicle seizure policy in relation to the misuse of rebated fuels takes into account the individual circumstances of each case and seeks to ensure that individuals who are repeatedly detected misusing rebated fuel will not have their vehicle restored. As outlined in the PBR paper "Tackling Indirect Tax Fraud" Customs are currently developing their strategy to tackle oils fraud, and are reviewing the use of all sanctions to ensure that they are used in the most effective way against those engaged in oils fraud.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20304w31.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 Energy intensive installations that are eligible to enter into climate change agreements are those covered by parts A1 and A2 of the Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control Regulations (IPPC) (as set out in Schedule 6 to the Finance Act 2000). IPPC covers all the main energy intensive sectors of industry which are subject to international competition. IPPC sites also have to operate in an energy efficient manner; other sites are not subject to this requirement. The decision to use IPPC to define the eligible energy intensive sectors was confirmed following extensive consultation with industry on possible alternatives. The Government are still prepared to consider suggestions for alternative eligibility criteria, but they would have to meet the same conditions as IPPC, which provides a clear rationale, legal certainty, administrative simplicity, and compatibility with EU state aid rules.

<UL>(2) what the original budget for replacing the LORDS computer system was; what the estimated cost of the project is; and if he will make a statement.  [38599]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20304w31.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The replacement of the LORDS computer system for VAT registration is one component of a series of fundamental changes under consideration to the way Customs process applications for all their taxes and duties. The total cost of these changes, which are far wider than a straight replacement for LORDS, would be in the region of &#163;12.6 million. The original target date for implementation of the new computer system was July 2002.
<P>

<a name="20304w31.html_para1">As part of this, a small number of high priority improvements to the LORDS system are planned for delivery in summer 2002.

 <i>[holding answer 1 February 2002]:</i> Children's hospices have access to national health service funding, the level of which must be agreed by health authorities and primary care trusts following assessment of local options available to support children with life threatening illnesses, and their families. In addition children's hospices will be eligible to apply for funding from the New Opportunity Fund's children's palliative care grant programme later this year that will make available an additional &#163;48 million for children's paediatric care.

 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State is advised on the issue of pesticides by the Food Standards Agency (FSA). The FSA has provided the following reply in consultation with the Pesticides Safety Directorate (an executive agency of the Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA)).
<P>

<a name="20304w32.html_para0">When considering the approval of a pesticide the independent Advisory Committee on Pesticides refers to a large dossier of information and studies carried out on 



<P>
<P><I>4 Mar 2002 : Column 122W</I><P>
the pesticide. The dossier has information on toxicology of the pesticide, including specific studies to address the reproductive toxicity of the pesticide and crop residues data. Only those pesticides which demonstrate an acceptable risk to all groups of consumers (including pregnant women) can be approved.
<P>

<a name="20304w32.html_para1">The findings from the 2000 pesticide residues monitoring programme indicates that standards are being maintained at levels that the FSA believes provide a high level of consumer protection and confidence.
<P>

<a name="20304w32.html_para2">Thus, the FSA believes it is not necessary to issue specific advice to pregnant women on this issue as the regulatory process fully takes the risks to this consumer group into consideration.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20304w32.html_spnew5"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 There have been six locations where cockles have tested positive for diarrhetic shellfish poisoning while other shellfish sampled on the same day have tested negative. These are the Thames Estuary, the Wash, Whitstable, the Menai Straight, the Burry Inlet and Strangford Lough.
<P>
<P>
<a name="20304w32.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Caton: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health when the highly toxic form of diarrhetic shellfish poisoning affecting cockles, which does not show the normally typical presence of okadaic acid, was first discovered by the FSA; at what locations; and what research has been commissioned into its causes.  [37097]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20304w32.html_spnew6"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 The Food Standards Agency became aware of the unusual aspects of the diarrhetic shellfish poisoning tests in cockles in October 2001. This has been seen in samples taken from the Burry Inlet, Anglesey, the Thames Estuary, the Wash and Strangford Lough. Initial investigations into the cause of the toxicity have been undertaken as part of the agency's on-going programmes of research and surveillance on shellfish toxins. The results of these investigations have been used to produce a structured plan of research on this toxicity, which will begin at the start of March.

 The NHS Plan referred to the creation of almost 500 extra secure psychiatric beds and 320 24-hour staffed beds by April 2001. These targets were achieved. Work is on-going to meet the further NHS Plan commitment to develop 200 long-term secure beds by 2004.

<a name="20304w33.html_para0">It is also important to provide alternatives to in-patient care so that patients can benefit from appropriate care and treatment in the least restrictive environment consistent with their needs, including in their own homes where this is clinically appropriate and preferred by the patient. The NHS Plan contained a commitment to create 335 crisis

<P>
<P>
<a name="20304w33.html_spnew1"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 Information about the availability and usage of mental health beds is already collected through annual returns obtained by the Department from providers of services. The returns are made on a financial year basis and the latest year for which data are available is 2000&#150;01. Figures are taken from the annual Korner return KHO3&#151;"Bed Availability and Occupancy". A more

detailed national audit of mental health beds would not be appropriate at this stage because we are in a phase of rapid change. Local services are currently engaged in the implementation of new service models such as early intervention, assertive outreach and crisis resolution, which aim to provide alternatives to in-patient care. Forthcoming departmental guidance on acute in-patient mental health care will advise local services to map their strengths and weaknesses and to plan accordingly.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health, pursuant to his answer of 23 January 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, column 958W, what steps he has taken to ensure that <i>(a)</i> the &#163;50 million allocated to health authorities and <i>(b)</i> the &#163;35 million allocated to local authorities has been spent on child and adolescent mental health services; and if he will make a statement as to the effectiveness of ring fencing of the allocations.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20304w33.html_spnew2"><B> Jacqui Smith </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 1 March 2002]:</i> The funding for health authorities is now in their baseline allocations and is not specifically audited. However we expect health authorities, and their successors, to continue to devote these funds to child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS). The local authority grant is a specific grant scheme and is audited to ensure that the grants are expended on CAMHS in line with the conditions of the grant.

<a name="20304w33.html_spnew4"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 As yet, there is insufficient evidence to support the use of human papilloma virus (HPV) testing as a primary screening tool. The health technology assessment (HTA) review of research into HPV testing, published in September 1999, concluded that the evidence might support testing for HPV only in certain situations, such as the management of borderline screening test results.
<P>

<a name="20304w33.html_para1">A Government funded pilot study of HPV and liquid based cytology testing as triage for women with mild or borderline abnormalities began in April 2001. The HPV arm of the pilot will end in September 2002. Analysis of the data will begin in October 2002 and a report of the evaluation of the pilot will be submitted in early 2003.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what estimate he has made of the number of people who have consumed meat from the offspring of BSE-infected cows since 1 November 2001.  [37867]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20304w33.html_spnew5"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 No estimates are available, but the number of cases of BSE arising in cattle born since August 1996, and considered to be attributable to maternal transmission, is below expectations. In addition, certain key control mechanisms help protect consumers if there is a failure of the controls which exclude BSE offspring from the food chain. These include the ban on specified risk material from being used for human consumption and the over-thirty-months rule which prohibits older animals more likely to harbour infectivity from entering the food chain.

 All health authorities commission radiotherapy services for cancer patients. These services may be provided from a radiotherapy centre located within that health authority itself, or one nearby.

Exercise referral schemes can form an element in the delivery of these programmes. These schemes also contribute to the achievement of milestones relating to the prevention and treatment of coronary heart disease within primary care, and cardiac rehabilitation.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20304w34.html_wqn8"><B> Malcolm Bruce: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health what systems the National Radiological Protection Board has in place to update their radiation risk models; when the risk models were last reviewed; and when the risk models were last updated.  [38275]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20304w34.html_spnew8"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 The National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB) conducts a rolling programme of research and scientific review in order to update advice on the health effects of ionising radiation and the appropriate risk models for assessing these effects. NRPB has issued formal advice in the documents of the NRPB (Vol. 4(4), 1993; Vol 6(1), 1995). The NRPB's advisory group on ionising radiation will report shortly on the risks of leukaemia.
<P>

<a name="20304w34.html_para4">Scientific reviews and reports on risk models are also undertaken by NRPB staff in the context of a United Kingdom input to the work of the International Commission on Radiological Protection, the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR), and a committee of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA. The UNSCEAR 2000 report on radiation effects and risk models included input from NRPB staff acting as consultants. This report represents the current international scientific consensus on the health effects of ionising radiation.
<P>
<P>
<a name="20304w34.html_wqn9"><B> Malcolm Bruce: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health what the National Radiological Protection Board's policy is on the radiation risk from <i>(a)</i> external and <i>(b)</i> internal low level radiation; when this policy was developed; and when it is next subject to review.  [38274]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20304w34.html_spnew9"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 The policy of the National Radiological Protection Board is to provide advice on the health effects of exposure to external and internal radiations which is based on the totality of relevant scientific information. These sources of information include assessment of doses to critical tissues in the body, epidemiological (human health) investigations and knowledge of the fundamental biology of radiation action on cells and tissues. In circumstances where direct epidemiological information is lacking, judgments are developed using knowledge of doses to different tissues, the biological effectiveness of different radiations and the relative radiation sensitivity of different tissues.
<P>

<a name="20304w34.html_para5">Risk modelling procedures used by NRPB have been developed over many years often in conjunction with international bodies such as the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) and the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR).
<P>

<a name="20304w34.html_para6">Current risk modelling procedures are based essentially on the 1990 Recommendations of ICRP and subsequent advice published by NRPB (Documents of the NRPB, Vol 4(4), 1993 and Vol 6(1), 1995). Scientific review of the data and procedures for assessing the health effects of external and internal radiations is an on-going process. The general policy of NRPB is to review and revise these procedures in the light of accruing scientific knowledge and therefore no specific date for revision may be given.

<P>
<a name="20304w35.html_spnew0"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 Health authority and primary care trust allocations are informed by weighted capitation targets. From 2002&#150;03, targets are adjusted for HIV treatment and care and prevention using the latest epidemiology. This will ensure the uniquely skewed distribution of HIV infection in England is reflected in targets for future years.

<a name="20304w35.html_spnew2"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 In 2000, 73 terminations of pregnancy were performed on non-UK residents in NHS hospitals in England and Wales. 2001 abortion data for England and Wales are not available until later in the year. Abortions performed in Scotland are a matter for the Scottish Executive.

1. A finished consultant episode (FCE) is defined as a period of patient care under one consultant in one health care provider. The figures do not represent the number of patients, as one person may have several episodes within the year.<P>

2. The main diagnosis is the first of seven diagnosis fields in the HES data set, and provides the main reason why the patient was in hospital.<P>

3. Data for 1996&#150;97 and 1997&#150;98 are adjusted for both coverage and unknown/invalid clinical data; 1998&#150;99 to 2000&#150;01 are not yet adjusted for shortfalls.<P>
