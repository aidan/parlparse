<P>
<P>
<a name="91208w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Healey: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security if he will make a statement about the outcome of the recent quinquennial Prior Options Review of the War Pensions Agency.  [102323]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91208w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Bayley: </B> 
 A Prior Options Review of the administration of the war pensions scheme was recently undertaken to examine whether further improvements in customer service and value for money could be made.
<P>

<a name="91208w01.html_para0">Part of that review involved an evaluation of the performance of the War Pensions Agency since its creation in April 1994. The Evaluation Report has been published today and copies have been placed in the Library. The Report recognises that, after a difficult start because of very high workloads, the management focus provided by agency status helped bring about steadily improving standards of performance over the last five years.
<P>

<a name="91208w01.html_para1">We have now considered the Review Team's recommendations. These take account of a number of detailed submissions from national and local user representative organisations. I am grateful to all those who participated in the review.
<P>

<a name="91208w01.html_para2">The review has recognised that over the past five years the War Pensions Agency has dedicated itself to serving a very special group of people, those who have suffered injury or bereavement in defence of their country. The main conclusions of the review, which I support, are that the War Pensions Agency should remain a Next Steps Agency within the Civil Service responsible, as now, for administering the existing war pensions scheme.
<P>

<a name="91208w01.html_para3">The review recognises the significant improvements in customer service and efficiency which the Agency has achieved since its inception in 1994. These reflect great efforts by the Chief Executive and his staff. The review's recommendations are designed to build on this work and will be supported by the Agency's programme of change which is aimed at improving its decision-making and appeals processes. This will be done through extended use of information technology and closer working with other government departments and voluntary sector bodies.
<P>

<a name="91208w01.html_para4">We will shortly publish a reviewed Framework Document confirming the Agency's responsibilities for the next five years.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security what levels of take-up of Income Support for pensioners are assumed in current forecasts of expenditure.  [99942]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91208w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Rooker </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 2 December 1999]:</i> Estimates of take-up levels are difficult to forecast. Our current estimates are derived from the Family Resource Survey and show that for 1997-98 between 71 per cent. and 85 per cent. of pensioners by expenditure claimed the Income Support to which they are entitled. Current caseload forecasts assume that an additional 43,000 pensioners will take up their entitlement during the forecasting period. This estimate will need to be reviewed in the light of our plans for a national programme to increase pensioner take-up.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91208w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Hilary Benn: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what plans he has to ban gamma hydroxy butyrate; and if he will make a statement.  [101518]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91208w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 Gamma hydroxy butyrate (GHB) is not controlled under the international drug Conventions nor under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 but its importation, manufacture, sale and supply fall within the scope of the medicines legislation. The Medicines Control Agency (MCA) investigates reports of the unlawful manufacture, advertising and sale of GHB in the United Kingdom.
<P>

<a name="91208w01.html_para5">The Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD), which advises the Government on drug misuse issues, has considered the misuse of GHB on three occasions--in 1994, 1996 and in May 1998. It found that GHB could cause acute health problems particularly if taken with alcohol or other drugs. The Council concluded that GHB misuse was not widespread and did not present a sufficient social problem--the criterion for controlling substances under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971--to be brought under the 1971 Act's control.




<P>
<P><I>8 Dec 1999 : Column: 533W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="91208w01.html_para6">However, as the drug could lead to acute health problems for some misusers--particularly if taken with alcohol--the Council recommended that a number of other measures should be taken. These were that the MCA should be asked to increase enforcement action against illicit manufacturers and suppliers of GHB; publishers should be asked not to carry advertisements for the drug and attempts should be made to reduce such advertising by the MCA and the Advertising Standards Authority; more targeted health education material should be made available about the adverse effects of GHB; and GHB misuse should continue to be monitored. The MCA and the Department of Health have taken action on the above recommendations; and the Home Office is continuing to monitor the position.
<P>

<a name="91208w01.html_para7">We understand that the World Health Organisation (WHO) is currently reviewing GHB; and the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) is considering its misuse within the European Union. If the WHO or the EMCDDA recommend controls on the drug, ACMD would be asked to look at GHB again.

<P>
<a name="91208w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 An officer may be represented by another officer chosen by him, or he may opt to be legally represented in cases where it is judged that the punishments of reduction in rank, requirement to resign or dismissal should be available. The Police (Discipline) Regulations 1985, which cover incidents occurring before 1 April 1999, provide that in such cases the legal representative may be assisted at the hearing by a member of a police force. The Police (Conduct) Regulations 1999, for incidents after 1 April 1999, provide that in addition to having his case conducted by a legal representative the officer may be accompanied at the hearing by a member of the police force.

 Much of the law on gambling is more than 30 years old. Social attitudes have changed markedly in these three decades and the law is fast being overtaken by technological developments.
<P>

<a name="91208w02.html_para0">The Gaming Board for Great Britain and the Deregulation Committees of the House of Commons and the House of Lords have recommended reform.
<P>

<a name="91208w02.html_para1">There is therefore a good case for a wide-ranging review to design a new structure of regulation for the gambling industry and to test public perception.
<P>

<a name="91208w02.html_para2">This will not be a simple task. The main controls are laid down in three major Acts of Parliament--the Betting, Gaming and Lotteries Act 1963, the Gaming Act 1968 and the Lotteries and Amusement Act 1976, together with associated secondary legislation. Reform will raise important issues. The social and economic impact of any change will have to be carefully assessed.
<P>

<a name="91208w02.html_para3">I intend to set up an independent review body next year, bringing together a wide range of relevant expertise. It will be asked to report to me within 12 months on proposals for reform.

 The Northern Ireland Prison Service will have completed five years of operation as an executive agency on 31 March 2000 and, therefore, is subject, like other agencies, to a Quinquennial Review. I am announcing the review today and intend that it should be brought to completion by July 2000.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91208w02.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The Independent Commission for Police Complaints (ICPC) have advised that on 16 January 1998 they issued a Statement expressing their view that the criminal investigation into a complaint, that police had witnessed the attack on the late Robert Hamill but had failed to intervene as promptly as possible, had been conducted to its satisfaction. This investigation was conducted under the close supervision of the ICPC by a senior CID officer of the RUC who had no connection with the Portadown district. The Northern Ireland Director of Public Prosecutions subsequently directed no criminal prosecution against any police officer involved. The ICPC is currently supervising the police investigation into the disciplinary issues relating to the complaint made and this process is at an advanced stage.

 <i>[holding answer 7 December 1999]:</i> There are already several methods by which the Government enable museums and galleries to make acquisitions. Acceptance in Lieu and Private Treaty Sale schemes continue to provide owners with an incentive to offer outstanding works of art to the nation in lieu of inheritance tax. Through the Museums and Galleries Commission, the Department provides funds for the PRISM Fund (71 grants worth &#163;292,567 in 1998-99) and the V&A Purchase Grant Fund (227 grants worth &#163;1 million) thus assisting regional museums to acquire objects for their collections. In addition, the Heritage Lottery Fund has doubled its acquisition budget from &#163;5 million to &#163;10 million. It has recently supported the acquisition of Botticelli's The Virgin adoring the Christ child (&#163;7.69 million) and has helped regional museums and galleries to acquire objects which will significantly enhance their collections, provide educational benefits, and encourage local support and interest. Under this Government, grant-in-aid to the national museums and galleries has been increased: it is for Trustees to decide their spending priorities.

 <i>[holding answer 6 December 1999]:</i> We have been working in partnership with the England and Wales Cricket Board's Development Department and Sport England to promote participation in cricket at schools and clubs for all young people. Cricket is supported by Sport England's Active Schools initiatives, which include the Youth Sports Trust, TOP sports, the Activemark and Sportsmark award schemes, and Coaching for Teachers. In addition, Sport England provides support to governing bodies' junior development initiatives, including Kwik Cricket in primary schools. Kwik Cricket has helped boost the number of primary school pupils playing the game and, working with initiatives for older school children, has helped the number of young people playing cricket in schools and clubs, according to ECB figures, grow to 2.4 million last year. To continue to take this forward, the ECB are in consultation to help design a game specifically for secondary schools, "Intercricket", which will be launched next year. I have attended a number of cricket matches aimed at widening the support for cricket in schools.

<a name="91208w02.html_para9">The Government also place great importance on the teaching of young people to swim, and swimming remains a statutory element of the primary National Curriculum.

 The Foreign Office is providing direct support to the work of the Joint Environmental Markets (JEMU) through the training on global environment issues now offered to all staff across the Foreign Office.

<P>

<a name="91208w03.html_para0">Exporters from all sectors also benefit from the establishment of the joint FCO/DTI British Trade International. They include those promoting UK environmental products and services as part of their company portfolio. British Trade International maintains a close liaison with sector specific bodies such as JEMU. Ministerial support for the sector was most recently evident in the JEMU trade mission to the Czech Republic from 18-19 October, led by the Minister of State, my hon.

[101890]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91208w03.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 We strongly support G7 and EU efforts to improve nuclear safety in Central and Eastern Europe. The EU accession process provides an important opportunity to achieve early closure of reactors which cannot be upgraded to international safety standards. At the (EU) Vienna European Council in December 1998 the EU agreed to use the accession process as a lever to encourage nuclear safety and, in particular, the early closure of the oldest Soviet design reactors which safety experts assess cannot be upgraded to international standards. We fully support the Commission's efforts to persuade the applicant countries concerned--Bulgaria, Lithuania and Slovakia--to put in place credible closure plans for the relevant reactors.




<P>
<P><I>8 Dec 1999 : Column: 540W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="91208w03.html_para1">We welcome the recent announcements by the Bulgarian, Lithuanian, and Slovak authorities and the commitments they contain on closure timetables for the non-upgradable reactors at respectively, the Kozloduy, Ignalina and Bohunice nuclear power plants.
<P>

<a name="91208w03.html_para2">We strongly support invitations for these three countries (as well as Latvia, Malta, and Romania) to open accession negotiations. We expect the Helsinki European Council on 10-11 December to decide to extend invitations to all six. Once negotiations begin, progress on nuclear safety objectives will continue to be part of the accession process as it is now.

<a name="91208w03.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Vaz </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 7 December 1999]:</i> Protection of the Kosovo Serbs and other minorities is a top priority for KFOR and UNMIK. KFOR devotes around half of its resources at present to maintaining a presence in minority areas. In the UK-led sector, there are KFOR soldiers present in every Serb town or village, as well as soldiers deployed to protect individual homes and farms. KFOR conducts patrols and escorts individuals to school and to work.
<P>

<a name="91208w03.html_para3">Protection of patrimonial sites (monasteries, cathedrals and Orthodox churches) is also a priority. In the British sector alone almost 300 troops are on permanent guard of 35 churches and other patrimonial sites.

 On 15 October, the United Nations Security Council adopted resolution 1267 which demanded that the Taliban turn over Usama Bin Laden, indicted in the US for the 1998 bombings of the US Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, to appropriate authorities in order for him to be brought to justice and decided that, unless that demand was met by 14 November, UN member states would impose a flight ban and freeze on funds in relation to the Taliban.
<P>

<a name="91208w03.html_para4">The demand has not been met. The measures came into force on 14 November. A UN Sanctions Committee will be established to designate the aircraft and funds or other financial resources to which the measures will apply.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91208w03.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 The crops in the farm-scale evaluations are being grown in the open and will be visited by bees from nearby hives. Traces of GM pollen may therefore occur in honey from such hives, although in any event honey only contains very small amounts of pollen. The Government, as advised by ACRE and the ACNFP, do not consider the presence in honey of pollen from GM crops to pose a risk to health. Therefore no special measures are being put in place to prevent bees from visiting crops.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91208w03.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 Although there is little evidence that antibiotic resistant marker genes can escape from crop plants under field conditions; the Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment (ACRE), and the Advisory Committee for Novel Foods and Processes (ACNFP), always consider the likely consequences of the horizontal spread of antibiotic resistant marker genes from genetically modified (GM) crops, were it to be possible. If horizontal gene transfer from a particular GM plant is judged to be harmful to human health or the environment, then the release would not be allowed.
<P>

<a name="91208w03.html_para8">The Committees consider that the use of antibiotic resistance markers should be discouraged and that their use will become unnecessary as genetic modification techniques are developed further. Their use should therefore be phased out.

Once construction started, however, because of the tree's extensive root system, it was found that it would be seriously affected. Ways of saving the tree including moving it, at an estimated cost of &#163;100,000 were considered but none were found to be practicable. The Agency concluded that the only option was for it to be cut down. Meetings between the Agency, the District Valuer and the Council to discuss the provision of replacement trees, wider landscape proposals for Pymmes Park and compensation matters have taken place and are set to continue. The final settlement of any compensation due will depend on the outcome of these negotiations. In the event that agreement on compensation cannot be reached the Lands Tribunal is available to make an independent determination.</FONT></UL>

 I refer my hon. Friend to the answer I gave to the hon. Member for Torbay (Mr. Sanders) on 10 November 1999, <i>Official Report,</i> column 610W. The estimates provided were for households rather than properties, since estimates on the latter basis are not available. It is probable that the figure for properties in London would be only slightly smaller than for households.

It includes overview material on the DETR website and details of individual programmes and projects--again on the website and through hard copy reports, Compendia and Newsletters. Details of each project are not held centrally but a list of the Department's research projects will be prepared and placed in the Library of the House within two weeks. Other bodies sponsored by the Department, including the Highways Agency, Maritime and Coastguard Agency, English Nature, the Countryside Agency and the Environment Agency, also fund their own research programmes and publish separate information on these.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91208w04.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 This is a matter primarily for liaison between local authorities and the universities and other higher education institutions. The DfEE, through the Higher Education Funding Councils, does not make financial provision to the universities for student residential accommodation. It is also a matter for individual students to choose the type of accommodation they wish to occupy.

<a name="91208w04.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 Manchester City Council, Gateshead Metropolitan Borough Council, and a number of other authorities, mainly in the north-east and north-west of England, have made a variety of proposals for extending licensing, or the power to licence, to other private rented sector housing. The Local Government Association have also suggested that future legislation should be framed to enable licensing to be extended.

 We are committed to the introduction of mandatory licensing of houses in multiple occupation (HMOs). While we recognise that there are problems of poor physical and management standards elsewhere in the private rented sector, and are considering whether further measures would be appropriate to deal with these, we have no plans to extend mandatory licensing beyond the HMO sub-sector.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions how many purchases of tropical timber have been made by the Environment Agency since 1998; what were the timber species; and for what purpose they were specified.  [101292]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91208w04.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 The Environment Agency uses timber for two main purposes, civil engineering and furniture. The Agency does not purchase any furniture containing tropical hardwood. Civil engineering works are predominately for flood defence projects. As the majority of these are contracted out, the Agency cannot readily provide figures on individual purchases of timber or other materials. Tender documentation seeks to ensure that works meet the highest environmental standards. For example, clauses are incorporated to ensure that new timber from all sources is provided from a managed renewable source. Also, the specification for groynes and piles states that

 The Government published for consultation their draft waste strategy for England and Wales, "A Way With Waste", on 30 June 1999. We have received over 500 substantive submissions from a wide range of interested parties, and over 20,000 postcards urging higher recycling targets from members of the public. These views will also be taken into consideration as we develop the final strategy.

<P>
<a name="91208w05.html_wqn4"><B> Miss McIntosh: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what is the smallest district council area which will be covered by the proposed cabinet structure for local government.  [101284]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91208w05.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 The Local Government Bill, which was read a Second time in the other place on 6 December, includes provision for all district councils, including Watford Borough Council which has the smallest area among such councils, to adopt new constitutions including a separate executive.
<P>
<P>
<a name="91208w05.html_wqn5"><B> Miss McIntosh: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what his proposed timetable is for the introduction of cabinet government into district councils.  [101286]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91208w05.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 Subject to Parliament enacting the Local Government Bill, all councils will be required to put forward proposals for new constitutions, including their proposed timetable for implementation. As our White Paper "Modern Local Government: In Touch with the People" (Cm 4014) made clear, should there be any cases where progress is not being made, it will be open to the Secretary of State to use his reserve power to intervene.
<P>
<P>
<a name="91208w05.html_wqn6"><B> Miss McIntosh: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what exemptions he proposes from the planned cabinet government structure for district councils; and whether the criteria for exemption will include <i>(a)</i> size of district, <i>(b)</i> population and <i>(c)</i> number of councils.  [101285]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91208w05.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 The Local Government Bill provides that all district councils shall have a duty to bring forward proposals to move to one of the new forms of constitution involving a separate executive.
<P>
<P>
<a name="91208w05.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Casale: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what advice he has given local authorities which wish to introduce new local government structures before the Local Government Bill is enacted.  [101978]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91208w05.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 In March, we published the paper "Local leadership, local choice" (Cm 4298), which set out proposals for more efficient, transparent and 



<P>
<P><I>8 Dec 1999 : Column: 550W</I><P>
accountable constitutions for councils and which included a checklist of steps that councils could take before legislation. The paper made clear that any new structure a council adopted should be what its local people wanted and therefore the council must consult its local community widely on all available options before making any change.

<P>
<a name="91208w06.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Paul Marsden: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions on how many occasions the Health and Safety Executive has investigated the Central Trains service between Shrewsbury and Birmingham; and if he will make a statement.  [101161]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91208w06.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 The Health and Safety Executive's Railway Inspectorate (HMRI) carries out routine inspection of the activities carried out by Central Trains. This includes the services between Shrewsbury and Birmingham, but HMRI has no record of specific inspections of these services.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91208w06.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Gordon Prentice: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will take steps to ensure that areas of outstanding natural beauty receive central support for their management and conservation.  [101208]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91208w06.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 The Government have provided the Countryside Agency with an additional &#163;2.5 million this year to be spent on the management and conservation of designated Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONBs). That more than doubles the amount previously available. We expect to announce shortly a number of further measures to assist in the conservation and management of AONBs.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91208w06.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Gordon Prentice: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what recent discussions he has had with the Landscape Institute concerning the possible introduction of landscape policy guidance notes; and if he will make a statement.  [101209]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91208w06.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 Ministers and officials have various contacts with the Landscape Institute. My hon. Friend the Minister with responsibility for housing, planning and construction attended the Landscape Institute awards on 18 November and on 25 November DETR officials met representatives of the Landscape Institute to discuss a number of points of common interest. I am not aware of any discussions concerning the possible introduction of landscape policy guidance notes, although the Institute has advised its intention to update its Guidelines for Landscape and Visual Impact Assessment.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91208w06.html_wqn3"><B> Angela Smith: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (1) what recent guidance he has given to Railtrack regarding trespass on railway lines;  [101325]




<P>
<P><I>8 Dec 1999 : Column: 551W</I><P>

<P>
<UL>(2) what his policy is on the action Railtrack should take following a trespass on Railtrack property that caused severe disruption to passenger trains.  [101326]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91208w06.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 As an infrastructure controller, Railtrack is required under the Railway Safety (Miscellaneous Provisions) Regulations 1997 to take reasonably practicable steps to prevent unauthorised access to its infrastructure. Breaches of this duty are enforced by the Health and Safety Executive's Railway Inspectorate.
<P>

<a name="91208w06.html_para0">The Health and Safety Commission's Railway Industry Advisory Committee (RIAC), of which Railtrack is a member, has been active in promoting industry-wide action against trespass and vandalism. In December last year RIAC produced a booklet "Prevention of Trespass and Vandalism on Railways--A Good Practice Guide" (a copy of which is in the House Library).
<P>

<a name="91208w06.html_para1">The action to be taken following severe disruption to train services following acts of trespass is an operational matter for Railtrack and the train operating companies. However, it is expected that their aim would be to restore normal services as quickly as possible.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what representations he has received about the concessionary fares scheme in Merseyside; and if he will make a statement.  [101693]<P>

<P>
<a name="91208w06.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hill: </B>

<P>
<P>
<a name="91208w06.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Cox: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what plans he has to review the freehold system as it applies to council tenants purchasing their council flat.  [101603]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91208w06.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 When council tenants buy their flat, they buy a long lease, not the freehold. Leaseholders have the right to purchase the freehold of their block in certain cases. However, the right can only be exercised by a majority of residents. As most council blocks are occupied mainly by secure tenants, rather than leaseholders, many cannot meet this requirement.
<P>

<a name="91208w06.html_para2">The Government last year announced proposals to reform the leasehold system and to introduce commonhold. Commonhold will allow flats to be owned absolutely, but there will be rules to regulate the relations between flat owners to enable proper management of the block as a whole. Leasehold reform will, among other things, make it easier for leaseholders to buy a share of the freehold of their block. However, the right will still require a majority to exercise it.
<P>

<a name="91208w06.html_para3">The Government have taken a number of steps to help those who have bought a council flat, including allowing--and in some cases requiring--landlords to reduce high charges, and giving council and other leaseholders an easier way to challenge unreasonable charges.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what is his policy on water companies contracting out their network maintenance services.  [101432]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91208w06.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 Water undertakers are required to carry out their duties consistent with Sections 37 and 38 of the Water Industry Act 1991. Sewerage undertakers have similar responsibilities under Sections 94 and 95 of the Act. It is for the relevant companies to consider how best to meet these obligations.
<P>

<a name="91208w06.html_para4">The Director General of Water Services publishes an annual "Report on levels of service for the water industry in England and Wales", a copy of which is in the Library of the House.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what response 



<P>
<P><I>8 Dec 1999 : Column: 553W</I><P>
he has made to the Court of Appeal decision to allow judicial review of the Rent Acts (Maximum Fair Rent) Order 1999.  [101642]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91208w06.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 The Secretary of State has appointed Counsel to defend the Government's position at the Court of Appeal hearing on 8 and 9 December. We believe that the Order is within the scope and purpose of the enabling power under section 31 of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985 and that the Secretary of State did not act unreasonably in deciding to make the Order.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91208w06.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 The Housing Corporation is required under section 9 of the Housing Act 1996 to approve all disposals of properties by Registered Social Landlords. Where the disposals are to tenants of the properties it is the Housing Corporation's policy not to allow disposals on terms better than the statutory terms.
<P>
<P>
<a name="91208w06.html_wqn10"><B> Ms Oona King: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what guidance Ministers have given to the Housing Corporation relating to approval of contractual purchase sales on terms better than the statutory terms.  [101450]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91208w06.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 My Department has not issued guidance to the Housing Corporation relating to the approval of contractual purchase sales, known as "voluntary sales", on terms better than the statutory terms. The Corporation's consent is required under section 9 of the Housing Act 1996 to disposals and I understand that it is the policy of the Corporation not to grant consents in the case of voluntary sales to tenants on terms which exceed those under the Right to Buy scheme.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91208w07.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B>

<P>
<P>
<a name="91208w07.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 As recognised by statute, the audit processes for local authorities, including parish councils, are not comparable with those of the private sector or charitable bodies, reflecting that authorities largely obtain their funds through taxation.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91208w07.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hill </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 7 December 1999]:</i> The Transport Bill currently before Parliament allows the Secretary of State or the National Assembly for Wales to require workplace parking levy schemes to include exemptions for particular types of premises. Local authorities will also be able to include their own exemptions. Our consultation paper "Breaking the Logjam" sought views on a range of possible exemptions. A detailed response to the consultation exercise will be published in due course.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what representations he has received in the last six months on the performance of the Meat Hygiene Service.  [99291]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91208w07.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 In the last six months, my Department has received several hundred representations from Members of Parliament, Members of the European Parliament, industry organisations, individual meat plant operators, farmers, consumers and others about the performance of the Meat Hygiene Service (MHS), and in particular the 



<P>
<P><I>8 Dec 1999 : Column: 555W</I><P>
extent of veterinary supervision in meat plants, and about proposals to increase MHS inspection charges. Representations have also been made about the need to use fully qualified veterinarians by the MHS.
<P>

<a name="91208w07.html_para1">The Government have listened to these concerns about the future of the slaughtering sector. Following fresh advice obtained from the European Commission, published on 13 October, low throughput slaughterhouses will not be required to have full-time supervision by a vet during post-mortem inspection. The MHS is now reviewing its levels of inspections in individual low throughput premises. Moreover, as the Minister announced on 1 December, the MHS hygiene inspection charges for the whole of 1999-2000 are being held at the levels set for 1998-99. The Government have also given a commitment that the rates of MHS hygiene inspection charges in 2000-01 should not rise by more than the rate of inflation above the levels charged in 1999-2000.

<i>Note:</i><P>

The figures are based on the addresses to which payments have been made which in the majority of cases will be the address where the relevant farming activities have taken place. However, when a single farm business operates on land in various locations, the payment is made to their main holding rather than, in all cases, the holding where the cropping or livestock maintenance may necessarily have taken place. This means that an element of the payments shown will relate to farming activities in other parts of the UK but the payments will have been made to the main holding address in Leicestershire. Conversely, the figures attached will not include payments for farming activities in Leicestershire in cases where the main holding is located in another part of the UK. <P>

<a name="91208w07.html_para3">All schemes have individual 'scheme years' and these, invariably, respect neither calendar nor financial year boundaries. The figures quoted give totals of all payments made under the schemes, which will cover a mixture of scheme years. For example, in the case of BSPS, they will be made up from the balance payments for the 1997 scheme year, paid in April 1998 and the Advance payments for the 1998 scheme year, paid in November 1998.

 Project Aquatrine will provide, for the first time, strategic management of water and sewerage services across more than 3,000 Ministry of Defence sites in Great Britain. The Department aims to achieve this through a Public Private Partnership (PPP) and has today launched a market consultation paper to explore private sector interest in the project. The PPP will lead to greater value for money, investment in the defence infrastructure and enable responsibility for the provision of water and sewerage services to rest with those best able to deal with it while meeting the Department's on-going environmental responsibilities.
<P>

<a name="91208w08.html_para0">The market consultation follows successful pathfinder projects at Tidworth and Lyneham; the outcome will inform the decision on the next phase of the project.
<P>

<a name="91208w08.html_para1">The current plan is to advertise Project Aquatrine in the <i>Official Journal of the European Communities</i> in early 2000, leading to the selection of a partner to begin providing services in late 2003. The project has a potential value of &#163;1 billion over 25 years.

<a name="91208w08.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The UK is fully committed to the Ottawa Convention which prohibits the use, stockpiling, production, and transfer of anti-personnel mines (APMs). The last of the UK's operational stocks of APMs were destroyed on 19 October 1999--three years ahead of the timeframe laid down in the Convention. Allies who have forces stationed in the UK are well aware of the Ottawa Convention's obligations which include the prohibition of 



<P>
<P><I>8 Dec 1999 : Column: 559W</I><P>
the stockpiling of APMs on UK territory. The only APMs stored in the UK are the small amount (some 4,000) that the UK's armed forces hold for training and testing in de-mining techniques, as permitted under Article 3 of the Ottawa Convention.

 The Royal Army Medical Corps undertakes recruiting on a continuous basis, utilising a wide variety of media and the Army Recruiting network. Recruitment into training is good, but it is more difficult to attract already qualified medical personnel. The tri-Service campaign in February and March 1999 aimed at the direct recruitment of qualified personnel has resulted, to date, in one doctor and four nurses entering the Army, with a further six nurses in the recruitment process. Additionally, a major recruiting campaign for the Territorial Army Medical Services was launched in September 1999. It is too early to predict the success of this campaign but early responses seem promising.

 Members of the Scottish Executive and the National Assembly of Wales are entitled to ask for and receive any information which would be relevant to the running of their business. The same principles apply to information that the Ministry of Defence might require from the devolved Administrations. As this relationship includes an exchange of information both ways, there are no charging arrangements in place in respect of the budgets of the Scottish Executive and the National Assembly of Wales to pay for the time of Ministry of Defence officials preparing this briefing.

 As part of the Government's new consumer strategy as set out in the recent White Paper "Modern Markets: Confident Consumers", we have been consulting on the basis of the document "Fair Trade: a consultation document on modernising the law on the sale of goods sold by quantity" on proposals to update and simplify weights and measures law. This includes how the law is enforced.
<P>

<a name="91208w10.html_para11">The consultation document proposed removal of the requirement in the Act for weights and measures inspectors to have a special certificate from the Department of Trade and Industry. Instead, either a general requirement would be placed on local authorities to ensure that those carrying out enforcement functions under the Act had appropriate training, skills and knowledge, paying regard to guidance on training and qualifications in a Code of Practice; or, alternatively I would have power to approve particular qualifications for particular purposes. These proposals have been brought forward as part of a broader examination of consumer protection enforcement (as described in the White Paper), in the light of the range of duties and responsibilities for enforcement in this area.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what plans he has to ensure that British Gas LP Gas is accountable to the Gas Consumer Council.  [101164]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91208w11.html_spnew1"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 The Gas Act 1986 defines gas by reference to substances which are in a gaseous state and does not deal with liquid petroleum gas (LPG) unless it is in a gaseous state when ownership is transferred to the consumer. As a body set up under the Gas Act 1986, the Gas Consumers' Council therefore has no functions in respect of companies' LPG activities. The Government have no plans for change in this respect.
<P>

<a name="91208w11.html_para0">As consumers have done in the past, problems concerning the pricing and supply of LPG, should continue to be referred to their local Trading Standards Department. The Office of Fair Trading (OFT) is responsible for consumer protection and competition issues covering the LPG industry including issues of pricing, supply and delivery and has powers under the Fair Trading Act 1973 to investigate anti-competitive behaviour such as collusive or predatory pricing. Consumers will continue to be able to bring this to the attention of the Director General of Fair Trading.

 We are not aware of this practice of hairdressers supplying dental whiteners.

 There is no EU Directive on dental whiteners. These are controlled under the Cosmetics Directive. A review of the provisions of the Cosmetics Directive as they apply to tooth whiteners is currently under way.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91208w12.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Alan Johnson: </B> 
 The half-year loss reported by Parcelforce is a matter of commercial and financial policy for Parcelforce management. It represents a 6 per cent. reduction in loss compared to the equivalent period to September 1998. Further improved operational efficiency from measures, such as the new express and international hubs at Coventry coming on-stream, are expected to make a positive contribution to the financial position of Parcelforce.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what measures he is implementing to ensure the half-year loss by Parcelforce does not constitute a hidden subsidy; and if he will make a statement on his assessment of the effect this loss will have on competitors.  [101805]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91208w12.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Alan Johnson: </B> 
 Parcelforce operates in a competitive area and is continuing to improve its competitiveness and profitability, as shown by its improved financial performance. The Post Office is required to take steps to make sure there is no undue cross-subsidy between Royal Mail monopoly services and Parcelforce. These include the separation of accounts and, in accordance with normal practice, a requirement that the in-year funding requirement to Parcelforce from Post Office Group is charged at a commercial rate.
<P>

<a name="91208w12.html_para0">In future the new, independent regulator, the Postal Services Commission, will ensure that any cross-subsidy from the monopoly areas to competitive activities is the minimum required, in its opinion, to ensure the continued provision of services required by the Universal Service Obligation at a uniform public tariff (which includes the standard parcels service). The Postal Services Commission will also ensure fair competition.

<a name="91208w13.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Alan Johnson: </B> 
 Since the introduction of the National Minimum Wage (NMW) on 1 April 1999 the helpline run by the Inland Revenue on behalf of the Department of Trade and Industry has received some 95,000 calls. In addition, the NMW helpline arranged through the Central Office of Information took 50,000 inquiries in January to March 1999. The total number of calls received by NMW helplines is therefore over 145,000.

This group will meet as soon as possible to clarify how they can together best help the industry adapt to the changed demand for their products and solutions.

 Selling a car with a false mileage reading is an offence under the Trade Descriptions Act 1968. The key is to ensure that the enforcement authorities and buyers have access to reliable information on the history of a vehicle and my Department has been working with the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions (DETR) on ways to improve this.
<P>

<a name="91208w13.html_para1">As a result the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency are currently considering proposals to make available more information on mileage by introducing a mandatory requirement for mileage to be recorded on vehicle registration and licensing forms. In addition, the computerisation of the MOT testing system by DETR will provide another central source of mileage information on vehicles more than three years old. For newer cars, the Government support the car retail industry's scheme for centrally recording data collected when vehicles are services.

The American pledge to cancel 100 per cent. of its bilateral debts for qualifying HIPCs will only be implemented after these countries have received their HIPC relief. It was therefore very disappointing that the US contribution for the HIPC Trust Fund was not agreed. This means that a substantial financing gap has opened up and this has stalled progress on implementing the revised HIPC initiative. I welcome the US Administration's commitment to pursue a US contribution to the Trust Fund next year.

 My Department has been working closely with the Treasury on the problem of unpayable debt. Our Government have played a leading role in seeking a permanent solution to the debt problems of the poorest countries. We successfully pressed for a comprehensive Review of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative last year. Proposals for revising the HIPC framework were agreed in September 1999 at the Annual Meetings of the World Bank and the IMF. The HIPC initiative will now provide twice as much debt relief, and it will be provided more quickly and to more countries. There is also a much stronger link to poverty, to ensure that the poor benefit from the debt relief provided.
<P>

<a name="91208w13.html_para2">My Department has cancelled nearly all the aid debts of the poorest countries, worth around &#163;1.2 billion since 1978, and we provide all our aid on grant terms, so as not to add to the burden of debt. We announced in 1997 that we are willing to cancel the aid debts of the remaining poor Commonwealth countries who are committed to poverty reduction and the international development targets, who are pursuing sound economic policies, who are committed to transparent and accountable government, and who are bearing down on corruption.
<P>

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Director of the Office for National Statistics (ONS) has been asked to respond to your recent parliamentary question on the number of people employed in Shrewsbury and Atcham. I am replying in Dr Holt's absence.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The most robust estimates at local authority level relate to jobs rather than numbers employed. These figures are available on an annual basis at September each year. In September 1997, the Annual Employment Survey (AES) shows that there were 39,000 employee jobs in the Shrewsbury and Atcham local authority district. This compares with 38,300 for September 1996. Information for September 1998 from the AES will be available in the next few months.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Direct estimates of the numbers of people who are in employment and living in Shrewsbury and Atcham can be derived from the Labour Force Survey (LFS). Figures from this source cover employees, self-employed, unpaid family workers, and those on government employment training programmes, but are subject to larger sampling errors at local authority district level. For 1997-98, our best estimate on this basis is 47,000 which is the same as 1996-97.</FONT></UL>

 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has announced that expenditure to assist further education students with child care costs will increase from &#163;5 million this year to &#163;21 million in 2000-01. These amounts add to the approximately &#163;4 million a year which is already provided by the Further Education Funding Council. This increase includes the additional funding referred to by the Chancellor in his Pre-Budget Report. It is expected that in 2001-02 we will assist about 37,000 students. The funding will be made a ring-fenced element within the Further Education Access Fund and will be allocated to colleges through a formula which takes account of student numbers and widening participation factors. Colleges will be told of their allocation by March 2000.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>As the Employment Service is an Executive Agency, the Secretary of State for Education and Employment has asked me to reply to your question about how many jobseekers have had their Jobseeker's Allowance stopped following interviews with Jobcentre staff. This is something that falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of the Agency.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>You will recall that I replied to you, along very similar lines, in my letter of 11 March. In that reply I said that the Employment Service conducts many different types of interviews with jobseekers, starting at the new claims stage and developing as unemployment lengthens. The new jobseeker's interview is important in establishing whether jobseekers meet the labour market conditions for receiving Jobseeker's Allowance and it is normally at this stage that a Jobseeker's Agreement is drawn up and jobseekers are made aware of their responsibilities in order to receive Jobseeker's Allowance. Thereafter, entitlement to the Allowance is reviewed at fortnightly interviews. We also use these opportunities to offer jobseekers further advice and help in their search for work. Jobseekers are also asked to attend a Restart interview at regular six monthly intervals at which they are offered further advice and information about employment and training opportunities. Beyond this, interviews may take place for a variety of other reasons.</FONT></UL>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Questions about a jobseeker's entitlement to Jobseeker's Allowance could arise at any of the interviews referred to above. In these instances there may be a reference to a Sector Decision Maker (formerly an Adjudication Officer) for a decision on benefit entitlement.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Statistics on the number and types of decisions given by Employment Service Decision Makers on labour market questions are recorded in a quarterly summary--the 'Analysis of Sector Decision Making' (formerly known as the 'Analysis of Adjudication Officers' Decisions'), a copy of which is held in the Library. As questions about a person's entitlement can arise during different types of interviews, it would be misleading to compare the total figures of disallowances with the total numbers of Employment Service interviews in any given period. Jobseeker's Allowance claims can be disallowed on labour market grounds or other grounds . However, some broad indication of volumes can be given by comparing the total number of Jobseeker's Allowance new claims with the number of awards of "nil benefits". This means simply the number of Jobseeker's Allowance new claims that, following assessment by the Benefits Agency who are responsible for Jobseeker's Allowance payment, result in no payment award. This could be for a wide variety of reasons ranging from inadequate contributions to failure to meet the labour market conditions for receipt of the Allowance.</FONT></UL>
