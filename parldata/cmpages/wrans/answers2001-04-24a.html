The groups should include the full spectrum of organisations and agencies involved and may include the Citizens Advice Bureau.

 The Kyoto protocol is an important step in setting the framework for dealing with climate change. We will continue to work for an agreement at the next round of talks in July which will enable us and others to ratify Kyoto, with the aim of bringing it into force by 2002. We are also keen to continue a constructive dialogue with the US as it is important that they remain engaged in global efforts to tackle climate change.

 Revised policy in respect of proposals to locate park and ride schemes on green belt sites is set out at paragraph 62 and at Annexe E to Planning Policy Guidance Note 13: "Transport", which was issued on 27 March. It provides that, in some circumstances, park and ride schemes may be permissible in the green belt where assessment shows such locations to be the most sustainable of the available options. A draft of PPG13 was issued for consultation in October 1999 and the majority of respondents commenting on the proposed changes were supportive.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10424w02.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 It is essential that appropriate use is made of all the available options to dispose of the substantial number of carcases from the current epidemic. The priority in each case is to prevent the spread of the disease and to minimise the risk to public health and the environment. In broad terms, the preferred hierarchy of disposal options is rendering for all carcases; incineration in authorised facilities for all carcases; disposal in licensed landfill sites for sheep, pigs and, with the agreement of the licence holder, cattle born after 1 August 1996; burning for all carcases; and burial of sheep, pigs and cattle born after 1 August 1996.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what account he took of the need to minimise the possibility of spreading foot and mouth disease in deciding to authorise two sites in west Sussex for disposal of animals culled as part of the exercise to control that disease.  [158342]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10424w02.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 23 April 2001]:</i> The Environment Agency has identified a number of licensed landfill sites which are suitable for the disposal of animal carcases. The carcases consigned to these sites are those which MAFF authorise for disposal under Article 5(2) of the Animal By-Products Order 1999. The objective of the authorities responsible for the disposal arrangements is to ensure that carcases are transported for disposal <i>(a)</i> within infected areas or <i>(b)</i> within non-infected areas--but not from one area to another unless necessitated by factors such as the location of abattoirs or landfills.
<P>

<a name="10424w02.html_para0">I understand that landfill sites at Small Dole and Warnham in west Sussex have been identified by the Environment Agency as suitable for carcase disposal but, in the event of their being used, only carcases from the local area will be consigned to them. Any such disposal of carcases will be carried out on the basis of a Best Practice Document (the Protocol) agreed between the Environment Agency, MAFF and the Environmental Services Association (ESA). A copy has been placed in the Library and is available on the Agency's website: http:// www.environment-agency.gov.uk/envinfo/fmd/protocol.pdf.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if the owners of holiday units available to rent will be eligible for rate relief under the Government's measures to help businesses affected by foot and mouth disease.  [158265]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10424w02.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 Owners of any business paying rates, including holiday units available to rent, are able to apply for hardship rate relief. A hardship rate relief scheme, where local authorities are able to grant discretionary rate relief of up to 100 per cent. to any business suffering hardship, can be made available by any authority. However as a consequence of the current foot and mouth disease outbreak, we have now extended the central Government contribution to the cost of the relief from 75 per cent. to 95 per cent, in cases where the business is located in one of the 151 eligible rural districts and has a

<P>
<P>
<a name="10424w02.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 It is clear that the crisis has adversely affected many organisations and individuals and we have already announced a number of measures to alleviate their difficulties. We do not at present have comprehensive information about the scale and scope of the impact on individuals and organisations, the losses they have sustained and the number of businesses which may have to close directly as a result of foot and mouth disease, although we have been actively seeking it. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport has, however, estimated that the cost to the English tourism is currently around &#163;140 million per week.

The address is www.wildlife- countryside.detr.gov.uk/ruraltf/zoos/index.htm. MAFF have provided advice to zoos on the precautions to be taken to reduce the risk of susceptible animals catching the disease, details of which can be found at www.maff.gov.uk/animalh/ diseases/fmd/animals.htm. Members of the public can also contact a telephone hotline (08456 071071) to discover what attractions are open or visit the open Britain website (www.openbritain.gov.uk). Finally, an extra &#163;6 million has been made available to promote tourist attractions, which will include zoos and wildlife parks.

 We have made available additional public investment and fiscal instruments to help increase the provision of affordable housing. In particular, we have almost doubled funding to the Housing Corporation through its approved development programme and have set up the Starter Homes Initiative. Furthermore, Regional Planning Guidance for the south-east (RPG9) sets out ways in which local authorities can identify and respond to local housing need.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10424w03.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 The values attributed in 1999 to the avoidance of road accidents are <i>(a)</i> fatal &#163;1,089,130, <i>(b)</i> serious &#163;146,890, and <i>(c)</i> slight &#163;14,540. These amounts are the values to be used in cost benefit analysis. They take account of medical costs, lost production, human costs based on willingness to pay for reduction of risk, the costs of police and courts, insurance administration, and property damage. Included in these values are the sums of &#163;5,970, &#163;10,380, and &#163;890 for fatal, serious and slight accidents respectively, for the cost to public funds for hospital and ambulance costs and the

<P>
<P>
<a name="10424w03.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Armstrong: </B> 
 We believe that the council tax is working well as a local tax. In our Green Paper on modernising local government finance, which we published in September 2000, we explained that the banding system makes tax bills predictable and stable. A number of respondents to the Green Paper proposed that additional council tax bands should be created. We are considering what they had to say in the context of preparing a White Paper on local government finance, which we intend to publish later this year.

This additional aid will be split between the RDAs for these areas with the south-west and north-west RDAs each receiving &#163;5 million and the North East and West Midlands RDAs each receiving &#163;2.5 million. This support can be used to provide a wide range of direct and indirect assistance, including grants to help sustain business by supporting marketing, reskilling and other activities, promotional campaigns, and regeneration projects.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10424w04.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hill </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 23 April 2001]:</i> This is an operational matter for Railtrack. I understand from Railtrack that the choice of the grade of steel to be used in railway tracks has not changed for many years and certainly not since 1997.

<a name="10424w04.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 Achieving greater energy efficiency in commercial buildings was the subject of an Adjournment debate on 24 January. My right hon.

Friend to follow up the debate and to set out his plans in this respect. A copy of the letter will be placed in the Library.

<P>
<a name="10424w05.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 The three cases, and any others, are or are likely to be subject to formal public inquiries before they are decided by the Secretary of State. On the general question of container port capacity, I refer to my answer to the hon. Member on 13 February 2001, <i>Official Report,</i> column 141.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10424w05.html_wqn2"><B> Dr. Tonge: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what plans he has to allow licensed minicabs to use bus lanes.  [158748]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10424w05.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 It is for the relevant highway authority, usually the local authority, to decide what classes of vehicles, if any, other than buses should be allowed to use bus lanes.
<P>

<a name="10424w05.html_para0">My Department provides guidance for local authorities on bus priority measures in Local Transport Note 1-97 "Keeping Buses Moving". The use of bus lanes by licensed minicabs is not recommended. When a wide range of vehicles are allowed access, enforcement can be more difficult and the benefits to buses reduced. In particular, where licensed minicabs do not have obvious features to identify them as minicabs, it is difficult to distinguish them from private cars and this can encourage more widespread violation as other cars follow them into a bus lane.
<P>

<a name="10424w05.html_para1">Local highway authorities would need to consider these issues, in liaison with the police, in deciding whether to allow licensed minicabs to use a particular bus lane.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10424w05.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 It is the Government's intention to transfer London Underground to the control of Transport for London once the framework is in place to deliver the massive long-term investment that the Underground requires. Our view is that the best way to do this is through the PPP. London Underground is making every effort to conclude the PPP as speedily as possible, consistent with the paramount requirement to maintain and improve safety and deliver best value, but it will be some months before contracts can be signed.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions how many full-time equivalent staff have been employed as environmental health inspectors in British <i>(a)</i> airports and <i>(b)</i> ports in each of the last 10 years.  [157032]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10424w05.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Stuart: </B> 
 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="10424w05.html_para2">Responsibility for employing environmental health officers at airports and ports rests with the local authorities which have responsibilities for the ports' health work. The number of enforcement officers is determined by the local authorities. The numbers of such officers are not held centrally and could be provided only at disproportionate cost.

<P>
<a name="10424w05.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="10424w05.html_para3">The energy projections which underlie the UK's Climate Change Programme were published as Energy Paper 68 in November 2000. Energy Paper 68 presents baseline energy demand projections. These do not take account of measures set out in the Climate Change Programme.
<P>

<a name="10424w05.html_para4">The growth in electricity demand between 2000 and 2010 is projected to be around 1 per cent. per annum, before taking account of measures in the Climate Change Programme.

1. The source of the data in the table is the Family Resources Survey (Great Britain). The latest year for which data are available is 1999-2000.<P>

2. For the purposes of this analysis, Council Tax is taken to be net of Council Tax discount and any deductions to the bill resulting from the receipt of Council Tax Benefit.<P>

3. Those households who do not pay Council Tax (such as students) have not been included in this analysis.<P>

4. The estimates are based on sample counts, which have been adjusted for non-response using grossing factors that control for region, Council Tax band, tenure and a number of demographic variables. Estimates are subject to sampling error and to variability in non-response.<P>

5. Estimates of the size of small changes between one year and another, as shown in the table, may be particularly vulnerable to estimating error.<P>

 <i>[holding answer 27 March 2001]:</i> Under European Union single market rules only meat which has been produced in accordance with relevant EU meat hygiene and BSE protection rules may be marketed for human consumption within the EU. These rules include European Commission Decision 2000/418/EC, which requires the removal of specified risk material (SRM) from cattle and sheep carcases at the slaughterhouse. Single market rules do not permit border controls at points of entry in respect of meat imported from other EU member states, although random checks at points of destination are permissible. The importation of fresh meat containing SRM into the United Kingdom from third countries is prohibited by virtue of the SRM Order 1997. Meat imported directly into the UK from a third country is subject to official checks at the border inspection post to ensure that it complies with all relevant EU and national public and animal health requirements.
<P>

<a name="10424w06.html_para4">In the UK such checks have shown that the vast majority of consignments of meat imported from other EU member states have complied with the relevant EU rules. A small number of consignments, however, have been found to contain carcases with small pieces of SRM still attached. The majority of these consignments (12 out of 14) were destroyed with the remaining two returned to the export approved plant in January 2001.
<P>

<a name="10424w06.html_para5">As a result of these findings, the Food Standards Agency (FSA) has, in each case, taken up the matter vigorously with the national Government of the exporting country concerned and with the EC. The FSA has also put in place risk-based enhanced checks on meat imported from other EU member states. The Meat Hygiene Service and its equivalent in Northern Ireland, has been instructed to check all consignments of imported carcase beef originating from those slaughterhouses which have previously exported carcases with SRM still attached. Since half of the findings of SRM have involved meat imported from Germany, the FSA has instructed that every consignment of carcase beef imported from 



<P>
<P><I>24 Apr 2001 : Column: 213W</I><P>
Germany arriving at a licensed meat plant in the UK must be checked by the relevant authority for the presence of SRM. Local authorities throughout the UK have been advised to make extra checks at meat plants under their supervision known to receive imports of carcase beef, and to check every consignment of carcase beef imported from Germany for the presence of SRM.
<P>

<a name="10424w06.html_para6">In addition, because of the disruption of British meat supplies arising from the outbreak of foot and mouth disease, enforcement authorities have been instructed by the FSA to step up levels of inspection of all types of imported meat, on a risk assessment basis, in order to ensure that all relevant public health requirements are met.
<P>

<a name="10424w06.html_para7">The enhanced checks on meat imported from other EU member states, and the enhanced level of inspection of all imported meat, will be maintained for as long as the FSA considers such measures to be justified. The FSA will continue to monitor the situation.

part-time students are eligible to apply for help, and the total includes &#163;13 million for the fee waiver scheme introduced in 1998 specifically for part-time students on benefit or low incomes. Additionally, since 1998 full-time students have been able to apply for a discretionary Hardship Loan of up to &#163;500 each year.
<P>

<a name="10424w08.html_para0">The Government have made available a range of further education learner support funds for students facing financial difficulties in further education. Discretionary funding has been massively increased to support the most disadvantaged students. In addition, we are piloting Education Maintenance Allowances (EMAs) in 56 local education authority areas to provide weekly support to further education students assessed on the basis of parental income.

<a name="10424w08.html_para1">Table 1 shows the amounts available through the higher education Access and Hardship Funds since the 1995-96 academic year.

 <i>[holding answer 23 April 2001]:</i> Nursery education vouchers were replaced in 1997 by a system of payments to nursery education providers. This system emphasises co-operation, rather than competition, between providers and is a more effective way of ensuring parents have access to the nursery education they want for their children.
<P>

<a name="10424w08.html_para6">All four-year-olds have had access to a free nursery education place since September 1998. From September 2004, all three-year-olds will be entitled to a free nursery education place. Total spending on nursery education will double from &#163;1 billion in 1996-97 to &#163;2 billion by 2003-04. It is intended to fund 200,000 more free places for three and four-year-olds in 2001-02 than in 1997-98.
<P>

<a name="10424w08.html_para7">To help parents choose suitable nursery education, they can obtain information about the early education and childcare provision in their area by contacting their local Childcare Information Service. There is also the ChildcareLink national freephone information line (0800 096 0296) and a website www.childcarelink.gov.uk from which parents can obtain details of provision in England and Scotland. We are also working with several major retailers and other organisations to enable parents to access this information in public places.

 I have had no discussions with other Government Departments on this matter.

They need to be aware of their legal obligations, and can help themselves to stay within the law by displaying notices detailing age restrictions; by asking a person's age if they have even the slightest doubt; and by being more ready to insist on seeing some form of proof of age.

 Our current judgment that it would be premature to decide on acquiring a ballistic missile defence capability for either UK territory or forces deployed overseas is based on our assessment of the threat, the rapidity with which relevant defensive technologies are changing, and the need to evaluate further the potential role of missile defences as one element of a broad-ranging defence response to missile proliferation.

 The Type 45 destroyer is primarily intended to provide effective area air defence against aircraft and missiles and will be equipped with the world-beating Principal Anti-Air Missile System.

 Since May 1997 my Department has introduced and developed a variety of initiatives which will impact on my hon.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10424w16.html_wqn0"><B> Mrs. Gilroy: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport if he will set out, with statistical information relating as directly as possible to <i>(a)</i> Plymouth, Sutton constituency, <i>(b)</i> Plymouth, Devonport constituency and <i>(c)</i> South-West Devon constituency, the effects on the Plymouth Unitary Authority area of his Department's policies and actions since 2 May 1997.  [158025]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10424w16.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Chris Smith </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 23 April 2001]:</i> Since May 1997 my Department has introduced and developed a variety of initiatives which will impact on the Plymouth Unitary Authority area which promote our objectives of access, excellence, education, and creativity and employment. We have published strategies to take this forward including "Tomorrows Tourism" and "A Sporting Future for All", which was recently followed up by "The Government's Plan for Sport". We have tackled the issue of social inclusion taking forward the recommendations of Policy Action Team 10 on Arts and 



<P>
<P><I>24 Apr 2001 : Column: 249W</I><P>
Sport and developing social inclusion policies across all our areas which is recognised within the most recent progress report "Building on PAT10".
<P>

<a name="10424w16.html_para0">We have given more support to the cultural and sporting infrastructure. The Spending Review 2000 secured a doubling of the budget for sport and the largest ever increase for the arts: an increase of 80 per cent. from &#163;186 million in 1997-98 to &#163;336 million in 2003-04. In taking forward our aim to develop the educational potential of culture and sport &#163;40 million has been allocated to developing Creative Partnerships; we have established through lottery funding, the &#163;30 million National Foundation for Youth Music; and secured an additional &#163;130 million for primary schools sports and arts facilities through the Space for Sport and the Arts programme. With &#163;120 million of central Government and lottery funding we will be providing a school sports co-ordinator in one in four secondary schools to work with local primary and special schools to improve sporting provision and physical education for children in the most deprived areas. We have delivered free access to national museums for children and the over 60's and additional money will be provided to allow this to be extended to everyone in December 2001. We have commissioned a taskforce which is currently considering the issues facing non-national museums in the regions.
<P>

<a name="10424w16.html_para1">We have made improvements in the way the lottery is spent to ensure a fairer distribution. The introduction of the New Opportunities Fund for spending on health, education and the environment has made a real difference to communities everywhere. For instance it has invested &#163;120 million to support the People's Network, which will enable all 4,300 public libraries to offer free public internet access through UK on-line centres; and a further &#163;50 million to stimulate development of content to support the Network.
<P>

<a name="10424w16.html_para2">We have set up a Regional Cultural Consortium in each of the English regions outside London to champion culture and creativity, including heritage, sport and tourism, and to draw up regional cultural strategies identifying regional objectives and priorities.
<P>

<a name="10424w16.html_para3">We have published a Green Paper "Culture and Creativity: The Next Ten Years", setting out how individual creative talent can be given the support it needs from childhood to flourish; how artists and cultural institutions can be freed from bureaucratic controls; and how the freedom to explore and enjoy creativity and culture can be made available to all.
<P>

<a name="10424w16.html_para4">Through their commitment to public service broadcasting, the Government have helped to foster an environment in which a creative, commercially successful broadcasting industry provides a wide range of UK-make, high quality, original programmes catering for all viewers and listeners. We have ensured a secure funding base for the BBC and S4C, while giving them the freedom to develop commercial operations which complement and support their public service remit. We have made clear in the Communications White Paper that public service broadcasting will continue to have a key role to play in the digital future. The Government have introduced free television licences for people aged 75 or over from 1 November last year.

 It is an offence to sell a National Lottery ticket to a child under 16 years of age and my Department, and the National Lottery regulator, the National Lottery Commission, are concerned to prevent such sales. The National Lottery operator, Camelot Group plc, makes test purchases using 16-year-olds who appear younger, but cannot make test sales using children under 16. Trading standards officers are able to make test purchases using children under 16. Advice to them on the use of children to make test purchases was included in Home Office Circular 17/1992. A copy of this Circular is in the Libraries of the House.

<a name="10424w17.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Alan Howarth: </B> 
 Overall, the quality of Annual Library Plans has much improved since they were introduced in 1998. I see this as a very positive development, indicative of the increased importance that library authorities are attaching to their duties. This is clearly demonstrated by the fact that for the first time more authorities have been assessed as providing 'good' plans than submitting 'satisfactory' plans. In 2000, 73 library authorities were rated as 'good', 71 plans were 'satisfactory', and only five were rated as 'poor'; we found none to be unacceptable. I am taking steps to help the five authorities rated as 'poor' improve their position.

 <i>[holding answer 9 April 2001]:</i> The Veterinary Products Committee gives advice to Ministers with respect to safety, quality and efficacy in relation to the veterinary use of any substance or article to which provisions of the Medicines Act may apply. The Advisory Board on the Registration of Homoeopathic Products offers advice to Ministers on the registration of homoeopathic products, whether for the treatment of humans or animals. However, homoeopathic products for the treatment of food producing species are not covered by the registration scheme and are subject to the requirement to obtain a marketing authorisation.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10424w17.html_spnew11"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 23 March 2001]:</i> The onus for providing evidence that supports the need for research into the effectiveness of borax against foot and mouth disease lies with the manufacturer. Products that are presented for the treatment or prevention of disease in animals, or which have that function, must be authorised under the terms of the Marketing Authorisations for Veterinary Medicinal Products Regulations 1994 before they can be legally sold or supplied in the United Kingdom. This ensures that such products are properly assessed and are demonstrated as being safe, of consistent good quality and effective when used in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. The manufacturer of any such products may apply for such authorisation. No such application has been made for borax.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10424w17.html_spnew12"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 2 April 2001]:</i> The viability of the foot and mouth disease virus in meat depends on the treatment and preparation of the meat, and on the presence of bones. The drop in pH during rigor mortis generally kills the virus in meat, but viable virus can be found in the bone marrow and lymph glands. Vacuum packing does not affect the viability of the virus.

 In the course of normal surveillance of individuals entering the UK, Customs officers do become aware of personal imports of foreign meat or meat products from third countries. Where they suspect the import is not permitted, they notify either local authority officials or MAFF officials where appropriate who take the necessary action. In most cases this involves seizing and destroying the product.

 <i>[holding answer 4 April 2001]:</i> I understand that the owners of Dawn Cardington took a decision to close their abattoir, stating that this was in order to protect their boning and cutting plant on the same site from the risk of infection with foot and mouth disease. The Government have sought to encourage operators in the red meat industry to participate in the market in as normal a manner as possible. Guidance to slaughterhouse owners has been issued by the state veterinary service on the consequences of a confirmed case being detected on their premises. This can be found on the foot and mouth website under moving livestock to slaughter at http://www.maff.gov.uk/.
