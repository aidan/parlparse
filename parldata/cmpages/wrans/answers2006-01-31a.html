<p><a name="st_0"><a name="60131w01.html_spnew0"><b> Ms Buck: </b> 
 No. As now, a person entitled to the statutory minimum can agree to give up that entitlement and accept an alternative concessionary fare scheme instead (e.g. tokens). They would then forego their entitlement to the statutory minimum for an agreed period. However, they must have the option to choose the statutory minimum.

 In the Future of Transport White Paper (Cm 6234) the Government set out that, without radical measures, including more effective demand management, road congestion would get worse.

But moving to a national system of road pricing would be a huge and complex task. That is why the Road Pricing Feasibility Study, which was published alongside the White Paper, recommended that local or regional schemes should be used to pilot approaches to road pricing.

 The principal action being taken by Government to tackle the import of illegally logged timber is implementation of the Forestry Law Enforcement Governance and Trade (FLEGT) regulation. This developed out of the European Commission&#039;s FLEGT Action Plan, published in May 2003. It describes a package of measures to tackle illegal logging, including proposals that the EU enters into partnership agreements with timber producing countries to establish a licensing system designed to identify products and license them for export to the EU.

<a name="stpa_43">The Government are delighted that the proposal for a licensing system was adopted by the EU in December 2005, under the UK&#039;s Presidency. Government believe that as a first step to address illegal logging, it is necessary to build consensus with producing countries and make sure that we do not discriminate against legitimate trade. The EU FLEGT licensing scheme, with its innovative approach of bilateral trade agreements and development assistance for improving forest governance, will achieve this in the first instance.

 The QinetiQ flotation is not unsuitable for private investors.

<a name="stpa_82">The level of fees under the Licensing Act 2003 is currently being reviewed by the Independent Licensing Fees Review Panel, chaired by Sir Les Elton.

during the next stage of their work. Two of those areas are licensing authority income and costs and the consequence of the new fees regime on not-for-profit groups. The full Interim Report can be accessed at: http://www.culture.gov.uk/alcohol&#095;and&#095;entertainment/monitoring&#095;and&#095;evaluation/ifreview.htm. The Panel have recently written to all Licensing Authorities in England and Wales to request details of the income they have received under the new licensing regime from different licensed sectors, including sports clubs and village and community halls, which they believe they require in order to support them in the next stage of their work. The Panel are due to present their Final Report and recommendations to Government in the autumn.

 DFID&#039;s aid allocation to particular countries is guided by a formula which takes into account the country&#039;s level of poverty and consequent need for aid, and its institutional capacity to make effective use of aid.

These can include support through Governments to deliver their poverty

<a name="60131w12.html_para9">
<a name="stpa_112">DFID believes that effective aid partnerships with developing country Governments depend on shared commitments to reducing poverty and achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDG)s; respecting human rights and other international obligations; and strengthening public financial management to reduce the risk of corruption. DFID uses these commitments both as our criteria for deciding whether to provide aid through Government, and as conditions for our aid. Once aid has been committed to a partner Government, DFID will only reduce it if the Government moves away from one of these three partnership commitments.

The results of a national assessment due in a week&#039;s time will determine the level of current and future needs but it is clear from my recent visit that the levels of malnutrition are unacceptably high and urgent action is needed by all parties; Government, donors, NGOs, and communities to help save the lives of those at risk.

<p>
<a name="60131w13.html_para9">
<a name="stpa_122">Food aid is critical in saving lives in an emergency but, on its own, it will not prevent another crisis happening. Each drought increases the numbers of people facing hunger. People are unable to escape poverty even in good years because they have lost or sold the assets they need to rebuild their lives. If people are to escape from this trap they need concerted effort by Governments to invest in these areas. Our support to education and health go some way towards helping. The provision of safety nets such as timely, adequate and guaranteed payments of cash or food on a regular basis to the neediest also helps rebuild lives.

For example, we have pledged $20 million in support of a new Infrastructure Consortium in Africa to better co-ordinate and target financing for regional infrastructure. We have also pledged $30 million towards an Investment Climate Facility which will help make Africa a better place for business and commerce (e.g. by reforming customs to support regional trade integration).

 The Counter Narcotics Trust Fund (CNTF) has been created to give the Afghans greater ownership of the counter-narcotics agenda and ensure assistance is targeted effectively. The Government of Afghanistan are encouraging international donors to make un-earmarked contributions to the fund to give the Government maximum flexibility to allocate funding in accordance with the four priorities highlighted in its National Drugs Control Strategy: disrupting the drugs trade by targeting traffickers and their backers; strengthening and diversifying legal rural livelihoods; reducing the demand for illicit drugs and treatment of problem drug users; and developing state institutions at the central and provincial level. However, in recognition of the budgetary and policy constraints under which different donors operate, it will be possible to earmark funds for one or more of the following eight pillars of activity (building institutions, information campaign, alternative livelihoods, criminal justice, law enforcement, eradication, demand reduction, regional co-operation). It is not envisaged that the wages of permanent counter-narcotics staff working for the Ministry of Counter Narcotics will be funded through the CNTF&#151;rather the fund will be used to cover projectised activity.

Under the Neighbourhood Policing Fund (NPF) we are investing &#163;88 million in 2006&#150;07 and &#163;340 million in 2007&#150;08 to help the police service to recruit 24,000 CSOs by 2008.

<a name="60131w24.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_188">The ruling of the European Court of Human Rights on 4 May 2001 relating to deaths in Northern Ireland involving the security forces found that the United Kingdom failed in those cases to meet its obligations to secure the right to life in Article 2 of the European Convention of Human Rights. Objections similar to those raised in the ruling of 4 May 2001 were made to the investigation and inquest into the deaths of the three IRA terrorists in Gibraltar, but the inquest jury decided by a majority that the deaths were lawful. I understand that the Gibraltar case does not come within the remit of the historic inquiry team of the Police Service of Northern Ireland, which is to review unresolved deaths that took place in Northern Ireland only. Furthermore, the Royal Military Police is not investigating these deaths.

 The Police Service of Northern Ireland have advised that their interpretation of &#039;suspicious death&#039; is murder and manslaughter. I would refer the hon.

 I recently announced a total redesign of the way in which out-patient services are delivered to ensure that, by March 2008, no patient will be waiting more than 13 weeks for their out-patient appointment following referral by their GP.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60131w31.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_240">Central to this will be the development of a new range of clinical assessment and diagnostic services&#151;Integrated Clinical Assessment and Treatment Services (ICATS), provided in a variety of primary and secondary care settings. This will ensure that all patients are seen quickly by the most appropriate healthcare professional and will include a range of assessment, treatment, diagnostic and advisory services. A new Electronic Referrals Management System is being established to support ICATS and to ensure that patients have a central point of contact and will be informed of the next step in their treatment within five days of being referred by a GP.
</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_223">You recently asked the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland a Parliamentary Question about how many households in Northern Ireland are not connected to the mains water supply, broken down by constituency (45482). I have been asked to reply as this issue falls within my responsibility as Chief Executive of Water Service.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_224">It is estimated that less than 1 per cent. of households in Northern Ireland are not connected to the public water supply. Water Service does not, at present, have a database of all household customers connected to mains water and cannot therefore supply the information on a constituency basis. However, a comprehensive customer database is currently being developed in preparation for the proposed introduction of domestic charging from April 2007 and this will identify any households not connected to the public water supply.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_226">It is estimated that less than 1 per cent. of households in Northern Ireland are currently not served by the public water supply and connecting all these, wholly at the public expense, could cost up to &#163;20 million.</p>

<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_227">While Water Service currently has a duty to provide water services, it is not required to do anything which is not practicable at a reasonable cost. For this reason, Water Service has always operated a policy of reasonable cost allowances for the purpose of determining whether applications for first time services can be fully met at public expense. The allowances for watermain schemes are &#163;5,000 for properties, which were occupied and on which rates were being paid on or before 31 May 2000, and &#163;2,900 for other properties. The higher reasonable cost allowance for existing properties not connected to the public watermain reflects the importance attached to reducing the number of such properties. The policy provides Water Service with an objective mechanism to consider applications for new water services in a consistent and equitable manner. The policy seeks to strike a balance between the interests of householders and taxpayers, within the context of resources made available for water services.</p>
