 The police have powers to restrict noise from moving vehicles under Regulation 97 of the Road Vehicles (Construction and Use) Regulations 1986. This regulation makes it an offence to use a motor vehicle on the road in such a manner as to cause any excessive noise that could have been avoided by the exercise of reasonable care on the part of the driver; this includes excessive noise from car stereos. The penalty is a fine of up to &#163;1,000.

<P>
<a name="31211w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The arrest and prosecution of anti-trial activists is the responsibility of the relevant police forces in whose areas the Randomised Badger Culling Trial areas are located, and the Crown Prosecution Service. Defra does not receive information on, or maintain records of, such arrests and prosecutions.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what deleterious effects on wildlife arising from the current badger population level have been recorded by her Department and other UK public bodies.  [141992]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31211w01.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Previous research has shown that there is a negative relationship between badger and hedgehog abundance, i.e. more badgers equals fewer hedgehogs, in rural areas. This is believed to be due to hedgehog predation by badgers and through hedgehogs avoiding areas of higher badger density. However, this is not necessarily a "deleterious effect on wildlife", since predator/prey interactions are a feature of ecosystems. It has been suggested that badgers may impact adversely on some species of ground nesting birds. The interaction between the badgers and other species in the ecosystem is the subject of a study being carried out by the Central Science Laboratory. This study is being conducted in selected areas of the Randomised Badger Culling Trial and the results will not be available until after the fieldwork programme finishes at the end of 2004.

 It is not possible to give an accurate cost of the reactive element of the Randomised Badger Culling Trial. The total cost of the trial to the end of March 2004 is forecast to have reached &#163;30.5 million.

<P>
<a name="31211w01.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 As at 5 December 2003, 8,276 badgers had been culled in the Randomised Badger Culling Trials. All culled badgers are tested for TB infection. On the advice of the Independent Scientific Group on Cattle TB, data on the prevalence of TB in badgers caught in the trial, along with locations of their capture and the incidence of TB in cattle in trial areas, once triplets are active, are not released. This is to protect the integrity of the trial, and for the security of Defra field staff and farmers co-operating in the work.

<i>[holding answer 1 December 2003]</i>: The Independent Scientific Group on Cattle TB (ISO) intends to publish the results of the Randomised Badger Culling Trial as soon as possible following its predicted conclusion in 2006.
<P>

<a name="31211w01.html_para7">In line with its undertaking to report any significant results that emerge from analyses before the trial's conclusion, the ISO recently reported results that indicated that localised badger culling seemed to increase TB incidence in cattle. These results stem from a comparison between the level of TB incidence in cattle in the reactive culling and the control (no culling) treatment areas. Further information is available from the Defra website http://www.defra.gov.uk/animalh/tb/index.htm and from a paper the ISO have published in <i>Nature</i> www.nature.com/nature.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what examples there have been of reactive badger culling programmes in England where the work was successful in controlling TB in cattle; and where and when those programmes were carried out.  [141970]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31211w01.html_spnew15"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Since the early 1970s MAFF/Defra has carried out a range of badger control strategies in an attempt to reduce TB incidence in cattle. These were reviewed in the Krebs Report in 1997 where, among other things, it was recommended that a scientific field experiment be set up to test rigorously the effectiveness (and cost-effectiveness) of different badger culling strategies and to provide the evidence on which to base future TB control strategies. The Krebs report recommended a randomised block approach comprising three treatments: reactive culling, proactive culling, and no culling. The Randomised Badger Culling Trial, as recommended by Krebs and designed by the Independent Scientific Group on Cattle TB, commenced in 1998.
<P>

<a name="31211w01.html_para8">Previous control strategies included Gassing (1975&#150;82), Clean Ring (1982&#150;86), Interim (1986 to 1998) and Live Test (1994&#150;96) further details are available in the Krebs Report Chapter 5 page 76. None of the control strategies has been assessed in a properly designed experiment to establish their efficacy. While removal operations may have had an effect on the prevalence of TB in badgers and on herd breakdowns, other factors may also have influenced these. In the absence of scientific controls, it is not possible to separate out the effects of badger removal from these confounding factors.

 It is only possible to make estimates of the incidence of bovine TB in cattle based on previous years. Unfortunately, data for both 2002 and 2001 cannot be easily compared with earlier years. This is because, in 2001, TB testing was largely suspended during the foot and mouth disease outbreak, and in 2002 much of the testing effort was aimed at high-risk herds and those with overdue tests. Nevertheless, early indications suggest that the reduced levels of testing in 2001 have not substantially altered the underlying historical trend of confirmed TB incidents in cattle, which continues to rise at a yearly average rate of about 18 per cent. for new herd incidents.

 Culture of samples for <i>Mycobacterium bovis</i> (the causative organism for bovine tuberculosis) takes at least six weeks. A backlog of samples built up at the Veterinary Laboratories Agency (VLA) after the foot and mouth disease outbreak in 2001.
<P>

<a name="31211w01.html_para10">An extra &#163;650,000 funding was made available in 2003&#150;04 to the Veterinary Laboratories Agency (VLA) to tackle the backlog. So far in 2003, the monthly throughput at VLA of bovine samples for culture has been more than three times higher than in 2002. Fresh samples are now being processed as they arrive at VLA and we are further reducing the backlog of frozen samples.
<P>

<a name="31211w01.html_para11">At the end of October 2003 there were 1,781 tissue samples awaiting culture at the VLA (down from 6,329 at the end of March 2003). Nearly all of the outstanding samples (1,712) are from carcases that showed no visible lesions at post-mortem, and thus not causing a delay in lifting movement restrictions from farms.

 The Gambling Bill is intended to reform the regulation of gambling rather than make provision for animal welfare: this is a matter for separate legislation now under consideration by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. However, we envisage that the premises licences for greyhound tracks which local authorities will issue under the proposed Bill will include conditions safeguarding the integrity of betting events which will entail compliance with minimum welfare standards.

Estimates are for London and are rounded to the nearest 0.1 million.3. The estimates are sample counts, which have been adjusted for non-response using multipurpose grossing factors that, in the case of the Family Resources Survey, control for tenure, Council Tax band and a number of other variables. Estimates are subject to both sampling error and to variability in non-response. The income measure used is weekly net (disposable) equivalised household income (that is to say income that is adjusted to reflect the composition of the household).<P>

4. Income is adjusted or equivalised to take into account variations in both size and composition of the household. This process reflects the notion that a family of several people needs a higher income than a single person in order for both households to enjoy a comparable standard of living. Incomes of larger families are adjusted downwards and incomes of smaller households adjusted upwards. The equivalence scales used takes a couple with no children as the reference point, and increases relatively the income of single persons households, and reduces relatively the incomes of households with larger consumption capabilities.<P>

 The child maintenance premium is a key feature of the new child support scheme. It relies on links with Jobcentre Plus IT systems to match up individuals on benefit with payments received. The new IT system is designed to do this and by the end of November 7,500 of the poorest families were already benefiting from the new premium. However to apply the premium to old scheme cases would require redesigning and rebuilding both the new and old IT systems.

This relates to a reimbursement system that member states have agreed to: the last state of work will reimburse part of the Unemployment Benefit paid by the state of residence. UK retains a Parliamentary Scrutiny on this Regulation.

worked 7.7 hours of actual unpaid overtime a week and their gross hourly pay for the hours they did get paid for was &#163;14.95. By multiplying these numbers together (and by multiplying by 52 weeks) we get an estimated value of annual actual unpaid overtime worked by employees in the UK of &#163;22&#190; billion. If managers and senior officials who receive a salary rather than an hourly rate are excluded then the value of annual unpaid overtime falls markedly, to &#163;12&#189; billion. These workers (2.55 million) on average worked 7.1 hours of actual overtime per week and their gross hourly pay for the hours they did get paid for was &#163;13.40.

Also, the Second Work-Life Balance Study: Employees Survey carried out in early 2003 estimates that 70 per cent. of employees who usually or were contracted to work more than 48 hours per week had not signed a written agreement to opt-out of the 48-hour average working week limit. Some of these employees would not have been required to sign an opt-out as not all would have worked over 48 hours per week on average over the 17 week reference period, some would have been autonomous workers and others would have been in sectors or occupations that were excluded from the regulations at the time of the surveys.

 The SaBRE (Supporting Britain's Reservists and Employers) campaign aims to win and maintain the support of employers for the Volunteer Reserves. This is achieved through a combination of highly targeted direct marketing and the establishment of a network of Employer Support Executives to focus employer support at the regional level. We are confident that SaBRE succeeds in generating increased levels of interest in, and support for, our Volunteer Reserve forces, and demonstrate to employers the benefits of employing reservists in their organisations.

<a name="31211w10.html_para2">In addition, as part of the overall process of identifying lessons learned from all aspects of Operation Telic, we will be reviewing the employer support package, including the right to claim financial assistance to cover the additional costs resulting from the call out of a member of staff.

<a name="31211w10.html_para3">Also as a result of our experiences during Operation Telic we intend to foster greater involvement of employers in "intelligent mobilisation" in the future.

Where possible, we will also endeavour to provide reasonable notice of mobilisation plans and improve the flow of information to employers about mobilised Reservists.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what assessment he has made of the reliability of evidence for the decline in the Irish hare; what assessment he has made of the effect of <i>(a)</i> setting up a monitoring system and <i>(b)</i> developing current hunting, shooting and coursing practices to ensure they cannot have an unsustainable impact on hare numbers; and if he will make a statement.  [142939]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31211w11.html_spnew4"><B> Angela Smith: </B> 
 The Irish Hare Species Action Plan, published by the Department of the Environment in 2000, identified the need for regular surveys of the Irish hare population, building on the baseline population for the species established by research commissioned by the Department from Queen's University of Belfast (QUB) in 1997. This was followed by The Northern Ireland Irish Hare Survey 2002, also carried out on the Department's behalf by QUB. Both reports confirmed that Irish hare numbers are low. I am satisfied that this research provides as accurate a population estimate as can be made for such an elusive and uncommon animal.

These practices are subject to the provisions of the Game Preservation Act (Northern Ireland) 1928, as amended. I recently published notice under the Act, of a proposal to introduce a temporary ban on the killing or taking, or the sale or purchase of Irish hares. This is intended to allow time to consider, within a current review of the Wildlife (Northern Ireland) Order 1985, whether there is a need to strengthen the statutory protection afforded to the Irish hare.

 Research carried out at the Queen's University of Belfast (QUB) reported in 1997 that the population of the Irish Hare was at low density in Northern Ireland.
<P>

<a name="31211w11.html_para10">This assessment was followed up by a research study, "The Northern Ireland Irish Hare 'Lepus timidus hibernicus' Survey 2002", commissioned by the Environment and Heritage Service (EHS) of the Department of the Environment and also carried out by QUB. It reported that Irish Hares were widespread but occurred at a low density of about one hare per kilometre square. The report of this study included the recommendation that the Department should consider removal of the Irish Hare from the quarry list and giving protection under the Wildlife (Northern Ireland) Order 1985. This recommendation is among the issues being considered in a current review of the Wildlife Order.
<P>

<a name="31211w11.html_para11">I considered the research and survey report in the context of the Irish Hare Species Action Plan published by EHS in 2000, which has among its objectives a target to double the Irish Hare population, over as wide an area as possible, by 2010. The inconsistency between this policy objective and the continuing practice of hunting and coursing Irish Hares led to the proposal for a temporary ban on the killing or taking, or the sale or purchase, of Irish Hares, pending the outcome of the Wildlife Order review.
<P>

<a name="31211w11.html_para12">A seminar delivering the results of the 2002 Survey was held in January 2003 at Queen's University Belfast. Interested parties were invited to attend. Following this seminar the full text of the report was made available on the EHS website, (http://www.ehsni.gov.uk/ pubs/publications/Irish HareSurvey2002.pdf) where it remains available, together with the Irish Hare Species Action Plan.

 Before agreeing to support any process of demobilisation we would carefully consider all aspects, including the need to take into account the rights of the civilian population to truth, justice and reparation.

 The Government have made clear their position on the use of genetic test results for underwriting life and health insurance in the October 2001 Government response to the report from the House of Commons Science and Technology Committee: Genetics and Insurance.
<P>

<a name="31211w16.html_para4">The Genetics and Insurance Committee (GAIC) is responsible for the evaluation of specific genetic tests and their relevance to particular types of insurance. The GAIC also provides independent scrutiny of compliance with the terms of the moratorium on the use of genetic test results by insurance companies, which runs until November 2006. If there is evidence of non-compliance with the moratorium by the insurance industry, then the Government are prepared to enforce it through legislation, if necessary.

 A vote on the authorisation of Bt11 sweetcorn was taken at a meeting of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health on 8 December. The Food Standards Agency represents the United Kingdom at this committee. As is always the case at such committees, the UK delegation presented a position on behalf of the Government, which was agreed after consulting Ministers from all relevant Departments.
<P>

<a name="31211w16.html_para9">The application for the authorisation of a line of genetically modified sweetcorn for food use was made in 1999 under the novel foods regulation (EC) No. 258/97. The dossier was reviewed by the European Union member states and then referred to the European Community Scientific Committee on Food (SCF). The SCF reviewed the application along with an additional dossier of information provided by the applicant, which responded to questions raised by member states. The SCF opinion was published in May 2002 and concluded that this line of GM sweetcorn is as safe for human food consumption as its conventional counterparts.
<P>

<a name="31211w16.html_para10">The UK supported the proposal for authorisation because the criteria laid out in the relevant legislation had been met, namely: the product does not present a risk to the consumer, does not mislead the consumer and is not nutritionally disadvantageous compared with other foods that it might replace.

 The Government are very careful when considering introducing a new vaccine into the childhood immunisation schedule. We have to be sure that the vaccine is safe, and effective in preventing disease. It is also important to know how many doses that children need to be protected and at what age the doses should be given. We also need to be confident that introducing a new vaccine into the childhood immunisation schedule doses not interfere with the protection given by the other vaccines in the programme. We have to be sure that any new health intervention is cost-effective.
<P>

<a name="31211w17.html_para6">The independent expert advisory body, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) is currently examining the evidence of the potential benefits of introducing pneumococcal conjugate vaccine to the infant immunisation schedule. What is clear is that there are many uncertainties in the evidence, in particular in measuring the burden of pneumococcal disease, and in the amount of disease that is expected to be prevented by a vaccine in both the short and longer term, because it protects against only seven of the numerous strains of pneumococcus.

 National minimum standards have been developed for a range of establishments and agencies regulated under the Care Standards Act.

The Department has previously estimated that first degree graduates earn on average around &#163;120,000 more &#151;in present value terms&#151;over their working lives than those with two or more A-levels. The analysis is based on the spring 2002 quarter of the Labour Force Survey (LFS) for Great Britain. The &#163;120,000 differential is derived from gross lifetime

 Both myself and my right hon.

<i>[holding answer 9 December 2003]:</i> The HE White Paper sets out our proposals for student support. From 2004, we are introducing a grant worth up to &#163;1,000 to assist students from low-income backgrounds. The full grant will be available to those whose household income is below &#163;15,200, estimated to be around 30 per cent. of students. This is in addition to the loans available for students' living costs, currently of up to &#163;4,930 and a grant for tuition fees currently worth up to &#163;1,125 a year. From next year, the hardship loan fund will be merged into the Access to Learning Fund. All payments of grants will be non-repayable and will be delivered through universities and colleges. Students with dependants and disabled students will continue to benefit from a series of grants that are designed to assist with the cost of entering higher education. We are also introducing a more flexible package of support for part-time students. Full details on the 04/05 student support package were announced on 3 December 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 61WS.
<P>

<a name="31211w21.html_para0">From 2006, students will no longer have to pay up-front fees. Instead, we will offer a loan for fees, which with the maintenance loan will be repayable after graduation once earnings exceed &#163;15,000. Any institution that wishes to charge higher fees must first have an access agreement, approved by the Office for Fair Access (OFFA). We are considering and discussing the content of access agreements, including bursaries and other financial support, and the role of OFFA, and will make an announcement in due course.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what research he has commissioned into students' risk aversion to debt.  [143104]<P>

<P>
<a name="31211w21.html_spnew3"><B> Alan Johnson </B> 
 [<i>holding answer 9 December2003</i>]: The Department has recently published results from the 2002&#150;03 Student Income and Expenditure Survey. This showed that more students are taking on debt; 92 per cent. of students anticipated leaving university with debts in 2002&#150;03. All students are taking on more debt on average, partly as a result of the complete replacement of mandatory grants with student loans, and partly to finance higher levels of expenditure.
<P>

<a name="31211w21.html_para1">In addition, in 2001 the Department published research entitled, 'Social Class and Higher Education: Issues Affecting Participation by Lower Social Class groups' which amongst other things explored the relationship between social class and students' attitudes to debt. This research showed that most potential and current students accepted that they would accumulate debt but felt that the investment was worthwhile and that most current students were confident about paying back the debt they were accruing.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what new teaching methods are being introduced geared to each child's ability.  [141799]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31211w21.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Stephen Twigg: </B> 
 The national Primary and Key Stage 3 Strategies have enabled teachers to improve and broaden their teaching skills to raise standards of attainment for children of all abilities. Typical of their approach to inclusion has been the help on challenging and supporting all pupils in whole class teaching, in the ways in which teachers differentiate tasks, in the ways pupils are grouped, and in the ways in which teaching assistants are used to support pupils. This year Key Stage 3 Challenge Programmes offer support in new approaches in one-to-one teaching for pupils who are falling behind in basic skills. Our programme for gifted and talented education, including our support for the National Academy for Gifted and Talented Young, is also helping to develop teachers' understanding of the most effective approaches to the teaching of the most able pupils.
<P>

<a name="31211w21.html_para3">Our ambitions for personalised learning in schools are that universal provision should be tailored-to the needs of every child. Central to this agenda are that teachers have more effective skills in formative assessment. We know through a wide body of research, for example through the Ofsted report "Good Assessment in Secondary Schools" published earlier this year, that the quality of assessment by teachers has a significant impact on attitudes to learning through challenging children and through encouraging teachers to focus on how to improve the learning skills of individual pupils. That is why we have made available to all schools the new Pupil Achievement Tracker to help them identify their pupils' strengths and weaknesses and set appropriate targets for development, based on the results of pupils in their National Curriculum Tests. 



<P>
<P><I>11 Dec 2003 : Column 614W</I><P>
And through the Primary and Key Stage 3 Strategies we will be making available to teachers next year support in assessment for learning techniques and approaches.

A national identity cards scheme will bring significant benefits in areas that are the responsibility of the Home Office. These include strengthening immigration controls, providing a means to encourage legal routes of migration to the United Kingdom, combating organised crime and terrorism and reducing identity fraud. The national identity cards scheme will be built incrementally by strengthening existing forms of identification, some of which are currently issued by the Home Office or one of its agencies such as residence permits and passports.

 Funding for mental health services in prisons is not specifically identified or ring-fenced within prison budgets. "Changing the Outlook, a Strategy for Developing and Modernising Mental Health Services for Prisoners" (December 2001) estimated that around half of the Prison Service's then expenditure on health care was spent on mental health care. In the current financial year total Prison Service expenditure on health services in prisons in England and Wales (excluding the contractually managed prisons) is expected to be around &#163;130 million, including &#163;19 million on establishments holding only female prisoners. In addition, the Department of Health made &#163;903,000 available for NHS mental health in-reach services in 11 women's prisons during 2003&#150;04.
