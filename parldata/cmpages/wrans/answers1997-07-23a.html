 As I said in my previous answer, the final value of the pension in respect of any individual on an hon. Member's staff will depend on a wide range of factors. I have no plans to change the present arrangements.

<P>
<a name="70723w01.html_spnew5"><B> Dr. David Clark: </B> 
 The documents relating to this meeting had been retained by my Department on grounds of national security. They have recently been re-reviewed to see whether they could be released. As a result, one item recording the committee's discussion about the deployment in the United Kingdom of a United States army intercept station and the paper relating to this part of the discussion are being prepared for transfer to the Public Record Office. The review has confirmed that another item, and the papers related to it, need to continue to be withheld on grounds of national security. These documents will be re-reviewed at regular intervals and when no longer sensitive will be released.

<a name="70723w01.html_wqn7"><B> Mrs. Golding: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster if he will make a statement on how he proposes to help businesses understand and comply with regulations. [10513]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70723w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Kilfoyle: </B> 
 As part of this Government's better regulation programme, we are determined to make central and local government's regulatory advice and service more transparent, accessible and helpful. The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster has therefore asked me to lead a new initiative called access business, which will co-ordinate and modernise a wide range of regulatory advice, forms and guidance for business into a simpler, more unified service. We have set up an access business group, whose first meeting I am chairing today, which consists of the Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions, my hon. Friend the Member for Wallasey (Angela Eagle); the Minister for SMall Firms, Trade and Industry; Teresa Graham from the Institute of Chartered Accountants; and Councillor John Ryan, chair of the Local Government Association's public protection committee. I look forward to the access business group announcing the first fruits of its work in the autumn.
<P>
<P>
<a name="70723w01.html_wqn8"><B> Mrs. Golding: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster if he will make a statement about his Department's policy in relation to the previous Government's consultation on proposals to apply to enforcement provisions in section 5 of the Deregulation and Contracting Out Act 1994 to trading standards, environment health and care services legislation. [10514]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70723w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Kilfoyle: </B> 
 A number of those who responded to the earlier consultation expressed significant concerns about the inflexibility and potential bureaucracy that would arise from the strict application of section 5 in these areas. There was, none the less, broad support from business, local authorities and enforcement bodies for the principles of good enforcement. This Government are committed to the fair, open and consistent enforcement of regulations. One of the first tasks, therefore, of the access business group, referred to in my previous answer, will be to build on the consensus about the principles of good enforcement while avoiding the inflexibility and expense in the last Government's proposals to legislate in these areas. I hope that we shall be able to agree a new joint approach later this year.

 Information relating to ethnicity in the Lord Chancellor's Department is not usually given where numbers are small enough to enable identification of individuals. This practice complies with an agreement between the trade unions and the Department, and assurances given to staff when they are asked to provide the information. However, all staff in my private office,

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security what review of cold weather payments she has made; when she expects to report on the review's conclusions; and if the review has considered the possible incorporation of the wind chill factor in the calculation of cold weather payments. [4726]<P>

<a name="70723w02.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Bill O'Brien: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security what progress has been made on the recently promised independent review of the science of the assessment of noise-induced sensorineural hearing loss for the purposes of claims to war pensions. [10554]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70723w02.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The Government are pledged to an independent review of the medical evidence behind the approach to the assessment of noise-induced hearing loss in war pensions. We hope that the review will provide a conclusion which is clear and unambiguous.
<P>

<a name="70723w02.html_para4">The review will be chaired by Sir Kenneth Calman, the chief medical officer. The other members of the review team will be Professor Adrian Davis of the Medical Research Council Institute of Hearing Research, Professor Mark Lutman of the Institute of Sound and Vibration Research, Professor Linda Luxon of the Institute of Laryngology and Otology at the University college London medical school and Dr. Guy Lightfoot of the department of clinical engineering at the Royal Liverpool university hospital. Dr. Anne Braidwood of this Department will serve on the team and act as secretary.

<a name="70723w02.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="70723w02.html_para6">Under the housing revenue account subsidy system, an authority's entitlement to subsidy for its council housing is based upon various assumptions about its relative income and expenditure. If the cost of rent rebates is excluded from the subsidy calculation, most local authorities have a notional surplus of income over expenditure. These surpluses are used to offset the cost of rent rebates.
<P>

<a name="70723w02.html_para7">We have some sympathy with local authorities' concerns about this aspect of the subsidy system and have embarked on a review of the HRA subsidy system as part of the comprehensive spending review of housing.

(2) The table excludes Departments which reported a nil return in 1995-96.<P>

(3) The notation '--' indicates that the Department recorded a nil return in the year concerned and there is therefore no basis for comparison with the base year 1995-96.<P>

(4) The reduction in the 480 cases referred to in the 1995-96 report reflects the subsequent correction of a database error.<P>

<P>

1. Some large percentage changes in value and case numbers are based on relatively small changes in actual values. The overall pattern shows a gradual increase year on year in the numbers of cases being reported. This increase may be due in part to better reporting arrangements and improved fraud awareness in departments.<P>

2. Levels of fraud reported in previous years cannot easily be inferred from reductions in percentage changes of 100 per cent. since the maximum reduction is 100 per cent.<P>

 <i>[holding answer 21 July 1997]:</i> The estimates are given in the table. These show changes in disposable income--that is income, including benefits less direct tax. That means that the figures include the effects of the change in mortgage interest relief in the Budget, but not excise duty or other tax changes.
<P>

<a name="70723w03.html_para2">The estimates made do not reflect the effect of new deal expenditure, such as measures helping young people into work, and the increased child benefit disregard for lone parents. This will increase disposable income, especially for households in the lower income deciles.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Chancellor of the Exchequer has asked me to reply, as Director of the Office for National Statistics (ONS), to your recent parliamentary question asking how many people aged 25 years or over have been unemployed for two years or more in the Bolton West constituency.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The ONS produces two measures of unemployment. The first is derived from the quarterly Labour Force Survey, and is defined on a consistent and internationally recognised basis set out by the International Labour Organisation (ILO). It counts as unemployed those people who are a) without a paid job, b) available to start work within the next two weeks, and c) have either looked for work in the last four weeks or are waiting to start a job already obtained.<i></i>
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The ONS also publishes the monthly claimant count, which is based on the administrative system and includes all people claiming unemployment-related benefits (i.e. Jobseekers Allowance or National Insurance credits) at Employment Service offices on the day of the monthly count, who on that day had signed on as unemployed and available to do any suitable work. Essentially, all people who attend an Employment Service office to sign on the designated day are counted.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The information requested can only be derived from the claimant count, as the labour force survey does not give detail on duration of unemployment below county level. In April 1997, the latest date for which figures are available, there were 112 people aged 25 years or over who had been claiming unemployment-related benefits for more than two years in the Bolton West constituency.</FONT></UL>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Labour Force Survey Interviewer contracts of employment are fundamentally different from main stream ONS employees and reflect the unique nature of their work.

</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Labour Force survey is continuous throughout the year but the amount of work available for field interviewers fluctuates each week. Employment is therefore paid at an hourly rate. The hourly rates have been calculated to include an additional supplement for bank holidays, privilege days and annual leave days which are not paid at the time they are taken, Interviewer appointments are not pensionable, and for periods of sickness absence only payments due under statutory entitlement are made. To compensate for this, the hourly rate for pay has been further enhanced.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Interviewers are paid for time spent travelling to and from working area, and for time spent calling on people and interviewing in the area. Study, planning and administration time are also paid. Payment is not made for periods when interviewers are unavailable for work or when there is no suitable work available. Labour Force Interviewers contact and interview informants by calling on them at home. The use of a car is essential and a motor mileage allowance is payable for use of a private vehicle on official business.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Since 1994 government departments and agencies have been free to set their own rates of motor mileage allowance, which are payable to employees travelling necessarily in the course of their paid employment.

<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The ONS operates a single rate of motor mileage allowance for all private motor vehicles. The rate for the first 4,000 miles is 37 pence per mile.

<a name="70723w04.html_spnew5"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 No assumption was used in respect of the uprating of the basic pension. The uprating for 1998-99 benefit levels will depend upon the retail prices index increase in September 1997. This reflects the prices paid for goods and services and will take account of the reduction in VAT on fuel and power. So the real value of the pension is not affected by the change.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70723w05.html_spnew2"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 I have now received advice from the Securities and Investments Board on the London stock exchange's proposed trade publication arrangements for its new stock exchange electronic trading service.
<P>

<a name="70723w05.html_para0">I endorse the advice from the SIB that the exchange's proposed trade publication rules for SETS should enhance the price formation process, improve the quality of transparency and so make for a fairer market. The Treasury has also received advice on this matter from the Director General of Fair Trading. This concludes that, although there is a potential competition issue here, none of the proposed rules--which will be kept under review by the DGFT--is significantly anti-competitive at present.
<P>

<a name="70723w05.html_para1">I welcome the stock exchange's plans to move to a more transparent trading system on the introduction of its electronic order book. In my view, the proposed new rules strike a sensible balance between the need to maximise the transparency of the UK equity market, so that investors can be confident that they are trading on an equal basis with other market participants; and the need to maintain arrangements which enable risk principle trading to continue for those investors wishing to obtain competitive prices for large trades. The result should be to enhance the liquidity of the UK equity market and make it even more attractive to international investors.
<P>

<a name="70723w05.html_para2">The Treasury is today submitting a memorandum to the Treasury Committee in response to the Committee's recent reports on the London stock exchange. Apart from trade publication, one of the other issues raised by the Committee was the exchange's corporate governance arrangements. The exchange's planned move to a new trading system this autumn demonstrates that it is capable of taking and implementing strategic decisions about its market in the light of commercial and competitive factors. However, I agree with the Committee that the effectiveness of the exchange's corporate governance arrangements is an important issue and one which will need to be kept under review. In this context, the Treasury fully supports the governance principles espoused by the SIB--that a recognised investment exchange should avoid any conflict between its regulatory role and the pursuit of its commercial interests, and that an exchange should be run in the interests of the full range of its users and members.

 At the end of the financial year 1995-96, total reserves held by training and enterprise councils were almost &#163;260 million. That is the most recent year for which information is available. TECs have provided further information which reports that the total reserves comprised &#163;51 million for investment in capital assets, &#163;86 million for working capital and &#163;123 million for discretionary expenditure. Of the sum available for discretionary expenditure, TECs report that &#163;102 million was committed for planned expenditure in 1996-97 and beyond for training, enterprise and economic regeneration activities. TEC reserves are already being used extensively to support local labour market needs. I am confident that TECs will now be able to contribute with their reserves to the challenging agenda set out in our manifesto for education, training and lifelong learning.

 Ministers have made a manifesto commitment to a long-term care charter to define standards for health, housing and social services. Additionally, the Government are planning to review the patients charter. Both of these charters are likely to provide an opportunity to develop, in liaison with a wide range of health and social care professionals and members of the public, standards which will improve not only the quality and delivery of incontinence care but other services which are aimed at the rehabilitative and long-term care needs of individuals.

<P>
<P>

 The Department of Health issued its guidelines, "An Agenda for Action on Continence Services" in 1991. Since 1991, the Department has continued to concentrate on the implementation of these guidelines through the funding of research; the setting up of a national resource centre and the promotion of annual public awareness campaigns on issues of prevention and early intervention.
<P>

<a name="70723w06.html_para2">"The NHS Priorities and Planning Guidelines for 1994-95" required health authorities to ensure that their continence services conformed to the good practice guidelines in "An Agenda for Action on Continence Services". In addition, health authorities were required to set targets for reducing the prevalence of incontinence in their local population. The Department of Health is currently examining the findings and recommendations of several reports it commissioned in response to the recommendations set out in the guidelines to determine the measures necessary to ensure the continual improvement of incontinence services.

In 1995, the Commission formalised a senior labour inspectors committee to look at these issues, and the UK has had some success in using this committee to promote the development of common principles of inspection.

<a name="70723w08.html_wqn0"><B> Sir John Stanley: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what reports his Department has received in respect of plans by the Botswanan authorities to move Kalahari bushmen out of the central Kalahari game reserve; and if he will make a statement. [9920]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70723w08.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Tony Lloyd: </B> 
 The Botswana Government have outlined plans for the bushmen who live on and off the central Kalahari game reserve. They have assured us that no one would be evicted from the reserve. Our high commissioner visited the central Kalahari area earlier this month and found no evidence that bushmen had been forced away from the reserve. He is consulting the Minister of Local Government in Botswana with responsibility for the bushmen, to ensure that plans for managing the move of those bushmen who have elected to leave are adequate.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what studies have been made of the practical problems that arise from Hungary's accession to NATO; what discussions have been undertaken with non-NATO countries in the region to establish <i>(a)</i> a land or air corridor and <i>(b)</i> a pipe transit; and if he will make a statement. [9624]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70723w08.html_spnew1"><B> Dr. Reid: </B> 
 I have been asked to reply on behalf of the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs.
<P>

<a name="70723w08.html_para0">Geographical location was one of the factors addressed in the NATO studies which preceded the decision to invite Hungary, with Poland and the Czech Republic, to begin accession talks. The process of preparing for their accession will include continuing work within NATO on the military implications of enlargement. This work will reflect the Alliance's intention of carrying out its collective defence and other missions by ensuring the necessary levels of interoperability, integration and capability for reinforcement. I am not aware that any formal discussions have so far taken place with non-NATO countries on these issues.

 As my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister explained in response to my hon.

 The first report from the Committee on Standards in Public Life--Cm 2850--recognised the value of enabling Members to retain interests outside the House, provided these were properly declared, both in the Register of Members' Interests and on other occasions. Subject to these requirements, and to the rules of the House relating to delegations to Ministers, Members are free to seek meetings with Ministers and officials, who will consider such requests alongside the many other approaches from individuals and organisations concerned to press their own interests or those of others.

The Government do not endorse those assumptions, but we are committed to live within the existing public expenditure control totals for this year and next. Within those totals we have, however, allocated an additional &#163;89 million for schools in 1998-99 to reflect the priority we attach to education. My right hon.

 The final cost of the repairs to the Erskine bridge together with other ancillary costs related to the closure of the bridge is in the region of &#163;3.85 million excluding VAT. Letters intimating claims in principle had previously been issued to those parties who appear to be responsible for the incident. None of the parties has admitted liability and no costs have been recovered. The next steps in the process of recovering the costs, including legal action if necessary, will commence in August 1997.

 The increase in the price of vehicle fuel forms a significant part of the Government's environmental strategy and aims to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by encouraging lower fuel consumption. Local government has its part to play and my right hon. Friend has no plans to compensate rural local authorities beyond the benefit they already gain in the distribution<i></i> of grant for rural factors such as population sparsity and weighted road length. In addition, local authorities will benefit directly from the other measures announced in the Budget: the additional &#163;89 million current expenditure for schools next year; and the &#163;8.9 million of capital resources this year with a further &#163;26.7 million in each of the four subsequent years, also for education.

To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland what is the Government's target for the number of houses to be built in Scotland for social rent <i>(a)</i> in 1997 and <i>(b)</i> in 1998. [9621] <P>

<P>
<a name="70723w10.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Chisholm: </B> 
 The Government do not set targets for the number of houses to be built in Scotland. We have, however, approved a target for Scottish Homes to provide 2,400 houses for rent by housing associations in 1997-98. Local authorities also plan to build a total of 402 houses in 1997-98 for social rent.

<a name="70723w10.html_wqn2"><B> Sir Richard Body: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland how much money was allocated to the United Kingdom out of the European Union afforestation budget for 1993 to 1997; what are the criteria for such funding; which types of trees are subsidised; over what period the funds are paid; what percentage of the estates concerned are <i>(a)</i> privately owned and <i>(b)</i> public parks; and if he will list them. [10210]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70723w10.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Chisholm </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 22 July 1997]:</i> The United Kingdom has been allocated 61.6 million ECU from the European Union's afforestation budget for the period 1993 to 1997 to co-finance work carried out to establish and manage conifer and broadleaf woodlands on former agricultural land. Such work is approved under the woodland grant scheme and the farm woodland premium scheme; grants under the former are paid over a period of five years while annual payments under the latter cover a period of 10 to 15 years. Several thousand payments are made each year under these schemes and a list of all the cases involved could only be produced at disproportionate cost.
<P>

<a name="70723w10.html_para2">As the EU funding is for work carried out on former agricultural land, woodlands in public parks are not generally eligible. Further details of the woodland grant scheme and farm woodland premium scheme are given in explanatory booklets which are held in the Library of the House.

 Young people have a medical examination at admission to secure accommodation and medical treatment as required thereafter either from their own general practitioner or a local doctor. Young people are referred for specialist treatment when appropriate. The care and placement of young people is subject to regular statutory review procedures and their health and development are considered during these reviews.
<P>

<a name="70723w10.html_para4">Rule 23 of the Prisons and Young Offenders Institutions (Scotland) Rules 1994 provides that the prison medical officer will have responsibility for the general care of the health of every prisoner.

<a name="70723w10.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. McLeish: </B> 
 The term "juvenile" is not used in the legislation regulating Scottish penal establishments. The Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 1963 provided for the detention in young offenders institutions of persons of or

over 17 years of age but under 21. The lower age limit was reduced to 16 in the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968.
<P>

<a name="70723w10.html_para6">Very few young prisoners under 16 are accommodated in the prison system. On 11 July 1997, there were three young male prisoners under 16 in separate accommodation at HM prison Longriggend in a hall which normally holds roughly 50 young male persons aged 16 to 21 on remand. The staffing complement for the hall is nine.

<a name="70723w10.html_para8">Rule 14 of the Prisons and Young Offenders Institutions (Scotland) Rules 1994 requires the governor of an establishment, so far as is reasonably practicable, to keep civil prisoners, untried prisoners and young prisoners apart from other categories.

 There are no young people held in within the prison system on preventive detention.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70723w10.html_spnew15"><B> Mr. McLeish: </B> 
 The age of criminal responsibility in Scotland is eight so a young person may be placed by the courts in a secure unit from this age. However, in practice the minimum age of those placed in secure accommodation is 11. The minimum age for the detention of young people in the Scottish penal system is 14.

<a name="70723w11.html_para0">The convention has had an important impact on shaping policy in Scotland. The influence of the convention is particularly apparent in the Children (Scotland) Act 1995 which came fully into operation on 1 April 1997 and the secondary legislation which flowed from that.

The first step in discharging this remit will be to have a fully comprehensive child-proofing policy for all Scottish Office Departments to ensure that they take into account the effects on children when developing policy.

 Twenty-five per cent. of any capital receipt from a large-scale voluntary transfer is available immediately to spend on housing. If a local authority becomes debt free, at a later date, the remainder of the receipt then also becomes available to it to spend as it wishes. Currently this is subject to one restriction: that it may not be used to support local authority social housing grant. This is being reviewed.

<P>
<a name="70723w11.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 Capital resources can be used only to fund spending for capital purposes. However, the Secretary of State has powers, under section 40(6) of the Local Government and Housing Act 1989 to issue a direction to capitalise revenue expenditure. Where revenue expenditure is capitalised, there can be a saving to the local authority's revenue account which may enable it to reduce its council tax, or--for spending within the housing revenue account--reduce its council house rents.
<P>

<a name="70723w11.html_para2">Under the capital receipts initiative the Government will issue supplementary credit approvals to enable authorities to invest additional sums in housing. Where authorities incur additional spending under this initiative, they will receive revenue support in the normal way. There should be no effect on the level of council rents or council taxes.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70723w12.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Raynsford </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 22 July 1997]:</i> No. The recently revised planning policy guidance note 1--"General Policy and Principles"--already contains guidelines which are designed to prevent decisions on major planning applications pre-empting decisions that are to be made in the course of an emerging development plan. In particular, it states that, where proposals for a development plan have been published for consultation, it may be justifiable to refuse planning permission on the grounds of prematurity where the proposed development is significant enough to predetermine decisions that are more properly taken in the context of the development plan.
<P>

<a name="70723w12.html_para0">During the development plan process, planning applications should continue to be considered in the light of current policies. However, account can also be taken of policies in emerging development plans which are going through statutory procedures towards adoption. The weight to be attached to such policies depends upon the stage of plan preparation or review, increasing as successive stages are reached. When planning permission is refused on the grounds of prematurity, the planning authority will need to demonstrate clearly how the grant of planning permission would have prejudiced the outcome of the development plan process.

<P>
<P>

 A draft directive was published on 5 March. An interim explanatory memorandum was produced on 15 April. A full explanatory memorandum will be supplied to the scrutiny committees in the next few days.
<P>

<a name="70723w12.html_para1">The Government welcome the draft directive's main objectives: the stringent application of high environmental standards across Europe, and a reduction in methane emissions from landfill sites. However, the draft directive also contains proposals, including one for limits on the landfilling of biodegradable waste, which imply a substantial change in UK waste management practice. It is of particular concern, therefore, that there has been no detailed assessment by the Commission of the cost implications for those member states which, like the UK, have a heavy reliance at present on landfill as a means of disposal.
<P>

<a name="70723w12.html_para2">The Government would prefer that the directive focus more on the shared objective of reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, and less on prescribing detailed means to achieve that end. The Government will also be keen to ensure that rules on landfill management are stringent and are evenly applied across Europe, and that the directive does not hamper efforts to improve sustainability of waste management in this country.

 Palestinian living standards have fallen substantially since the Oslo process began, largely due to the effects of border closures. The west bank and Gaza has the potential for rapid economic growth, but its social and economic development will continue to be constrained until there is an equitable settlement of the peace process.

 My Department supports a wide range of projects in developing countries which aim to create a favourable environment for investment. One of our key aims is to help develop conditions which attract private sector investment to the least developed countries. For instance, in South Africa--and in central and eastern Europe--we have projects which aim to build alliances between UK businesses and their counterparts, to help reduce the cost of investment appraisal for small British firms, and to assist in the transfer of skills. We also sponsor the Commonwealth Development Corporation, whose statutory purpose is to contribute to economic development in the poorest countries by investing in, and supporting private sector operations.

 Further analysis of the information given in the reply of 30 June has shown that the number of people who were held in detention, solely under Immigration Act powers, and then subsequently granted leave to enter or remain was previously overestimated. The revised totals, with the breakdown requested, are given in the table. I apologise if this has caused any inconvenience.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70723w17.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 A voluntary self-classification system is used to record the ethnic origin of staff in the Home Office. Of the staff serving in the Home Office ministerial secretariat on 6 July 1997 <i>(a)</i> 7.4 per cent. had classified themselves as being of Asian origin and <i>(b)</i> 2.9 per cent. had classified themselves as being of Afro-Caribbean origin. The ministerial secretariat consists of staff serving all the Home Office Ministers and the permanent secretary. Given the small size of the ministerial secretariat, the information requested on numbers cannot be provided as this might result in the identification of individuals. This would be contrary to the Home Office code of practice on the use and disclosure of ethnic data, which has been agreed with the trade union side.

<a name="70723w17.html_para3">It is not possible to specify as a percentage the cost of taxis against total travel cost, either nationally or for Channings Wood prison, as the assisted prison visits unit computer system does not differentiate between different modes of travel such as taxi, private motor vehicle, bus, etc.

 This information is not collected centrally. I understand that the Association of Chief Police Officers and the Association of Police Authorities have estimated that police forces in England and Wales could receive up to &#163;30 million in 1997-98 in agreements involving gifts, loans and sponsorship. Some information on the value of police authority sponsorship agreements can be found in "Police Statistics 1994-95 and 1995-96 Actuals" and "Police Statistics 1996-97 Estimates" published by the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy, copies of which are in the Library.

 The report of the disasters and inquests working group, published in March, recommended legislation to relieve coroners of the need to resume their inquest after the public inquiry had been completed, and invited comments. There is no current legislative opportunity to give effect to the recommendations, but the position is kept under review.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70723w18.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Howarth: </B> 
 The publicity campaign about absent voting on television and in the newspapers was considered to be the most cost-effective way to reach as large an audience as possible within the period available after the general election was announced for applications to be made. Because there are so many very different radio stations, it would not have been possible to achieve such wide coverage through radio advertisements. The Government monitor the effectiveness of their advertising and we are of course prepared to consider using a different medium if that would be more suitable.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70723w18.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 The statutory entitlement to visits by juveniles, which is the same as that for adult prisoners and young offenders, is set out in the young offender institution rules and standing order 5, copies of which are in the Library. In accordance with these, all convicted prisoners, including juveniles, are entitled to at least one visit after reception on conviction and every two weeks thereafter. Unconvicted prisoners, again including juveniles, are entitled to visits lasting at least one and a half hours each week but, where circumstances permit, governors should allow more. In addition to this, governors have discretion to allow special visits and prisoners may earn additional visits under the incentives and earned privileges scheme.

<P>
<a name="70723w18.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 The majority of juveniles are held in establishments which also hold young offenders and/or adult prisoners. Therefore, it is not possible to say what the ratio of prison staff to juveniles is. The staff to prisoner ratio for all Prison Service establishments at 30 June 1997 was 1: 1.51.

<P>
<a name="70723w18.html_spnew9"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 The Prison Service has received no representations from outside bodies in the last year on the treatment of juveniles whilst they are in detention. However, representations have been received from a range of organisations and agencies on the implementation of the provisions in the Criminal Justice Act 1991 for court-ordered secure remands and ending prison remands for juveniles. The Government remain committed to ending prison remands for 15 and

<P>

<a name="70723w18.html_para1">Separate records of the total number of complaints made on behalf of juveniles, including those made by third parties, are not held centrally. Individual establishments, however, keep records of formal complaints made by juvenile prisoners, and the Director General of the Prison Service will write to my hon.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70723w18.html_spnew10"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 The nature of a prison regime for juveniles is for the governor to determine, within young offender institution rules, budget and on advice from his management team. The area manager must approve the regime for each establishment. This produces regimes which reflect local needs and recognise the specific needs of juvenile prisoners.
<P>

<a name="70723w18.html_para2">The work available for juveniles varies between establishments. Subject to limitations through legal restrictions on the operation of certain machinery by juveniles, and the requirement that young offenders under the age of 17 must undertake 15 hours per week compulsory education, the work is the same as provided for adult offenders.
<P>

<a name="70723w18.html_para3">Juveniles may be required to work as part of a balanced regime of education, training and work designed to assist them to acquire or develop personal responsibility, self-discipline, physical fitness, interests and skills and to obtain suitable employment after release. Where possible, they are given a choice of work.
<P>

<a name="70723w18.html_para4">The young offender institution consolidated rules 1996 require that prisoners aged less than 17 be provided with at least 15 hours a week of education or training. The education provided is focused on remedial eduation in basic skills, combined with a wider variety of experience and training to equip young offenders to deal more effectively with life after imprisonment.
<P>

<a name="70723w18.html_para5">Education provision for those under 17 years of age is linked to the national curriculum for schools in so far as facilities allow.

and Young Persons Act 1933; and detention, up to the adult maximum, under section 53(2) of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 for grave crimes including those which are punishable in the case of an adult by 14 years' imprisonment or more. For juveniles aged 15 to 17, detention in a young offender institution for a maximum of two years is available for any offence for which an adult may be sentenced to imprisonment.
<P>

<a name="70723w18.html_para6">Our aim is to provide the courts with a more coherent and flexible set of custodial powers than those left by the previous Government. In the meantime, we will press ahead with introducing the secure training order provided for in the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, to deal with 12 to 14-year-old persistent offenders who have not responded to punishment in the community. My right. hon. Friend announced on 3 July that he has commissioned a review of the secure accommodation currently available for young offenders and the youth justice task force will be advising Ministers on this issue.

 Most juveniles in detention have a tap with drinkable water in their cell. Where the cell does not have integral sanitation, individuals will have access to drinking water outside the cell; or if they are confined to their cell during the day they will be provided with a jug of water.
<P>

<a name="70723w18.html_para7">The young offender institution rules (21. (3)) state that male juveniles in detention may be required by the governor to shave or be shaved for neatness or, as directed by the medical officer, for health or cleanliness. The circumstances will vary according to the inmate: those needing to shave and who are not considered a suicide risk may keep their own razors, and are encouraged to shave each day; where a juvenile is considered a suicide risk the razor is issued temporarily for shaving under supervision.

 The Prison Service health care standards require establishments to provide reception screening, clinical and other health assessment, counselling and education, to treat inmates, promote healthier life styles and, generally, to enable them to take informed decisions regarding matters affecting their health. The standards apply to young offender institutions as well as adult prisons.

<P>
<a name="70723w19.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 I have approved funding of &#163;2.1 million for 1997-98 for the DTI-assisted international travel scheme which is administered for DTI by the British Standards Institution. This is &#163;100,000 less than the scheme's 1996-97 budget and reflects spend under the scheme in that financial year.
<P>

<a name="70723w19.html_para0">The aim of the scheme is to facilitate the attendance of key UK business delegates at overseas standards development meetings through a contribution to the cost of their air fares. It has always been the Government's view that business, as the main beneficiary of standards, should pay the lion's share of costs. The allowances are calculated using the return economy air fares in the "OAG World Airways Supplement" because this is understood to be the only publication that lists such fares on a worldwide basis.




<P>
<P><I>23 Jul 1997 : Column: 658</I><P>

<P>

<a name="70723w19.html_para1">My officials became aware earlier this year that these fares were higher than return economy air fares generally available in the marketplace; and that, consequently, the level of the allowance was out of line with the scheme's objectives. After careful consideration with BSI, the Department therefore decided, in order to ensure that the allowance reflected the scheme's objectives and also to obtain better value for money for the taxpayer, that it should reduce the contribution to a maximum of 65 per cent. of the quoted return economy air fare from London to the relevant overseas airport, nearest to where the standards development meeting is held. This was given effect from 1 July 1997. About 4,500 claims a year are made under AITS. The President has received four representations, in writing, about this reduction.
<P>

<a name="70723w19.html_para2">I know how much the AITS is appreciated by British business. It helps business to secure European and international standards which are supportive of UK competitiveness. Although the administration of the scheme is kept under regular review by both DTI and BSI, we have for the time being no plans for further changes.

<a name="70723w19.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Lansley: </B> 
To ask the President of the Board of Trade if she will make a statement on the level of grant given by the Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council to <i>(a)</i> the Royal Greenwich observatory and <i>(b)</i> the royal observatory, Edinburgh, in real terms for each year since 1992. [7492]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70723w19.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Battle </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 10 July 1997]:</i> The Royal Greenwich observatory and the royal observatory, Edinburgh became establishments of the Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council on 1 April 1994. At that time, the two observatories and the island sites operated as an integrated organisational entity under the control of a single director. Following the establishment of PPARC, the organisation was split into four independent establishments--RGO, ROE, joint astronomy centre, Hawaii, and Isaac Newton Group, La Palma, Canary Islands--each with a separate budget holder. The basis of funding was also changed in 1995-96 to one in which a more arm's-length customer-supplier relationship exists between the island directors and the Gemini Telescopes UK project manager as procurers of telescope instrumentation, and the UK directors of the UK observatories as suppliers.
<P>

<a name="70723w19.html_para3">Island directors and the Gemini Telescopes UK project manager each now receive separate allocations of funds reflecting their responsibility for procurement of instrumentation and telescope construction. Smaller sums are allocated to UK directors to finance core programmes, infrastructure and running costs. The UK directors are then expected to compete to win the available work from the island sites and any similar work that might become available from other sources. Similarly, the island directors and the Gemini project manager are expected to seek out the most cost-effective suppliers, but with the proviso that, where short-term changes to work load within the UK establishments would give rise to significant restructuring costs, restrictions will apply.

 The Welsh Consumer Council is a self-governing committee of the National Consumer Council, a company limited by guarantee established in 1975 to provide an independent, co-ordinated consumer voice. Establishment followed a 1974 White Paper, the statutory authority for Government funding of the NCC being section 20 of the Competition Act 1980. The WCC aims to further action to promote and safeguard the interests of consumers, to ensure that those who take decisions have a balanced and authoritative view of the interests of consumers before them and to insist that the interests of all consumers, including the inarticulate and disadvantaged, are taken into account. Although the WCC

To ask the President of the Board of Trade what relative weight the Minister for Science, Energy and Industry gave to <i>(a)</i> commercial interests, <i>(b)</i> animal welfare and <i>(c)</i> ethical considerations before deciding to write in the terms he did to Members of the European Parliament in respect of the biotechnology patents directive. [9537]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70723w22.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Battle </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 21 July 1997]:</i> The Commission's proposal for a directive on the legal protection of biotechnological inventions and the report on this proposal by the European Parliament's Legal Affairs Committee are generally consistent with current United Kingdom legislation and practice--the Patents Act 1977--which already balances the needs of industry with ethical considerations, such as animal welfare. In particular, they do not extend or substantially reduce what may be patented, and they set out the same conditions that must be met by an invention if it is to be afforded patent rights. Furthermore, the proposal provides for refusal or revocation of patents relating to transgenic animals if the suffering or handicap to the animal outweighs the benefit pursued. This is the test which is already applied in the United Kingdom.
<P>

<a name="70723w22.html_para0">The Commission's proposal does not seek any change to the nature of the patents system which is currently in operation in the United Kingdom and elsewhere, whereby a patent assists researchers in recouping the costs of their efforts by allowing them to prevent others from using an invention for a limited period, but gives no positive right to use an invention as such. The patent holder must comply with all other legislation and regulations, for instance concerning health, animal welfare and the environment in the making and use of his invention.

<P>

 The Secretary of State currently authorises 133 insolvency practitioners. In 1992, the corresponding figure was 148.

To ask the President of the Board of Trade how many practitioners appointed by the Insolvency Service have been discharged from Insolvency Service work over each of the last 10 years. [9822]<P>

<P>
<a name="70723w22.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Griffiths: </B> 
 Practitioners may be appointed by the Secretary of State to act as liquidator in a compulsory liquidation or as trustee in a bankruptcy. In such cases, the practitioner may be removed either by an order of court or by a meeting of creditors summoned specially for that purpose or by the Secretary of State. Records of the number of cases where a practitioner has been removed are not maintained, but there have been few cases in the past 10 years where the Secretary of State has removed a liquidator or trustee.

To ask the President of the Board of Trade what arrangements she has put in place to monitor the performance of insolvency practitioners appointed by the Insolvency Service; and on what basis their fees are <i>(a) </i>set and <i>(b)</i> regulated. [9821]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70723w22.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Griffiths: </B> 
 Insolvency practitioners appointed by the Secretary of State are, in common with all authorised insolvency practitioners, subject to a formal programme of monitoring visits by their authorising body. The visits are intended to assess whether a practitioner is fit and proper and to promote compliance with statutory obligations and best practice.
<P>

<a name="70723w22.html_para3">The fees of insolvency practitioners in liquidations and bankruptcies are subject to the approval of the liquidation committee or creditors committee respectively or by the creditors in general meetings. If there is no committee and no resolution of the creditors, the practitioner is entitled to be paid in accordance with the scale corresponding to what would have been paid to the official receiver if he were acting as liquidator or trustee. If either the liquidator or the creditors are dissatisfied with the level at which the remuneration has been fixed, there is provision for an application to be made to the court for the amount to be varied.

 From 1 April this year, the partnership between the Department of Trade and Industry and the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council, the Economic and Social Research Council, the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, the Natural Environment Research Council, the Medical Research Council and the Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council was defined within new combined management statements and financial memoranda which set out clear and comprehensive frameworks of respective responsibilities and accountabilities. These documents combine the provisions of a management statement and a financial memorandum and replace:

<P>
<a name="70723w23.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Radice: </B> 
To ask the President of the Board of Trade if she will make a statement about the future regulation of the insurance industry. [10589]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70723w23.html_spnew1"><B> Mrs. Beckett: </B> 
 The insurance industry is a key--and highly successful--part of the United Kingdom's financial services sector. In 1995, it earned worldwide premium income of some &#163;92 billion--equivalent to 14.3 per cent. of gross domestic product--and invisible earnings of &#163;5.4 billion.
<P>

<a name="70723w23.html_para2">It has long been an anomaly that, alone among financial services, prudential supervision of the insurance industry, has been carried out by the ministerial Government Department rather than an arm's-length body. The announcement by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer that the Government will be bringing forward legislation to create a new enlarged financial services regulatory body is an opportunity to put this right. I have therefore agreed with my right hon. Friend that, when the new unified regulatory body has been established, it should assume responsibility for the insurance supervisory functions presently carried out by my Department. The Prime Minister has agreed that the Treasury will assume ministerial responsibility for insurance matters and a transfer of functions order will be brought forward as soon as possible.

To ask the President of the Board of Trade if she will make a statement about the respective roles of her Department and Her Majesty's Treasury in procurement policy. [10590]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70723w23.html_spnew2"><B> Mrs. Beckett: </B> 
 At present, the Treasury is responsible for all aspects of public procurement policy. This includes public spending and value for money, both core Treasury functions, as well as EU and World Trade Organisation public procurement policy in which DTI has the major interest because of its responsibilities for completion of the single market and for trade policy. In my view, and that of my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the time has come to address this anomaly. He and I have agreed that our Departments should be jointly responsible for the procurement policy team, which is concerned primarily with UK procurement policy and the EC public procurement directives.
<P>

<a name="70723w23.html_para3">The team will report to senior officials and Ministers in DTI on EU and WTO public procurement policy and to Treasury officials and Ministers on other issues. Officials will agree a short memorandum of understanding setting out the respective responsibilities and arrangements for ensuring co-ordination with other units

in both Departments. A similar model of joint responsibility with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office already operates successfully in DTI in respect of the Joint Export Promotion Directorate and the Invest in Britain Bureau.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70723w23.html_spnew3"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 A liberalised trade and investment climate is essential for international development and poverty alleviation and my Department will continue to develop policies that promote open markets. One of our key priorities is to facilitate the integration of developing countries into the multilateral trading system and to encourage these countries to maximise their potential to attract and retain investment. The Government's forthcoming White Paper on international development will set out the detail of policies designed to achieve these objectives.
