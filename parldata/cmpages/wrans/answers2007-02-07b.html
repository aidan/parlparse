 In 2006, DFID provided approximately US$ 350,000 for support to internally displaced people through community-based groups in Eastern Burma.

teams covering different areas of the country, and during 2006 they booked over 490 visits including Comprehensive, Grammar, Independent, single sex, and Faith Schools (Church of England, Catholic, and Muslim). These presentations are extremely well received and do allow us to get our messages over about the importance of defence. Almost all schools ask for a repeat visit the following year which has lead to a yearly increase in presentations. Civilian and military staff are seen as excellent role models and there are consequently significant benefits for future recruiting. The actual investment in the Defence Schools Presentation Teams has been about &#163;1.9 million per year. I have placed in the Library of the House a chart detailing the tasking of the five teams during 2006.

It has been planned as a ten year programme. Defence Dynamics will start with the delivery in September 2007 of 40+ lesson plans with audio-visuals in Science, Maths and English based on scenarios that reflect the professional work of the MOD and the armed forces worldwide. The material will be developed to support the requirements of the school curriculum and across a range of subject areas in the longer term. MOD will be working closely with DfES and the devolved Government education Departments in the UK. Initially the Defence Dynamics programme will run for two years with the aim to develop this for the long-term. An e-learning approach has been used successfully in Australian schools since 2002.</p>

 The Ministry of Defence places a very high priority on the welfare of its service personnel and their families. To that end, there are significant single service welfare resources in place for all personnel and their families which can be accessed through unit welfare and community support staff. This support is significantly increased during operational periods for the families of those deployed on operations. In particular extra travel allowances are available for dependants and close family members and a welfare grant is also made available to the parent unit to help fund group welfare activities and facilities.</p>

 Analysis for the Department for Transport estimated the &#145;marginal&#146; costs (in 2002-03 prices) of extending existing concessions offered by local authorities in their areas to free &#145;bus&#146; travel, at all time and for all purposes, for five to 16-year-olds at around &#163;365 million per year, and around a further &#163;160 million per year for 17 and 18-year-olds. A total extra cost of approximately &#163;525 million per annum. These estimates are for England only, are restricted to concessionary bus travel within the local authority in which the concessionaire is resident, and excludes any Barnett consequentials. The Department has no cost information on concessionary travel for people aged 18 to 21 years and on other forms of public transport for children and young people.</p>

This is extremely difficult to estimate due to the uncertainties about: take-up, the extra concessionary travel generated, the switch from dedicated school transport, travel behaviour and the amount of additional capacity required. The existence of all these inter-related variables creates significant uncertainty in any estimate.</p>

A further &#163;120 million will be allocated for the 2007-08 grant period resulting in a total expenditure of &#163;605 million.

 It is not possible to calculate the percentage of lamps on the House of Commons estate which are low energy, but it can be said that the majority of the lamps in use are low energy. Parliamentary estate engineers have been proactive in using low-energy lamps for several years and two of the earliest installations in the UK of the Philips QL lamps, which use less than a third of the energy of standard tungsten lamps, were inside the Clock Tower and on the Terrace. This work has continued with the Palace external lanterns and Star Chamber Court, Members Staircase and the Colonnade lights all being converted to QL lamps since then. The Clock Tower external floodlighting and the Lower Secretaries offices, Upper Committee Corridors North and South and 1 Derby Gate lights were all fitted with low-energy lamps during the last two years. There are several types of low-energy lamps currently on trial in the Upper Committee Corridor wall light fittings and comments on them would be most welcome.</p>

It should be noted that using low-energy lamps, which are usually the fluorescent type, in some light fittings in historic areas of the palace would not be appropriate, for example the chandelier in Central Lobby. Projects for installing more low-energy and long-life lamps and for installing lighting controls are being considered at present and suggestions for areas to investigate would be welcome.</p>

 British Standard 7971 &#147;Protective Clothing and Equipment for Use in Violent Situations and in Training&#148; was developed as an umbrella and generic set of standards rather than as a police-specific standard. As such, it is intended to cover additional walks of life where violence, confrontation or training might be an issue. Each standard under the umbrella relates to specific equipment. Where the Home Office Scientific Development Branch has published a standard for Protective Equipment an assessment has been made that the Police Operational Requirement is not met by the corresponding element from the generic BS 7971 set. Other elements of the BS 7971 set will be assessed to see whether they meet the POR prior to work being carried out on a police-specific standard</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what average percentage of the operational budget for policing of police forces in England and Wales was spent on police pensions in the last period for which figures are available. [118174]</p>

 The total net revenue budget for the police service in 2006-7 is &#163;10.0 billion. The projected figure for employer&#146;s pension contributions is &#163;1.13 billion (11 per cent.).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_427"><a name="70207w0016.htm_para0"><a name="0702081000541">Under the new system of pensions financing introduced on 1 April 2006 police authorities now have a separate pensions account out of which retired officers&#146; pensions are paid. Where the cost of pensions in payment exceeds the level of employer and officer contributions paid into the pension account in any year the account is topped up with a grant from central Government; any surplus is recouped. A key benefit of this change is that it takes away from police authorities the responsibility for meeting the rising cost of pensions, as the number of pensioners increases, from the operational budget. Instead, the operational budget now only has to provide for the employer&#146;s contributions.</p>

 The Department&#146;s aim is for all schools in England to be sustainable schools by 2020. In 2006 we consulted on a framework to help schools embed sustainability across all areas of school life including the curriculum. This academic year is a year of action to help schools become sustainable. We are working with partners to develop resources to support the teaching and learning of key issues like climate change such as a pupil &#145;detective kit&#146; and teacher resource pack. A climate change package including a copy of Al Gore&#146;s film &#145;An Inconvenient Truth&#146; is also being made available to all schools.</p>

This year it will produce poster-based teaching resources on climate change for schools. The Climate Challenge Fund was set up in 2006 by DEFRA to provide financial support for communications projects seeking to achieve positive changes in public attitudes about climate change. A number of the projects will create resources for schools, including an e-learning game, education packs and DVDs.</p>

<i> [holding answer 6 February 2007]: </i>Education about safety is included in the curriculum through the non-statutory framework of personal social and health education (PSHE). In PSHE lessons pupils are taught about rules for, and ways of, keeping safe, to recognise the risks that apply in different situations and then to decide how to behave responsibly. They should be taught to recognise and manage risk, to be aware when pressure from others threatens their personal safety and to develop assertiveness techniques when dealing with unhelpful pressure. Schools may use the issue of safe driving when addressing these learning outcomes.</p>

<tr valign="top"><td class="tabletext" colspan="7"><sup>(1)</sup> School-based expenditure includes only expenditure incurred directly by the schools. This includes the pay of teachers and school-based support staff, school premises costs, books and equipment, and certain other supplies and services, less any capital items funded from recurrent spending and income from sales, fees and charges and rents and rates. This excludes the central cost of support services such as home to school transport, local authority administration and the financing of capital expenditure which cannot be attributed to a particular phase of education.<br>
<sup>(2)</sup> Expenditure was not distinguished between the pre-primary and primary sectors until the inception of Section 52 for financial year 1999-2000.<br>
<sup>(3)</sup> School-based expenditure in LA maintained nursery schools was not recorded in 2002-03 and comparable figures are not available for 2003-04 onwards.<br>
<sup>(4)</sup> Spending in 1997-98 reflects the transfer of moneys from local government to central Government for the nursery vouchers scheme. These were returned to local government from 1998-99.<br>
<sup>(5)</sup> The 1999-2000 figures reflect the return of grant maintained schools to local authority maintenance.<br>
<sup>(6)</sup> 1999-2000 saw a change in data source when the data collection moved from the RO1 form collected by the ODPM to the Section 52 form from the DfES. 2002-03 saw a further break in the time series following the introduction of Consistent Financial Reporting (CFR) to schools and the associated restructuring of the outturn tables. The change in sources is shown by the blank row.<br>
<sup>(7)</sup> The calculation for 2002-03 onwards is broadly similar to the calculation in previous years. However, 2001-02 and earlier years includes all premature retirement compensation (PRC) and Crombie payments, mandatory PRC payments and other indirect employee expenses. Also, for some LAs, expenditure that had previously been attributed to the school sectors was reported within the LA part of the form from 2002-03 and would therefore be excluded, though this is not quantifiable from existing sources.<br>
<sup>(8)</sup> 2005-06 data is subject to change by the local authority.<br>
<sup>(9)</sup> Figures are rounded to the nearest &#163;1,000.<br>
<sup>(10)</sup> Financial data is collected at a local authority level and not at constituency level and consequently figures for the constituency of Yarrow are not available. Yarrow has schools in both South Tyneside LA and Gateshead LA and consequently figures are provided for both.<br>

 The coefficients were calculated on the full national dataset of approximately 600,000 pupils reaching the end of Key Stage 4 in 2006, taking account of their KS2 and KS4 attainment together with the individual pupil level characteristics collected in the Annual School Census in January 2006. The coefficient for a particular characteristic shows the average effect of that characteristic on pupil attainment, after taking account of each pupil&#146;s prior attainment and all the other characteristics included in the model.

a crucial first step for them to develop an enthusiasm for reading. Our renewed primary literacy framework draws on the recommendations of Jim Rose&#146;s review of the teaching of early reading, and the systematic use of phonics as the prime strategy for the teaching of reading, and will help improve reading levels amongst all pupils. The national roll-out of the &#147;Every Child a Reader&#148; initiative will help those children who experience difficulties in learning to read.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_443"><a name="70207w0019.htm_para3"><a name="0702081001548">We recognise that reading for pleasure is critical to improving children's life chances and we are taking action on several fronts to promote this. This includes providing a range of materials to support teachers, school librarians and others to ensure that schools both provide high-quality teaching and learning in reading, and promote an environment which encourages children's enthusiasm for reading. We encourage schools to develop study support activities which focus on literacy, including reading and book clubs. Our &#147;Playing for Success&#148; study support centres which open out of school hours use sport as a theme in their reading activities to encourage children to read.</p>

Key strands are Reading Connects, which supports schools in building whole-school reading communities; and Reading Champions, which finds and celebrates positive male role models and seeks to change boys&#146; attitudes to reading. A third strand of work, the Family Reading Campaign, launched earlier this year, is working in partnership with key organisations to promote the benefits of reading in the home and show parents and other family members how easily they can support their children.</p>

In addition, the 2006 pre-Budget report announced funding to provide every child making the transition to both primary and secondary school&#151;including all children entering schools in the independent sector, special schools, or any other kind of school&#151;with a free book, from autumn 2007.</p>

A rural area is defined as a settlement of fewer than 10,000 inhabitants.

 About 70 per cent, of care home residents aged 65 and over have all or part of their care publicly funded.

Treatment and Support Services centres in Cumbria on <i> (a)</i> the review being undertaken by Cumbria Primary Care Trust, <i> (b)</i> services provided by the West Cumberland Hospital and <i> (c)</i> proposals for a new acute hospital to replace the West Cumberland Hospital. [111639]</p>

 Health services across Cumbria are currently being reviewed to ensure that local services are sustainable, fit for purpose, effective and affordable. Proposals for a new acute hospital in West Cumbria are being developed in the context of this review. Any proposals emerging from this review will be subject to public consultation in due course.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_494"><a name="70207w0027.htm_para3"><a name="0702081003254">The six primary care trusts (PCTs) in Cumbria and Lancashire are currently carrying out public consultation on the details of the local implementation of the clinical assessment, treatment and support (CATS) services in the two counties. The consultation covers the locations of the CATS sites, the impact on the wider health services, how the CATS can fit seamlessly into the pathway from general practitioner referrer through to local hospitals treatment, and whether the clinical specialties proposed (orthopaedics, rheumatology, ear, nose and throat, general surgery, urology and gynaecology) are the most appropriate. The PCTs are also undertaking a locality impact assessment of the CATS scheme. These pieces of work will be considered as part of the Cumbria whole system review.</p>

They have been calculated from the numbers appearing in Table 14 of this year's article, and previous versions of the same table.

</ul><a name="70207w0029.htm_brev5"><a name="0702085001522"><ul><p class="tabletext">The tax burden is the proportion of gross income taken in both direct and indirect taxes. Gross income includes income from wages, occupational pensions, self-employment income, investment income, and income from state benefits, all before tax. Direct taxes include income tax, national insurance contributions and council tax. The indirect taxes include VAT, duties, and a number of smaller items such as television licences. Indirect taxes also include intermediate taxes &#151;these are indirect taxes paid by companies which are deemed to be passed onto households through the prices they pay for goods and services. A more detailed breakdown showing each of the different taxes appears in the annual article.</p>
</ul><a name="70207w0029.htm_brev6"><a name="0702085001523"><ul><p class="tabletext">There was a change in the way the figures were compiled in 2002/03 which will affect the estimated tax burden. Up until 2001/02, charges for water, environmental and sewage services were treated as local taxes, whereas from 2002/03 onwards they were excluded. The local tax category now just includes council tax and Northern Ireland rates, and in the annual article it is labelled as such.</p>

</ul><a name="70207w0029.htm_brev8"><a name="0702085001525"><ul><p class="tabletext">There was also a change to the way that tax credits were treated from 2003/04 onwards. Up until 2002/03 tax credits were treated as cash benefits. From 2003/04, they are classified as negative income tax, but only to the extent that income tax less tax credits, remains greater than or equal to zero for each family. So for households paying relatively little or no income tax, tax credit payments were still regarded either partially or wholly, as cash benefits. Based on figures for 2003/04, the effect of this change is to reduce the estimate of the average tax burden for all households by 0.3%.</p>
</ul><a name="70207w0029.htm_brev9"><a name="0702085001526"><ul><p class="tabletext">The tax burden, when expressed as a proportion of gross income appears particularly high for the bottom income decile, although this result needs to be interpreted carefully. The apparently high tax burden is due to payment of indirect rather than direct taxes Estimates of indirect taxes are imputed based on household expenditure. It should be remembered that measured expenditure will not necessarily balance with measured income for the year.

In these cases, expenditure is not being met from current income. Some types of receipts are not included as income in the EFS e.g. inheritance and severance payments.

<i> Notes:</i><br>
1. Proportion of calls handled by adviser/abandoned&#151;calculated using calls offered for the adviser to answer. These figures do not include calls receiving an engaged tone and other outcomes because the adviser is unable to answer such calls.<br>
2. Those calls receiving an engaged tone and other outcomes occur and are measured before they reach the contact centre and before being offered for the adviser to answer. This is a standard telephony definition.<br>

 Before the Financial Assistance Scheme is able to start processing applications for individual scheme members, the pension scheme has to complete the Notification and Qualification processes.

 If the state pension of people living in frozen rate countries was brought up to the current rate they would have received if they had remained in the UK it would cost around &#163;410 million in 2006-07 and would increase year on year. This figure does not include paying any arrears.</p>

for the payments to be available by Christmas. We decided to make all automatic payments by Christmas to reassure pensioners that they will have extra money available to pay for heating their homes during the coldest part of the year. If the qualifying week were to be significantly later than it is at present, then payments would have to be made in the early part of the following year. Departmental computer systems are already working to full capacity during the early months of the year to accommodate the uprating of benefits in April. It would not be possible to issue over 11 million winter fuel payments at the same time without putting this at risk.</p>
