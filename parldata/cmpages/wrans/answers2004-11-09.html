 Following the second successful meeting of the Commission for Africa in Addis Ababa, the Commission has produced its consultation document, which is now available on its website. The Commission will be seeking the views of governments, civil society and businesses within and beyond Africa, on this document until 17 December. I hope that hon.

 The most recent UN Humanitarian Profile (October 2004) indicated that approximately 529,000 internally displaced people are in the South of Darfur, of which Nyala is the capital. A large proportion of these are in camps and settlements. The UN reports that 170,963 are internally displaced people known to be hosted in camps in the Nyala area. It is likely that there are further numbers of displaced persons in host communities and recent arrivals due to insecurity moving into the area.

<a name="stpa_8">On 2 November, the Government of Sudan forcefully relocated of 6&#150;8,000 internally displaced people from the El Geer camp (previously known as the El Seraif camp) in the Nyala area. This occurred without prior consultation with the UN. It was therefore in breach of the established and agreed mechanism to determine voluntary return and movement of people. The UK strongly condemns any forced relocations, and through our Ambassador to Sudan, has made representations to the Government of Sudan to adhere to its obligations and commitments under the Memorandum of Understanding on Darfur, between the Government of Sudan and the International Organisation for Migration, which prohibits involuntary movement of internally displaced persons. This has been echoed by the EU and UN. DFID continues to monitor the situation closely.

<a name="stpa_10">Due to very limited access in Darfur up until April 2004, the UN did not estimate figures on a monthly basis beyond its September 2003 report of 250,000 displaced people. From April 2004 until August, the UN estimated that there were just over 1 million displaced people. From September this figure reached 1.5 million. The reasons for this increase is due to the on-going violence and improving access to Darfur. For Sudan as a whole, the UN has not made monthly estimates.

We will do so, in the context of wider ranging AGM suggestions and recommendations for the future of motorcycling.

Initial conclusions emphasise site-specific management as the key. Further work has been agreed, on an inter-disciplinary approach taking account of social and economic interests. Discussions at ORNIS (the EC Committee covering the Birds Directive), also covered the Development of a Framework for Biodiversity Reconciliation Action Plan (RAP). The data from REDCAFE will be input into this process, along with other European initiatives such as the IMEW (Integrated Management of European Wetlands). The RAP aims to fully quantify the problems, develop a solution and provide synthesis and dissemination of the results. This process will provide a participatory decision strategy.

There is also scope to specify more in-season food, rather than out of season or exotic produce that can only be supplied from abroad, and to organise the size of contracts and lots within contracts so that small and local suppliers have more chance of being able to meet demands. Public bodies do, of course, have an overarching duty to secure value for money and so must ensure that the measures they adopt to encourage more supplies of local food are proportionate and justified. They are also required by the EC treaty, the EC procurement directives and the UK regulations that implement them to ensure that public procurement is fair, transparent and not used to discriminate by setting up barriers to free trade. We are also encouraging public sector bodies to work with their food service companies to play an active part in achieving this aim by ensuring that local suppliers are given opportunities to be part of their supply chains, provided they are able to provide value for money and meet their requirements on quality, consistency of supply and food safety etc.

The Public Records (Scotland) Act 1937 makes provision for the preservation, care and custody of the public records of Scotland. There is not, however, any statutory basis for closure of records created by Scottish public bodies.

<a name="stpa_78">By contrast, in England and Wales the Public Records Act 1958 (as amended by the Public Records Act 1967) sets a statutory &quot;closure period&quot; of 30 years after which records must, with limited exceptions, be made available to the public. The 1937 Act does not impose similar obligations on Scottish Executive departments, but in practice those procedures are followed in Scotland.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41109w07.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_79">The criteria for closures longer than 30 years were defined in a White Paper on Open Government published in 1993 (Cm 2290), which stated that it is for the department responsible for depositing the material to decide on the closure period.

<a name="41109w07.html_para7">
<a name="stpa_80">Documents containing information about individuals, whose disclosure would cause either substantial distress, or endangerment from a third party to persons affected by disclosure or their descendants can be subject to a variable closure period of between 40 and 100 years.

<p>
<a name="41109w07.html_para8">
<a name="stpa_81">At the conclusion of Lord Cullen&#039;s inquiry, the papers were lodged with the then Scottish Record Office. As is normal practice, the closure periods were identified by the SRO, in consultation with the Secretary to the Inquiry and the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service. In light of the obvious sensitivities in relation to the information about children and alleged offences against them the productions were closed for 100 years. This closure was in accordance with the Government guidelines published in the White Paper &quot;Open Government&quot; Cm 2290 (1993) and Lord Cullen was content with these arrangements.

<a name="41109w07.html_para9">
<a name="stpa_82">However, subsequently the Lord Advocate decided that the material from the Dunblane inquiry should be catalogued by staff at the National Archives of Scotland in a way which did not lead to the identification of children. The cataloguing of the productions has recently been completed. Officials from the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service are currently reviewing this material and considering what information is suitable for release either in its entirety or in an edited format. However, the sensitive nature of the information contained in some of the material will obviously prevent its release before the end of the 100-year closure period.

<sup>(8)</sup> Change since 1997&#150;98<br>

Notes:<br>

1. Price Base: Real terms at 2003&#150;04 prices, based on GDP deflators as at 30 June 2004.<br>

2. Figures reflect relevant sub-blocks of education SSA/EFS settlements and exclude the pensions transfer to EPS and LSC.<br>

3. Total funding also includes all revenue grants in DfES Departmental Expenditure Limits relevant to pupils aged 3&#150;10 and 11&#150;15 and exclude EMAs and grants not allocated at LEA level. For those LEAs in receipt of advance of grant under the transitional support arrangements for 2004&#150;05, advance grant funding is included in the year of payment (2004&#150;05). There will be a consequential reduction in DfES grant for these LEAs in future years (either 2006&#150;07 and 2007&#150;08 or 2006&#150;07 to 2008&#150;09, depending on the terms on which the advance was given to the LEA).<br>

4. The pupil numbers used to convert &#163; million figures to &#163; per pupil are those underlying the SSA/EFS settlement calculations plus PLASC 3-year-old maintained pupils and estimated 3&#150;4 year olds funded through state support in maintained and other educational institutions where these are not included in the SSA pupil numbers.<br>

5. Rounding: Figures are rounded to the nearest 10.<br>

6. Status: 2004&#150;05 figures are provisional as some grants have not yet been finalised/audited.<br>

7. 1997&#150;98 figures for LEAs subject to Local Government Reorganisation in that year have been estimated, pro-rata to their post LGR figures.<br>

 Standards Fund grants are allocated to local education authorities, not directly to schools. The amount allocated to schools is a matter for local decision. The following table gives the Standards Fund recurrent and capital allocations, including local authority contributions, for the London borough of Havering from 1998&#150;99 to 2004&#150;05. From 1999&#150;2000 the Standards Fund included a grant to support the statutory reduction of infant class sizes. In 2003&#150;04 this class size funding was transferred to Education Formula Spending baselines. The amount transferred for Havering was &#163;535,000.

 My Department does not assess the operation of the National Grid for Learning (NGfL) programme, or its successor the ICT in Schools programme, at individual local authority level. Each authority is responsible for making sure that ICT in Schools&#039; funding is used to best effect in support of national priorities. The NGfL Pathfinders and ImpaCT2 studies investigated the roll out and effect of the programme nationwide. These reported the different approaches to implementing the then National Grid for Learning taken by authorities and ImpaCT2, for example, reported that the effective use of ICT could improve levels of pupil attainment by the equivalent of half a grade at GCSE.

The vast majority of these defects have no impact on a submarine&#039;s seaworthiness. Systems that could affect seaworthiness generally have some form of back up to prevent the submarine from being at risk as a result of a single failure; this is inherent in the design. Safety is of paramount importance and a submarine would not be sent to sea unless it was safe to do so.

<p><a name="st_201"><a name="41109w21.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. MacShane: </b> 
 Following the referendum on the UN Secretary General&#039;s comprehensive settlement plan in which the Greek Cypriots voted &quot;no&quot; and the Turkish Cypriots &quot;yes&quot;, the EU agreed to end the isolation of the Turkish Cypriots. In practice, we are working to reach EU agreement on regulations to enable preferential direct trade between north Cyprus and the rest of the EU, and to disburse the &#163;259 million of aid allocated for the north of the island.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41109w21.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_158">We support these measures as we believe it is important for the EU to bring Turkish Cypriots closer to Europe, and help to build trade links and reduce the economic gap between the two communities. This will make reunification more likely, easier to consolidate and less costly. Trade will increase trust and lay the foundations for co-operation in a reunified Cyprus. A widening wealth gap and continued economic division will make a solution much more difficult.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41109w21.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_159">As I told the Greek Cypriot leadership during my recent visit to the island, we understand the concerns that made Greek Cypriots vote &quot;no&quot; to the UN plan and look forward to seeing Greek Cypriot proposals on moving the process forward. If we believe the proposals are reasonable and have a realistic chance of success, we will encourage the UN Secretary-General to re-engage and put all our resources and influence behind finding a solution on the basis of the Annan Plan that is 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>9 Nov 2004 : Column 632W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>

 The national programme for information technology (NPfIT) has always made it clear that the best use should and will be made of the existing asset base so long as it continues to provide value and be fit for purpose. General practitioners are being advised that, certainly in the short and medium term, existing clinical systems can continue to be used subject to compliance criteria. This message has been repeated in guidance published by the national programme, aimed at existing systems suppliers. No practice will be expected to move from current systems until the same or greater levels of functionality than GPs currently enjoy are available under the national programme, unless that is part of an agreed strategy or by choice for specific reasons.

<sup>(30)</sup> For deaths between 1999 and 2000, bowel cancer was identified using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes 153&#150;154. For deaths between 2001 and 2003, the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes C18-C21 were used.<br>

<sup>(31)</sup> The introduction of ICD-10 for coding cause of death in 2001 resulted in the number of deaths coded as cancer at all ages increasing by 2.5 per cent. for males and 2.2 per cent. for females. For this reason, figures are not completely comparable with those for years before this date and should therefore be interpreted with caution. A description of the effects of the change in classification in 2001 on deaths from cancer was published in Health Statistics Quarterly in May 2002.*<br>

 The Northern Ireland Blood Transfusion Service&#039;s (NIBTS) policies and procedures for selection of blood donors are based on national guidelines produced and agreed by the four United Kingdom Blood Transfusion Services.

<p>
<a name="41109w29.html_para0">
Any donor may suffer adverse reactions to blood donation, which on occasions can be quite severe. Such reactions must be dealt with on a proper blood donation couch (not a wheelchair) so that they can be addressed safely. Donors must therefore not donate blood in their wheelchair, and be able to climb on and off the donation couch. If the underlying cause of disability in the case of a wheelchair user, or others, is not a contraindication, blood donation may be acceptable. However, certain causes of disability may preclude individuals from donating for reasons of safety to the recipient as well as the donor. Health and safety issues for staff normally preclude donors being physically lifted onto a donor couch. NIBTS provides wheelchair access at all its fixed (permanent) donation venues including the purpose designed BloodMobile and also at the vast majority of mobile donation sessions throughout the province.
