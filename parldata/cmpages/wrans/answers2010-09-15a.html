 As part of the tender process for 2010 contracts the Legal Services Commission (LSC) (who, as the body that administers the legal aid budget, managed the tender process) applied a 'capacity test' across civil areas of work.

Crown Courts: area categorisation based on the prosecuting police force area (which is not necessarily the area of the sentencing court). If another agency has brought the prosecution, area categorisation is based on the criminal justice area of the sentencing court.<br>
<i> Magistrates Courts:</i> As part of the rollout of the Libra case management system in magistrates courts during 2008. a change was made to the categorisation by area. Sentences given at courts using the Libra system are categorised according to the criminal justice area of the court while others are categorised in the same way as the Crown Court. By the end of 2008, all magistrates courts were using Libra. Police forces do not prosecute minor offences (those that are sentenced at magistrates courts) outside their areas. Only around 0.01% of sentences at magistrates courts were affected in 2007 and 2008.<br>

Quality and fit of prosthetic limbs are of paramount importance in the rehabilitation process, and as part of the routine clinical care every amputee case at DMRC is regularly assessed for the comfort and fit of their socket, and the alignment and functional quality of all components are checked every time the patient comes to DMRC as either an in-patient or out-patient.</p>

 As at 1 July 2010, there were 8,470 service personnel who are citizens of Commonwealth countries. It is not possible to ascertain without disproportionate cost the numbers of Commonwealth service personnel who have served in the last five or in the last 10 years. However, as at 1 April 2000 and 1 April 2005, there were 820 and 6,040 Commonwealth personnel respectively in the Army. Figures for the Naval Service and RAF are not available as their legacy database systems do not enable the distinction to be made between Commonwealth citizens and other non-British nationals. There has been no estimate of future trends in the recruitment of Commonwealth citizens.</p>

 No, not all the land occupied by the Ministry of Defence's (MOD) facilities in Cyprus is classed as sovereign British territory. Under the 1960 Treaty of Establishment (ToE) the United Kingdom retained British sovereignty over two areas, one in the south (Akrotiri) and the other in the east (Dhekelia), which are known collectively as the Sovereign Base Areas (SBAs). In addition, the MOD has facilities on several 'retained sites'. The ToE gives the UK rights on these sites, although the Republic of Cyprus has sovereignty over the territory on which the retained sites are located.</p>

 We know that the demand from young people and adults for good quality employer-owned apprenticeships is high and the Government are committed to increasing the number of apprenticeships, in particular, advanced apprenticeships that confer technician status. The Government's decision to redeploy £150 million of our savings for 2010-11, creating an additional 50,000 adult apprenticeship places, demonstrates our commitment to high-quality skills. The National Apprenticeships Service and the Skills Funding Agency are working with training providers which will be encouraging employers to make these additional places available. This investment in our future will help train the next generation, as well as developing the existing work force, which is vital to build a modern advanced economy.</p>

 The Food Standards Agency funded a series of questions on food technologies, including genetically modified foods, as part of the 2008 British Social Attitudes (BSA) Survey. The total cost of this work, of which genetic modification was only a part, was £89.590. Following from this survey, the agency commissioned qualitative research into public attitudes among groups of people who had expressed differing views on genetically modified food in the BSA Survey. The cost of this work was £73,654.50. The results of these projects are available from the Agency's website.</p>

HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. Changes to the figures over time need to be interpreted in the context of improvements in data quality and coverage (particularly in earlier years). In particular improvements in how 'bariatric surgery' is coded, with the introduction of new codes in various versions of the Office of Population, Censuses and Surveys (OPCS), growth due to better recording of procedures should not be misinterpreted as growth solely due to increases in activity.<br>
 These data should not be described as a count of people as the same person may have been admitted on more than one occasion. Also it is not possible to get a total 'bariatric surgery' figure from this data, as adding the types of 'bariatric surgery' together may include double counting, as a patient may have more than one type of 'bariatric surgery' within the same year.<br>
<sup>(1)</sup> Finished Consultant Episode (FCE)<br>
A finished consultant episode (FCE) is a continuous period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. FCEs are counted against the year in which they end. Figures do not represent the number of different patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the same stay in hospital or in different stays in the same year.<br>
<sup>(2)</sup> Primary diagnosis<br>
The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 20 (14 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and seven prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in the HES data set and provides the main reason why the patient was admitted to hospital.<br>
 ICD-10 code used:<br>
E66-Obesity<br>
<sup>(3)</sup> Number of episodes with a (named) main or secondary procedure<br>
The number of episodes where the procedure (or intervention) was recorded in any of the 24 (12 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and four prior to 2002-03) procedure fields in a HES record. A record is only included once in each count, even if the procedure is recorded in more than one procedure field of the record. Note that more procedures are carried out than episodes with a main or secondary procedure. For example, patients under going a 'cataract operation' would tend to have at least two procedures - removal of the faulty lens and the fitting of a new one-counted in a single episode.<br>
See clinical codes sheet for OPCS codes used for 'bariatric surgery'.<br>
Data quality<br>
HES are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England and from some independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br>
 Strategic Health Authority (SHA)/PCT of residence<br>
The SHA or PCT containing the patient's normal home address. This does not necessarily reflect where the patient was treated as they may have travelled to another SHA/PCT for treatment.<br>
Assessing growth through time<br>
HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. Changes to the figures over time need to be interpreted in the context of improvements in data quality and coverage (particularly in earlier years), improvements in coverage of independent sector activity (particularly from 2006-07) and changes in NHS practice. For example, apparent reductions in activity may be due to a number of procedures which may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and so no longer include in admitted patient HES data.<br>
