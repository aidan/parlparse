<P>
<P>
<a name="31118w01.html_wqn0"><B> Norman Baker: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what controls exist over the <i>(a)</i> level and <i>(b)</i> toxicity of emissions from cement kilns used for co-incineration; what chemical analysis of the (i) product and (ii) dust generated is carried out; and how these controls compare in respect of maximum emission levels with standard incinerators.  [138575]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31118w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Cement kilns are regulated by the Environment Agency under the Pollution Prevention and Control (England and Wales) Regulations 2000 (the PPC Regulations). The PPC Regulations control industrial pollution through a system of permits, and require that operators use the best available techniques ("BAT") to control pollution from their activities. In determining applications for PPC permits, the Environment Agency considers the level and toxicity of emissions and sets permit conditions to ensure a high level of protection to the environment (inclusive of human health) as a whole.
<P>

<a name="31118w01.html_para0">The analysis of the final cement product is outside the remit of the Environment Agency. Dust generated from the process is collected in abatement equipment and then discarded from the process. Such material is classified as a waste and its generation and subsequent management are regulated under PPC at the installation, and the Waste Management Licensing Regulations 1994 once the dust is discarded from the installation. Under certain circumstances the alkalinity levels in this type of waste may be sufficient for it to be given the technical designation of "hazardous" waste. The analysis required would depend on whether the material is consigned for recovery, landfill or any other treatment for disposal.
<P>

<a name="31118w01.html_para1">The maximum emission levels specified for installations manufacturing cement or incinerating waste are based on what the Environment Agency considers to be BAT for each individual installation, but also take into consideration local factors and other relevant statutory requirements. As the technologies for cement manufacture and waste incineration are different, the maximum emission limits for the principal emissions (oxides of nitrogen, sulphur dioxide, particulates etc.) are not directly comparable.

<a name="31118w01.html_wqn1"><B> Norman Baker: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what controls exist over the nature of fuels used in cement kilns where co-incineration takes place.  [138576]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31118w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Cement kilns that co-incinerate waste are regulated by the Environment Agency under the Pollution Prevention and Control (England and Wales) 



<P>
<P><I>18 Nov 2003 : Column 716W</I><P>
Regulations 2000 ("the PPC Regulations"). The operator is required to comply with the 1989 Municipal Waste Incineration Directives (89/429/EEC and 89/369/EEC), the 1994 Hazardous Waste Incineration Directive (94/67/EC) and from 28 December 2005 the Waste incineration Directive (2000/76/EC).
<P>

<a name="31118w01.html_para2">The Environment Agency is the regulator for such cement kilns. Permits issued under the PPC Regulations contain permit conditions which control the type and nature of the fuel to be used, and establish the operating conditions under which that fuel could be used.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will list the types of <i>(a)</i> fuels and <i>(b)</i> raw materials used since 1 January in the production of cement at Rugby Cement Works, Rugby.  [138579]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31118w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Since 1 January 2003 to date the cement works in Rugby has used as fuel: coal, fuel oil (for site vehicles) and gas oil (as start up fuel); and as raw materials: chalk, clay, grinding aids and air entrainers, gypsum, iron oxide source, limestone filler, lubricating oils and other maintenance fluids and pulverised fuel ash.

<a name="31118w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Goodman: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs pursuant to her answer of 17 September 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 776&#150;77W, on flooding, what progress has been made with regard to pre-feasibility studies to identify options for the alleviation of flooding in Medmenham and Marlow.  [138467]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31118w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
<i> [holding answer 13 November 2003]</i>: I understand that the Environment Agency's study of options for reducing flood risk in Medmenham and related areas will be concluded by the end of November. The agency is planning to present the findings to local flood action groups and councils in December and January. I also understand that a report on the agency's study of options for Firview Close, Marlow is expected by the end of November. In both cases the conclusion of studies is a month later than expected previously because the agency's consultants have been looking at further possible options.
<P>

<a name="31118w01.html_para3">I understand that the agency's consultants have completed a pre-feasibility investigation into options for the Pound Lane area, Marlow, and that the indications are that a scheme to construct a bund at the rear of Pound Lane to reduce the impact of overland flooding may be justifiable. Further investigations into groundwater problems would be required at feasibility stage.

<a name="31118w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Weir: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (1) what recent meetings she has had with her EU counterparts at which plans to change the procedure for approval of GM <i>(a)</i> foods and <i>(b)</i> seeds within the EU were discussed;  [138218]




<P>
<P><I>18 Nov 2003 : Column 717W</I><P>

<P>
<UL>(2) what recent meetings she has had with her EU counterparts to discuss regulation of GM crops; and if she will make a statement.  [138219]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31118w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Ministers from the Department have regular discussions with their EU counterparts on issues relating to genetically modified crops, seeds and foods. The issue has, in particular, featured on the agenda for several recent meetings of Councils of Agriculture and Environment Ministers.
<P>

<a name="31118w01.html_para4">For instance, at the Environment Council in July 2003 EU Ministers agreed to two new EC Regulations. One Regulation elaborates and extends existing rules on traceability and labelling of any GM product. The other Regulation sets up a more centralised and specific regime for the authorisation and labelling of GM food and animal feed, focused on the new European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). It introduces, for the first time, specific rules on GM animal feed and requires the safety aspects of any GMO intended for use in both foods and feed to be considered together.
<P>

<a name="31118w01.html_para5">At a meeting of the Agriculture Council in September 2003 there was a discussion on the European Commission's guidelines on the co-existence of GM and non-GM crops. Final EU decisions on pending applications for consent to grow GM crops are not expected until next year.
<P>

<a name="31118w01.html_para6">EU discussions on the setting of thresholds for adventitious presence of approved GMOs in non-GM seeds are currently being conducted at official level.

<a name="31118w01.html_wqn5"><B> Gregory Barker: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will make a statement on the effects she estimates the adoption of genetically modified crops in the UK would have on <i>(a)</i> the cost of farming and <i>(b)</i> profits for farmers.  [138807]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31118w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 As part of the GM dialogue process the Government have sponsored the Strategy Unit to carry out a study of the costs and benefits of GM crops, They published their report on 11 July. Comments were invited on the report and a summary of these will be published later this year.
<P>

<a name="31118w01.html_para7">The main conclusions of the report were that existing GM crops could offer some cost and convenience advantages to UK farmers. However, any economic benefit to the UK is likely to be limited in the short term as only a narrow range of existing crops are currently suited to UK conditions and weak consumer demand is likely to limit take-up. Looking to the longer term, future developments in GM crops have the potential to offer more wide ranging benefits to farmers and consumers.
<P>
<P>
<a name="31118w01.html_wqn6"><B> Andrew George: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what recent evidence there is on the impact of the effect of herbicide use on GM maize, with particular reference to levels of herbicide use; and what assessment has been made of that evidence.  [139019]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31118w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The recently published results of the farm-scale evaluations represent the largest study ever made of the impact of herbicide use on GM maize. A copy of the results have been placed in the Library.




<P>
<P><I>18 Nov 2003 : Column 718W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="31118w01.html_para8">The results of the farm-scale evaluations, and the results of other published work, are currently being considered by the Government's statutory advisers on GM crop releases&#151;The Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment (ACRE).

<a name="31118w01.html_wqn8"><B> Andrew George: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs whether decisions will be made by her Department in respect of applications to grow GM crops in the UK before the final results of the farm scale trials are published.  [139154]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31118w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 17 November 2003]</i>: The final results for three of the four GM crops tested in the farm scale evaluations (beet, forage maize and spring-sown oilseed rape) were published in October 2003. The results for the other GM crop (autumn-sown oilseed rape) will be published next year. Our statutory expert advisers on GMO releases&#151;the Advisory Committee on Release into the Environment (ACRE)&#151;are considering the results for the first three crops and we expect their advice in December or January.
<P>

<a name="31118w01.html_para9">Decisions on whether or not any particular GM crop should be authorised for commercial use in the EU are subject to collective agreement by all EU member states. It is not possible to say precisely when these EU decisions will be taken, but we do not expect any decisions on current applications to cultivate GM crops until well into next year.
<P>

<a name="31118w01.html_para10">There are currently 21 applications for proposed commercial GM products being processed across the EU, 12 of which include cultivation of GM crops (no such application has been made in the UK). Of the 12 applications for cultivation, 10 have not yet completed their initial assessment by the member states in which the applications were made; the other two have received favourable initial assessments, and have been forwarded for scrutiny and comment to the European Commission and all other member states. Neither is a GM crop involved in the farm scale evaluations and in both cases the UK has objected to the applications on the grounds that the applicants have not yet supplied sufficient information for us to make an adequate risk assessment of the likely effects of the GM crops in question on the environment.
<P>

<a name="31118w01.html_para11">The GM forage maize in the farm scale evaluation trials (Bayer T25) already has a consent under EU GM safety legislation for commercial cultivation throughout Europe. This was granted in 1998. Based on the FSE results, the UK will reach a view on whether this consent should be maintained, altered or revoked. Other member states will also need to consider this.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what steps are being taken to ensure that UK companies are informed of measures required to comply with the European Landfill Directive.  [137541]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31118w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Since the Landfill Directive was agreed by the Council of Ministers in April 1999, the Government have carried out four separate consultation exercises to ensure that all the issues were fully aired. Also, a number of stakeholders groups that include representatives of UK industry, such as the Hazardous Waste Forum and the Landfill Directive Implementation Group, have discussed different aspects of the Directive. For example, the Hazardous Waste Forum is developing an action plan that includes a commitment to a communication strategy to raise awareness of industry to forthcoming legislative changes on hazardous waste.
<P>

<a name="31118w02.html_para0">Currently, two further consultation exercises are being carried out; one dealing with the Directive targets to reduce the amount of biodegradable municipal waste going to landfill and the other covering the implementation of the waste acceptance criteria requirements that were added to the Directive by Council Decision 2003/33 of 13 December 2002.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (1) which criteria have been established by the Marine Consents and Environment Unit for time periods for the issue of licences; and what percentage of closures have been achieved within the time period in each of the last five years;  [138554]
<P>
<UL>(2) how many licences have been issued by the Marine Consents and Environment Unit in each of the last five years; how many were refused; and what the average time taken was for <i>(a)</i> consultation and <i>(b)</i> approval of the licences.  [138556]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31118w02.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Marine Consents and Environment Unit (MCEU) is a joint-departmental unit that was set up in April 2001 by my Department and the Department for Transport. Its role is to administer the marine works consents for which each Department has responsibility under the Food and Environment Protection Act 1985 (FEPA), the Coast Protection Act 1949, the Telecommunications Act 1984 and certain other local legislation. The unit also processes licence applications under FEPA in waters for which the National Assembly for Wales is the licensing authority.
<P>

<a name="31118w02.html_para1">The unit's published guidance notes and website (http://www.mceu.gov.uk) make clear that a period of at least 10 weeks is normally required to process a straightforward application but that larger schemes (such as offshore windfarms and large port developments) and those in sensitive marine areas may take substantially longer. Much of this time is taken up by the consultation process with a range of outside bodies, which are normally given six weeks to respond.
<P>

<a name="31118w02.html_para2">The numbers of FEPA licences issued by the MCEU in each 12 month period since the unit was established is as follows.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Virtually all deaths from deep vein thrombosis occur as a result of a pulmonary embolism, and most pulmonary embolisms arise from deep vein thrombosis in the leg.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>It is not possible to state if long haul air travel was a contributory factor in deaths from deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism as this information is not routinely entered on the death certificate.

<a name="31118w03.html_spnew6"><B> Ruth Kelly: </B> 
 An accounts direction for the Defence Dental Agency (DDA) for 1997&#150;98 was issued in March 1996 on the understanding that satisfactory accounting systems would be in place for that financial year. It was withdrawn in January 1999 when it became apparent that, because of difficulties with the stock recording systems on which DDA and a number of agencies within MOD relied, DDA would be unable to prepare accounts for 1997&#150;98 which would have received an unqualified audit opinion from the Comptroller and Auditor General. At that time, the policy was not to issue accounts directions if there was a probability that the auditors would be unable to give an unqualified opinion&#151;this policy is no longer applied.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31118w03.html_spnew9"><B> Ruth Kelly: </B> 
 Grossing up is a serious abuse of the market. The Government is giving the Financial Services Authority (FSA) responsibility for regulating general insurance as from 14 January 2004. The FSA is currently consulting on its rules in CP187. The FSA considers there is more opportunity for such market abuse in the commercial rather than the retail market, and therefore does not propose to introduce commission disclosure for retail customers. But, for commercial customers, it will be requiring intermediaries to disclose commission earned by them and any affiliated intermediaries if requested to do so by a commercial customer.

 Only by pooling the additional resources pledged as part of the Monterrey Consensus, and leveraging these through an International Finance Facility designed to deliver the additional US $50 billion a year needed to meet the Millennium Development Goals, can the international community meet the challenge of halving poverty by 2015.

 A number of improvements have recently taken place.

These will establish key objectives for each region within a long-term context. The West Midlands Regional Planning Assessment is due for publication in Autumn 2004.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31118w05.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 Our strategy for encouraging cycling involves improving both cycling infrastructure and promotion. We have assessed provision for cyclists in all English local authorities. We have initiated the Cycling Projects Fund and given over &#163;4 million to local cycling initiatives. The Department is also a major contributor to the cross-departmental Activity Co-ordination Team, which is seeking to raise levels of physical activity across the board. On the safety front, and in addition to encouraging better facilities for cyclists, we are promoting measures which cyclists can take to protect themselves, such as taking cycle training and making themselves conspicuous. We are also improving training and testing for motorists.

 The section of the A414 between Chelmsford and the M11/Harlow junction is the responsibility of Essex County Council. Essex County Council have identified the route as having a poor accident record and it is now the subject of a priority route study to determine the main causes and patterns of accidents.

 <i>[holding answer on 29 October 2003]:</i> The regulations that ensure the safe transport of radioactive materials do not distinguish on safety grounds between waste and any other radioactive materials.

The benefits must be for humans, animals or the environment and relate to the scientific and/or medical progress likely to result from the programme outlined in the application.

 I understand from Post Office Ltd that their Network Development Managers working on the urban reinvention programme are paid in the same way as all other managers in Post Office Ltd. Their pay arrangements include provision for a bonus based on a combination of overall business, financial and quality results and achievement of personal objectives. Their personal objectives are structures around identifying and preparing robust network reinvention proposals for presentation to Postwatch to achieve sustainable restructuring of services in local areas, and are linked to the success in migrating customers from any branch which closes as a result to other branches in the network. There is no incentive linked to actual branch closure.

 A little under 50 per cent. of this funding has been committed to Round 1 offshore wind projects, reflecting the importance of offshore wind to meeting the Government's 2010 renewable energy target.

This will require some over-committing of funds in the expectation that a certain proportion of projects will not go ahead.

 Information on Urgent Operational Requirements (UORs) for Operation Fingal is not held separately from those for overall operations in Afghanistan under Operation Veritas. A total of 113 UORs were agreed for these operations at an approved cost of &#163;155 million, split between financial years 2001&#150;02 and 2002&#150;03. UORs for these operations were funded from the Reserve, under a special arrangement agreed with the Treasury.
<P>

<a name="31118w10.html_para0">Over 190 UOR measures were agreed for Operation Telic 1, at an approved cost of some &#163;510 million falling in financial years 2002&#150;03 and 2003&#150;04. All these UORs are again funded from the Reserve, as agreed with the Treasury, as part of the overall additional costs of Operation Telic. A number of Operation Telic UORs have brought forward planned expenditure already contained within the forward equipment programme. Where that provision is no longer needed, we expect to reimburse the Treasury for an appropriate amount. A precise figure has yet to be established, but the key point is that the defence budget is neither penalised nor gains windfall benefits as a result of pulling forward expenditure in this way.
<P>

<a name="31118w10.html_para1">Where equipment bought through the UOR process is retained after an operation has completed, appropriate provision needs to be made for downstream support costs. Such decisions on whether or not to keep UORs in service are considered in the normal Departmental planning round alongside other potential equipment enhancements.

<a name="31118w10.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 British military assistance to Colombia includes bomb disposal training and provision of British military education. It complements Colombian efforts to reduce the number of deaths, both civilian and military, from explosive devices, and introduces Colombian military personnel to British defence concepts in key areas such as Rules of Engagement and democratic and accountable control of the armed forces. In view of the clear humanitarian benefits this British military assistance offers to the Colombian people, we do not intend to suspend it.

 Under the terms of the Joint Declaration of Intent between Ministry of Defence and English Nature the MOD will give advance warning to English Nature of any intended disposal of land wholly or partially notified as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). English Nature may then advise MOD on ways to secure wildlife opportunities and to nominate a suitable purchaser. This procedure has operated in the case of Pilning Range, and English Nature have nominated the Avon Wildlife Trust as a suitable purchaser. The balance of the site not purchased by the Wildlife Trust will be offered by open and public competition.

The fact that the Government does not recognise "Gulf War Syndrome" as a medical condition does not mean that veterans cannot claim war pensions: war pensions are paid on the basis of disability, not diagnosis.

<a name="31118w11.html_para4">A considerable amount of research into Gulf veterans' illnesses has been undertaken in the United States and its Department of Defense have also funded research in the United Kingdom. There is scientific evidence that some veterans of the 1990&#150;91 Gulf conflict report a number of recognised medical conditions. However, the overwhelming consensus of the scientific and medical community is that there is insufficient evidence to enable this ill-health to be characterised as a unique illness, condition or 'syndrome'.

<i> [holding answer 10 November 2003]:</i> As at 13 November, there were 125 Iraqis being interned by the British Forces because they were considered to be a threat to Coalition Forces. The maximum length of time that any person has been held is just under six months; the least one week. Every 28 days, a review is conducted to determine whether continued internment is necessary. Procedures are in place to allow internees to appeal against their continued internment. Individuals will continue to be held until such time as they are no longer considered a threat to Coalition Forces.

 Iraq continues to make progress and is broadly stable. The majority of incidents occur around Baghdad.

 Following public disorder events in Iraq during August, a requirement was identified to fit Vehicle Protection Kits (VPK) to a range of Combat Support Vehicles. Delivery to theatre began in mid August and should be completed by the end of February 2004.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31118w11.html_spnew14"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The Ministry of Defence identifies the costs of Operations in terms of the net additional costs it has incurred. The costs, which the MOD would have incurred had the operation not been undertaken&#151;expenditure on wages and salaries or on conducting training exercises for example&#151;are deducted from the total costs of the operation.
<P>

<a name="31118w11.html_para16">The cost of food is not identified separately, but is contained within stock consumption, along with ammunition, clothing and vehicle and equipment spares for example. Costs are not incurred on a regular daily basis and force levels have fluctuated considerably. As a result, to attempt to provide monthly average costs would be misleading.

 The majority of United Kingdom military units deployed to Iraq undertake tours of either four or six months depending on the role they perform.

The UK is providing &#163;7.5 million over three years to the Small Arms Destruction Unit (SADU) of UNDP's Bureau for Conflict Prevention and Recovery for weapons collection, management and destruction work in forty-five developing countries. Since the start of the programme in 2001 SADU have destroyed over 360,000 weapons and in excess of 24 million items of ammunition.

<a name="31118w13.html_para7">The UK Government is also providing &#163;1.9 million for the development of 5-year National Action Plans in Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, Mozambique and Namibia. These Plans will provide a comprehensive approach to weapons controls in these countries, and will include disarmament, destruction and weapons management elements. Two NGOs, Saferworld and SaferAfrica, are undertaking this work with the governments of these countries.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what assessment her Department has made of the impact proposed increases in the cost of alcohol licences will have on <i>(a)</i> community clubs and <i>(b)</i> sports associations.  [138602]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31118w13.html_spnew4"><B> Estelle Morris: </B> 
 The proposed levels of fees for club premises certificates and premises licences under the Licensing Act 2003 will lead to an increase in licensing fees for some community clubs and sports associations operating either as qualifying clubs under club premises certificates or under premises licences though many will also see a reduction in fees.




<P>
<P><I>18 Nov 2003 : Column 762W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="31118w13.html_para13">Any increases will arise because fees have been estimated on the basis of the actual costs to the licensing authority. Current fees are not set on a full cost recovery basis by the magistrates' courts. This change has been made because we do not consider it appropriate for the taxpayer to subsidise the consumption of alcohol in sports clubs or any other premises.
<P>

<a name="31118w13.html_para14">Any increase in fees should not, however, have a significant impact on any of these clubs or associations. Small clubs are likely to pay around &#163;100 in the first year of the new licensing regime and &#163;50 in subsequent years. This means that, for example, for a club with 25 members, the minimum needed to qualify as a qualifying club, a club premises certificate would cost about &#163;4 per member in the first year and &#163;2 per member in subsequent years.

 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State regularly receives representations from hon. Members, and members of the public, on these subjects. This reflects the extent of public concern about growing rates of obesity among children, and of interest in community sport and activity facilities.
<P>

<a name="31118w13.html_para15">The Government fully shares both that concern, and that interest. The UK is now the most obese nation in Europe. Sedentary lifestyles&#151;especially among young people&#151;have greatly contributed to that. The Government are already investing substantial amounts in schools and community sports facilities. In schools, the New Opportunities Fund is investing &#163;581 million in school sports facilities in England, and Space for Sport and the Arts is putting &#163;130 million into primary school facilities. In communities, NOF is investing &#163;256 million in healthy living centre projects, and &#163;108.5 million in

 Neither the Ministry of Defence, nor the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, has had any discussions on this subject with the Belgian Government. However, the Commonwealth War Graves Commission continues to monitor the effects of the A19 extension scheme. We fully expect the Belgian Government to adhere to existing procedures for dealing with the remains of British Servicemen discovered during the course of the extension of the A19 motorway. This would entail the eventual interment of remains in a Commonwealth War Graves Commission cemetery in Belgium.

 The Twenty-First Session of the Preparatory Commission (Prepcom) of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), which took place in Vienna from 10 to 14 November 2003, dealt primarily with the 2004 Budget for the Provisional Technical Secretariat.

The UK has always been at the forefront of efforts to maintain the build-up of the Treaty's International Monitoring System.

 Since September 2000, &#163;6,000 training bursaries have been available to postgraduate trainee teachers and &#163;4,000 golden hellos for those who go on to teach priority subjects, including mathematics, in a maintained school. Since September 2002, these incentives have been reinforced by the Repayment of Teachers' Loans pilot scheme for new teachers of priority subjects. Recruitment to postgraduate courses of initial teacher training in mathematics has accordingly risen by 68 per cent. between 1999/2000 and 2003/04. Partly as a result of this increase, the number of unfilled vacancies for mathematics teachers in maintained secondary schools has fallen by 22 per cent. in only two years.

<a name="31118w18.html_para8">The Government will build on these achievements over the coming years. The Teacher Training Agency is currently developing a number of new initiatives to bring more mathematics specialists into the classroom. These include enhancement courses designed to allow prospective teachers of mathematics to bring their subject-knowledge up to the required level for entry onto a postgraduate teacher training course.

 The Skills Strategy, published in July, set out our intention to introduce a new entitlement for any adult in the labour force to have access to free learning for their first full Level 2 qualification. This entitlement will enable individuals to reach a level of attainment that gives a platform of skills for employability, improve their position in the labour market, and increase their chances of undertaking further learning. We are working with the Learning and Skills Council nationwide on the phasing in of the Level 2 entitlement, with phase one in 2004&#150;05 and full rollout beginning the following year.

<a name="31118w19.html_para2">The Secretary of State has asked the London Development Agency and its partners to produce proposals showing how they will work together to address the key themes of the Skills Strategy, including raising the percentage of the workforce with Level 2 qualifications.

 Increased school funding designed to help school maintain the improvement in standards since 1997. The cost of incremental drift has been taken into account in calculating average cost pressures, and although schools' costs will vary from the average, the 5 per cent. floor increase for LEAs should enable them to target resources at particular schools which have unavoidable higher than average staff costs. Threshold payments will continue to be fully funded through grant in 2004&#150;05.

<P>
<a name="31118w20.html_wqn1"><B> Paul Farrelly: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what his estimate is of the average debt medical students will face when they qualify as doctors if they are charged the maximum tuition fee per year.  [137216]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31118w20.html_spnew1"><B> Alan Johnson: </B> 
 Average additional debt for medical students as a result of being charged the maximum variable fee of &#163;3,000 per year from 2006/07 will depend on whether they receive a higher education grant or a bursary from university; and whether they use these sums to offset fees. Currently students who are not eligible for means-tested grants for fees pay &#163;1,125 contributions to fees. Over the four years when this Department is responsible for medical students' support, the maximum increase in support would be &#163;1,875 per year, totalling an additional &#163;7,500, to meet the difference. Poorer medical students will in addition be eligible for HE grants of up to &#163;1,000 per year and university bursaries which will reduce their costs and hence their extra debt.
<P>

<a name="31118w20.html_para0">The level of loan taken out by medical students will depend upon their individual circumstances and choices, including the extent to which they work while in higher education. In years five and six they currently pay no contribution to fees and are eligible for means tested NHS bursaries, which helps to keep down the level of debt. Medical students on graduation should have better prospects of secure employment and of higher salaries than the typical graduate and will therefore pay off their loans faster.

The Task Force is focusing on: exploring tax incentives and models of matched funding schemes to encourage giving and institutions' capacity to raise funds; building a culture where universities ask for donations and donors are more willing to give; and elements necessary for a professional development office and effective fundraising. The Task Force is due to report in March 2004.

 "Caring about Carers&#151;A National Strategy for Carers" published in 1999 underlined the Government's commitment to support carers. Carers are entitled to an assessment by their local council to determine their needs as carers and their eligibility for support. Depending on their individual circumstances, carers have access to the full range of social security benefits including Carer's Allowance (CA) (previously Invalid Care Allowance), the Carer Premium in income-related benefits and additional amounts in Pension Credit.

Resources for personal social services increased by 20 per cent. in real terms between 1996&#150;97 and 2002&#150;03, an average real terms increase of 3 per cent. a year, and will be increased by an annual average of 6 per cent. in real terms from 2003&#150;04 to 2005&#150;06.

This enables us to provide more intensive support to return to the labour market to people in this second group.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Department for Constitutional Affairs what action his Department is taking to promote the use of alternative dispute resolution in legal cases in which Government Departments are involved.  [138931]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31118w22.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Lammy: </B> 
 In March 2001, the Lord Chancellor (Lord Irvine of Lairg) announced the Government's pledge to consider and use alternative dispute resolution (ADR) in their own disputes where suitable and wherever the other party accepts it. Since then, Departments, individually and collectively, have been taking forward work on embedding ADR in the way they handle their disputes.
<P>

<a name="31118w22.html_para2">This Department collates information on the Government's use of ADR under the pledge. The latest report, published in July 2003, demonstrated increasing use of ADR. The report also highlighted the programme of awareness training that has been introduced across Departments. In addition, this Department's legal adviser chairs the ADR sub-group of the Government Legal Service Liaison Group, a cross-government body that was established as a result of the pledge, to promote awareness and use of ADR.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31118w22.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Lammy: </B> 
 The "Moving Forward Together" report was developed by the Advisory Group for Marriage and Relationship Support (AGMARS) and was published in March 2002. The Advisory Group consisted of officials from across Government and senior representatives of Marriage and Relationship Support (MARS) organisations. The strategy set out in the report was intended to inform the work of both the Government and organisations delivering marriage and

<P>
<P>
<a name="31118w22.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Oaten: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Department for Constitutional Affairs what action the Lord Chancellor is taking to promote the use of mediation and other forms of alternative dispute resolution in <i>(a)</i> civil and <i>(b)</i> criminal cases.  [138770]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31118w22.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Lammy: </B> 
 The Government have long held the view that litigation should be the dispute resolution method of last resort. The Civil Procedure Rules encourage the use of alternative dispute resolution, as do the pre-action protocols, which seek to encourage the settlement of disputes before court proceedings are issued. One of this Department's Public Service Agreement targets is to reduce the proportion of disputes that are resolved by resort to the courts. As part of the programme of work designed to achieve this, a number of court based pilot mediation schemes are being developed that will actively encourage the use of mediation. These will complement the local schemes that are already in operation, or under consideration, in a several of courts in England and Wales. The Government are also keen to expand the use of restorative justice in the adult criminal justice system, as well as continuing to build on its success in the youth justice system. Activity in this area is led by the Home Office, which published a strategy, in the form of a consultation document, in July 2003. The strategy covers both restorative justice, which involves mediated contact between offender and victim, and reparation to the community. The Home Office will publish a summary of the consultation responses on its website in the New Year.

 No. The statutory two days minimum period must elapse before a local planning authority may remove or obliterate a placard or poster where it has served notice, on the person responsible for the poster, of its intention to do so. This provides that person with the opportunity to challenge the local planning authority's notice or to comply with it. Less than 48 hours is an unreasonably short period of time in which to expect the notice to reach the advertiser and for him to take action.

<a name="31118w23.html_para10">The Plan also made it clear that authorities that do not pursue these options cannot expect increased investment above that provided for through mainstream housing funding.

 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is aware of the Census results relating to occupancy, including the relatively high percentage of children who live in "overcrowded" housing.

 Under section 167 of the Housing Act 1996, a local housing authority is required to have an allocation scheme for determining priorities in the allocation of housing accommodation. That scheme must ensure that reasonable preference is given to:

<a name="31118w26.html_para0">Where a person applies to a local housing authority as homeless, the authority must decide whether or not he is homeless under section 175 of the Housing Act 1996. In reaching their decision, the local housing authority must not treat the applicant as having accommodation (if he does) unless it is accommodation which it would be reasonable for him to continue to occupy. Where statutory overcrowding exists, it will be a relevant consideration in reaching this decision, but under section 177(2) the local housing authority may also have regard to the general circumstances prevailing in relation to housing in the district.

 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is working in collaboration with the Joseph Rowntree Foundation and the Welsh Assembly Government by jointly commissioning research to monitor the development and implementation of new strategies by local authorities and to identify good practice for broader dissemination. This follows the coming into force on 18 July 2002 of the Regulatory Reform (Housing Assistance) (England and Wales) Order 2002 (RRO 2002), which gave local authorities wider powers to provide assistance to private homeowners for repair and renovation. This research work is on-going until October 2004. An initial progress report was published by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister at the beginning of November showing that, by March 2003, four-fifths of authorities were in the process of planning and developing loan/grant packages, the majority of which include outside expertise and support. Progress in implementing these strategies will be assessed through the research and from statistical information provided by local authorities.

<a name="31118w26.html_para7">Revenue support grant (RSG) figures cannot be considered in isolation in this context, because the amounts payable depend upon the amounts of redistributed national non-domestic rates (NNDR) that an authority receives. Both RSG and NNDR are therefore included in the following table. Grant figures are not consistent between years because of changes in function.

In 1992&#150;93, revenue support grant and redistributed national non-domestic rates paid to district councils included a share of the amounts that were payable to the county council for the area, and separate amounts attributable to each district council were not separately identified. Figures for Worcester city council are not therefore available for 1992&#150;93.<P>

 Figures are not available showing how many sheltered accommodation centres have and do not have resident wardens, and on the trends regarding resident wardens over the last 10 years. As part of their on-going assessment of local needs and review of housing-related support services as part of the Supporting People programme, local authorities are examining the amount of sheltered accommodation and housing-related support provided in that accommodation and, for the first time, will be able to gradually build up an indication of longer term trends.

<a name="31118w27.html_spnew6"><B> Keith Hill: </B> 
 The Government are committed to ensuring that all vulnerable members of the community receive the housing-related support they need including, where appropriate, warden services in sheltered accommodation, to help them live as independently as possible. To help bring this about, the Supporting People programme provides an integrated framework for planning and funding housing-related support services. Under Supporting People, local authorities will review all housing-related support services, examining their quality, performance and cost-effectiveness. In the case of sheltered housing, we would expect these reviews to consider the advantages and disadvantages of the way in which warden services are provided.

 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is not responsible for making policy decisions about the housing needs of specific groups.

They are required to take into account the needs of particular sections of the community including Black and Minority ethnic populations.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister if he will include in the decent homes standard the provision of sound insulation in domestic properties <i>(a)</i> constructed and <i>(b)</i> converted into flats and apartments.  [139091]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31118w28.html_spnew0"><B> Keith Hill: </B> 
 The issue of noise insulation is already dealt with in the decent home standard. For a property to be considered decent it must meet four criteria one of which is the provision of reasonably modern facilities and services. A property fails to meet this criterion if it lacks three or more of a list of six facilities, one of which is 'adequate noise insulation'.
<P>

<a name="31118w28.html_para0">The guidance on implementing the standard concentrates on insulation from external airborne noise, such as traffic or factory noise. It has this focus because it can be difficult to assess the extent to which domestic noise nuisance is caused by problems with the building itself (either because of its construction or inadequate

<P>
<a name="31118w28.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 My hon. Friend will be aware that there are in excess of 700 voluntary and community sector organisations in Wolverhampton. They will be attracting funding from a very wide range of government and European funding programmes including SRB, Neighbourhood Renewal Fund, Community Empowerment Fund, ERDF and ESF programmes, New Deal for Communities, Learning and Skills Council and Lotteries funding regimes to name some. There is no single database of organisations and their funding sources, so it is impossible to provide the level of detail required by the question.
<P>

<a name="31118w28.html_para2">A list of organisations funded through the Community Empowerment Network can be obtained from Wolverhampton Network Consortium and the City Council's Voluntary Sector Unit can provide details of the voluntary and community organisations they support via a co-ordinated small grants programme which has sought to simplify the funding process for eight specific small grants initiatives for the voluntary and community sector.

 It is estimated that the Airwave service contract for the provision of the police service's new digital radio communication service will cost &#163;2.3 billion (at 1999 prices) over the 22-year lifetime of the project. In addition, forces have to procure radio terminals and to modernise control rooms. Funding is provided centrally by the Home Office and locally by police authorities.
<P>

<P>
<a name="31118w28.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 As part of their work on developing an Alcohol Harm Reduction Strategy for England, the Prime Minister's Strategy Unit published an Interim Analytical Report on 19 September 2003. This report indicated that the annual estimated costs of alcohol-related crime and public disorder were up to &#163;7.3 billion. These estimates were prepared using specially commissioned research by the Strategy Unit. No previous estimates of the costs of alcohol-related crime have been made.

<a name="31118w28.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Etherington: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many laboratory animals were used in the United Kingdom for the potency testing of batches of botulinum toxin for cosmetic purposes in each year since 2000; and if he will make a statement on Government policy on animal tests for cosmetic products.  [136516]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31118w28.html_spnew7"><B> Caroline Flint: </B> 
 Botulinum toxin is not a cosmetic for the purposes of the EU Cosmetics Directive, and no animals have been used to test this material for marketing as a cosmetic in the United Kingdom. It is, however, produced, tested on animals and marketed for clinical use as a prescription only medicine.
<P>

<a name="31118w28.html_para11">The Government, the cosmetic manufacturers and the contract research organisations agreed a voluntary ban on the animal testing of all cosmetics (based upon the EU definition) in November 1997. This voluntary ban applied both to cosmetic ingredients and finished products.
<P>

<a name="31118w28.html_para12">We are committed to putting an end to testing cosmetics on animals across Europe and have led the way and worked hard for many years to try to achieve that. The Government have strongly supported the 7th Amendment on the Cosmetics Directive which was approved by the European Parliament in Plenary on 15 January and by the Council on 27 January 2003. The adopted text extends what has been almost solely a UK ban on testing cosmetic products and ingredients to cover animals throughout the EU.
<P>

<a name="31118w28.html_para13">An animal testing ban on finished products will be introduced immediately after the Directive enters force in 2005, followed by an animal testing ban on ingredients in 2006. The Government welcomes the introduction of an EU wide testing ban as an important and positive step to achieving real improvements in animal welfare standards across the European Community.
<P>

<a name="31118w28.html_para14">The 7th Amendment will also, in due course, introduce a marketing ban. This will mean that cosmetics cannot be marketed in the EU if animal tests have been carried out on either the finished product, or an ingredient or 



<P>
<P><I>18 Nov 2003 : Column 821W</I><P>
combination of ingredients, once an alternative to that test has been accepted and published by the European Centre for the Validation of Alternative Methods (ECVAM), and not at all after 2009. This ban will apply regardless of whether or not the animal testing took place in the EU. There will be very limited exceptions to the 2009 deadline. The Department of Trade and Industry leads on policy in this area.
<P>

<a name="31118w28.html_para15">Through our contributions to the European Union, we support the work of ECVAM, whose role is to co-ordinate the independent evaluation of the relevance and reliability of tests and validation studies, so that cosmetics products, as well as medicines, vaccines, other biologicals, medical devices, household products and agricultural products, can be manufactured, transported and used more economically and more safety whilst the current reliance on animal test procedures is progressively reduced.
<P>

<a name="31118w28.html_para16">We also support the Test Guidelines Programme of the Organisation of Economic Development and Co-operation (OECD) which should enable alternative methods to be accepted internationally and with minimum delay.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31118w29.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Blunkett: </B> 
 The Secretary of State will only certify and detain an individual under the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act, (ATCS) part 4 powers, once he is satisfied that criminal charges cannot be brought. This does not preclude the bringing of criminal charges at a later stage, should further evidence come to light. It is not always possible to bring criminal prosecutions. Some types of evidence cannot safely be disclosed in criminal proceedings without putting others at risk and other types of evidence (e.g. intercept evidence) are not permissible in UK criminal courts. This point was extensively debated before Parliament passed the ATCS Act 2001.

<P>

<a name="31118w29.html_para0">The available information relating to breaches of ASBOs, covers the period 1 June 2000 to 31 December 2001 and shows that of the four ASBOs made, one was breached in Gloucestershire during this time.

 We are fully committed to tackling arson through the achievement of our Public Service Agreement target to reduce crime and the fear of crime and through our continued engagement in the work of the Arson Control Forum. We have also recognised the important contribution of the fire service to multi-agency working. From 1 April 2003, all fire authorities are statutory partners in local crime and disorder reduction partnerships, which will help ensure that the fire services play a full role in community safety and raise local ability to tackle arson and the associated areas of crime.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31118w29.html_spnew5"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 We have no plans to amend our policy in relation to the detention of families with children in removal centres. Children will continue to be detained as members of family groups as it would clearly not be in the interests of children to separate them from their parents. The vast majority of families with children are detained for a short time, most for only a few days immediately prior to removal. Removal centres that may hold families with children for anything more than a few days are required to have arrangements in place to provide educational classes to the children concerned. At present, this relates only to Dungavel Immigration Removal Centre and Oakington Reception Centre. The education provision at Dungavel is well established. The position at Oakington is different in that the need for educational provision has arisen only comparatively recently and is in the process of being put in place. We

<P>
<P>
<a name="31118w29.html_spnew6"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 The full integration into British society of asylum seekers awaiting decisions on their claims is neither achievable nor desirable. Asylum seekers are for example, generally not permitted to take up employment. We are working to speed up the decision-making process so that their status is resolved more quickly. Nonetheless the Government is fully committed to ensuring that asylum seekers who make their claims in accordance with the law are enabled to live in decent conditions and gain access to essential services, including education for their children, and that they may live in this country without fear of harassment. We also seek to encourage asylum seekers to contribute through volunteering to the communities in which they live.
<P>

<a name="31118w29.html_para1">In order to promote these ends, the regional management of the National Asylum Support Service (NASS) maintains regular contact with all the relevant statutory and voluntary services in the areas to which asylum seekers are dispersed. NASS holds regular meetings to ensure that issues relating to the local integration of asylum seekers are raised and, where possible, resolved locally. Regional management will be representing NASS and asylum issues in all matters relating to community cohesion. We are also gradually developing our police liaison and intelligence capabilities to help provide safe and secure communities where asylum seekers are dispersed.

 There is no known mechanism by which the biological functions of the human body could react to radio signals, and the National Radiological Protection Board's independent Advisory Group on Non-ionising Radiation recommended further research on this topic. A study on possible non-linear mechanisms is under consideration as part of the adjunct Mobile Telecommunications and Health Research TETRA programme funded by the Home Office.

 The Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl) work on calcium efflux is complete and shows that TETRA has no effect on calcium exchanges in cells. The work on brain slice electrophysiology and epileptiform activity is still underway. The electrophysiology results are not yet fully analysed. Initial results show no effects of TETRA on epileptiform behaviour.

 My right hon. Friend, the Home Secretary announced on 11 November that the Government has decided to begin the process of introducing a national identity cards scheme following the consultation paper published in July 2002.
<P>

<a name="31118w31.html_para3">The Government are determined to ensure that the development of a national identity cards scheme is managed to the highest standards, and that the major business change and IT challenges which we face are dealt with effectively. A Programme Board is being established chaired by the Home Office to co-ordinate and drive forward the different elements of the Government strategy. Progress at every stage will be monitored and reviewed as further decisions are taken during the implementation. Before decisions are taken on implementation, there will be an intensive phase of feasibility assessment and prototyping so that decision making is soundly based and risks in the programme are kept to a minimum.
<P>

<a name="31118w31.html_para4">Once the Office of Government Commerce (OGC) has confirmed that the programme is ready to proceed, by means of an OGC Gateway Zero review, we will publish draft legislation to enable the scheme to be introduced.

<a name="31118w31.html_para5">Set up costs for the first three years have been estimated at &#163;36, &#163;60 and &#163;90 million. Costs thereafter will be covered by charges. Under the proposed scheme, we estimate that a 10 year plain identity card would cost most people approximately &#163;35. The enhanced fee for a combined passport&#151;identity card would be &#163;77and a combined driving licence&#151;identity card would be &#163;73.
<P>

<a name="31118w31.html_para6">The proposed charging schedule would fund free cards for all 16 year olds and a reduced charge of &#163;10 for those on low incomes. We are looking at how those who have been in retirement for some time could obtain a lifelong card, requiring no further payment and are also looking at whether plain identity cards could be paid for by instalments.
<P>

<a name="31118w31.html_para7">For very frail and elderly citizens it would be possible to issue a non-biometric card (for instance those with severe learning disabilities who are in residential care or those over 80).
<P>

<a name="31118w31.html_para8">People who held both a passport and a driving licence would only pay the additional charge for one document. This is because the charge covers the cost of establishing a more secure identity including recording the biometric information which only needs to happen once.

 The Department for Work and Pensions estimates that the level of identity fraud in the benefit system is between &#163;20 million and &#163;50 million per annum.

 It is the longstanding policy of successive governments neither to confirm nor deny allegations concerning the activities of the Security Service.

<a name="31118w32.html_para12">Reflex is focused on tackling organised immigration crime at source, in transit and in the United Kingdom through intelligence led enforcement action and overseas co-operation. Since April 2003, 20 organised criminal gangs have been disrupted and 16 facilitators have been convicted. Under Reflex successful partnerships have or are being established in a variety of countries such as Romania, Serbia, Bosnia, Montenegro and Bulgaria.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what the total cost was of <i>(a)</i> setting, <i>(b)</i> monitoring and <i>(c)</i> measuring the performance targets for his Department in 2002&#150;03; and how many and what grades of civil servants monitor these targets.  [137956]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31118w33.html_spnew0"><B> Fiona Mactaggart: </B> 
 Performance targets for the Home Office were agreed as part of the Spending Review 2002. The monitoring and measurement of Public Service Agreement (PSA) targets forms part of departmental performance management. Performance management is an integral part of the day to day running of the Department, and as such it is not possible to separate the specific costs out. The monitoring of progress towards, and performance against, the Department's PSA targets is undertaken by a wide variety of staff at all levels of the organisation.
<P>

<a name="31118w33.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Flight: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will list the performance targets that <i>(a)</i> his Department and <i>(b)</i> its agencies and non-departmental public bodies are required to meet; and if he will specify for each target (i) who sets it and (ii) who monitors achievement against it.

 Key performance targets for the Home Office were agreed as part of the Spending Review 2002 and the latest set were published in Spending Review 2002: Public Service Agreements 2003&#150;2006 (CM 5571). They have also been published in various 



<P>

Home Office publications, including "Targets Delivery Report" (CM5754), and on the Department's website. The Department monitors progress towards the targets along with Her Majesty's Treasury and the Prime Minister's Delivery Unit and progress is reported regularly.

<a name="31118w33.html_para0">Targets relating specifically to Home Office agencies and executive non-departmental public bodies (NDPBs) are set by the Secretary of State for the Home Office and are monitored by the Department, including through meetings between each organisation and Ministers or officials.

<P>
<a name="31118w34.html_spnew6"><B> Caroline Flint: </B> 
 The new powers given to the police by the Police Reform Act 2002 relate to offences under sections three and 34 of the Road Traffic Act 1988. Those offences cover driving on-road without due care and attention and driving off-road without authority. As from January 2003, where a vehicle committing one of these offences is being driven in such a way that it is causing or is likely to cause alarm, distress or annoyance to members of the public, a constable in uniform is empowered to stop and seize it. Unless a warning has been given previously, the police are required where practical to warn the person before seizing the vehicle, so that its anti-social use can be stopped.
<P>

<a name="31118w34.html_para10">The new power came into effect at the start of the year and its effective use is being developed. Figures for the number of vehicles that have so far been seized under this legislation are not collected centrally. I understand, however, from the Merseyside Police that as at 10 November, 14 warnings had been issued and one vehicle had been seized in Crosby.

 <i>[holding answer 4 November 2003]:</i> There are no centrally imposed restrictions on the provision of chiropody in the National Health Service. Primary care trusts have the responsibility for improving the health of the community. In commissioning services PCTs need to plan local services near to patients and ensure that they are identifying the health needs of patients and securing services for them.

 The Commission for Patient and Public Involvement in Health (CPPIH) is well on track to meeting its statutory obligations to ensure all its new structures are in place and working by the time of the abolition of the community health councils on 1 December 2003. The Independent Complaints Advocacy Service has been in place since 1 September 2003, supporting individuals who wish to pursue a complaint against the national health service. Recruitment to patients' forums is progressing well, with national and local advertising campaigns eliciting a large number of applications leading the CPPIH to have every confidence in being able to achieve full forum coverage by 1 December 2003.

 A human resources framework for community health council (CHC) staff, agreed with the relevant trades unions, was issued in June 2003. The framework included arrangements for those CHC staff who wished to leave early to take up posts in organisations providing independent complaints advocacy services, local network providers to patients' forums, overview and scrutiny committees (OSCs) and other posts in the national health service dedicated to patient and public involvement. The framework also made provision for clearing houses, training opportunities and helplines to assist CHC staff find alternative employment in the NHS. Guidance on the retention and disposal arrangements for CHC records was also issued in June 2003. The Commission for Patient and Public Involvement in Health continues to work with CHCs to consider the best ways to transfer valuable local knowledge to patients' forums to help them build local capacity. CHCs have for some time been working with patient advice and liaison services and OSCs, including sharing experiences and local knowledge, so that those organisations are able to carry out their new responsibilities as effectively as possible.

 Data are not collected on the number of people with dementia, in the population generally or in care homes in particular.

 Primary care trusts (PCTs) took over the responsibility for the administration of the general dental services (GDS) arrangements from 1 October 2002.

The level of patient registrations in the GDS has remained broadly stable since October 2002. Patients do not need registration in order to access national health service dentistry through the community or personal dental services. Arrangements are also in place for patients to access NHS dentistry on an occasional basis in the GDS.

<P>
<a name="31118w36.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 Dental amalgam is a combination of alloy particles, mainly silver, and mercury. Dental amalgam is the most frequently used material for restoring decayed teeth. Its main advantages include wide indications for use, ease of handling and excellent physical properties. It has been used in dentistry with good results for more than a century.
<P>

<a name="31118w36.html_para6">The 1998 European Union expert report concluded that currently available data indicate that mercury from dental amalgam restorations will not cause an unacceptable health risk to the general population. There is little evidence that an unacceptable health risk is associated with occupational exposure of dental personnel providing due care is used in the preparation and handling of dental amalgam. The same report also concluded that there is no scientific evidence that the use of dental amalgam is related to adverse effects on pre-and post-natal health or fertility. There are therefore no plans to commission further research into amalgam safety. However, it remains the Department's advice that dentists should continue to avoid or delay any dental intervention or medication during pregnancy.

 We recognise the important role that epilepsy specialist nurses play in the treatment and management of children and adults with epilepsy.

As part of the process of developing the NSF, work is in hand to consider relevant work force issues such as the need for increased numbers of staff but also for new ways of working, including skill mix, role extensions and multi-disciplinary working, based around patient needs. We expect that the group looking at these work force issues will make recommendations on the future supply of professionals and development of new ways of working to inform national work force planning processes.

 The costs associated with a membership base for a National Health Service foundation trust will depend on a number of factors, including the size of membership.

 As at September 2002, there were 210,462 healthcare assistants employed in the national health service according to the non-medical workforce census. Healthcare assistants perform a similar role as other groups in the NHS, including nursing auxiliaries and assistants to qualified scientific, therapeutic and technical staff. These staff are included in the above figure and also the Performance and Planning Framework target for 27,000 more healthcare assistants by 2005 over a 2002 baseline.

 During my visit to Washington DC in October, I visited the West End Medical Centre to meet staff and patients and to see at first hand how Kaiser Permanente serves its members. At the medical centre, I learnt about the way in which Kaiser involves patients in their own care, and heard a presentation about the prevention and treatment of diabetes. I was given a tour of the medical centre and talked to staff and patients. The costs of the Kaiser system have been studied by independent researchers whose comparison of the national health service and Kaiser was published in the <i>British Medical Journal</i> last year. Departmental officials are working with Kaiser to explore how we might learn from their approach in the next stages of NHS reform.

 No statement has been made in response to the statement by nine of the members of the Royal Commission on Long-Term Care which reported in 1999. However, we do not believe that making personal care free for everyone is the best use of limited resources. Instead we have significantly increased investment in other aspects of older people's services. We believe that investing in this way will secure greater benefits for older people than could have been achieved by simply providing free personal care.
<P>

<a name="31118w39.html_para0">The recent publication of performance indicators and star ratings for social services for 2002&#150;03 demonstrates that the Government's policy is now having the desired effect with 81,500 people in England now receiving intensive home care to maintain their independence. The proportion of households over the age of 65 receiving intensive home care has risen from 7.9 per 1,000 in 1998&#150;99 to 10.4 per 1,000 in 2002&#150;03 and 57 per cent. of older people in England report that they were either very satisfied or extremely satisfied with the services they received in their own home.

 Our strategy to support delivery of the NHS Plan is to set a clear national framework of standards backed up by strong inspection regimes and increasingly to give more responsibility to front-line health and social services providers so that local organisations have more flexibility and freedom to plan, resource and deliver services. As a result we set fewer central targets. Progress in policy areas not directly linked to national targets can be monitored and driven forward in a number of ways, for example:

 The work programme for the National Institute for Clinical Excellence is determined by Ministers having regard to national health service priorities and published selection criteria. These criteria are set out on the Department's website at www.doh.gov.uk/nice/consultation2002/overviewdec02. pdf

<P>
<P>
<a name="31118w41.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 The National Institute for Clinical Excellence has been notified of its funding for the three financial years 2003&#150;04 to 2005&#150;06. The funding includes provision for an additional appraisal committee to be established.
<P>
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what guidance is being given to funders to ensure that new medical treatments that are class compatible with the National Institute for Clinical Excellence appraised treatments are not denied funding because they have become licensed in between NICE's appraisal.  [137577]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31118w41.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 In August 1999, the Department issued Health Service Circular 1999/176, which asks national health service bodies to continue with local arrangements for the managed introduction of new technologies where guidance from the National Institute for Clinical Excellence is not available at the time the technology first became available. These arrangements should involve an assessment of all the available evidence.

<P>
<a name="31118w41.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hutton  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 11 November 2003]:</i> Information is not collected centrally on the number of patients receiving specialist learning disabilities care. Employment arrangements of learning disabilities nurses vary from place to place; they are employed by organisations other than primary care trusts (PCTs), which often cover several PCT areas. It is therefore not possible to show the ratio of qualified learning disability nurses to PCT populations. Information on the number of qualified learning disabilities nurses by strategic health authority and per 100,000 population has been placed in the Library.

 People from all walks of life are encouraged to join patients' forums, bringing with them a diversity of experience and views. The majority of members of a forum must be people for whom services are being or have been provided by the relevant national health service trust or relevant primary care trust (PCT) and, in the case of PCTs' patients' forums, are living in the area where the service is provided. A general understanding of the NHS by members is desirable. More important is to find individuals who have a real interest in improving services and a commitment to represent the views of the community served by the trust or PCT.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health pursuant to his Answer to the honourable Member for Truro and St Austell of 6th February 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 450W, on performance targets, how his Department will measure progress towards achieving the public service agreement target on value for money.  [138199]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31118w42.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The value for money Public Service Agreement (PSA) target requires that 'Value for money in the National Health Service and personal social services will improve by at least 2 per cent. per annum, with annual improvements of 1 per cent, in both cost efficiency and service effectiveness'.
<P>

<a name="31118w42.html_para0">For the NHS, the cost efficiency element of the PSA target will be measured by comparing data from the National Schedule of Reference Costs between one year and the previous year. Adjustments to this simple comparison will be made to take account of changes in casemix, quality investment, input price inflation and externally driven, one-off, cost-increasing events such as rising employer pensions contributions.
<P>

<a name="31118w42.html_para1">The quality element of the target will be assessed by comparing the estimated expenditure on increasing service effectiveness with data on quality from the NHS performance ratings exercise. A key element of this will be the value that can be placed on the lives saved from reducing mortality following health care interventions.
<P>

<a name="31118w42.html_para2">For personal social services, costs will be based on unit costs of services, after some adjustments to allow for increases in funding for quality improvements. The quality element will be based on the quality indicators published by the Department, in the social services performance assessment framework, for instance, waiting times for care packages.

<a name="31118w42.html_para8">Information on suspected vaccine-associated adverse events experienced as part of the current vaccination programme have been collected by the Health Protection Agency and the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency. The type of adverse reactions noted after smallpox vaccinations so far were mostly non-serious; the majority were expected reactions to successful vaccination with smallpox vaccine or are known to occur after any vaccination. These included reactions at the site of injection, fever, feeling unwell and swollen glands. Two vacinees were hospitalised, one with suspected encephalitis and one with severe local cellulitis. A further four people developed cellulitis at the injection site. Two vacinees reported shortness of breath. One vacinee retrospectively reported having experienced retrospective symptoms of suspected mycocarditis though no confirmation tests were carried out. Adverse experience occurring after vaccination does not necessarily mean that the vaccine caused the problem. Other factors, such as an underlying illness present before vaccination, must be considered as possible alternative causes.
