Iris Robinson:</b> To ask the Secretary of State
for Northern Ireland how much public money was spent on the removal of
asbestos from buildings identified as unsafe in each of the last three
years in each parliamentary constituency in Northern Ireland; and if he
will make a statement.
[69653]</p><p><a name="06052520000315"><b><a name="06052520005350">Mr.
Hanson:</b> In the last three years some 97,000 Work Orders
were issued for Maintenance, Minor Works and Major Capital
Refurbishment Projects at Government buildings, totalling approximately
&#163;174 million in respect of estimated work value. Asbestos
removal work would be an item on many of these orders. It is not
possible to determine the full extent of any asbestos removals with any
degree of accuracy without incurring disproportionate
costs.</p><p><a name="06052520000316">Asbestos was,
in the past, routinely used in construction by the building industry
and as such, many of the older properties in the Government Estate
contain this
material.</p><p><a name="06052520000317">In late
1987, a plan of action was instigated to prepare Asbestos Registers for
many properties within the Government Estate. Asbestos Surveys
commenced from 1988 onwards, involving over 1,000 properties, many of
which are currently known to contain Asbestos Containing Materials
(ACMs). Each Asbestos Register records the precise location, use, type
and condition of all ACMs known to be
present.</p><p><a name="06052520000318">In the
intervening years, these Asbestos Registers have been maintained
through various programmes of inspections, including the introduction
of effective management and control procedures. These actions have
maintained Government properties in a safe and occupiable condition,
ensuring that any recorded ACMs present at each location do not present
any significant risk to the health and safety of staff employed there
or the visiting
public.</p><p><a name="06052520000319">The Health and
Safety Executive (NI) advises that asbestos is dangerous only if fibres
are released into the atmosphere. There is no requirement to remove
such ACMs if they are in good condition and unlikely to be disturbed.
The HSE (NI) further advises that, where possible, ACMs should be left
undisturbed, but that their presence should be effectively managed.
Where ACMs are deemed in poor condition and require removal, such
action is undertaken by specialist Asbestos Removal Contractors
accredited by the HSE 
<br><notus-date day="23" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>23 May 2006 : Column 1598W</b><br>(NI), using a recognised and legislatively compliant safe system of
work. Such work is also notifiable to the HSE
(NI).</p><p><a name="06052520000320">Government
Departments do not, therefore, have a general plan to remove asbestos
from their buildings, but will remove such materials where regular
inspections dictate such a
recommendation.</p><p><a name="06052520000321">Asbestos
removals, where not deemed necessary through regular inspections, i.e.
as a result of planned disturbance, are normally carried out as an
integral part of ongoing Maintenance, Minor Works or Major Capital
Refurbishment

Eagle:</b> The Cost of Doing Business Survey published by the
Economic Research Institutefor Northern Ireland (ERINI) in
December 2005 concluded that, on balance, business costs in Northern
Ireland are relatively competitive when compared to GB and the Republic
of Ireland. While some elements such as energy and insurance costs were
found to be higher in Northern Ireland than in GB, these

de-rating should not add significantly to the cost burden of
manufacturing. In 2004 turnover in manufacturing was around

full (which is not due to happen until 2011) this would represent less
than0.4 per cent. of this level of turnover. In addition, the
revenues raised will enable significant investment in priority public
services, which will benefit the economy. A policy review of industrial

a further interim target of 23.5 per cent. set for March
2008.</p><p><a name="06052520000381">In the first
eight competitions there were over 28,000 applications from
non-Catholics, of which 541 will have been rejected directly as a
result of these temporary provisions. In other words less than 2 per
cent. of all non-Catholic applicants will have been rejected as a
direct result of the 50:50
provision.</p><p><a name="06052520000382">Although
the Patten Report focused on the imbalance between the number of
Catholics and Protestants in the composition of the Police Service, it
rightly recognised the importance of gender and ethnic minority
representation. It is notable that female composition has risen from 13
per cent. to 20.42 per cent. and the ethnic minority background
composition compares favourably with the overall level of the working
age ethnic minority population in Northern Ireland and continues to
rise.</p><p><a name="06052520000383">In terms of the
steps taken to recruit police officers, the oversight commissioner has
commented that the advertising programme has been both imaginative and
assiduous. It has varied between competitions, but has included press,
television, billboard, cinema and online advertising, all designed to
reach groups currently under-represented in the Police
Service.</p><p><a name="06052520000384">The
responses from all communities have been extremely positive and the
results have exceeded expectations. The latest campaign (10) saw the
highest number of applications yet, with 7,691 applications competing
for 220 places. 37 per cent. of these applications were from the
Catholic community which is the highest rate to date and the number of
ethnic minority applications
doubled.</p><p><a name="06052520000385">In addition
to a large number of Northern Ireland applicants, applications have
been received from Great Britain and the Republic of Ireland, as well
as from a number of other
countries.</p>

Thomas:</b> In recent years there has been a good deal of
progress in reducing protectionist trade policies which impact on poor
countries. Within the EU for example, agricultural import tariffs
declined by an average of 36 per cent. between 1995 and 2000. Our
current projections are that once the reforms to the Common
Agricultural Policy agreed in 2003 have worked through, EU reliance on
export subsidies will have reduced by approximately 65 per cent.
compared with
1997.</p><p><a name="06052520000749">But there is
still much to be done outside the EU as well as within, which is why
the UK supports an ambitious outcome to the current round of World
Trade Organisation (WTO) negotiations in areas such as agriculture,
industrial products and services, with meaningful special and
differential treatment for developing countries built in. It also
includes the elimination of export subsidies and other equivalent
measures by 2013, which was agreed at the Hong Kong ministerial meeting
in December. Time is running out for such an ambitious outcome to the
current WTO negotiations, and discussions between the key players have
intensified since the Hong Kong meeting to try to narrow the gaps that
still remain, and reach a consensus on a balanced package of agreements
across the main negotiating
areas.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="06052520000064">Tsunami Evaluation

recommendation in the Prime Minister's Strategy Unit report,
&#147;Improving the Life Chances of Disabled People&#148;, we have
set up an Office for Disability Issues (ODI) to drive forward our
strategy to meet this challenge. The work of the ODI is overseen by a
ministerial group, involving Ministers from several key Departments
(Department of Health, Department for Education and Skills, Department
of Trade and Industry, Department for Transport, Department for Work
and Pensions, Department for Communities and Local
Government).</p><p><a name="06052520001984">The
Government have also put in place a comprehensive and enforceable set
of civil rights for disabled people. For example, provisions introduced
in October 2004 substantially improved rights in employment and
required service providers to make reasonable adjustments to tackle
physical barriers to disabled people accessing their services. The
Special Educational Needs and Disability Act 2001 amended the
Disability Discrimination Act (DDA) to provide rights for disabled
pupils and students in
education.</p><p><a name="06052520001985">Most
recently, the DDA 2005 extended rights for disabled people in a number
of areas including transport, functions of public bodies, private clubs
and the renting of premises. It also extended protection to around
250,000 people, effectively from the point they are diagnosed with
cancer, multiple sclerosis or HIV, freeing them from pre-symptomatic
discrimination. In addition, people with mental illness will avoid the 
<br><notus-date day="23" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>23 May 2006 : Column 1676W</b><br>unnecessary burden of being required to prove their
condition is clinically well-recognised to get redress against
discrimination.</p><p><a name="06052520001986">Importantly,
from 4 December 2006, the DDA 2005 places a new duty on public
authorities to promote equality of opportunity for disabled people.
This will mean that public bodies must take account of the needs of
disabled people as an integral part of their policies, practices and
procedures.</p><p><a name="06052520001987">The ODI
is responsible for raising awareness of the Disability Discrimination
Act and improving attitudes to disabled people. A campaign aimed at

is not comparable with later SWI survey estimates because of
differences in design, coverage and the level of information collected.
Indications suggest that if it was possible to put this estimate on the

regarded as financially dependent on their parents, who can receive
child benefit and child tax credits on their behalf. Support for those
who choose to undertake full-time advanced education is provided by the

figures are estimates only. As they are derived from a sample they are
subject to sampling error, also the context of the face-to-face BCS
interview means the estimates are certain to be underestimates of the
true extent due to the fact that some respondents may be unwilling to
reveal experience of domestic violence to interviewers. To address
this, self-completion components for those aged 16-59 on domestic
violence have been included in the 1996, 2001, 2004-05, and 2005-06
BCS. Results from the 2001 BCS self-completion module on domestic
violence were published in Home Office Research Study No.276. According
to this more confidential approach to measurement prevalence (per cent.
of population victim at least once) rates for last year domestic
assault were approximately five times higher than in the main
face-to-face BCS. Also according to this report, 80 per cent. of the
domestic violence incidents suffered by women in the 12 months prior to
interview were from current spouses or partners, and 20 per cent. from
ex-spouses/partners. The respective figures for men were 86 and 14 per
cent. It also showed that the police came to know about the (worst)
incident of domestic violence suffered in the 12 months prior to
interview in 23 per cent. of cases suffered by women, and 8 per cent.
of cases suffered by men. Overall, in 72 per cent. of the cases that
the police came to know about, the victim reported it (rather than
someone else such as family member or friend, or police came to know
about in another

is that which establishes the person's claim to British nationality.
For persons born in the UK since the British Nationality Act 1981 came
into force on one January 1983, this depends on a parent having been a
British citizen or settled in the UK at the time of the birth. The Act
provides that for the purposes of determining British nationality, the
relationship of father and child shall be taken to exist only between a
man and any legitimate child born to him. Therefore a passport
applicant who wishes to establish that he is a British citizen because
his or her father was a British citizen when the applicant was born
needs to provide his or her father's marriage certificate. To establish
the number of applications which were unsuccessful because this
certificate could not be provided would require a search of individual
case records and could not be done without disproportionate
expense.</p><p><a name="06052520002751">This

responsible for the enforcement of bus lane infringements in England

autumn. Suspected offenders will be told that a vehicle of which they
are the registered keeper has been detected committing a bus lane
offence. The provision of further information is a matter for
individual chief officers of police. Guidance from the Association of
Chief Police Officers is that the registered keeper or person named by
the keeper as driver at the time of the alleged offence should be
allowed to view photographic evidence on request. Any person who
receives a fixed penalty notice for a bus lane offence and wishes to
dispute the alleged offence is required to request a court hearing, the
procedure for which is explained on the notice. If a case went to
court, the prosecution would have to furnish the evidence to support
the proceedings and relevant material would be disclosed under the
provisions of the Criminal Procedure and Investigations
Act.</p><p><a name="06052520002954">In
London, the police can still enforce bus lane infringements if they
consider it appropriate. Most enforcement is however undertaken by
Transport for London and the London boroughs under the overall

Transport and Environmental Committee (ALGTEC). Recipients of penalty
charge notices issued for bus lane offences are entitled to view the
record of the contravention free of charge at the offices of the
issuing authority. Alternatively a copy of the recording can be

for making representations against a notice to the enforcing authority

Dhanda:</b> To be awarded qualified teacher status (QTS), all
trainee teachers must demonstrate that they understand their
responsibilities under the statutory SEN code of practice, know how to
seek advice from specialists where necessary, and can differentiate
their teaching to meet the needs of pupils, including those with
SEN.</p><p><a name="06052520003244">The National
Standards for qualified teachers status and the Induction Programme for
Newly Qualified Teachers (NQT) both cover SEN, including specific
learning difficulties such as dyslexia. Nets are required to
demonstrate that they can plan effectively to meet the needs of pupils
in their class with SEN, with or without a statement, and in
consultation with the school's SEN Co-ordinator, contribute to the
preparation and implementation of individual pupils1 education plans or
the equivalent.</p><p><a name="06052520003245">The
Department is working with the Training and Development Agency for
Schools to take forward a range of specific initiatives designed to
improve the skills and confidence of trainee, newly qualified, and
established teachers in supporting pupils with SEN and
disabilities.</p><p><a name="06052520003246">All
schools have a school development grant that they can use, amongst
other things, for the purposes of supporting the continuing
professional development of teachers in relation to their understanding
and knowledge of SEN and disability issues. A wide variety of courses
are available covering SEN, including dyslexia, ranging from
awareness-raising through to in-depth studies leading to specific
qualifications. It is, however, a matter for individual teachers and
their schools to determine their own particular training and
development
needs.</p><p><a name="06052520003247">No
information is collected centrally which would enable the Government to
make an estimate of the number of children and adults with dyslexia.
However, since 2004, the Department for Education and Skills have
collected data on pupils by type of SEN as part of the annual school
census. Dyslexia is included within specific learning difficulties
(SpLD)&#151;which also covers dyscalculia and dyspraxia. We have data
on pupils with SEN at &#145;School Action Plus&#146; and with a
statement of SEN where SpLD is recorded as their primary need. The
number of pupils aged under 16 with SpLD in maintained schools in 2006
was just under 77,000. We do not have data on pupils whose needs are
met at &#145;School Action&#146; or where SpLD is a secondary or
other need.</p><p><a name="06052520003248">The

programmes (Entry to Employment and Programme led Pathways) funded by
the Learning and Skills Council (LSC). The extension of EMA to unwaged
trainees should not be regarded as simply the replacement of the
training allowance by EMA. It is a full package of financial support
which will extend EMA to unwaged trainees and extend child benefit and
child tax credit to their parents/carers. This will mean more money for
the majority of unwaged trainees and their families, who are typically
low to middle income households. Those young people who are estranged
from their parents/carers, and entitled to claim benefits in their own
right, will also be much better off as they will be able to claim
income support in addition to their
EMA.</p><p><a name="06052520003310">The LSC will

telephone advice. The LSC consulted last year on its strategy for the
Community Legal Service (CLS), Making Legal Rights a Reality. The
Commission's final strategy for the CLS was launched

Legal Advice Networks which will be particularly beneficial in less

available. Clients can find a local legal advisor through the Community

undertaken by West Hertfordshire Hospital Trust. The review is expected
to conclude and report in late June of this
year.</p><p><a name="06052520004570">The review group
is made up of health professionals, community representatives, that is
local authorities, NHS managers, voluntary groups (including Dacorum
Hospital action group) and the National Childbirth Trust (NCT). As part
of its work, the review team has commissioned the NCT to conduct a
postal survey involving every one of the 5,000 women who gave birth in
West Hertfordshire last year. Every woman who gave birth last year has
been sent a survey form and some have been asked to take part in more
intensive focus
groups.</p><p><a name="06052520004571">The review's
overall remit is to consider and make recommendations on future
provision of safe and cost-effective maternity services which meet
current national best
