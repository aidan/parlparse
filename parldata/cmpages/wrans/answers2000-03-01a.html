To ask the Prime Minister how many senior civil servants from an ethnic minority background are employed in his office; and how many of them are <i>(a)</i> men and <i>(b)</i> women.  [110676]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00301w01.html_spmin1"><B>The Prime Minister:</B> 
 As at 1 April 1999, 55 members of the Senior Civil Service were from ethnic minority background (1.7 per cent.).
<P>

<a name="00301w01.html_para0">Information on ethnic origin in the Civil Service is collected on the understanding that it will be treated on a confidential basis. To protect the privacy of individual members of staff we do not disclose data relating to fewer than five people.
<P>

<a name="00301w01.html_para1">The Cabinet Office monitors ethnicity but not at individual unit level. The Cabinet Office and Number 10, which for these purposes are taken together, have fewer than five people of ethnic minority background in the Senior Civil Service.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00301w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Ian Stewart: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer how he proposes to effect the transfer of the Competent Authority for listing from the London Stock Exchange to the Financial Services Authority.  [112936]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00301w01.html_spnew0"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 Given the need for planning purposes to have a precise target date for the transfer of the Competent Authority for listing function, we have decided to make the transfer by means of Regulations made under the European Communities Act 1972. These Regulations are being laid in draft today for the approval 



<P>
<P><I>1 Mar 2000 : Column: 266W</I><P>
of Parliament with the intention that the transfer should take place on 1 May. The proposed new legislative framework for the Competent Authority would then be brought into effect as soon as possible after the enactment of the Financial Services and Markets Bill.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00301w01.html_wqn5"><B> Dr. Starkey: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what investigations Her Majesty's Customs and Excise has conducted of imports to the UK during the past three years of wines produced in wineries located in <i>(a)</i> the Golan Heights and <i>(b)</i> the Israeli West Bank settlement of Barkan; and what its findings have been concerning imports under preferences during that period.  [111882]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00301w01.html_spnew2"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 From examination of entry records Customs and Excise has identified small quantities of wines from the Golan Heights and the area Barkan. Details have been passed to the European Commission.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00301w01.html_wqn6"><B> Dr. Starkey: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer, pursuant to his answer of 14 February 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 447W, concerning imports from Israeli settlements in occupied territories, whether the documents referred to in the answer declared products imported to the United Kingdom in violation of Article 38 and the provisions of the Protocol on Rules of Origin of the EC Trade Agreement with Israel to have originated in Israel.  [111874]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00301w01.html_spnew3"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 As indicated in my answer of 14 February, the documents failed to substantiate the alleged non-compliance with the provisions of the Agreement between the EC and Israel.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00301w01.html_wqn7"><B> Dr. Starkey: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what post-import verification procedures Her Majesty's Customs and Excise has initiated with Israel's customs service for products imported from Israel following indications that the products in question may have been wholly obtained or significantly processed in territories occupied by Israel since 1967, including in Israeli settlements.  [111883]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00301w01.html_spnew4"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 None.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00301w01.html_wqn8"><B> Dr. Starkey: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what assessment Her Majesty's Customs and Excise has made of its ability to establish the origin of products that may have been produced in territories occupied by Israel since 1967 if Israel's customs misapply the origin rule protocol and the territorial clause in its agreements.  [111884]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00301w01.html_spnew5"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 The European Commission is taking the lead in establishing the origin of products imported into the European Union, that may have been produced in territories occupied by Israel since 1967. The Commission has not yet provided an assessment of the likely outcome of this initiative.

<P>
<a name="00301w01.html_wqn9"><B> Dr. Starkey: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what investigations Her Majesty's Customs and Excise has conducted and what information it has obtained concerning carpets imported to the UK under preferences from a manufacturing firm in the Israeli West Bank settlement of Barkan, or carrying the name or trademark of such a firm.  [111879]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00301w01.html_spnew6"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 Customs and Excise has identified a number of consignments of carpets from the area Barkan which have been imported into the UK under preferences. Details have been passed to the European Commission.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00301w01.html_wqn10"><B> Dr. Starkey: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer, pursuant to his answer of 14 February 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 447W, what the information was concerning products processed in Israeli settlements in occupied territories which may have been imported into the UK in violation of Article 38 and the provisions of the Protocol on Rules of Origin of the EC Trade Agreement with Israel; and if Her Majesty's Customs and Excise has identified <i>(a)</i> importations to the UK under preferences of dates from the Israeli exporters in question and <i>(b)</i> the UK importers and consignees.  [111881]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00301w01.html_spnew7"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 It comprised details obtained by the European Commission of a range of goods together with information from another source about dates produced in Israeli settlements. Customs and Excise has identified importations into the UK under preferences of dates of Israeli origin but, as indicated in my answer of 14 February, scrutiny of the customs entry documents has failed to substantiate the alleged non-compliance with the provisions of the EC-Israel trade agreement.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00301w01.html_wqn12"><B> Mr. Key: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence (1) what use experience of video conferencing exists in <i>(a)</i> the Army and <i>(b)</i> the RAF; and what were the locations linked and the bandwidth used;  [110851]
<P>
<UL>(2) if he will list the Royal Navy ships which have video conferencing facilities, indicating the bandwidth used and the locations where video conferencing has been <i>(a)</i> successful and <i>(b)</i> unsuccessful for each ship.  [110852]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00301w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Spellar </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 21 February 2000:</i> VideoTeleConferencing (VTC) is used both operationally and for normal business across Defence. Because it is primarily used in a joint environment, the questions are answered together.
<P>

<a name="00301w01.html_para4">HMS Illustrious, Invincible and Fearless are permanently fitted with VTC facilities. HMS Chatham, Campbeltown, Cumberland and Cornwall are also fitted to receive VTC, but the terminal equipment is not carried routinely unless the ship is in Flag Ship role. They typically operate at bandwidths of either 64 kilobits per second or 128 kilobits per second and use dedicated military satellite services, although some ships can also use Inmarsat if required.
<P>

<a name="00301w01.html_para5">The Permanent Joint Headquarters (PJHQ) is the main sponsor of deployed, operational VTC. VTC was first deployed on operations in 1997 in the form of a capability trial. The trial was successful and VTC is now routinely deployed on operations to provide the Chief of Joint Operations with one of his primary command tools. The PJHQ has a significant VTC capability and is able to conduct secure VTC with a wide range of UK and allied Headquarters and deployable formations. In addition, HQ Allied Command Europe Rapid Reaction Corps, for which UK is framework nation, is in the process of being equipped with VTC. Secure high quality VTC links also exist between the PJHQ and the Defence Crisis Management Centre that are used to conduct crisis planning and to provide operational updates to Defence chiefs. The bandwidth employed by operational VTC services varies between 64 kilobits per second and 384 kilobits per second. It forms part of the overall information exchange requirements package for a deployed formation which takes account of the operational requirement, whether or not the end user is in a mobile or static environment, and the available capacity in the overall communications planning scenario.
<P>

<a name="00301w01.html_para6">Within the Royal Air Force, VTC systems exist in the main Headquarters of Strike Command and Personnel and Training Command among other locations. Additionally, a Closed Circuit Television System is used in Headquarters Strike Command to support operational briefings for senior staff. Commercially available systems are employed which typically utilise a bandwidth of between 128 kilobits per second and 384 kilobits per second, connected via Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) lines. These allow dial-up connections to be established to other sites with similar facilities.
<P>

<a name="00301w01.html_para7">Within the Army, VTC is being used for a variety of applications including communication between the main locations of the Adjutant General's staff in Upavon, Glasgow and London and also within Headquarters Land 



<P>
<P><I>1 Mar 2000 : Column: 269W</I><P>
and at a number of garrisons. Again these systems typically utilise a bandwidth of between 128 kilobits per second and 384 kilobits per second. Initiatives are currently being studied to extend this connectivity to provide VTC facilities in other major Army headquarters to support a variety of business activities in the future.
<P>

<a name="00301w01.html_para8">One specific application under investigation is the use of VTC in support of Custody Hearings and Summary Appeal Courts under the control of the Courts Martial Administrative Office (CMAO) to support the processes set out in the Armed Forces Discipline Bill. On 18 February 2000, CMAO staffs completed a two week trial which included links to sites in Germany, Brunei and Canada. The purposes of this trial were: to demonstrate to the Judge Advocate General's department the proposed Custody Hearing process using VTC; to prove the principle of using VTC for Custody Hearings; to examine the possibility of taking evidence from witnesses in overseas theatres and to examine the possibility of conducting Directions Hearings by VTC. The trial report is expected to conclude that the aims of the study were achieved although some processes and procedures would need to be refined. The report will recommend that a detailed Statement of Requirement be prepared for a VTC system to be procured and installed later this year.
<P>

<a name="00301w01.html_para9">In the event, however unlikely, that a soldier needs legal advice on a Summary Dealing matter while in an operational theatre, it will firstly be sought from other Service lawyers in theatre (RAF or RN). Should these not 



<P>
<P><I>1 Mar 2000 : Column: 270W</I><P>
be available then the use of telephone or VTC will be made available subject to operational priorities. If the matter was sufficiently serious for the CO to believe that detention is necessary, he will almost certainly wish the individual to be removed to a rear area where he can be appropriately dealt with.

 I have been asked to reply.

<a name="00301w02.html_para8">The UK Government have had recent representations from Commonwealth and non-Commonwealth Ministers regarding the potential exclusion of nuclear power projects from the Clean Development Mechanism. At the Fifth Conference of the Parties (CoP5) in November 1999, the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions received representations from Indian and Chinese Ministers. Both Ministers were concerned that the UK should not support specific exclusions from the Clean Development Mechanism and that the host developing country should determine whether projects met their own sustainable development aims. At CoP5, some EU Ministers and I briefly discussed project eligibility for the Clean Development Mechanism. I understand that the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs has not received any representations.

However, the overall level of activity undertaken by the Council in Africa over the same period has declined from &#163;106 million to &#163;59 million, as the result of a downturn in the management of development and training contracts.

We strongly backed UN Security Council Resolution 1289 of 7 February which authorised the deployment of up to 11,100 troops and observers.

<a name="00301w03.html_para6">We also agree with the Secretary-General that the UN, already under considerable resource pressure, will not be able to maintain a major military presence in Sierra Leone for a prolonged period; and that the responsibility for the success of the peace process ultimately lies with the people and leaders of Sierra Leone.

 Although the Sri Lankan Government have taken some steps to improve their human rights record, we remain concerned about continuing violations and failures to prosecute violators. We are also concerned about human rights abuses committed by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and reports that they are still using child soldiers. We will continue to raise our concerns and stress the need for effective machinery to protect and promote human rights.

 The governments of Syria, Iraq and the League of Arab States have registered their concern about the potential impact of the Ilisu Dam on their water supply from the Tigris river. We have also received several letters from NGOs on the same subject. Water is a sensitive issue in the region because of scarcity of supply. The Ilisu Dam is, however, a hydro-electric project, not an irrigation proposal. Continued flow of water would be needed for the dam to function.

 The Government remain neutral on the use of MTBE in petrol. It can provide worthwhile improvements in air quality through the reduction of vehicle pollutants, e.g. carbon monoxide by 25 per cent. and hydrocarbons by 15 per cent.

 Ministry staff track forecasts of weather and sea conditions on all occasions when there are plans to take live food animals out of Dover by sea. The trigger for the Department's inspection staff at Dover to initiate discussions with the master of the vessel is a clear forecast, when the master imminently intends to sail with animals, that force 7 winds and/or rough sea conditions are likely to prevail. Inspection staff discuss the conditions with the master of the vessel to ensure that the master has exercised his judgment as to whether animals are likely to be caused injury or unnecessary suffering as a result of weather and/or sea conditions likely to be encountered during the voyage (as required by article 4(2) of the Welfare of Animals (Transport) Order 1997).

 Police officers need some means of protection against attacks, even when committed by people who are mentally disturbed, and the safety of CS spray to all concerned must be compared with that of alternatives, such as physical restraint or use of batons, which themselves involve an element of risk. Nor is it always clear when an attacker is suffering from a mental disorder which might require medication. The Guidance on the use of CS spray in such circumstances are set out in paragraphs 6.5, 8.4 and 8.5 of the guidance published by the Association of Chief Police Officers on this subject, a copy of which is in the Library.

 Of the total 170 people on the aircraft, 73 returned voluntarily to Afghanistan on 14 February.

Indefinite leave to enter will be granted to the wife of one of these applicants as his dependant, although she had claimed asylum in her own right. The claimants in these cases have five children who will also be given indefinite leave to enter.

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what percentage of British <i>(a)</i> bilateral and <i>(b)</i> multilateral aid was allocated to states in (i) Africa, (ii) Asia, (iii) Latin America and (iv) Europe in (1) 1996, (2) 1997, (3) 1998 and (4) 1999; and what is her estimate of the equivalent figure in 2000.

<P>
<a name="00301w10.html_spnew2"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 The information requested is given in the table for the Department for International Development expenditure only (other UK aid is excluded as we do not have the required details for the later years). Multilateral assistance cannot be readily broken down by region but we conduct special exercises periodically to estimate the geographical distribution of our contributions to multilateral institutions. The latest exercise was conducted in 1997.

 One member of the DfEE's staff agreed to be a member of the group established by the New Local Government Network, and has met a member of the secretariat, but has not so far attended any meetings. This involvement was intended to improve the group's understanding of relevant central Government policy and activity. No meetings of the group have been held in the Department and no staff, material or other support extended to the group or to the Network, so there has been no cost to public funds. One of Her Majesty's Inspectors of Schools is also a member of the group, but has not attended any meetings. The full membership of the group is a matter for the New Local Government Network.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what measures he has taken to support children with dyslexia in schools; and if he will make a statement.  [111979]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00301w11.html_spnew5"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 Under the Education Act 1996, schools and local education authorities have a duty to identify and make suitable provision for all children with special educational needs, including children with dyslexia. The Code of Practice on the Identification and Assessment of Special Educational Needs, which came into effect on 1 September 1994, gives guidance to schools and local education authorities on how to meet this duty. Paragraphs 3:60 to 3:63 provide guidance on specific learning difficulties and have particular reference to dyslexia. The Code is currently being revised to update the guidance and provide examples of good practice, with an increased emphasis on early identification and support.
<P>

<a name="00301w11.html_para2">In recognition of the need for partnership working to address children's dyslexia a seminar was held in July 1999 bringing together the main Government Departments and agencies, and external partners for an exchange of views on the key educational issues. Ways in which individual expertise and resources can be pooled were identified, and a consensus reached over a shared agenda for tackling issues in the areas of early identification, teacher training, and the use of ICT. An informal working group has since been focusing on the training of teachers of children with dyslexia.
<P>

<a name="00301w11.html_para3">To assist schools in recognising dyslexia we have produced simple guidance which provides hints to primary school teachers to help them identify children who may be dyslexic. In addition the Department has recently provided a grant to help the British Dyslexia Association reprint the schools resource pack entitled "Achieving dyslexia friendly schools". Two copies of the pack have been distributed to all local education authorities in England. With funding from the Department, the Dyslexia Institute is undertaking a two year study programme which seeks to evaluate the effects of structured programmes of intervention for seven-year- old pupils who are experiencing specific difficulties in learning to read, write and spell. Two key aspects of the programme are to develop activities that parents can do at home and to share the knowledge and skills of specialist teachers more widely.

 The introduction of Citizenship education in schools was supported during the consultation on the review of the National Curriculum. We are actively taking forward plans to implement the new arrangements for the introduction as a statutory subject at Key Stages 3 and 4 in 2002. I chair a working party in the Department for Education and Employment developing a package of measures to support schools in delivering the Citizenship programme. The Working Party's membership is drawn from head teachers, advisers, Citizenship education groups and the churches. The hon. Member for Faversham and Mid-Kent (Mr. Rowe) is also a member. It includes representatives from the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority, the Office for Standards in Education and the Teacher Training Agency. It is considering the requirements for teachers and teacher training for Citizenship education as part of its remit along with other issues such as assessment, community involvement and resources.
<P>

<a name="00301w12.html_para9">Standards Funds of &#163;18 million have already been made available from April 2000 to support schools in implementing the revised National Curriculum--some &#163;12 million of that will support Citizenship and Personal, Social and Health Education, of which &#163;5 million is for Citizenship at Key Stages 3 and 4. The wider costs to the Government of introducing Citizenship education are being considered as part of the Citizenship Education Working Party's work.
<P>

<a name="00301w12.html_para10">Pupils will be taught, within the Citizenship programme, about the regional identities in the United Kingdom as part of learning about the diversity of our society and the need for mutual understanding and respect. The teaching of controversial issues arises in other subjects as well as in Citizenship. There are well established safeguards in law to guard against biased and unbalanced teaching. The report of the National Advisory Group on Education for Citizenship and the Teaching of Democracy in Schools acknowledged these in its final

Teaching and learning in Citizenship will be monitored in the same way as for other subjects. Citizenship comes under the remit of the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority to monitor and review the curriculum and the teaching of it in schools will be inspected by the Office for Standards in Education.

 Of the 60 'trailblazer' and 69 Round 2 local authority districts announced to date as eligible for a local Sure Start programme, five can be classed as 'remoter mainly rural' (Boston, Fenland, Sedgemoor, Penwith and Kerrier). In addition, the trailblazer Sure Start programme in East Cleveland covers what is essentially a rural area, while a further seven districts are a mix of urban and rural, and coalfield areas (Isle of Wight, Easington, Wear Valley, Sedgefield, Derwentside, Ashfield, Bolsover). The trailblazer programmes in Fenland and East Cleveland are up and running now and Minsters hope to agree the programmes in Penwith and Sedgemoor soon. The remaining programmes are part of the second round and should be up and running by the summer.

 Invitation letters are sent to those lone parents whose youngest child is aged over five years and three months, after they have received Income Support for eight weeks. Other lone parents with younger children are able to join the programme but are not sent invitation letters. These invitation letters are not appointment letters; their aim is to tell lone parents about NDLP and the benefits that can be gained from participating in the programme.
<P>

<a name="00301w13.html_para2">There have been 443,700 invitation letters issued to lone parents. Of these, 36,990 have attended an initial interview, of which, 4,680 have left the New Deal for Lone Parents (NDLP) to go into employment. At the end of November an additional 6,070 were receiving support from their personal advisers while in work on NDLP. These 10,750 lone parents represent 2.4 per cent. of those sent a letter.
<P>

<a name="00301w13.html_para3">In addition, 74,320 lone parents who did not receive an invitation letter attended an interview. Therefore, total interviews and/or letters was 518,020, total jobs found was 32,710, which is 6.3 per cent. of those who were either interviewed or sent a letter.

 Although no specific assessment of this kind has been made, a national network of Employment Service Jobcentres exists to provide all individuals who need it help with finding work, including those who work on a part-time or seasonal basis.

<P>

 We are making &#163;390 million available over three years to increase by 190,000 the number of free, good quality, early education places for three-year-olds. This new money is being phased in over the financial years 1999-2000 to 2001-02. The priority is to reach those three-year-olds in social need who would most benefit from a free nursery place. The additional funding will enable 66 per cent. of all three-year-olds to have access to a free place by March 2002, as the first stage of the Government's strategy to provide free early education places for all three-year-olds. The estimated annual cost of achieving universal provision is approximately &#163;450 million.

Headteachers and representatives of LEAs have been invited to one of a series of threshold training events taking place between 27 March and 14 April. At these events they will be given training packs and a "tool-kit" to take back to schools to help them explain the threshold process to teachers and governors.

 There is only one licensed manufacturer of BCG vaccine in the United Kingdom--Medeva Pharma. Over the past months, this company has experienced severe manufacturing problems with their BCG production facility in Speke, Liverpool. Medeva has indicated to the Department that the production volumes are not currently sufficient to support the routine schools programmes. Until manufacturing resumes in sufficient quantities, stocks are being used specifically for those at higher risk of tuberculosis. The Department has had no alternative but to request health authorities to suspend their routine schools immunisation programme.
<P>

<a name="00301w14.html_para1">As soon as the problems with the manufacturing facility have been resolved and this has been demonstrated by stocks becoming available in sufficient quantities, the Department will advise health authorities to recommence their routine schools programmes.

<a name="00301w14.html_para2">Since vaccines are biological products whose manufacture can never be guaranteed, continuity of supply can only be assured by having sufficient stock manufactured in advance, preferably from more than one manufacturer.

 We recognise the problems of access to National Health Service dentistry which exist in parts of the country and which it inherited in 1997. My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister has made it clear that, by the end of 2001, everyone should be able to find an NHS dentist simply by calling NHS Direct. We have already addressed the problem with the Investing in Dentistry initiative which generated up to 800,000 patient registrations with dentists, and the Personal Dental Service projects which include "phone and go" dental access centres. By the end of the year there will be about forty access centres in the areas which need them most, providing the full range of high quality NHS dentistry to patients who are not registered with a dentist. Further measures will be set out in the forthcoming strategy for NHS dentistry in England.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health If he will make a statement on the effects which staging the fee increases to general dental practitioners for the financial years 1996-97, 1997-98 and 1998-99 will have on general dental practitioners' pensions.  [112031]<P>

<a name="00301w16.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 National Health Service pensions are based on actual levels of pensionable remuneration and not on deemed or notional earnings. Where staging occurs, only earnings actually received are taken into

account in the calculation of pensions. The effect of staging, therefore, is slightly to reduce the pension from the figure that would be payable had staging not occurred. The degree to which this happens for an individual will depend on when that person retires and their earnings in the years before the staging and during the years when the staging applied. General Dental Practitioners' pensions are calculated on total career earnings uprated in accordance with a formula agreed with the profession.

 Figures on the number of locum staff working in the hospital medical sector are no longer collected centrally. The figures were last collected in September 1996 when there were 2,500 hospital medical locums. Figures on the number of locum staff working in general practice are not collected centrally.
