 Every year the Northern Ireland Office use Hillsborough Castle to host a series of receptions at Christmas time to bring a wide cross-section of the community together and to use these opportunities to build community confidence.</p>

The four Christmas receptions held in Northern Ireland in 2007 were attended by over 1,400 members of the public drawn from the criminal justice, policing, military, business, charity and community sectors. The guests included families of the security forces and serving personnel, representatives of victims groups, churches and businesses, as well as many others working in the community sectors across Northern Ireland.</p>

We work hard to monitor costs at these occasions as we are mindful in Government of the need to provide value for money. Anyone with a close understanding of Northern Ireland will know the value of these occasions in bringing people together in a renewed political environment.</p>

External forecasts from third parties such as travel companies, insurance firms and banks were used as the basis for assumptions. Information was received from a spread of ATOL license holders, including the four largest air travel tour operators, five medium sized operators and two online tour operators.

 The Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (RTFO) creates a market for first generation biofuels which in turn helps to set the right conditions for the development of commercially viable second generation biofuels. The UK will be required to modify the RTFO in order to implement the Renewable Energy Directive in 2010. The directive incentivises second generation biofuels through requiring member states to count their contribution towards renewable energy targets as twice those of first generation biofuels. We shall be consulting later this year about how to take forward the implementation of the directive in UK legislation.</p>

Last autumn the Government also announced that the Department anticipates contributing up to &#163;3 million per year over the next two financial years to the Carbon Trust&#146;s Advanced Bioenergy Directed Research Accelerator.

In 2008-09 DFT will provide Chorley borough council with special grant funding of &#163;280,000 for the improvement to statutory concessionary travel; this is in addition to the existing formula grant funding from CLG. The Special Grant Funding represents a 33 per cent. increase in funding over and above Chorley borough council&#146;s declared costs of &#163;0.85 million for concessionary travel in 2007-08.</p>

 HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) administer almost 20 different taxes and duties and several other collection and payment regimes such as tax credits, national insurance and child benefit. All of the regimes make provision for administrative financial penalties to underpin compliance.</p>

 HMRC announced the planned closure of these three offices in February 2008. While we cannot rule out compulsory redundancies, our aim is to avoid them as far as is reasonably possible, and there have been none so far.</p>

<i> [holding answer 9 February 2009]:</i> The Climate Change Act 2008 puts in place a system of five-year carbon budgets that will set a legally binding limit on UK greenhouse gas emissions. Following advice from the Committee on Climate Change received in December 2008, the Government will set the levels of the first three carbon budgets, covering the period 2008 to 2022, by 1 June 2009.

A key instrument to reduce emissions will be the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS). The combination of a more ambitious, EU-wide cap on emissions with an annually declining trajectory to 2020 and beyond will ensure that emissions reductions from the EU ETS will correspond to approximately two thirds of the effort the EU will need to make to reach the 20 per cent. target by 2020.</p>

 The Cancer Reform Strategy, published in December 2007, sets out guidance to the local national health service on how to improve cancer prevention, speed up the diagnosis and treatment of cancer, reduce inequalities, improve the experience of people living with and beyond cancer, ensure care is delivered in the most appropriate settings and ensure patients can access effective new treatments quickly. A copy of the strategy has already been placed in the Library. It is for primary care trusts (PCTs) to use the funds made available to them and work in partnership with strategic health authorities, local services, cancer networks and other local stakeholders to deliver these aims. Information on the work being done in the Coventry area can be obtained direct from Coventry Teaching PCT.</p>

 The vascular checks programme has been designed to be undertaken in a variety of settings to ensure that those who are not regularly in touch with formal health care can access the programme. Primary care trusts will commission the programme to reflect the needs of their population and how they access services. Primary care trusts may, therefore, commission the service from general practitioners, pharmacies or other providers which their target group access. This could include running the programme in a workplace setting.</p>

 As part of preparing primary care trusts for implementation, the Department will make available a standard invitation letter and leaflet about the vascular checks programme. Until the national call and recall system is developed, primary care trusts will decide locally who and how to call people first. Current vascular checks type activity across the country suggests that for some populations other methods of invitation e.g. through telephone calls generate a better take up. Working through NHS Improvement, we are making available learning on this and other aspects of the programme across the country. Once the call and recall system is developed, people will recalled every five years for their check.</p>

 Many primary care trusts, especially in spearhead areas, already have vascular checks type programmes in place. The implementation of the vascular checks programme will be phased during 2009-10. All primary care trusts will be expected to have undertaken some activity to support the programme during this period. We are working with strategic health authorities to ensure all primary care trusts implement the programme. We are developing an evaluation strategy that will provide information on the rate and mode of implementation. As part of the evaluation, we will look at uptake amongst groups less likely to participate in the programme and those particularly likely to benefit since they are inherently likely to be at higher risk. These groups will vary from primary care trusts to primary care trusts.</p>

 The vascular checks programme has the potential to reduce health inequalities and has been designed to form part of the Department's overall programme for tackling them. The assessment element of the programme has been designed to be undertaken in a variety of settings to help to ensure that everyone who is eligible can access the programme. In November 2008 the Department issued guidance to primary care trusts Next Steps' guidance for Primary Care Trusts which underlines the need for them to commission a programme that tackles and reduces health inequalities.

 Raising the public awareness of prostate cancer is a key challenge. We want men to know what their prostate is, what it does, and what can go wrong with it. However, we have to raise awareness in a responsible way so as not to cause undue anxiety.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_878"><a name="90212w0017.htm_para0"><a name="09021354002668">That is why the Prostate Cancer Advisory Group Public Awareness Working Group developed a definitive set of consistent key messages for the general public about the prostate, including prostate cancer. These messages provide men and their families with information about the prostate designed in such a way as not to cause unnecessary anxiety. The key messages have been agreed by 20 organisations, including charities, patient groups and professional bodies, as well as the Department. The messages are free for all organisations to use, and were published in 2008 in the Royal British Legion&#146;s Members Directory and in supplements to the <i> Daily Express</i> and <i> The Daily Telegraph</i> at a cost of over &#163;5,000.</p>

 We are concerned that the Burmese regime has imposed restrictions on churches and other places of worship for religious minorities in Rangoon. We condemn the marginalisation or persecution of any community based on their religious beliefs. We also remain concerned about reports that the mainly Buddhist Burmese authorities restrict freedom of religion. There are Christians among a variety of ethnic groups in Burma, though their persecution by the authorities appears to be based largely on their ethnicity rather than their faith.</p>

 The UK supports the principle of a Central Asia Nuclear Weapon-Free Zone and welcomes Kazakhstan&#146;s recent ratification of the treaty of Semipalatinsk. The Government believe this gives the central Asian states the opportunity to amend articles IV and XII, the provisions of which pertaining to transit arrangements and the primacy of previous security arrangements are not in our view compatible with a nuclear weapon-free zone. Acceptable amendments to these provisions will enable the UK to ratify the protocol to the treaty.</p>

 The Government have received reports of an incident which occurred at the Abu Fana Coptic monastery on 31 May 2008. The incident concerned the building of a wall on agricultural land disputed by the local village, Deir Abu Fana and the monastery. The dispute became violent when a mob attacked the monastery, killing a local resident. Two monastery workers suffered bullet wounds, two monks suffered injuries and three monks were taken by the mob and badly beaten. I understand that the disagreement has been settled through customary informal negotiations. We understand that no one has been brought to trial and 15 people remain in detention.</p>

But sectarian tension and discrimination does sometimes exist at grass roots level. We regularly raise our concerns about human rights with the Egyptian government, and will continue to do so.</p>

<i> [holding answer 10 February 2009]:</i> I should clarify that it was the US, not the UK, who had sole responsibility for the security and administration of the camp. The responsibility for the camp was handed to the Iraqi authorities from 1 January 2009 by the US. Several hundred former residents have voluntarily returned to Iran in the recent past. Reporting leads us to understand that those who have returned have not been ill treated. Repatriations to Iran of those residents who wish to return will continue. But there is no evidence to  suggest forced relocation of the residents in Iraq or elsewhere will take place. Whilst residents of the camp were treated as &#147;protected persons&#148;, this was exercised at the good will of the US authorities in charge and  was not granted through any legal obligation under international law.</p>

 The assessment of the accuracy of the assumptions and estimated income is revisited in the current financial year and is based on recent volatility of and identifiable trends in the volumes of cases in past and current years. Using prior year volumes, based on historical actuals, and multiplying the total by the fee charge provides the basis of the fee income forecast for the financial year. In addition the impact, on the forecasted fee income, is adjusted to take into account known impacts from proposed changes to fee policy in the coming year, for example new fee charges. Throughout the year the fee income forecast and the assumptions against volume are revisited on a monthly basis, using actual data captured. Any substantial changes to volume trends, that can be identified, are factored in and adjustments made to the income forecast.</p>

 While parental income does not determine the educational attainment of any individual child, there is a clear correlation between low income and average attainment, as is shown for example in the data published annually by my Department showing differences in attainment at ages 11 and 16 between children eligible for free school meals and the rest of the cohort.

 Initial site investigation studies on the site of the Velopark were carried out throughout 2007 and continued into 2008, when the poor ground conditions were identified. As part of the review of the Masterplan for the Olympic Park, undertaken in 2007, the Velodrome was moved slightly to the west to help with the design and layout of the wider cycling facilities to be built in legacy. This movement exacerbated the ground conditions problem.</p>

The level of contamination on this site was more extensive than originally assessed and this contributed to the overall increase of &#163;25 million in the Velopark budget to &#163;105 million. Once the full extent of the ground conditions was known, design and ground modelling studies were undertaken which produced an accurate estimate of the potential costs.</p>

A large increase in the number of static libraries open for less than 10 hours per week (from 0 to 86) during this period compensates for a reduction in the number of mobile libraries (-12 per cent.) and results in the total number of libraries (static plus mobile) increasing by eight between 1996-97 and 2006-07.

The Government believe that investment in new broadband networks opens the way to a whole range of job opportunities, both during and post construction of the new networks. The National Endowment for Science, Technology and the Arts (NESTA) estimates that universal super-fast broadband in the UK could directly create 600,000 new ICT jobs and add &#163;18 billion to GDP over four years with even larger indirect benefit. The Information Technology and Innovation Foundation published a similar study of the impact investment in network infrastructures could have in the USA.</p>

 The UK Government recognise that losing the individual&#146;s right to opt-out of the 48 hour working week as set by the working time directive, would have a detrimental effect on the hours which firefighters working the retained duty system could be available for duty, especially the substantial numbers who work full-time for their primary employer.

 The UK does not have a national mandatory retirement age. Employers do not have to retire employees once they reach 65.

<p><a name="stpa_1076"><a name="90212w0043.htm_para0"><a name="09021354008116">Subsequently DFID has worked intensively with other donors, the UN High Level Task Force on Global Food Security and other stakeholders to take this forward. The UK worked within the G8 to secure food security as a key priority for the Toyako summit in July. G8 leaders called for the establishment of a Global Partnership for Agriculture and Food and established a G8 Working Group on Global Food Security in which the UK has been proactive. We have also engaged closely with the European Commission through the Working Party on Development Cooperation (CODEV). The result is sold donor consensus on the need for more and better support for food security, social protection and agricultural development and for a global mechanism to help deliver a comprehensive and co-ordinated international response to hunger.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1077"><a name="90212w0043.htm_para1"><a name="09021354008117">The recent &#147;High Level Meeting on Food Security for All&#148;, hosted by Ban Ki Moon and President Zapatero in Madrid, agreed to launch a formal consultation process for the establishment of a &#147;Global Partnership for Agriculture, Food Security and Nutrition&#148; (GPAFSN) which will fully engage all relevant stakeholders.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1078"><a name="90212w0043.htm_para2"><a name="09021354008118">Given the existence of the International Fund for Agricultural Development and the World Bank&#146;s multi-donor trust fund for rapid response to countries badly affected by the recent food crisis, the GPAFSN is not conceived as a new global fund. A small secretariat is envisaged, with its main role being to co-ordinate among the various UN agencies, donors, partner countries and other stakeholders who are serious and ambitious in stepping up joint efforts to reduce global hunger.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1079"><a name="90212w0043.htm_para3"><a name="09021354008119">Over $15 billion of new funding has already been announced since the food crisis began last year. G8 leaders announced some $10 billion of new commitments at their summit in Toyako. A further $1.75 billion to tackle food security was announced at the UN High Level Meeting on the MDGs in New York in September. This included one billion euros from the European Commission. Spain pledged one billion euros over the next five years at the recent Madrid meeting. The World Bank has pledged to increase its annual spending on agriculture by some $2 billion per year. Within these figures, during 2008 DFID has committed over &#163;900 million to addressing agriculture and food security, of which over &#163;230 million has already been disbursed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1080"><a name="90212w0043.htm_para4"><a name="09021354008120">The GPAFSN will have a crucial role in promoting the co-ordination of this funding at country level where partner governments are willing to give sustained priority to this agenda. GPAFSN will also be a forum for identifying and addressing emerging international issues, such as global grain price volatility, not appropriate for other international forums.</p>
