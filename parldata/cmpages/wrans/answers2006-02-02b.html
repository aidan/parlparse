 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what guidance he has given to the British Transport Police on the application of anti-terrorism legislation to the activities of railway enthusiasts who choose to photograph trains and stations.  [42286]</p>

 The Department has not issued any such guidance to the British Transport Police (BTP). Railway enthusiasts are frequently present on the rail infrastructure, are knowledgeable about railway operations and know what is or is not usual. They are in a good position to report any suspicious activity to the police and BTP actively encourage them, like any other user of rail services and stations, to do so.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60202w09.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_19">BTP officers would not normally use powers under Section 44 of the Terrorism Act 2000 to stop and search rail enthusiasts. However, in certain circumstances, photographing and videoing of railway infrastructure could be one possible indication of hostile surveillance and officers may judge it necessary to question, and possibly search, an individual. In this context, rail enthusiasts are not treated any differently from any other individual.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport how much was spent on cycling safety in each of the last 20 years.  [48012]</p>






<br>&nbsp;<br><i>2 Feb 2006 : Column 656W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>



<p><a name="st_20"><a name="60202w09.html_spnew5"><b> Dr. Ladyman: </b> 
 Most spending on cycle safety in England is undertaken by local highway authorities. This includes capital spending on infrastructure schemes such as cycle lanes, which may have traffic management as well as safety benefits. It also includes revenue spending on cycle training, other educational initiatives and local cycle safety publicity. Since 2001&#150;02, capital spending by English authorities outside London has been recorded through the local transport plan system, but this was not recorded centrally for earlier years. Revenue spending on road safety comes from local authorities&#039; own resources and is not recorded centrally.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60202w09.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_20">The Department for Transport also produces cycle safety publicity and resources at national level. Figures for annual spending are only available as far back as 2002&#150;03. Our road safety challenge grant scheme, which has been running since 2002&#150;03, has funded a number of projects that are wholly or partly to improve cycle safety. Figures for spending on cycle safety projects under previous grant schemes are not available. The Department also includes projects on cycle safety in its road safety research programme, though figures are available only from 1999&#150;2000.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60202w09.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_21">The Department has also from time to time funded various schemes to promote cycling, including infrastructure, facilities and training, which will have included safety benefits. From 2005&#150;06, this role has been taken on by Cycling England, which now receives &#163;5 million per year from the Department, to spend on a range of infrastructure, training and publicity measures.

<p>
<a name="60202w09.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_22">Available figures are shown in the following table. These may include amounts sent on cycling infrastructure and facilities that was not entirely safety-related and amounts spent on road safety publicity and education that was not entirely cycling related.

<p><a name="qn_22"><a name="60202w10.html_wqn0"><b> Gregory Barker: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what steps have been taken to prevent ships at sea spilling oil since the Sea Empress oil spill; and what further steps he plans to take.  [47173]</p>




<p><a name="st_22"><a name="60202w10.html_spnew0"><b> Dr. Ladyman: </b> 
 The UK Government have played a key role, internationally, regionally and nationally, in developing many measures to prevent, or mitigate the consequences of, oil spills from ships during the 10 years since the Sea Empress oil spill in February 1996. The most significant measures are as follows:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_20">In 1994, recognising the value of tugs in preventing groundings and other incidents, the UK introduced Emergency Towing Vessels (ETVs) on a trial basis. Initially ETVs were stationed at Dover and Stornoway for the winter months only. After further review, the number of ETVs was increased to four&#151;stationed at Dover, Stornoway, the Fair Isle Channel, and in the South West approaches&#151;and since October 2001 all four ETVs have been on station all year round.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_21">The UK participated fully in the adoption in 1996 of the Hazardous and Noxious Substances Convention which will provide compensation cover similar to the international oil pollution compensation regime but for other oils and chemicals, and also for explosion, death or injury from such products.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_22">In 1997 the UK co-ordinated an EU member states&#039; initiative at the IMO to have the whole of the North Sea, and all waters around the UK and Ireland, declared a special area for the purposes of protecting those waters from operational discharges of oil from shipping.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_23">The UK Maritime and Coastguard Agency has a dedicated Enforcement Unit. In 1997, legislation was passed to enable magistrates to impose a fine of up to &#163;250,000 on either the master or the ship-owner for an oil pollution offence; this is the highest fine for any offence in a magistrates court.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_24">In 2000, following a wide-ranging review, the UK published a revised &quot;National Contingency Plan for Marine Pollution from Shipping and Offshore Installations&quot;, setting out how the relevant agencies and authorities in the UK will respond to such incidents. The UK has also created the role of the Secretary of State&#039;s Representative for Maritime Salvage and Intervention (SOSREP). On behalf of the Secretary of State, SOSREP has the power to oversee, control and&#151;if necessary&#151;intervene in salvage operations within UK waters involving vessels or fixed platforms where there is a significant risk of pollution. To reduce the risk of pollution of our seas and coasts, SOSREP can direct vessels which are in difficulties to a suitable place of refuge. The powers of direction invested in SOSREP are extensive, and are called into play when he believes that the public interest is not being adequately protected. The SOSREP role has proved very successful, as well as being an international first for the UK.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_25">In 2000 the UK initiated action at the IMO to increase the limit of compensation under the 1992 CLC/Fund regime by a further 50 per cent. to &#163;177 million, with effect from 1 November 2003.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_26">In 2001, along with six other states, the UK pressed for a world-wide initiative to create a Supplementary Fund to the 1992 CLC/Fund to provide further substantial compensation for the most serious oil spills.</p>
</ul>
<p>

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_27">The UK was one of the countries, which developed the Bunkers Convention 2001, which establishes a liability regime for pollution from ships&#039; fuel oils.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_28">The UK played a leading role in the EU and the IMO to secure international agreement to accelerate the phasing out of single hull oil tankers. Double hulls can provide additional protection against spillage in the event of collisions and groundings.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_29">The UK played an active part in the work leading to the development of the EC Vessel traffic monitoring and information system Directive, which covers reporting requirements on ships with dangerous cargoes, the installation of Voyage Data Recorders on ships, the installation of Automatic Identification Systems (AIS) on ships and the establishment of shore-based stations to receive AIS5 information; exchange of vessel traffic information; places of refuge; and measures for shore authorities to take in bad weather conditions. The UK implemented the Directive in national law in 2005.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_30">The UK played a leading role in the IMO in achieving the designation of the Western European Particularly Sensitive Sea Area (PSSA), which includes a substantial proportion of the UK&#039;s seas and coasts. The PSSA came into effect on 1 July 2005. The protective measure for the PSSA is a mandatory reporting system. The reporting system applies to all tankers of more than 600 deadweight tonnes (dwt) carrying heavy grades of oil.</p>

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_31">The Merchant Shipping (Pollution) Bill is currently going through Parliament which will enable the UK to ratify and implement the Supplementary Fund Protocol to the Fund Convention, thereby increasing the amount of compensation available for any one incident to some &#163;621 million.</p>
</ul>

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_32">In addition, work on vessel routeing and traffic management measures has progressed to take account of wider developments in UK policy on the sustainable use of the marine environment, such as the growth in offshore renewable energy, the Government&#039;s commitment to introducing a Marine Bill, developments in thinking on marine spatial planning and advances in e-navigation technology. As part of this process, considerable work has gone into the identification of Marine Environmental High Risk Areas and an announcement will be made shortly.</p>

2. Data is taken from 5 per cent. extract of PSCS as at 31 March 2000 and 2005, therefore figures are subject to a degree of sampling variation. They are also adjusted to be consistent with the overall February caseload from the WPLS.<br>

3. Figures are rounded to the nearest hundred.<br>





4. A full basic state pension as at 31 March 2005 was &#163;79.60.<br>

5. A full basic state pension as at 31 March 2000 was &#163;66.75.<br>

6. The latest available population figures from ONS are mid year 2004.<br>

7. The figures supplied are based on entitlements to all categories of state pension. A full basic state pension is paid to those who fully satisfy the contribution conditions either in their own right or where applicable, on the basis of their late or former spouse&#039;s contributions.<br>

 Where the Secretary of State is satisfied that a local authority is failing to perform its duties to the minimum standards required, the Secretary of State has the power to intervene. Forms of intervention and engagement are decided in the light of independent evidence and tailored to the specific needs of the local authority. The authority will receive co-ordinated support and advice from officials in the Government Office, DfES advisers and from senior officers of the Primary and Secondary National Strategies. Action taken to improve local authority services following an Ofsted unsatisfactory rating has included establishing partnership arrangements with a high performing local authority and directing the outsourcing of the strategic management of services. Similar action will be taken in future in the light of evidence from the new Joint Area Review undertaken by Ofsted and other inspectorates. From this April, Directors for Children and Learners (DCLs), based in the Government Offices, will provide tailored support and challenge for every local authority in their region. This will be based around annual priorities meetings, at which DCLs, local authorities and their partners discuss local priorities in the context of national priorities and the action being taken to address areas of weakness and concern.

 Children of servicemen and women can face extra challenges in education, mainly because their parents&#039; redeployment leads to frequent changes of schools. A working group comprising head teachers from schools with significant numbers of children of service personnel, officials from the Ministry of Defence and the Department for Education and Skills, and the Children&#039;s Education Advisory Service (an MOD agency that supports service families) meets regularly to examine the needs of these children and identify possible solutions. Funding arrangements are in place to help schools manage high pupil mobility and local authorities are encouraged to use their funding flexibly to help service schools. DfES officials also work closely with Service Children&#039;s Education, an MOD agency responsible for forces schools abroad, to ensure that service children get the same education abroad that they would receive in this country. The school admissions code of practice advises admission authorities to take 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>2 Feb 2006 : Column 687W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
account of the needs of service families. Admission authorities can accept applications from parents returning to the area some months in advance and allocate a school place for when the family returns. In areas with a significant standing presence of service personnel, service representatives should be invited to join the admissions forum.

Accordingly we estimate the cost of implementing PPA time from September 2005 will add an additional 0.7 per cent. to the cost pressures on primary schools for 2006&#150;07&#151;and that has been added to the universal cost pressures on schools for 2006&#150;07 to give a Minimum Funding Guarantee (MFG) for nursery and primary schools of 4 per cent. for that year. The MFG figure for secondary and special schools will be set at 3.4 per cent. for 2006&#150;07.

 The 14-to-9 Education and Skills White Paper and the Implementation Plan (published December 2005) lay out detailed proposals for changes to the 14-to-19 curriculum. Key to these changes is the introduction of specialised diplomas, which will be available to young people from age 14, in 14 sector-related lines of learning. Specialised diplomas will provide young people with the skills and knowledge they need to progress into skilled employment, training and further or higher education; the diplomas will have a significant focus on applied learning. Employers are leading on the content development of the specialised diplomas, to ensure that these qualifications teach young people skills that have real currency in the labour market. The first five diplomas will be piloted from 2008; all 14 lines will be available from 2010, and there will be a national entitlement to a diploma course from 2013.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60202w19.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_61">The 14-to-19 Education and Skills White Paper also proposed a work-focused programme to motivate 14-to-16 year-olds with relatively low attainment, who are at serious risk of disaffection, building on the lessons of the Entry to Employment programme for 16-to-19 year-olds. Pilots are to start from 2006&#150;7, and the White Paper suggested a figure of up to 10,000 young people on the programme from 2007&#150;8.

The Young Apprentices programme, which provides an opportunity for 14-to-16 year olds to gain a taste of &#039;real work&#039; through two days a week (or equivalent) work experience, and to pursue qualifications that relate to particular occupational sectors, as well as following core national curriculum subjects, will continue to run. So too will the Increased Flexibility Programme, in which 14-to-16 year olds have the opportunity to study off-site at a college or training provider for one or two days a week throughout Key Stage 4. The pupils may work towards vocational and work related qualifications, and so develop their knowledge and understanding in a work context. GCSEs in vocational subjects will also continue to be offered: there are currently eight titles available, each of which is a double award. A further six titles are being developed; in some cases, these will be single, rather than double, awards.

<a name="stpa_62">In addition to these specific learning programmes, from September 2004 there has also been a statutory requirement for all pupils to undertake some work-related learning at Key Stage 4, through planned activity that uses the context of work to develop knowledge, skills and understanding useful for work.

 In August 2001 the Army Policy and Resources Committee authorised a review of the soldiers&#039; career structures. The review, known as the Non Commissioned Engagement and Career Study, reported its findings in November 2002 and recommended the introduction of a more flexible and efficient career structure for soldiers, that would meet the operational and administrative needs of the Army and the individual in the 21st century while enabling better use of those soldiers who wish to serve beyond a 22-year engagement. As a first step in November 2004 the longer career model (LCM) was introduced for the staff and personnel support branch of the Adjutant General&#039;s Corps offering the possibility of three-five years extension of service beyond the 22-year point. The LCM is also available to other cap badges and several are now actively investigating the feasibility of longer

Notes:<br>

1. The drop in registrations between September 1997 and September 1998 is mostly attributable to the reduction in re-registration period from two years to fifteen months.<br>

2. Most PDS schemes that have registrations have a re-registration period in excess of fifteen months, so the figures for PDS schemes are generally higher than they would have been for the same attendance pattern under CDS.<br>

3. Prison registrations are included in these figures.<br>

4. Salaried dentist registrations are not included in these figures.<br>

5. A dentist with a GDS or PDS contract may provide as little or as much NHS treatment as he or she chooses or agreed with the PCT.<br>

6. The Dental Practice Board has no information concerning the amount of time dedicated to NHS work by individual dentists.<br>

7. The areas have been defined using practice postcodes within the current boundaries.<br>

8. Areas have been defined using the Office of National Statistics All Fields Postcode Directory.<br>

9. Population data at constituency area are not available.<br>

<p>
1. The percentages of the population registered with a dentist (or registration rate) have been estimated by including patient registrations in the area of the dentist, that is, according to the postcode of the dental surgery and not the patient&#039;s address. So the registration rates for some areas may be affected by some patients receiving dental treatment in a different area from the one in which they live.




<br>&nbsp;<br><i>2 Feb 2006 : Column 721W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
2. Estimates have been calculated using population estimates for the nearest year for which data are available. Percentages for 2005 have been calculated using 2004 mid year population estimates.
3. Information on children registered with a dentist at constituency level is not available as a percentage of the total number of children in the constituency. This is due to population data not being available at constituency level.

1. 2005&#150;06 was the first year of operation of the HMCS inclusive of the magistrates courts. The figure shown here represents the latest delegated budget position.<br>

2. Prior to 2005&#150;06, DCA allocated funds to local authorities to cover only 80 per cent. of the funding of the Magistrates Courts Committees. The balance of funding came from the LA themselves and this figure is not reported above.<br>

3. Unification changes funded in 2005&#150;06 relating to harmonising of the magistrates courts into the central Government accounting framework. The key changes to the magistrates costs included 20 per cent. balance of funding from ODPM (&#163;87 million), capital charges introduced with the new resource accounting methodology applied to the magistrates element (&#163;73 million) and in addition there were also some DCA HQ departments transferred across into HMCS (&#163;24 million).<br>

4. Figures are shown in terms of net costs, i.e. after netting off any income from fees and fines. Capital spend is included within both comparators and depreciation is subtracted from the combined figures, with the exception of the magistrates courts which did not charge depreciation on the assets before 2005&#150;06. Note that estimated depreciation figures have been used.<br>

5. The 2004&#150;05 figures represent latest estimated provisional outturn and are subject to change.<br>

6. Figures for 1996&#150;97,1997&#150;98 and 1998&#150;99 have been drawn from previous years DCA departmental reports, which did not report on a Resourcing Accounting and Budgeting Stage 2 basis. Therefore we have attempted to put these figures.<br>

<a name="stpa_136">Information from the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (AIT) indicates that an immigration appeal, comprising both in-country and entry clearance cases, lodged between April 2004 and the end of March 2005 took an average of 54 weeks to be decided by an immigration adjudicator following the appeal being lodged with the Immigration and Nationality Directorate (IND) of the Home Office, either directly by the appellant or having being forwarded to IND from the entry clearance post.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60202w34.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_137">Provisional information for entry clearance appeals lodged after 4 April 2005, up to September 2005 only currently covers a low volume of appeals. It is therefore difficult to provide an accurately indicative figure for the average waiting times from appeal lodgement to a decision by an immigration judge for appeals lodged in this period. Accounting for the times allowed for the respondent to prepare the appeal bundle in entry clearance cases, it is expected that appeals are decided by an immigration judge approximately 27 or 35 weeks from the date of lodgement, dependent on the type of case. This includes time allowed for international transit of documents to and from the tribunal.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60202w34.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_138">The entry clearance appeals decided prior to the commencement of the AIT were lodged with the original decision maker in accordance with the procedure rules of the Immigration Appellate Authority (IAA), the appellate body subsequently replaced by the AIT. Once lodged the appeals were transferred to the IND for preparation before being forwarded to the IAA to be decided by an immigration adjudicator.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60202w34.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_139">With the commencement of the AIT entry clearance appeals can be lodged either directly to the AIT or with the relevant entry clearance post. Where an appeal is lodged with the relevant entry clearance post it must be endorsed and forwarded to the AIT as soon as reasonably practicable, and in any event within 10 days.

 The Home Office has performance management arrangements in place to measure the effectiveness of Community Safety Partnerships (CSPs) in Wales and Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships (CDRPs) in England. Under these arrangements, challenging targets for crime reduction have been agreed with each CSP and CDRP and the Home Office and Government Offices/Welsh Assembly Government regularly monitor progress against them. The Home Office and Government Offices/Welsh Assembly Government also work with partnerships to support them in monitoring or improving performance. The targets are to be delivered by 2007&#150;08.

 The National Offender Management Service (NOMS) engages with public, private and voluntary sector providers through a variety of channels. As a result some expressions of interest in providing future NOMS services have been received from all sectors. However these indications have been informal and non-specific in nature and therefore at this time, clarity as to the commercial and legal status of these organisations has not been obtained. In due course a more formal process will be undertaken, at which time it will be possible to be more specific, but in accordance with European Union procurement rules.

 The Home Office does, via the British Crime Survey (BCS), measure levels of violence against adults (ages 16 and over) in private households. The risks of being a victim of violence are published annually by age group for men and women. The most recent figures, based on the 2004&#150;05 BCS, showed that the overall risk of being a victim of violence was less than one per cent for both men and women aged 65 or over.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60202w34.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_141">The risk of becoming a victim of violent crime was 0.4 per cent. for men aged 65&#150;74, 0.2 per cent. for men aged 75 or over, 0.5 per cent. for women aged 65&#150;74, and 0.5 per cent. for women aged 75 or over. In terms of domestic violence, the 2004&#150;05 BCS indicates that the risk among men and women in these ages groups is low (0 per cent. and 0.1 per cent. among men and women aged 65&#150;74, respectively, and 0 per cent. for both men and women aged 75 and over).

<p>
<a name="60202w34.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_142">However, it is recognised that the core BCS measure of domestic violence may be an underestimate as some victims may be unwilling to report experience of domestic violence to an interviewer, and it does not cover adults living in institutions.
