<a name="30213w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Gareth Thomas: </B> 
To ask the Minister for the Cabinet Office what action he is taking to increase <i>(a)</i> graduate recruits, <i>(b)</i> recruits from the private sector and <i>(c)</i> recruits from the voluntary sector into the senior civil service; and if he will make a statement.  [97600]

<P>
<a name="30213w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Alexander: </B> 
 The Civil Service is committed to ensuring that it has the right skills and experience at all levels. The service does this both by developing its own staff and by bringing in talent from outside the service including the private and voluntary sectors. In 2001&#150;02 there were 200 posts at SCS level filled by open competition, up from 107 in 1998. Of these 77 (39 per cent.) were filled by civil servants, 86 (43 per cent.) from the broader public sector and 37 (18 per cent.) from the private sector. In addition, the service makes use of expertise from the private and voluntary sector through a programme of interchange, including at SCS level.
<P>

<a name="30213w01.html_para0">The service does not target graduates specifically for recruitment into the senior civil service since we are looking for those who have demonstrated the relevant skills and experience for the particular job. However, graduate recruitment exercises are run at lower levels of the service, both through individual Departments' schemes and the centrally-run fast stream graduate trainee scheme.

<a name="30213w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Beggs: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer whether Customs and Excise in Northern Ireland has received any additional Government funding since 1 April 2002.  [97009]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30213w01.html_spnew1"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 Since 1April 2002 additional funding has been made available to Customs to further enhance their efforts in Northern Ireland to help tackle oils fraud and to assure compliance with a range of other taxes including landfill tax, aggregates levy and the climate change levy.

 <i>[holding answer 11 February 2003]:</i> The information requested falls within the responsibility of the National Statistician. I have asked him to reply.
<P>

<a name="30213w01.html_para1"><i>Letter from L. Cook to Mr. Jonathon Djanogly, dated 13 February 2003:</i>
<P>

<a name="30213w01.html_para2">

<BR>
As National Statistician I have been asked to reply to your recent question concerning what percentage of total UK GDP was constituted by <i>(a)</i> business-to business transactions and <i>(b)</i> business-to-consumer transactions in (i) 2000, (ii) 2001 and (iii) 2002. (97236)
<BR>
The National Accounts do not separately identify business-to-business transactions or business-to-consumer transactions.
<BR>
In the National Accounts only business-to-business transactions on capital items are recorded in GDP. The concept that measures this in the National Accounts is business investment.
<BR>
Business-to-business transactions, non capital items or intermediate expenditure as it is defined in National Accounts, do not add to GDP as the expenditure and incomes in the buying and selling industries cancel out. The ONS publishes estimates of total intermediate expenditure for the corporate sector, the latest figure available is for 2000.
<BR>
The table below summarises the available data. Figures are expressed in billion at current prices or as percentages. First estimates for 2002 will be published on 26 February 2003.

 HM customs and excise does not collate figures for convictions for diversion frauds separately from other prosecutions, and therefore these figures are not readily available. In relation to diversions of goods that originated from London City Bond between 1995 and 1998 during the use of the informants there, I refer to my answers to the hon.

 <i>[holding answer 11 February 2003]:</i> The proceeds from the sale of part of the United Kingdom's gold holdings, between 6 July 1999 and 6 March 2002, were invested in interest-bearing foreign currency assets in broadly the same proportion as currently held in the net foreign currency reserves (40 per cent. dollars; 40 per cent. euros; 20 per cent. yen). Further information on the investment policy for the foreign currency reserves is detailed in the Exchange Equalisation Account Financial Accounts 2001&#150;02 published on 16 January 2003 (HC 258 Session 2002&#150;03).

 <i>[holding answer 11 February 2003]:</i> The investment policy for the net foreign currency reserves is detailed in the Exchange Equalisation Account Financial Accounts 2001&#150;02 published on 16 January 2003 (HC 258 Session 2002&#150;03). Prior to the decision in 1999 to restructure the reserves portfolio the Bank of England provided advice on the portfolio risks associated with gold and other assets. These portfolio risk issues, and the broader rationale for the restructuring of the reserves portfolio, are discussed in HM Treasury's "Review of the Sale of Part of the UK Gold Reserves" (October 2002)-copies of this document have been placed in the House of Commons Library and it is also available on the Treasury's website-http://www. hm-treasury.gov.uk/media//9EFEF/GoldReserves.PDF.

<P>

<a name="30213w02.html_para3">As my hon. Friend knows from his longstanding interest in this topic, rights of access are not the only benefits secured for the public by undertakings under the conditional exemption scheme, and the access provided by such undertakings has never been restricted to the matters covered by the Countryside and Rights of Way Act, where it applies. The Inland Revenue and their heritage advisers take full account of the Act's potential application in determining what undertakings they will regard as giving reasonable public access. They find that the conditional exemption scheme is able to secure greater and/or better quality opportunities for access than those afforded by the Countryside and Rights of Way Act, and they will continue to seek such added benefits.

<UL>(2) how many reservists are working in the NHS <i>(a)</i> as doctors, <i>(b)</i> as nurses, <i>(c)</i> as paramedics and <i>(d)</i> in professions allied to medicine.  [93029]
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30213w03.html_spnew10"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 Reservists are not usually required to provide details of any civilian employment to the Ministry of Defence until such time as they are called-out. Historically, therefore, no central records have been maintained by the MOD of the numbers of reservists working in the NHS as doctors, nurses, paramedics and other professionals allied to medicine. Although the MOD encourages reservists to declare their reserve status to civilian employers, there is no legal requirement to do so unless specified in individual contracts of employment. The call-out papers sent to reservists require them to advise the MOD of their civilian employer, and to pass to their employer documents relating to their call-out, including a form for the employer to return to the MOD acknowledging the call-out.
<P>

<a name="30213w03.html_para5">Information is not available centrally on the civilian employment of medical reservists called-out for service in the event of military action against Iraq. However, some medical reservists who have been issued with call-out papers had previously declared their civilian employment. As at 6 February, 345 medical reservists in the Volunteer Reserve Forces had been sent call-out papers, and of these, 194 are understood to be working in the NHS. In addition, 182 medical ex-regular Royal Air Force personnel with a reserve liability have been sent call-out papers but information on their civilian employment is not currently available.
<P>

<a name="30213w03.html_para6">NHS hospital trusts would be informed by reservists of their call-out when they receive their call-out papers. The MOD will work with the Department of Health to minimise disruption to the NHS as far as possible.

 In the event of military operations, we would as always, take great care to minimise civilian casualties. This Government take very seriously their responsibility to act within the framework of international law regulating international conflict. Saddam Hussein of course has no such scruples, as he demonstrated when he used chemical weapons against his own people.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence <i>(a)</i> what role is planned for British field hospitals in Iraq and <i>(b)</i> what preparations have been made for such hospitals to receive civilian casualties of all nationalities in the event of hostilities in Iraq.  [97769]

<P>
<P>
<a name="30213w03.html_spnew12"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The purpose of British field hospitals is to provide hospital equivalent support to United Kingdom forces and their military allies and to meet the requirements of The Hague and Geneva Conventions in the provision of medical support for wounded prisoners of war. They are therefore equipped and manned to support this role.

<a name="30213w03.html_para9">There has been no decision to take military action against Iraq. Saddam Hussein might still comply with the demands of the international community although

No United Kingdom forces have been committed to any military action against Iraq and there is still time for Saddam to comply fully with UNSCR 1441 and avoid disarmament by force.

The strength of internal association shown between reports of ill health and both the extent and current status of dipping activities underlines the importance of the Government funded epidemiological and mechanistic research studies currently underway;

the variable quality of the data submitted to the SARSS, together with the inherent nature of data from a passive monitoring system, prevented firmer conclusions being drawn; and

 Dairy farmers in the north-west, in common with the rest of the country, benefit indirectly from the Dairy CAP, which involves expenditure of nearly two billion euros across the Community. Despite this considerable expenditure, the farmgate price of milk remains below the level at which many dairy farmers can make the investment required to sustain their businesses. This clearly shows the current Dairy CAP is failing farmers and is in need of reform. The UK Government do not regard the Commission proposals for dairy reform in the context of the Mid Term Review to go far enough to address those concerns.

 Defra's stakeholder group will be meeting regularly to discuss implementation issues and develop agreed approaches to communicating the key messages of the directive. The Environment Agency is also developing a public participation strategy for the implementation of the directive through river basin management plans.

 Operational responsibility for flood measures rests with the local operating authorities, normally the Environment Agency (EA) and local councils, who decide which projects to promote and their timing. This Department provides grants for flood and coastal defence capital works and associated studies, which meet essential technical, economic and environmental criteria and achieve an appropriate priority score.

 The Environment Agency (EA) receives the bulk of its funding for management of flood risk through levies on local authorities which are largely reimbursed by central Government through the ODPM's funding stream to local authorities. Defra provides grant aid to the flood and coastal defence operating authorities (EA, local authorities and internal drainage boards) to support their capital works and related studies in the management of risk from flooding and coastal erosion. In the case of the EA, additional contributions are made to support national initiatives such as the flood warning public awareness campaign, the national flood and coastal defence database and catchment flood management plans.

 We believe there are overall environmental and commercial benefits in a deposit and return system for bottles. A deposits system would involve the public directly in waste collection and this would help to change the culture of waste collection and recycling.
<P>

<a name="30213w08.html_para0">We are currently investigating deposit systems used in other European countries. Some of these countries have reported very high administrative costs, which could make these schemes a more expensive way of recycling products than other collection methods. Some countries have reported benefits from such systems, particularly in terms of higher recycling rates, but sometimes these occur in the countries which have high packaging waste recycling targets and it is not clear that deposit systems on their own would deliver high recycling rates in a cost-effective way.
<P>

<a name="30213w08.html_para1">We would therefore need to consider both the costs and benefits of a deposit scheme. We would also have to examine how deposit systems could complement and add to other means of encouraging waste minimization and recycling, such as the packaging regulations.

<i>[holding answer 12 February 2003]:</i> The Landfill Tax Credit Scheme (LTCS) transition scheme announced by my right hon. Friend the Economic Secretary to the Treasury on 3 February 2003 is now open for applications from those projects that consider they meet the criteria set out in the statement. Funding is available to meet all eligible applications. The regulator of LTCS, Entrust, will also administer this scheme and further information is available on the Entrust website at www.entrust.org.uk In implementing this transitional funding arrangement, the Government are putting in place a straightforward process for making decisions on funding to ensure minimum delay and uncertainty for on-going projects. Also, by establishing this transitional funding period the Government are providing a reasonable period for projects to manage the consequences of the decision announced in the Pre-Budget Report.

<a name="30213w08.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The UK National Aviation Security Programme does not specifically require airlines to ask passengers to prove their identity, and while all measures are kept under review, there is no present intention that it should do so. The primary measures which underpin security in this area is that all passengers, all items of hand baggage and all items of hold baggage must be screened, and that airlines must ensure that the person who checks in hold baggage is the same person who subsequently boards the aircraft. We do not specify how airlines should achieve this, instead allowing them flexibility. On international flights where passports are carried, airlines usually use these to confirm identity. On domestic flights, and those to the Republic of Ireland where there is no need to carry a passport, airlines adopt a variety of methods to ensure that those who check hold baggage then travel with it.

<a name="30213w08.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The Air Travel Reserve Fund was wound up in 1986 and its functions were transferred to the Air Travel Trust Fund (ATTF). The ATTF provides a back-up facility to the Air Travel Organisers' Licensing (ATOL) scheme, should a bond held by an ATOL holder be insufficient to meet customer claims in the event of that company's financial failure. Taken together, the ATOL scheme and the ATTF cover air tickets sold by an ATOL holder, either as part of a package or on a seat-only basis. Air tickets sold directly by airlines or their ticketing agents are not covered, but some purchasers may be protected when a credit card is used. In the event of failure of an ATOL holder, the Civil Aviation Authority will ensure that those abroad at the time will be able to continue their holidays and return home, and will reimburse those who have paid for their holiday but have yet to travel.

 A review of the Blue Badge Scheme has recently been concluded. The review considered all aspects of the scheme, including the eligibility criteria. Following initial discussions with the main stakeholders, a discussion paper was drawn up and comments were invited through a major public consultation exercise. Formal representations were made by the Thalidomide Trust and their views were given due consideration during the review process.
<P>

<a name="30213w10.html_para2">The Disabled Persons Transport Advisory Committee (DPTAC, the Department's statutory advisers on the transport needs of disabled people) were asked to look at the responses received and to submit their recommendations to Ministers.

<P>

<a name="30213w10.html_para3">Eligibility for the Blue Badge will remain unchanged. This means that it will continue to be available to those disabled people who are unable or virtually unable to walk and to those with severe upper limb disabilities. Many people whose disability is the result of Thalidomide already qualify under one or other of these criteria.

 In its debates on the Communications Bill, Standing Committee E sat for 65 hours over 26 sittings. The original programme resolution for the Committee's proceedings was agreed by the Programming Sub-Committee at its meeting on 9 December 2002. This was approved without division at the beginning of the Committee's first session on 10 December 2002.
<P>

<a name="30213w11.html_para2">On two occasions during the Bill's passage through Committee, Programming Sub-Committee resolutions to move knives were agreed. This enabled hon. Members to focus on clauses of the Bill that they felt merited more detailed discussion. As a result of the agreed programme, the knives led to 101 clauses and five Schedules being moved forthwith by the Chair. It is worth noting, however, that, just because a clause was not reached by the Committee, it does not mean that substantive points on that clause were not raised and debated in full during earlier debates.

 The Community Fund has made 188 grants to the value of &#163;13,516,037 to organisations directly involved in work relating to cancer. The Fund has awarded a further &#163;23,651,116 to hospices whose client group will include people with cancer.

 Since the launch of the National Lottery, &#163;13.9 billion has been raised for the good causes. Camelot was awarded the second licence as operator of the National Lottery in January 2002. The National Lottery Commission continues to have the duty to ensure that the National Lottery is properly run and that players are protected, while maximising the money raised for the good causes. We published a consultation document last year about the way in which the Lottery might be run and regulated in future; and my right hon.

We do not collect data on access to child care places specifically for this group of children. Local authorities' 2002&#150;03 early years development and child care plans showed that, in April 2001, 12.3 places were available per hundred children aged 0&#150;14 (or 0&#150;16 with special educational needs) in wards other than the 20 per cent. most disadvantaged wards, higher than the 7.6 places per hundred children in the 20 per cent. most disadvantaged wards.

<i>Note:</i><P>

These figures have been rounded to the nearest 100.<P>

These figures were published in Statistical Bulletin 08/01 "Children's Day Care Facilities at 31 March 2001", a copy of which is available from the Library. An electronic copy of the bulletin is available on the Department's website www.dfes.gov.uk/statistics.<P>

During the period 1997 to 2001 total child care places have increased. The returns from local authorities have shown year on year increases in the numbers of day nurseries, out of school clubs and holiday schemes. However, the numbers of playgroups and child minders have been declining. Many playgroups are converting to full day care and this means that they are re-classified as day nurseries rather than playgroups. The Department is encouraging this conversion by offering assistance to playgroups to extend their services to full day care in order to meet more parents' needs.<P>

In practice, this means that there is ongoing dialogue between the Scottish Executive and Government Departments, including the Scotland Office. For this reason it is impossible to determine at whose initiative discussions about the use of the Sewell convention begin, as they usually take place in the context of wider and on-going discussions.
<P>

<a name="30213w13.html_para0">As a matter of principle, either the Government or the Scottish Executive can take the initiative in establishing whether Sewel consent is needed. It is for the Scottish Executive to indicate the view of the Scottish Parliament and to take whatever steps are appropriate to ascertain that view. The Scottish Parliament has agreed to 39 Sewell motions since its inception.

<a name="30213w13.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Bob Ainsworth: </B> 
 In addition to the stringent requirements in the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 regarding the use of non-human primates, the use of wild-caught non-human primates in scientific experiments is subject to supplementary additional considerations.
<P>

<a name="30213w13.html_para4">We announced in 1997 that we cannot foresee any circumstances under which we would be prepared to issue licences under the 1986 Act for programmes of work involving the use of Great Apes (chimpanzees, pygmy chimpanzees, gorillas and orang-utans), and that exceptional justification would be required for the licensed use of other types of non-human primates taken from the wild.
<P>

<a name="30213w13.html_para5">The 1986 Act provides that non-human primates, whether captive bred or wild-caught, can only be used when no other species are suitable for the purposes of the programme to be specified in the licence, or that it is not practicable to obtain animals of any other species that are suitable for those purposes. For the use of wild-caught primates to be exceptionally authorised, there must be no appropriate alternative, no suitable captive-bred animals available and the likely benefits of the programme of work would have to fully justify their use.
<P>

<a name="30213w13.html_para6">In respect of applications to use wild-caught non-human primates, the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Inspectorate and the Animal Procedures Committee provide advice on a case by case basis on whether and on what terms such use should be licensed. Application of these stringent criteria has meant that first time use of wild-caught non-human primates in scientific procedures has not been licensed in the UK for some years.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many National Hi-Tech Crime Unit staff will <i>(a)</i> be dedicated to the policing of internet chatrooms, <i>(b)</i> have the priority of protection of children on the internet and <i>(c)</i> have specific training in dealing with child protection law; and what the framework for liaison between the internet crime squad child protection team and other police units will be.

 <i>[holding answer 12 February 2003]:</i> We set up the National Hi-Tech Crime Unit (NHTCU) as part of the National Crime Squad to combat national and transnational hi-tech crime within or which impacts upon the UK.This includes investigation of hacking, virus writing, extortion, fraud, drug trafficking and organised paedophilia.

It also includes those persons profiting from the commercial exploitation of on line child abuse, through the provision of pay for view child pornography.
<P>

<a name="30213w15.html_para1">This specific technical role augments the policing provision for child protection by the National Crime Squad, National Criminal Intelligence Service and forces.

<P>

<a name="30213w15.html_para3"><i>(b)</i> Approximately 25 per cent of NHTCU resources are engaged in the investigation of child abuse on-line. This equates to ten members of law enforcement and support staff encompassing intelligence, investigation and forensic examination roles.
<P>

<a name="30213w15.html_para4"><i>(c)</i> NHTCU investigators have received training from clinical psychologists in relation to the investigation of offences of child abuse on line.

 <i>[holding answer 30 January 2003]:</i> Under the regime of resource accounting introduced by the Government in April 2001, Departments now account for their expenditure in terms of when resources are consumed, rather than when cash is paid. Thus, the Department now budgets for the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme in terms of the amount of compensation committed in any particular year rather than simply the amount of cash expended in that year.

Some &#163;54 million of these payments related to awards offered in 2001&#150;02 which score against the resource budget for that year.<P>

It is not readily possible to say how much was offered in each month of the current financial year but not yet paid out because, for example, some applicants decide to appeal against the award offered. However, as at 31 December 2002, some &#163;2.4 million worth of awards was due to be paid within 28 days, awards on offer amounted to &#163;26.3 million, and other contingent liabilities amounted to &#163;6.9 million.<P>

The general prison population contains a large number of prisoners with a combination of psychiatric disorders, alcohol and drug dependency, family background and relationship problems, histories of self-harm and previous abuse, all of which raise their risk of suicide and self-harm.Good care and support from staff saves many lives but such instances go largely unreported. The Prison Service's approach, in close partnership with other agencies such as the Youth Justice Board, and outside organisations such as Samaritans, is to better identify and support those who seem at greatest risk, with an approach that focuses on staff/prisoner relationships and the physical environment.<P>

The Prison Service is currently developing a new suicide prevention and self-harm reduction policy through a programme of projects that aim to improve pre-reception, reception and induction arrangements; the exchange of information; the care of prisoners; detoxification; prisoners supporting each other, and learning from investigations into deaths in custody.<P>

The Government has also committed $200 million over five years to the Global Trust Fund to fight AIDS, TB and Malaria.

 In March 2002, the Council for Registered Gas Installers (CORGI) gave advice solely to the Health and Safety Executive (HSE). On 21 March the CORGI Chief Executive wrote to advise HSE about how it proposed to deal with Transco's application for renewal of its registration from 1 April 2002. CORGI stated their view that the Rules for Registration needed to be applied equitably to all CORGI registered businesses and that to make an exception to these in the case of Transco would have been inappropriate. CORGI gave no advice to Ministers at that time.
<P>

<a name="30213w20.html_para0">CORGI advised that they had decided to re-register Transco with effect from 1 April 2002 but only for work undertaken by the 325 engineers then holding either unexpired certificates of competence issued under the Health and Safety Commission's Approved Code of Practice (AcoP) or certificates under the Nationally Accredited Certification Scheme (ACS). Throughout the remainder of the year the registration progressively covered the work of additional engineers as they completed training and assessment under the newly-introduced National Vocational Qualification which is aligned, for gas safety issues, with the ACS. As at 16 January 2003 the registration covered a total of 2,707 engineers holding valid certificates of competence for emergency service work.

 No such assessment has been made. The migration of benefit payment to ACT begins this year and the Post Office's strategy is to respond to that challenge with a range of banking and other services. How the migration of benefit payments affects the revenue of post offices will depend on a number of factors, not least how benefit recipients and other post office customers respond to change. The income from the various contracts Post Office Ltd. has with the spending Departments and various financial institutions, and the remuneration of sub-postmasters for banking services, is a commercial matter between the parties.

 Firms generally cease trading as the result of a combination of factors, including increases in costs.

 The Government have not made estimates for the contribution that onshore and offshore wind farms will make to our overall electricity generation over the next 10 years. The Government's target for renewable energy is that, by 2010, 10 per cent. of electricity should be supplied from sources eligible under the Renewables Obligation. While we expect both onshore and offshore wind to make a substantial contribution to this target, no specific targets have been set in relation to the contribution of any particular form of renewable energy to the overall 10 per cent. target.

 District councils in Northern Ireland came under a statutory duty to undertake air quality assessment and management only with the recent enactment of the Environment (Northern Ireland) Order 2002. The Order requires district councils to identify areas where air quality standards are not likely to be achieved within specified timescales and to draw up action plans setting out the proposals they, and other relevant authorities, have for the reduction of air pollution levels in those areas.
<P>

<a name="30213w21.html_para0">However, in anticipation of the new legislation, all 26 district councils had voluntarily completed an initial screening of pollution sources having a significant impact within the district council area in order to identify pollutants of concern locally. As a consequence, all 26 district councils are now engaged in a more detailed assessment of the pollutants identified in the initial screening. No district council has yet reached the stage of drawing up air quality action plans.
<P>

<a name="30213w21.html_para1">To assist with the review and assessment process, the Department of the Environment has provided grant-aid of some &#163;l million to district councils in the 2001&#150;02 and current financial years.

The Department also proposes in the near future to issue for consultation a policy guidance paper designed to assist district councils, and other relevant authorities, to meet their air quality management obligations.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30213w21.html_spnew2"><B> Angela Smith: </B> 
 There are no measures aimed specifically at introducing low emission vehicles specifically into airport operations within Northern Ireland. In broader terms, there are national polices in place to reduce emissions from vehicles generally, such as the Powershift programme, administered by the Energy Saving Trust. This programme was established in order to stimulate the market for clean fuel vehicles in the UK. Financial support is available under the programme to help with the purchase of vehicles which are proven to offer emissions benefits and which have shown to be technically viable.
<P>

<a name="30213w21.html_para3">In addition, the European Auto-Oil programme has introduced tighter European vehicle emission and fuel quality standards. These are reflected in the Air Quality Strategy for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The key elements of the programme are:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>stringent emission standards for cars and light vans, which applied to all new vehicles sold from 1 January 2000 (known as Euro 111 standards);

<P>
<BR>
tighter fuel quality specifications which applied to all petrol and diesel sold from 1 January 2000, with a further tightening of the specification to apply from 1 January 2005; and
<P>
<BR>
a ban on general marketing of leaded petrol since 1 January 2000.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="30213w21.html_para4">A further element of the Auto-Oil programme established a more stringent emissions standard for heavy-duty diesel engines from 2000.

The draft Order will also introduce the possibility of custodial sentences, for those found guilty of an offence, of up to six months on summary conviction and up to two years on conviction on indictment. The draft order was laid at Westminster on 16 January 2003, and was debated in the House of Commons Select Committee on 4 February 2003. The draft order is due to be debated in the House of Lords on 13 February 2003 and, subject to Lords' agreement it is expected that it will be taken at the February Privy Council meeting.

<a name="30213w23.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 Information about Burmese political prisoners is hard to obtain and often incomplete. My latest information is that there are 18 MPs-elect currently detained on political grounds in Burma. The prison sentences quoted are often only arbitrary figures. It is common for prisoners to be kept detained long after their notional sentences have expired. Many political prisoners are also detained even when suffering serious ill-health.

<a name="30213w23.html_para1">Of the MPs listed, U Doe Htaung and U Khin Maung Swe have each served more than their seven year term but have still not been released. And U Kyaw San, Dr. Than Nyein, Daw May Win Myint, U Ohn Maung, U Sein Hla Oo, and U Toe Po all have serious health problems.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what information he has collated about the number of British tourists who visited Burma in each of the past two financial years.  [97252]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30213w23.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 It is our policy not to encourage tourism to Burma. We have drawn to the attention of travel organisations the views of the Burmese democratic opposition that tourism is inappropriate at present due to the political and human rights situation there. As part of this policy, Burmese tourism officials are included in the European Union visa ban and asset freeze.
<P>

<a name="30213w23.html_para4">HMG does not have figures for the final destination of those who travel from the UK. Official Burmese figures, which are often unreliable, indicate that 8,424 UK visitors passed through Rangoon in 2001 and 8,620 in 2002. However these figures include all categories of visitors, including UK passport holders of Burmese origin who are visiting family members.

<a name="30213w23.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Burstow: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs pursuant to his answer of 9 January, <i>Official Report,</i> column 351W, on Capita, if he will give the <i>(a)</i> start and finish date, <i>(b)</i> value, <i>(c)</i> evaluation mechanism for successful delivery and <i>(d)</i> penalty charges for failure to deliver for each contract; whether penalty charges have been incurred; what the service level agreements were; what the contract numbers were; and if he will make a statement.  [97339]

<P>
<a name="30213w23.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Rammell: </B> 
 Our two contracts with Capita relate to staff recruitment services. One is for the recruitment of administrative assistants (contract PC-R l/00)and the other for the recruitment of specialist staff (contract PC-R 2/00). The value of the contracts over their lifetime is estimated at &#163;917,000 and &#163;1.06 million respectively, &#163;861,000 of which is taken up by expenditure on advertising.
<P>

<a name="30213w23.html_para5">Both contracts commenced on 1 November 2000 and will end on 31 October 2003. They comprise a number of separate recruitment campaigns and we routinely assess performance after each one has been completed. No arrangements for penalty charges are included in the contracts, but we have the option to terminate them if the company were to default on its commitments. Performance levels to date have been satisfactory.

In addition, the International Energy Agency stands ready to take action if the need arises&#151;for example, on the occurrence of a significant supply disruption&#151;including co-ordinating a release of oil stocks by its members.

The BBC World Service could only provide figures for 1995&#150;96 and 1996&#150;97 at disproportionate cost.<P>

These figures cover the usual consulting roles e.g. for advising on options and feasibility in the initial stages of a project. They exclude the cost of whole projects being implemented by outside consultants e.g. Cap Gemini/Ernst Young who are main contractors for the installation of the FCO's PRISM project.<P>

So far as the FCO is concerned, the vast majority of expenditure is associated with our major Information Communications Technology (ICT) and Estate construction programmes. Consultants have also advised on legal, financial and personnel issues and provided support in areas where we have skills shortages. Increasing expenditure over the last three years is 



associated with the growth of our ICT programme which is being used to support business change. Such projects include FTN, a new global telecommunications network and PRISM, a new integrated management information system covering finance, personnel, procurement and payroll.<P>

<a name="30213w25.html_para8">The Government want to see improved opportunities for vulnerable young people in local community projects involving leisure, the creative arts and sporting activities. The Government encourage councils to form partnerships between the Quality Protects programme and other local projects in the community to make sure that this happens. A key Quality Protects principle is to listen and take account of the views of young people in the design, delivery, and evaluation of services.

<a name="30213w26.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. McCartney: </B> 
 The only circumstances in which a member can benefit from the protected rights part of their pension fund before age 60, is where the trustees or managers of an occupational scheme are satisfied that the member has a life expectancy of 12 months or less. However, the Green Paper, "Simplicity, security and choice: Working and saving for retirement" (Cm 5677) published on 17 December 2003, includes a proposal to lower the age restriction on protected rights so that they may be taken at the same time as other rights. On the same date, the Government published "Simplifying the taxation of pensions: increasing choice and flexibility for all" which proposes to extend to personal/stakeholder pensions the provision allowing benefits to be taken early in the case of serious ill health.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. The estimates presented show expenditure by equivalised income deciles based on 'Households Below Average Income' (HBAI) for the financial year 2000&#150;01. The series is derived from the Family Resources Survey which does not include Northern Ireland. The latest year for which data are available is 2000&#150;01.<P>

2. The estimates are presented both for income Before Housing Costs (BHC) and for income After Housing Costs (AHC), in line with HBAI conventions. Households are assigned to income deciles according to their income including all benefits.<P>

3. All results are estimates, and may be affected by sampling error, reporting error and any differences between groups in their willingness to respond to the Family Resources Survey. Results are presented as percentages; estimates of total expenditure, by benefit, from this survey may not match actual expenditure.<P>

4. Housing and community charge/council tax benefit figures are total amounts paid to beneficiaries, irrespective of the source of funding. Therefore the figures include benefit spending reimbursed by DWP, spending on rent rebates financed within local authorities' Housing Revenue Accounts, benefit spending financed from local authorities' general funds, and benefit spending within the National Asylum Support Service budget.<P>

5. Retirement pension and MIG are shown together as the latter may be misreported as the former, in the Family Resources Survey.<P>

6. In accordance with HBAI methodology, no allowance has been made for any extra costs facing disabled people, when assigning their households to an income decile.<P>

<sup>(28)</sup> Figures for 1997&#150;99 reflect the finding of the Chief Adjudicator Officer, who was responsible for reporting on standards of decision making in the Department.

<P>

In addition, under DMA legislation, the Secretary of State now has a legal obligation to report on the standards of decision making in the Department for Work and Pensions. The Secretary of State's first DMA report was for the year 2000&#150;01. He reported that 57 per cent. of child benefit decisions were correct. For child benefit, this report was concerned only with the decision making process, not with the outcome&#151;accuracy of payment. It is quite possible for there to have been a technical error in the process but for the payment to be entirely correct. This applies with particular regard to evidence, in particular the retention of original documents required by the monitors when checking decisions made on review.<P>

Decisions resulting from such reviews were classed as errors regardless of whether the award itself is correct. Figures for 2001&#150;02 have not yet been reported but indications are that around 77 per cent. of decisions were correct, again reflecting a DMA monitoring specification that concentrated on the process and not on the outcome&#151;payment accuracy. For 2002&#150;03, the DMA monitoring specification closely aligns the process and payment accuracy to give a more realistic indication of decision-making standards. Emerging findings indicate an accuracy level of 99.6 per cent. for 2002&#150;03.<P>

All offices which process child maintenance applications now have access to the new IT system. It is being used to process a small proportion of cases on the basis of existing rules. No offices are directly involved in testing the application of the new rules.

You ask how many driving licences have been removed from non-resident parents for failure to pay child support to parents with care since this measure was introduced; and what the date was in each case.
<BR>
There have been 2 non-resident parents who have been disqualified from driving for failure to pay child support. The intention of the relevant legislation is however to use the existence of this power to encourage more parents to meet this responsibility with out a court appearance. I believe that it is having this beneficial effect.

 The Department treats very seriously any suspicion of misuse of computer systems by staff and takes firm action in any cases that arise. All such cases, if proven, result in disciplinary action being taken against the offender leading to either a disciplinary penalty or dismissal. In addition over the last five years three members of staff have been prosecuted for computer misuse offences.

 Whenever possible, we take the opportunity to exchange views with European Union counterparts on the challenges of ageing populations to employment strategy, social protection and social inclusion. The principal discussions in this area have been on the effect of demographic changes on the sustainability of pension systems where we regularly take the opportunity to exchange views with European Union counterparts on respective national approaches to pensions issues. The Lisbon European Council in March 2000 identified this as a significant issue in the context of its programme for economic reform. The United Kingdom has contributed to the voluntary exchange of information and good practice by member States within a framework of common objectives covering adequacy, financial sustainability and modernisation agreed during the Swedish Presidency of the EU.

<a name="30213w28.html_para3">As part of this process the European Commission publiched a Draft Joint report on Adequate and Sustainable Pensions in December 2002 based on national contributions. The draft Joint Report is due for adoption at the Employment and Social Afairs and Ecofin Councils on 6 and 7 March 2003, prior to presentation to Heads of Government at the Spring Council.

 The Department for Work and Pensions came into being on 1 April 2001. Consequently, there are no comparable figures prior to this date. The final provision for 2002&#150;03 has yet to receive parliamentary approval and therefore a comparison with expenditure for 2001&#150;02 cannot be made. The current expenditure plans of the Department for Work and Pensions are contained in Tables 1 to 11 of the Departmental Report, "The Government Expenditure Plans 2002&#150;03 to 2003&#150;04" (Command 5424).

 The Control of Asbestos at Work Regulations 2002, which have recently been made, will from 21 May 2004, place a new duty on those who manage asbestos in non-domestic premises. This includes independent schools. It requires them: to assess whether those premises contain asbestos; to assess the risk from asbestos; and to take action to manage the risk from asbestos. The duty does not specifically require a survey. However, if duty holders decide, as part of their assessment and management process, that a survey is necessary, and that they need independent expertise, the Health and Safety Executive publishes guidance on verifying the competence of a surveyor.

 Increasing the basic state pension for older pensioners would not target resources on those who are most in need. While it is true that older pensioners tend to be poorer on average, income inequality is far more pronounced across the whole pensioner population than between pensioners of different ages. For example, the median net income of the richest fifth of pensioner couples is around four times that of the poorest fifth.

 The Department does not hold data on worker exposure to tobacco smoke in the way requested. In a 2001 survey on smoking behaviour and attitudes undertaken by the Office for National Statistics, 47 per cent. of the workers questioned said that there was a ban on smoking in their workplace. This survey also revealed that 38 per cent. of workers had smoking restricted to designated areas in their workplace, and 6 per cent. of workers worked alone. Nine per cent. of workers in this survey reported that there were no smoking restrictions at all in their workplace.

Each person needs to decide where the balance between current and future needs lies for them. There will be times in many people's lives when they cannot afford both to contribute to a pension and meet their current needs, but it is important that people save when they can afford to do so.

 The Government do not consider that there will necessarily be any impact on the clean-up costs of previously developed land arising from the water framework directive. The standard for clean-up under both the contaminated land provisions of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 and the planning system is the removal of unacceptable risk, so as to make a site suitable for its existing and future uses respectively. This will ensure that all receptors of potential discharges from a site are protected, including humans, surface and groundwater, flora, fauna and buildings. This approach is already advised in draft planning technical advice for England, which was issued for consultation in February 2002 and which will be

Three written representations were also received from Havering during consultation on the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's proposals.

 Recruitment and retention is a key part of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's capacity building programme for local government.

<P>

<a name="30213w32.html_para4">As well as recruitment, it is equally important that local government employees get the support to encourage them to stay. In collaboration with Warwick University, the EO will run a number of support programmes for aspiring middle and senior managers. A new accelerated development programme based on the Civil Service's "Fast Stream" scheme will provide support to staff aiming for senior management positions through the key stages of their career.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister when he plans to publish a response to the consultation exercise on the effectiveness of planning enforcement; and what process will follow.  [97641]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30213w32.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is currently considering the 482 responses received to the "Review of the Planning Enforcement System in England" consultation paper. We will be making an announcement on our conclusions and how we intend to take them forward as soon as possible.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30213w32.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Hoban: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what methodology is used to count the number of rough sleepers; when the last count took place; and how many rough sleepers there were in <i>(a)</i> Portsmouth, <i>(b)</i> Southampton and <i>(c)</i> Fareham at that date.  [94923]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30213w32.html_spnew7"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 Guidance was first published in 1996 on counting methodology developed in partnership with charities and voluntary organisations helping people sleeping rough. Independent evaluation has confirmed that the methodology remains the most robust method for measuring relative levels of rough sleeping and of change over time.
<P>

<a name="30213w32.html_para7">Local authorities are responsible for ensuring that the counts are undertaken and that the methodology is followed. The snapshot counts should take place on a single night, between 12 am and 6 am. The definition of people who should be included in rough sleeper counts is clearly set out in the guidance. It is: people sleeping, or bedded down, in the open air (such as on the streets, or in doorways, parks or bus shelters); people in buildings or other places not designed for habitation (such as barns, sheds, car parks, cars, derelict boats, or stations). Guidance is also given on the appropriate timing of rough sleeper counts&#151;which will depend on the level of rough sleeping reported and on local circumstances.




<P>
<P><I>13 Feb 2003 : Column 971W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="30213w32.html_para8">Portsmouth last carried out a count in May 2002 and found one rough sleeper; Southampton last carried out a count in November 2001 and found six rough sleepers; and Fareham last carried out a count in February 1998 and found 13 rough sleepers. Since 1998, Fareham has reduced its numbers of rough sleepers and in the Housing Investment Programme return, July 2002, returned an estimate of 0&#150;10.

<a name="30213w32.html_wqn8"><B> Vera Baird: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister when he will announce a housing market renewal pathfinder project in the Tees Valley.  [97216]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30213w32.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is promoting a new, long-term approach to tackling housing low demand and abandonment. Nine pathfinders have been identified, focused on the areas most acutely affected. Although we are not seeking to establish further pathfinders at this time, in our action programme, "Sustainable Communities: building for the future", we explained that we would use the lessons learned from the pathfinders to help all areas with declining demand to tackle the problems better.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30213w33.html_wqn0"><B> Harry Cohen: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister if he will establish a special fund for the allocation of resources to the most affected local authorities for dealing with fly tipping, tyres, obsolete refrigerators and abandoned cars; and if he will make a statement.  [94517]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30213w33.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="30213w33.html_para0">The Government do not have any plans to establish a fund specifically targeted at local authorities most affected by fly tipping of tyres, since this would be against the polluter pays principle and may create a perverse incentive for people to fly tip tyres safe in the knowledge that the public purse will fund any clearance. However, the Environment Agency has set up the Tyre Watch campaign to help tackle the problem of fly tipped tyres and to support a sustainable recovery and disposal system. The DTI is also exploring alternative routes for disposing of tyres, given the forthcoming ban from disposal to landfill under the Landfill Directive.
<P>

<a name="30213w33.html_para1">We have provided additional finance of &#163;46 million to local authorities to cover their costs of disposing of refrigerators. Also, interim funding has been agreed for local authorities to help with the implementation of the End of Life Vehicles Directive, which may lead to an increase in levels of abandoned cars. The DTI will meet the additional costs and have secured three years funding (&#163;25 million for 2003&#150;04, 2004&#150;05 and 2005&#150;06) which was agreed in Spending Review 2002.

 On 31 December 1997, our records showed that there were 26,018 magistrates in England and Wales excluding the Duchy of Lancaster (where the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster is responsible for appointments). On 1 April 2002, there were 24,526 <sup>1</sup> . However, the figures are not comparable because all records were re-validated in 2001 when a computer database was introduced and it became apparent that the previous figures had been inaccurate.

 81,437 trials were listed in the magistrates courts during the period April 2002 to September 2002, of which 2,875 (3.53 per cent.) did not continue due to the absence or withdrawal of a witness. 6,780 trials (8.32 per cent.) became ineffective due to the absence of the defendant. It is not possible to break down these figures into those relating specifically to youth cases.
