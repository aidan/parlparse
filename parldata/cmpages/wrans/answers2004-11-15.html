 There was no support during the last review of the scheme to extend it to this group of people and we have no plans to do so.

<a name="stpa_0">The scheme is designed primarily to assist people with severe difficulty in walking which is reflected in the eligibility criteria for a badge. This includes an automatic qualifying criterion for those in receipt of the higher rate of the mobility component of disability living allowance on the basis that receipt of that benefit indicates that the applicant has considerable difficulty in walking.

<p><a name="st_1"><a name="41115w01.html_spnew1"><b> Charlotte Atkins: </b> 
 The research we will be undertaking will consider the mobility needs of a number of groups of disabled people who are currently excluded from the scheme. I can confirm that this research will include the needs of both adults and children with autistic conditions. This is one of three research projects we are taking forward as a direct result of the review of the scheme. We are finalising the work specifications and intend to go out to tender later this year for all three. On this particular project we would expect to have results and recommendations in the course of next year.

 The FLEX mechanism is a compensatory financing mechanism provided from the EU&#039;s European Development Fund under the Cotonou Agreement for African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries. It has been in place since 2000. Its objectives are:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3">to provide support in the case of short-term fluctuations in export earnings in order to safeguard reforms and policies at risk as a result of a fall in revenue; and</p>

<p>


</p>
<ul>

 Tax credit awards are initially set using latest circumstances and previous year income. Families are encouraged to report changes in both income and circumstances in year; any changes not notified in year will be picked up at the end of the year when tax credit awards are finalised. In this way the tax credits strike a balance between a system that provides certainty of support, and a system that responds to changes in family need. Furthermore, the first &#163;2,500 of any income rise is ignored.

<a name="41115w05.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_32">As I announced on 19 November 2003, <i>Official Report,</i> columns 1099&#150;1100W, in a written answer to the hon. Member for Birmingham Northfield (Richard Burden) from April, Inland Revenue wrote to all families who had had a 2003&#150;04 tax credit award to explain the action they needed to take to finalise their 2003&#150;04 award and to renew their award for 2004&#150;05. Families were sent reminder letters and as the 30 September deadline approached, those that had not returned their annual declaration were telephoned as a further reminder. Many families contacted the helpline, both for help and to provide the information necessary to finalise and renew their awards. All of this activity was supported by an extensive publicity campaign involving television, radio and newspaper advertisements which began in April and ran across the summer.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41115w05.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_33">Families benefiting from the Child Tax Credit through IS/JSA continue to receive their support in this way and are not part of the renewals process. And families receiving the family element only were told that they needed to contact the Inland Revenue only if their income had changed significantly or their circumstances had changed. This has meant that 1.3 million families did not need to contact the Inland Revenue and these families will have their awards renewed automatically. A further 3.7 million have returned their annual declaration enabling their 2003&#150;04 award to be finalised and their initial award for 2004&#150;05 to be set. At the start of October, around 200,000 families had neither renewed their award nor contacted the Inland Revenue and stood to have their awards cut off.

<a name="stpa_34">For 2003&#150;04 tax credit awards were set using 2001&#150;02 income. As set out in &quot;The Child and Working Tax Credits. The Modernisation of Britain&#039;s Tax and Benefit System Number Ten April 2002&quot;, the first &#163;2,500 rise in income will be disregarded for tax credits. This disregard means that many families will not see their tax credits reduced as their incomes rise. The Code of Practice 26 sets out what happens when tax credits have been over or under paid. Analysis of the numbers of families with over or underpayments and the values of these will only be available once all awards have been finalised. This will only be after the deadline of 31 January for reporting of final 2003&#150;04 income for those families only able to provide an estimate by

 Interest rates are set by the Bank of England&#039;s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) to meet the inflation target set by the Government, which is currently a 2 per cent. annual rise in the Consumer Prices Index (CPI). The MPC was set up in 1997 as a body independent of government and political influence. This reform has worked well&#151;it has brought stability and transparency to monetary policy, resulted in low and stable inflation and interest rates and has anchored inflation expectations to the inflation target.

Today, interest rates are at their lowest level for 40 years. Since May 1997, interest rates have averaged 5.3 per cent. This compares to an average rate of 10.5 per cent. between 1979 and 1997.

likely impact on community and amateur sports clubs of the licensing charges announced on 4 November; and if she will make a statement.  [197449]</p>








<p><a name="st_83"><a name="41115w09.html_spnew6"><b> Mr. Caborn: </b> 
 The fee levels to be set by the Secretary of State under the terms of the Licensing Act 2003 have not been finalised. On 4 November, we announced the publication of a consultation on fee levels. We welcome the views of sports clubs as part of that public consultation, which ends on 23 December. All responses will be carefully considered before the fees are finalised. The proposal is that fees for grant of a club premises certificate will range between &#163;80 and &#163;500 and annual charges between &#163;40 and &#163;225. These fee levels have been proposed to ensure that licensing authorities are able to recover fully their costs of administration, inspection and enforcement under the terms of the Act and no more. In proposing fee levels and the allocation of premises to a band based on its non-domestic rateable value we have considered the impact of the approach on clubs, including community and amateur sports clubs. We do not therefore consider that the impact on such clubs would be significant. The Licensing Review that preceded the White Paper on licensing reform showed that alcohol licensing fees have been set too low for many years, and it would be wholly wrong for central or local taxation to continue to subsidise the consumption of alcohol. Consequently, we do not believe that the best way to promote sport is through Government subsidy of sports club bars. The Government&#039;s commitment to amateur sport is illustrated by the introduction in 2002 of a scheme which gives registered Community Amateur Sports Clubs mandatory rate relief at 80 per cent. and tax relief through Gift Aid on donations from individuals. So far the scheme has given amateur sports clubs an extra &#163;5 million.

<p><a name="st_84"><a name="41115w09.html_spnew7"><b> Mr. Caborn: </b> 
 Yes. Our estimates of fee levels were first publicised in the White Paper &quot;Time for Reform: Proposals for the Modernisation of Our Licensing Laws&quot; (CM 4696) on 10 April 2000, which included a regulatory impact assessment. A regulatory impact assessment, which also included estimates relating to fee levels, was also presented to Parliament with the Licensing Bill in November 2002, and was revised when the Bill entered the House of Commons in March 2003. In September 2004 a draft regulatory impact assessment was published with a consultation document on regulations to be made under the Licensing Act 2003. All of these documents are available in the Library of the House. For the purpose of the regulatory impact assessments, sports clubs are treated as members&#039; clubs holding registration certificates under the Licensing Act 1964 and which expect to hold club premises certificates under the 2003 Act. Such clubs include as well as sports 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>15 Nov 2004 : Column 965W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
clubs, political clubs, working men&#039;s clubs, ex-services clubs, social clubs and others. There are approximately 20,000 such clubs. A further regulatory impact assessment will be presented with regulations relating to fee levels when they are made following the public consultation which began on 4 November. The consultation document enables any individual club to calculate precisely the fees it could expect to pay, under the proposals in the document, in respect of applications made for the grant and variation of a club premises certificate under the 2003 Act.

The Director&#039;s responsibilities are set out in clause 18 of the Children Bill. These are: the local authority&#039;s education and social services functions for children, functions in relation to young persons leaving care, any functions relating to children delegated to the local authority by an NHS body under section 31 of the Health Act 1999, and some new functions conferred on authorities under the Bill, for example preparing a Children and Young People&#039;s Plan, and making arrangements to promote co-operation among local agencies to improve children&#039;s well-being.

 Teaching honesty, respect for the individual and social responsibility is part of school life and in every curriculum particularly in the citizenship education curriculum. Allowing pupils to help manage a part of the budget earmarked for combating vandalism can encourage a sense of responsibility and produce a reduction in criminal damage. This may be done through a school council or youth action group. 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>15 Nov 2004 : Column 978W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
Various agencies can help. For example, most police forces have a school liaison officer. The success of this approach depends on it being sustained over the full age range. Intermittent, one-off projects, however attractive or successful they appear, will have little effect over the longer term. DfES has not carried out an assessment of the role schools can play in tackling graffiti but has produced guidance on graffiti in Managing School Facilities Guide 4 &quot;Improving Security in Schools&quot;, and in Design Note 48 &quot;Removal and Control of Graffiti&quot;, see www.teachernet.gov.uk/schoolbuildings.

<p><a name="st_147"><a name="41115w17.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 The Department welcome the report &quot;Up In Smoke?&quot;. The report, put together by leading environmental and development organisations, highlights how the impacts of climate change could undermine achievement of the UN Millennium Development Goals (MDGS) and that climate change could even reverse human development achievements. It reinforces the need for developed countries to take the lead in actions to mitigate climate change and calls for the provision of greater financial assistance to help developing countries to adapt to the impacts of 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>15 Nov 2004 : Column 993W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
climate change. It also identifies the need for nature conservation and development models that are both climate proof and climate friendly.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41115w17.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_124">Climate change is already happening. Because of past and recent emissions of greenhouse gases, we are already locked in some degree of climate change. As stated in the report, it is the poor and vulnerable communities that are going to suffer the most. The report calls for urgent action from governments. We recognise the need to act now to effectively combat climate change. We fully recognise the need to work with developing countries to help them assess their vulnerability to climate change and adapt to the inevitable changes.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41115w17.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_125">One of the recommendations of the report is to &quot;work toward a better understanding of the threat&quot;. The Department works with developing countries to help them improve their understanding of the effects of climate change. Defra has undertaken collaborative research projects with India and China to help these countries assess the likely impacts of climate change. This work involved the development of new approaches to assessment of vulnerability as well as capacity building. New bilateral research projects with China and India are currently being developed.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41115w17.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_126">As highlighted in the report, Africa is one of the most vulnerable countries to the adverse effects of climate change. The report reads: &quot;Africa already has a highly variable and unpredictable climate and climate change is making it worse&quot;. The Department and the Department for International Development, DFID, have commissioned a joint study on climate and climate change issues relevant to Africa. The study will identify information gaps, key priorities for further research and options for collective international action for Africa. The results of this study will be made available to the Commission for Africa.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41115w17.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_127">Climate change threatens livelihoods of poor people with long-term pernicious effects on development. The report calls for development models based on risk reduction and incorporating adaptation strategies. The Department is actively involved in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Working Party on Global and Sustainable Policies, which aims to identify the linkages between climate change and development. This work will also be useful in informing the UK&#039;s G8 focus on both climate change and Africa.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41115w17.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_128">DFID is supporting developing country efforts to integrate climate change into mainstream poverty reduction agendas. DFID is working with other donors, NGOs, developing country partners and the disaster risk reduction community to better understand how climate risks can be managed. For example, DFID is engaged in a multi-agency effort to identify linkages, complementarities and areas of divergence between disaster prevention and climate change adaptation.

<a name="stpa_130">Meetings of the group have proved an invaluable forum for the exchange of information.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs whether organic material derived from the mechanical biological treatment of compost qualifies as suitable for composting for the purposes of local authority targets.  [196812]</p>








<p><a name="st_153"><a name="41115w19.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 Only the production of compost which meets the definition stated in Government guidance can count towards Best Value Performance Indicator 82b. This is available from the Defra website at www.defra.gov.uk/environment/waste/management/guidance/mwms/10.htm. With the standard of current technology it is unlikely that the product of a Mechanical and Biological Treatment process will meet that definition, in which case it would not be permissible for local authorities to count it towards meeting their recycling targets.

<p><a name="qn_155"><a name="41115w19.html_wqn1"><b> Norman Baker: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what criteria are used to determine whether material produced for composting constitutes controllable waste.  [196813]</p>








<p><a name="st_154"><a name="41115w19.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 The definition of waste in force in the United Kingdom is the definition in Article 1<i>(a)</i> of the Waste Framework Directive (as amended). Whether or not a substance is discarded as waste, and when waste ceases to be waste, are matters which must be determined on the facts of the case and the interpretation of the law is a matter for the Courts. The European Court of Justice (ECJ) has issued several judgments on the definition of waste which are binding on member states and their &quot;competent authorities&quot;.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41115w19.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_131">Composting is classified as a waste recovery operation under the Directive. This means that, in England and Wales, composting must be carried out under the terms of a licence issued by or a licensing exemption registered with the Environment Agency.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41115w19.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_132">The ECJ has ruled that

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_94">&quot;..whether [a substance] is waste, must be determined in the light of all the circumstances, regard being had to the aim of the Directive and the need to ensure that its effectiveness is not undermined.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>

</p>


<p>
<a name="41115w19.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_133">In practice, this means that waste does not cease to be waste until it has been fully recovered within the meaning of the Directive and there is certainty of its use as a product without undergoing a further recovery operation. The Environment Agency considers that <i>(a)</i> source-segregated waste which, after composting, meets a recognised and suitable quality standard (e.g. BSI PAS 100) is likely to meet the first criterion; and <i>(b)</i> mixed waste which is composted is likely to remain waste until it is used in a further recovery operation (e.g. land treatment resulting in agricultural benefit or ecological improvement) subject to control by the Agency under a licence or registered licensing exemption.

 The African elephant is protected under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) and all trade in raw ivory is currently suspended. Some elephant populations have recovered sufficiently to allow a one-off sale of existing ivory stocks but this will not take place until we are satisfied that the trade can be properly regulated and that the baseline data for monitoring the impact of such sales on the illegal killing of elephants (MIKE) are in place. The Elephant Trade Information System (ETIS), which is funded by Defra, is also helping to monitor the number of ivory seizures and identify the patterns of illegal trade. In addition, the CITES Secretariat has been directed to develop an action plan for dealing with the global market in ivory, focusing in particular on the unregulated domestic markets in Africa. It will also look at the markets in South East Asia, where the increased demand for ivory is thought to be fuelling the illegal killing of elephants.

<a name="stpa_150">On the proposed Directive on the Management of Waste from the Extractive Industries, discussion was primarily on the scope of the proposal. Hungary wanted the requirement for a financial guarantee to extend to land surrounding a waste facility. The UK argued that such a move would be impractical, overlap unhelpfully with the Environmental Liability Directive, and place unwarranted burdens on the extractive industries. Council reached agreement by a qualified majority which included the UK, on the basis of the compromise text tabled by the Presidency for the meeting, with Austria and Hungary abstaining.

<a name="41115w21.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_151">The proposed Regulation on Certain Fluorinated Greenhouse Gases aims to make a contribution to our Kyoto Protocol target by introducing mitigation measures in relation to these gases, developed to replace the much more damaging (to the ozone layer) CFCs and HCFCs.

<a name="stpa_152">The original proposal for a Regulation has been split into two parts, with a separate Directive relating to mobile air conditioning systems (MACs) fitted to cars and car-derived vans. Both were considered at Council, and much of the discussion related to the legal base. Austria and Denmark were particularly concerned that the environmental legal base provided in Article 175 should be used for the Regulation, allowing them to maintain tighter existing standards of their own without having to notify them to the Commission. Sweden also supported this view, wishing to preserve the flexibility to go further in future. For the UK, the Secretary of State 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>15 Nov 2004 : Column 1007W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
put the view, also supported by the Commission and several other member states, that a dual legal base was the best means to avoid possible undermining of the single market, while achieving important environmental gains across the EU. The Directive includes a ban on the use of fluorinated gases with high global warming potential in MACs from 2011 (new vehicle types) and 2017 (all new vehicles). Both the Regulation and the Directive had additional text added providing for a future neutral review of the Community provisions (in the Regulation and Directive) concerning global warming potential of fluorinated gases.

The Secretary of State spoke in support of the Commission&#039;s approach in its recent communication, which is to focus on providing for the financing of these sites through the principal existing community financial instruments where they are applicable. She also noted that the Habitats Directive which established Natura 2000 sites is clear in giving primary responsibility for financing them to member states, and stating that co-financing should be in exceptional circumstances.

<i>[holding answer 8 November 2004]:</i> Cement kilns in England and Wales are regulated for environmental purposes by the Environment Agency under the Pollution Prevention and Control (PPC) system. Cement kilns that burn hazardous waste are subject to additional regulatory controls under the Hazardous Waste Incineration Directive and the new Waste Incineration Directive. Any PPC permit granted by the Agency includes conditions designed to ensure 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>15 Nov 2004 : Column 1023W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
that the installation is operated in such a way that all the appropriate preventative measures are taken against pollution, in particular through the application of the best available techniques, and that no significant pollution is caused.

<a name="stpa_216">The Environment Agency&#039;s Substitute Fuels Protocol, originally published in 1999, sets out detailed consultation requirements for PPC permit applications by cement kiln operators wishing to use waste as substitute fuels. It also sets out detailed monitoring requirements and controls on the constituents of the substitute fuel.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41115w25.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_217">The Environment Agency recently conducted a three-month public consultation on proposed revisions to the Substitute Fuels Protocol. The outcome was discussed at a meeting of the Environment Agency Board on 13 October and the Agency issued a News Release on the matter on 15 October.

<p><a name="st_206"><a name="41115w25.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Morley  </b> 
<i>[holding answer 8 November 2004]</i>: Under the revised Substitute Fuels Protocol, the Environment Agency will no longer exclude pentachlorophenol or wastes derived from the manufacture of pharmaceuticals, biocides, pesticides and explosives from being incorporated into substitute fuel. In addition, any new waste, including hazardous waste, proposed as a substitute fuel in cement kilns will have to comply with the following criteria:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_230">(i) the main purpose of its use is the generation of heat;</p>

</p>


<p>
<a name="41115w25.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_219">At present emission limit values for cement kilns that burn hazardous waste are calculated in accordance with a formula given in Annex II of Council Directive 94/67/EC of 16 December 1994 on the incineration of hazardous waste . The formula ensures that the fraction of gas produced by the incineration of hazardous waste in a cement kiln has the same emission limit values applied to it as it would have done had it been incinerated in a merchant waste incinerator. These emission limits are given in Article 7 of that Directive. However, the final emission limit values for a cement kiln also take into account the concentration of pollutants derived from the combustion of conventional fuels (e.g. coal, petroleum coke) and raw materials (e.g. limestone, clay) in the cement kiln.

 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State is very aware of the beneficial conservation effects of captive breeding of raptors. The increase in numbers of non-hybrid captive bred specimens helps lessen the threat to the wild populations of those species. Her officials carry out a constructive dialogue with UK breeders over a range of issues which effect captive breeding operations within the UK, including the streamlining of procedures to aid them in complying with their registration obligations.

 The current EU sugar regime is clearly unsustainable and the UK Government has consistently called for early decisions on reform to give all concerned time to adjust to the substantial changes needed to bring the arrangements into line with other parts of the Common Agricultural Policy and the EU&#039;s international obligations. The European Commission has tabled a Communication setting out its preferred approach to reform, but has not yet made formal legislative proposals for a new regime.

Some veterinary medicines may be supplied only in accordance with a prescription issued by a veterinary surgeon.

 It is not unusual for the Royal Artillery and Royal Armoured Corps to deploy units in the infantry role. In addition, other parts of the Army, such as the Royal Corps of Signals and Royal Logistics Corps, undertake general infantry tasks as part of routine operations. This is made possible by the fact that every soldier in the Army is trained as an infantryman first, and as a specialist second.

<a name="41115w31.html_para0">
On larger operations, such as that in Iraq, a complete brigade is usually deployed as an entity, including infantry, armoured and artillery units. This reflects the fact that the whole brigade will have trained together for a range of operations, and will be capable of switching rapidly between different roles as part of routine business in Iraq. For example, in Iraq, armoured regiments regularly switch between operating with their tanks, and operating in the infantry role. These flexible arrangements are expected to continue for the foreseeable future.

<p><a name="st_271"><a name="41115w32.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Hoon </b> 
<i>[holding answer 9 November 2004]:</i> The Defence Crisis Management Organisation (DCMO) is responsible for the strategic level planning and execution of military operations, including operations in Iraq, and acts as a channel for operational briefing to Ministers and Chiefs of Staff. The DCMO comprises both civilian and military personnel and is made up of elements of Ministry of Defence Central Staff, the Permanent Joint Headquarters (PJHQ), single-Service front-line commands and other relevant Departments.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41115w32.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_274">The DCMO provides advice to the Chiefs of Staff and Ministers on a range of issues, including mobilisation and other military preparatory measures. Final decisions on these issues are made by Ministers. The Prime Minister stated on 24 September 2002 that there had to be genuine preparedness and planning to take action against Iraq if diplomacy failed and it proved impossible to bring Iraq into compliance with UN Security Council Resolutions by diplomatic means. It was made clear in a Commons Debate on 25 November 2002 and Defence Questions on 9 December 2002 that the Government was undertaking prudent preparations and planning in the event that military action was required. The decision to start mobilising reserves was made by Ministers in early January once it became appropriate to do so in order to further military preparations, and a call-out order under the Reserve Forces Act 1996 was put before Parliament.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41115w32.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_275">The decision on the participation of UK forces in military action against Iraq was made following the Parliamentary debate on the 18 March 2003 on Iraq&#039;s continued non-compliance with UN Security Council Resolution 1441 and the Parliamentary vote in favour of military action to enforce the UN Resolutions.

<p><a name="st_273"><a name="41115w32.html_spnew7"><b> Mr. Hoon: </b> 
 The European Commission&#039;s White Paper proposes, amongst other things, a number of space-related initiatives aimed at improving the EU&#039;s crisis management capability. Whilst space-based assets and applications could play an important role in helping to meet the EU&#039;s security and defence needs, the provision of military capability remains a member state responsibility under the European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP). This will not be changed by the White Paper, and the White Paper does not therefore determine the priorities for UK Defence policy. The EU&#039;s future requirements for military space capabilities are being examined through the ESDP&#039;s European Capability Action Plan process.

 Both I and my Army Board colleagues are very aware of the level of interest in, and the strength of feeling aroused by, the decision to adjust the structure of the infantry. Following my announcement on 21 July, the Executive Committee of the Army Board (ECAB) tasked the Divisions of Infantry to consider how best to restructure themselves on the basis of large regiments of two or more battalions, with a view to putting forward recommendations. This process has involved a great deal of consultation both within the ranks of those serving and within the wider Army community. Ultimately, proposals will be put before the Army Board and Ministers for the final decision, but we have made it clear that we want a future infantry structure that takes full account of the considered response of those affected.

 Figures for the costs of operations, in Iraq and elsewhere, are published annually to take account of the need for physical stocktakes to establish accurate figures for some aspects of consumption and to allow for audit by the NAO. The annual cost of operations in Iraq in 2003&#150;04, including some elements of the warfighting phase, was &#163;1,311 million. Monthly expenditure within this figure would vary depending on troop numbers and activity, but it is not possible to break down the total by month.

Notes:<br>

1. Owing to the different nature of their flying operations, RAF Lossiemouth records colour states on a minute by minute basis while RAF Kinloss records the situation hourly.<br>

2. The RAF Lossiemouth figures have been recorded over the time period 0750 to 2150 daily, which is the time period within which the majority of the flying programme takes place. The RAF Kinloss figures have been recorded over a full 24 hour period because the station remains open round the clock.<br>

3. No records are available for January to July 1997 for RAF Lossiemouth.<br>

<p><a name="st_304"><a name="41115w35.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Ingram </b> 
<i>[holding answer 3 February 2004]:</i> It is not possible to quantify how many unexploded cluster munitions deployed by UK forces there might be worldwide. Air-delivered cluster munitions have been used in a number of recent conflicts. Their rates of failing to explode as designed can vary considerably depending on a variety of factors, including the terrain conditions on impact. By contrast, the modern artillery-delivered cluster munitions used in Iraq have secondary fuses that ensure a far smaller proportion is left unexploded. The quantity of unexploded munitions has also been greatly reduced by extensive clearance efforts in, for example, Kosovo and Iraq.

 Human rights form an integral part of our policy towards Colombia. We keep the human rights situation in the country under constant review. We recognise that there have been some improvements but much still needs to be done. We work closely with the Colombian Government, EU and other partners, including civil society, to try to achieve this further improvement. We regularly urge the Colombian Government to meet UN recommendations on human rights and are working with them to achieve this goal. As part of this co-operation, we were pleased to host the meeting of international support for Colombia held in London in July 2003. This resulted in the London Declaration, a key text that guides international support. We are working with the Colombians and other partners in the run-up to the follow-up meeting to the London meeting to be held in Colombia in February 2005.

<i>[holding answer 29 June 2004]:</i> The difference in these targets reflects a number of differences between publicly and privately operated prisons. Prisons operated by the private sector are generally of newer design and construction and have larger cells that can accommodate extra beds: many older public sector prisons have smaller cells that cannot accommodate extra beds. Some privately operated prisons were designed with scope to increase regime facilities in case of overcrowding while many public sector prisons have limited capacity to increase regime services. The private sector has, proportionately, more local prisons, which have traditionally been more overcrowded than other types of prison.

<p><a name="st_531"><a name="41115w55.html_spnew10"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 The Government have implemented a range of measures with a view to encouraging sex offence victims to report abuse and to act as a witness in court.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41115w55.html_para10">
<a name="stpa_462">In 2002, the Government published their Rape Action Plan including steps to improve the investigation and prosecution of rape cases and the treatment of victims and witnesses. The intention is that these measures will help to bring more cases to justice, increase public confidence and consequently encourage victims to report their abuse. Key elements of the RAP include:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_525">specialist training of Sexual Offence Liaison Officers and Rape Victim Chaperones.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>

</p>


<p>
<a name="41115w55.html_para11">
<a name="stpa_463">Guidance on special measures such as allowing victims to give their evidence from behind a screen, or on video, helping to sustain cases which would otherwise stand no chance of getting to court, and encourage victims to act as witnesses.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41115w55.html_para12">
<a name="stpa_464">An important recommendation from the Rape Action Plan is that forces support the development of Sexual Assault Referral Centres (SARCs)&#151;integrated services where victims of rape and sexual assault can have their various medical, forensic, counselling and support needs met quickly and sympathetically, in one location, by properly trained staff. A recent evaluation of SARCs (Home Office Research Study 285: Lovett, J., Regan, L. and Kelly, L. (2004),) reported high levels of victim satisfaction. While victims may use the services of a SARC without reporting to the police, they are encouraged to do so, and if they do not wish to report immediately, they are still able to undergo a forensic examination in case they decide to report at a later date.




<br>&nbsp;<br><i>15 Nov 2004 : Column 1145W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>


<p>
<a name="41115w55.html_para13">
There are now 13 SARCs across England, with more under development. Over this and the next financial year, a proportion of the &#163;4 million set aside from the Victims Fund for services to victims of sexual offending will help to extend and strengthen the SARCs network. Work is also underway to raise awareness about SARCs. If people who have been raped are confident that they will be treated with respect and dignity, they may be more likely to report to the police.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41115w55.html_para14">
<a name="stpa_465">The remainder of the &#163;4 million will be used to develop voluntary and community sector based services for victims of sexual offending. The services will be available regardless of whether a victim chooses to report the offence or testify in court but we hope more victims of sexual crime will have the confidence to report the offences and that more victims can be supported as their cases go through the criminal justice process.

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_527">Around half of witnesses who did not have the opportunity to give evidence with the aid of special measures said that they would have found special measures helpful.</p>

This work continues and on Monday 18 October the Office of Criminal Justice Reform published the Victim and Witness Delivery Plan &quot;Improving Services for Victims and Witnesses&quot;, setting out the Government&#039;s seven priorities for victims and witnesses.

Help may be limited to information or advice or referral to appropriate agencies in their local communities on release. Some prison programmes, such as anger management, may address the impact of abuse indirectly. Prisoners who have a history of sexual abuse are at a greater risk of suicide or self-harm and guidance to staff on managing prisoners who self-harm has been circulated to establishments.

 Reducing violence, in all its forms, is fundamental to the objectives of the Prison Service.

Notes:<br>

Finished consultant episode (FCE)&#151;A FCE is defined as a period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. Please note that the figures do not represent the number of patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the year.<br>

All operations count of episodes&#151;These figures represent a count of all FCE&#039;s where the procedure was mentioned in any of the 12 (four prior to 2002&#150;03) operation fields in a HES record. A record is only included once in each count, even if an operation is mentioned in more than one operation field of the record.<br>

Diagnosis (primary diagnosis)&#151;The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 14 (seven prior to 2002&#150;03) diagnosis fields in the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data set and provides the main reason why the patient was in hospital.<br>

Ungrossed data&#151;Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).<br>

Responsibility for administering the scheme was delegated to the HAs with advice that they imposed conditions on the use of the funds to benefit NHS patients.

 As my right hon.

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_544">Benefit processing is one of the largest and most important business areas within Jobcentre Plus and for some time the Agency has been exploring ways of making it more efficient. Rationalising the number of sites from which benefits are processed will improve service to customers by bringing greater consistency to processes, allow staff to develop more in-depth benefit knowledge and experience, reduce costs (for example in management and overheads) and make better use of the estate.</p>
</ul>

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_545">In the case of Workington, the existing estate would not support an enlarged processing facility. The proposed move to Carlisle will allow us to capitalise on the facilities available at the former Social Security Office at Rufus House which is capable of being developed into a benefit processing centre housing up to 180 people. Rural considerations have been taken into account when making these planning proposals.</p>

<sup>(63)</sup> Figures are based on persons claiming severe disablement allowance, long-term or short-term incapacity benefit, credits only cases, and those persons claiming IB but who have their benefit extinguished for reasons such as an overlap with another benefit, or because of hospitalisation.<br>

<sup>(64)</sup> Training/employment programmes in this case are: New Deal for Young People (NDYP), New Deal for Long Term Unemployed (NDLTU), New Deal for Lone Parents (NDLP), New Deal for Partners Unemployed (NDPU), New Deal for Musicians (NDfM), New Deal Innovation Fund (NDIF), New Deal Disabled People (NDDP), Basic Skills, Joint Claims, Work Based Learning for Adults (WBLA), Employment Zones (EZs) and Action Teams. Data for employment/training programmes prior to 1998 is not available.<br>

<sup>(65)</sup> Other benefits in this instance are income support (IS), jobseeker&#039;s allowance (JSA) and pension credit (Guarantee credit only/Guarantee and savings credit). Family credit and disability working allowance are excluded as &quot;other benefits&quot; as they were replaced in October 1999 by working families tax credit and disabled persons tax credit (subsequently replaced by new tax credits).<br>

<sup>(66)</sup> Data for New Deal 50-Plus (ND50) is not included as the database for this programme is still under development.<br>

<sup>(67)</sup> Movements to a training/employment programme include some people who have been on a programme at the same time as IB/SDA, but whose participation in the programme continues after the IB/SDA claim ceases.<br>

<sup>(68)</sup> Only cases, which move to one of the listed training/employment programmes within 91 days from the end of their IB/SDA claim, will be counted. Some cases will move to training/employment programmes after 91 days: Such cases will not be counted as a move to a training/employment programme.<br>

<sup>(69)</sup> Claimants shown as starting an employment/training programme may also appear in the &#039;Move to another benefit&#039; column. For example they may have moved onto JSA and then almost immediately begun an employment/training programme.<br>

<sup>(70)</sup> There will be some additional IB/SDA claimants who undertake training/employment programmes (e.g. New Deal for Disabled People) while remaining on IB/SDA for the whole period. These cases are not covered in the table, which only covers those who have ceased to claim IB/SDA.<br>

<sup>(71)</sup> Movements to another benefit includes some people who have claimed IS/PC at the same time as IB/SDA but whose IS/PC claim continues after the IB/SDA claim ceases.<br>

<sup>(72)</sup> Only cases that move to one of the other listed benefits within 91 days from the end of their IB/SDA claim will be counted. Some cases will move to other benefits after 91 days: Such cases will not be counted as a move to another benefit.<br>

<sup>(73)</sup><br>

<sup>(74)</sup> Some of the cases shown as having moved to another benefit may have now terminated.<br>

<sup>(75)</sup>State pension age is currently 60 years for women and 65 years for men.<br>

<sup>(76)</sup>Claimants shown as terminating a claim within 6 months of state pension age may also appear in the &quot;moved to another benefit&quot; column, as they may have subsequently been awarded either IS or PC.<br>





<br>

<sup>(77)</sup>IB/SDA claimant data is held on a computer system called INCAP; RP (and WB and BB) data is held on a computer system called PSCS; INCAP and PSCS are linked because both cover contributory benefits and require information on the claimant&#039;s NI contributions history. Once an IB claimant gets within six months of SPA, their RP award can start to be built on PSCS i.e. PSCS and its operators begin calculating how much RP will be payable once SPA is reached. At that point, the claimant disappears from the INCAP side of the system and appears on the PSCS side (though obviously they continue to be paid the relevant rate of IB via PSCS until they reach SPA when RP kicks in). Since our IB/SDA data obviously comes from INCAP, these claimants reaching SPA can effectively disappear from our IB/SDA data (from INCAP) any time in the six months before they reach SPA.<br>

Notes:<br>

1. Caseload figures have been rounded to the nearest hundred. Totals may not sum due to rounding.<br>

2. Figures based on a 5 per cent. sample, are subject to a degree of sampling variation.<br>

3. Some IB/SDA end dates will have been estimated at the end of a quarter, where the true end date is not known.<br>

4. A person is counted only once in each period, regardless of the number of times they claim and subsequently leave each benefit.<br>

5. SDA is not available to new claimants from 6 April 2001. From this point, disabled people, whose period of incapacity begins before the age of 20 (or 25 if in education or training before the age of 20), may be able to receive incapacity benefit without having to satisfy the National Insurance contribution conditions. SDA recipients aged below 20 at the cut-off point will transfer on to IB at the long-term rate in April 2002. Existing recipients can continue to receive the benefit for as long as they satisfy the conditions of entitlement for the benefit.<br>

 On 25 October 2004, the Department launched pilots of two new financial incentives to help lone parents. The incentives are a Work Search Premium (WSP) of &#163;20 a week, on top of benefits, to assist lone parents during the search for work, and an In Work Credit (IWC) of &#163;40 a week, on top of wages and tax credits, helping work pay during their first year back in full-time work.

Currently less than nine per cent. of lone parents claiming income support are on NDLP.

It has not been set out as a priority for the council during their current Local Transport Plan (LTP) period (to 2005&#150;06). If the scheme is progressed it will be through developer funding and as such the time scale is dependent on the private sector.

 To ask the Deputy Prime Minister if his Department will introduce new building regulations obliging each new development to include solar electricity.  [198229]</p>

 The building regulations requirements are functional rather than prescriptive to enable compliance in practical and cost-effective ways, and to leave open the possibilities for innovation. It would therefore be inconsistent to prescribe particular technologies such as solar electricity. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is reviewing the energy efficiency requirements however and amendment proposals were published for consultation in July. The proposals include setting minimum overall building performance standards at levels much higher than at present and providing new technical guidance on low and zero carbon systems.

 I have been asked to reply.

<a name="stpa_681">The Victims&#039; Fund will be funded by a new surcharge on criminal convictions and fixed penalty notices for criminal offences. The Fund will be used to support new and improved services for victims of crime at both local and national level. Criteria for making application to the Fund and the arrangements for administering the Fund are still being developed.
