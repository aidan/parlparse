<p><a name="40714w02.html_spnew6"><b> Mr. Ingram </b> 
<i>[holding answer 12 July 2004]:</i> Currently the United Kingdom has 30 staff officers employed between the Multi National Force (MNF) and Multi National Corps (MNC) Headquarters (these were previously known as the Combined Joint Task Force Headquarters). The UK contributes a variety of staff and command functions including a Lieutenant General in the role of Deputy Commanding General Operations and a Major General as Deputy Commanding General MNC.

 There is no obligation on landowners to incur any expenditure in respect of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000. Landowners will incur costs if they make use of the appeals and restrictions system, but there is no charge for using these systems which have been kept as simple as possible.

Local highway authorities and National Park authorities, in their capacity as access authorities under the Act, have powers to enable and manage open access in their areas and will be responsible for putting in place infrastructure such as signage, footbridges and gates. We hope that landowners and managers will work closely with them to ensure the new right is implemented in a way which benefits the public without adversely affecting the management of the land. In order to facilitate this the Countryside Agency is supporting a series of half-day briefing sessions, open to all landowners and land managers, organised by the Country Land and Business Association and supported by the National Farmers&#039; Union and the Moorland Association.

The UK red squirrel Biodiversity Action Plan Steering Group has identified those areas of the UK where action to maintain red squirrels is most likely to be effective in the long term. In northern England, these priorities have now been translated into management plans for key forest areas, where we believe a combination of large-scale habitat management in forests and buffer areas allied to surveillance and targeted grey squirrel control gives the red squirrel the best chance of survival.

Elsewhere in England, a red squirrel strategy for the Isle of Wight has recently been published. Work on improving the island&#039;s woodlands and hedgerows for the red squirrel has been continuing, funded by the Forestry Commission and the HLF, and a recent survey found signs of red squirrels in 86 per cent. of the woodlands, an improvement over the 71 per cent. found in 1996&#150;97. The populations on the islands in Poole Harbour (Brownsea, Furzey) are also important and a joint management plan to ensure their survival here will soon be developed.

<p><a name="40714w06.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Caborn: </b> 
 The Government are implementing the Game Plan (2002) recommendation to improve the delivery of sport and physical activity through local government. We are working closely with partners at Sport England, the Local Government Association, the Chief Cultural and Leisure Officers Association, the Audit Commission and others to: improve local partnerships; include sport and physical activity in Local Public Service Agreements; develop an Excellence Framework for Sport and Recreation; develop strategies for improvement planning and develop and train key workers in sport. Sport in schools, and links between schools and communities, will benefit from this work.

 National Lottery funding has been made available through the Veterans Reunited initiative to ensure that all generations of UK residents can commemorate the momentous events that led to the end of the Second World War. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State first announced our intention to provide Lottery support in this area last October.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40714w06.html_para8">
The Veterans Reunited initiative has three strands, one of which, &quot;Their Past Your Future&quot;, is a &#163;10 million, two-year education scheme funded by the Big Lottery Fund and led by the Imperial War Museum (IWM) in partnership with the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council, Scottish Museums Council, National Library of Wales, Northern Ireland Museums Council and local education authorities UK wide.

<p>
<a name="40714w06.html_para9">
&quot;Their Past Your Future&quot; concentrates on the participation of schools and young people in understanding events of the Second World War; it is designed to raise children&#039;s awareness of issues of remembrance, conflict, freedom, commemoration and reconciliation as well as informing them about historical aspects of the war. The IWM project, receiving &#163;4 million from the Big Lottery Fund, consists of an educational website, a series of competitions for schools to win overseas commemorative visits, a travelling exhibition, and a Partnerships Scheme linking children to armed service and civilian veterans of the war. Funding of &#163;2.3 million has also been offered to all UK local authorities to support locally organised events and activities or overseas trips.

This has been caused by the restrictions on the movement of Palestinian people and goods which the Government of Israel sees as an essential security procedure. The Israeli disengagement plan and additional donor funds will not alone improve the Palestinian economy. It must be accompanied by major change in the closure regime, and a reinvigorated programme of Palestinian reform.

<p><a name="40714w08.html_spnew8"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 The UK Government are deeply concerned about the situation in Darfur. Humanitarian requirements in all sectors (food, water, shelter) are enormous. Civilian protection is also a major concern, with reports of systematic attacks on civilians. The Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights report has identified disturbing patterns of human rights violations. DFID, with our EU partners, have made clear that all alleged attacks should be thoroughly investigated and the perpetrators brought to justice.
</p>

DFID is in almost daily contact with the Government of Sudan and the Darfur groups, both through our embassy in Khartoum and the joint DFID/FCO Sudan Unit in London.

Following concerted pressure from the UK Government, in conjunction with others, we have

The UK is the second largest bilateral donor in Darfur, next to the US. Since September 2003, DFID has allocated &#163;62.5 million to the humanitarian response to the crisis, which we are committing to UN agencies, the Red Cross and non-governmental organisations. UK funding has contributed to provision of water and sanitation, food, nutrition and health services for the displaced population and to their host communities in Darfur and Eastern Chad. DFID is also actively involved in urging the EU and other organisations to increase their funding.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40714w08.html_para6">
In terms of the security situation and civilian protection, our priority remains on the rapid deployment of the African Union (AU)-led Ceasefire Monitoring Mission. Experience from elsewhere in Sudan shows that the deployment of ceasefire monitors can have a positive effect on the security situation and the protection of civilians. Following agreement of the AU&#039;s plan on 28 May, the UK immediately committed &#163;2 million to enable swift deployment and we are working to provide a UK monitor to the mission.

The 2003 Regional Housing Strategy and its accompanying investment framework includes the provision of sufficient new homes, creating mixed income and sustainable communities as one of its objectives.

Notes:<br>

1. Caseload figures have been rounded to the nearest 100. Figures are based on a 5 per cent. sample, and are therefore subject to a degree of sampling variation.<br>

2. Age is given at the point the claim commences.<br>

3. Income support disability premium commencements include both new/repeat claims to benefit and those persons moving into the disability premium group from another income support statistical group.<br>

4. Incapacity benefit figures are based on persons claiming long-term or short-term incapacity benefit, national insurance credits only cases, and those persons claiming IB but who have their benefit extinguished for reasons such as an overlap with another benefit, or because of hospitalisation.<br>

5. A person is counted only once in each period, regardless of the number of times they claim and subsequently leave each benefit. Only the first claim in any given period is counted, and it is that claim from which the six-month period has been calculated.<br>

6. Income support claims and status are based on a series of point in time sample enquiries taken in February, May, August and November of each year. These enquiries are a snapshot of live claims on the enquiry date. Claims which start and end between enquiry dates are not captured, and as such numbers of IS claims made may be underestimated.<br>

7. End dates of IS claims are not collected, therefore the claim end dates for IS claimants are estimated. Persons returning within six months will therefore be a six-month period from the estimated end date.<br>





8. Movements between ISDP and IB, and where a claim to one of these benefits terminates and a new claim is made before the six-month point, are classified as still claiming the original benefit. Movements from ISDP to another IS statistical group are classified as receiving another benefit, as the basis of entitlement may have changed.<br>

<sup>(20)</sup> Modernisation Programme works are part of a major programme funded by the Treasury to improve the way in which DWP services are delivered to the public. The physical surroundings of several of the businesses within DWP are being changed, including Jobcentre Plus, The Pensions Service and Debt Management Services. This spend is a combination of new acquisitions, major refurbishments to buildings already part of the estate, as well as the smaller, business-related refurbishment works costs. While the overall cost of the programme is known it is not possible to provide separate figures for refurbishment works.<br>

Note:<br>

Additionally, our private sector partners Land Securities Trillium are responsible for providing an on-going maintenance programme for all buildings on the estate.

<p><a name="40714w22.html_spnew6"><b> Malcolm Wicks: </b> 
 The National Insurance Advisory Committee (NIAC) originally considered the amount of benefit that should be paid to long-term in-patients in 1949. Although they said that there would be grounds for withholding the whole of benefit because no allowance should be paid for outside commitments, they thought it desirable that benefit should not be reduced below &quot;a reasonable amount for personal needs in hospital&quot;. They recommended an amount which was roughly 20 per cent. of the standard rate of state pension. (A higher rate was set for long-term in-patients with respiratory tuberculosis.)
</p>


<p>
<a name="40714w22.html_para4">
When asked to review the amount of benefit paid to in-patients in 1952, the NIAC recommended that the amount paid to long-term in-patients should be increased to reflect increases in the cost of living. This increased amount continued to represent 20 per cent. of the prevailing rate of state pension.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40714w22.html_para5">
Changes were introduced in 1988 to abolish the resettlement benefit payable to long-term in-patients without a dependant on discharge, and to reduce the amount payable to dependants of long-term in-patients. The Social Security Advisory Committee (SSAC), when considering those changes, said that they had received several representations that the level of benefit paid to long-term in-patients (that is, the 20 per cent. of basic state pension) was too low to meet their needs. SSAC said that they had seen no evidence to convince them that the level of benefit should be raised.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40714w22.html_para6">
The benefit paid to long-term in-patients is to meet their personal day-to-day requirements, such as newspapers, magazines, and toiletry items. It is not intended to cover the purchase of more expensive items such as clothing. That is the responsibility of the local NHS trust.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40714w22.html_para7">
We have seen no convincing evidence that the current level of benefit is causing long-term in-patients either therapeutic or economic harm.

The new Enterprise Adviser service is working alongside head teachers in almost 1,000 schools in the most disadvantaged areas. All of this effort is leading to the production of national guidance to show schools the most effective ways of teaching enterprise. From September 2005 new funding of &#163;60 million per annum will support a new focus on enterprise education in secondary schools. In particular the new resources will allow for an Enterprise Education entitlement to provide all Key Stage 4 pupils with the equivalent of five days&#039; enterprise activity, which develops enterprise capability&#151;innovation, creativity, risk-management and risk-taking, and financial and business understanding.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what indication he has given to local education authorities of the capital allocations available to schools that are not participating in Pathfinder or Phase 1 of Building Schools for the Future.  [182510]</p>








<p><a name="40714w27.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </b> 
 All authorities and schools have now been given details of their allocation of capital for 2005&#150;06, with the exception of the relatively small Targeted Capital Fund where we aim to make announcements in the autumn. We will also hope to announce details in the autumn of the major capital funding programmes for authorities and schools for the 2004 spending review period to 2007&#150;08, in line with government policy to give authorities three-year certainty on 85 per cent. of their funding so that they can plan strategically to invest to achieve greater value for money.

 There is not a separate budget for the pathfinder projects. They and the other projects announced in February are all part of wave one, due to start in 2005&#150;06, and which has an overall budget of &#163;2.2 million.

Notes:<br>

1. Figures reflect Education Formula Spending Share (EFSS) settlement (all sub-blocks). Total funding also includes all revenue grants in DfES Departmental Expenditure Limits relevant to EFSS pupils aged 3 to 15.<br>

2. Education Formula Spending Shares give all local education authorities the same funding for equivalent pupils plus top-ups for deprivation, for the higher costs of recruiting and retaining staff in some areas, and for sparsity. DfES grants are mainly distributed 



to LEAs on a per pupil/per school basis with some weighting to take account of relative deprivation or low attainment where that reflects the grant objectives.<br>

3. Figures exclude EMAs and grants not allocated at LEA level.<br>

4. The pupil numbers used are those underlying the EFSS settlement calculations plus Pupil Level Annual School Censors 3-year-olds maintained pupils and estimated 3 to 4-year-olds funded through state support in maintained and other educational institutions where these are not included in the SSA pupil numbers.<br>

5. 2003&#150;04 figures are provisional as some grants have not yet been finalised/audited.<br>

6. Per pupil figures are rounded to the nearest 10 so may not sum.<br>

<p><a name="40714w29.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Ivan Lewis </b> 
: Drop-out and retention rates are not available for all vocational courses undertaken in England. However, the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) routinely collect and publish retention data for learners on LSC funded further education provision. Retention rates for 2001&#150;01, 2001&#150;02 and 2002&#150;03 are shown in the LSC statistical first release, &quot;Further Education and Work Based Learning for Young People&#151;Learner Outcomes in England: 2002/03&quot;, available on the LSC website: http://www.lsc.gov.uk/National/Documents/SubjectListing/SectorData/StatisticalFirstReleases/sfr04.htm. A paper copy can be found in the Commons Library. Table 2 of this publication shows success, retention and achievement rates by level and type of qualification. The same publication also gives success rates for National Vocational Qualifications (NVQs) studied through LSC funded work based learning for young people.
