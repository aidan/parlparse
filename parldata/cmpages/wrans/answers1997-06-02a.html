<a name="70602w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 We have no plans to review the statutory requirement that applicants for naturalisation under section 6(1) of the British Nationality Act 1981 should have sufficient knowledge of the English, Welsh or Scottish Gaelic language. There is no language requirement for those applying as the spouse of a British citizen.
<P>

<a name="70602w01.html_para1">In 1996, only 27 applicants out of the 17,670 applications determined were refused citizenship because of their failure to meet this requirement.
<P>

<a name="70602w01.html_para2">There remains a residual discretion for the Secretary of State to waive the need to fulfil the requirement if he considers that because of the applicant's age or physical or mental condition, it would be unreasonable to expect it to be fulfilled.

 My Department is aware of the problem.

The Department's information technology (IT) supplier (Sema Group) has completed an audit of IT systems and is about to commence more detailed analysis. The aim is to produce a prioritised, costed programme of action by October 1997 and to have implemented and tested modified systems by the end of 1998. This is in line with the recommendations of the Central IT Unit (CITU) and the National Audit Office.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70602w02.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Joyce Quin: </B> 
 Current unrest amongst the general population of immigration detainees held in Rochester prison is believed to centre on complaints about prison food, being locked in their cells for longer than normal and their access to education facilities being cut. However, no formal complaint has been received.
<P>

<a name="70602w02.html_para1">The meals and menus are checked regularly by the governor, the area manager, catering adviser and members of the Board of Visitors and have been adjudged wholesome and varied. The regime of the whole prison has been temporarily reduced because of the need to provide staff for a bedwatch on a prisoner in the Medway hospital, aggravated by a high level of sick leave. This has resulted in a reduction in the time out of cell of all prisoners and the closure of education facilities for the detainees. To compensate for this, wing-based education is being introduced for the detainees from Monday 2 June 1997 until a normal regime can be restored.

 This is essentially the responsibility of individual departments. However my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster has recently written to all ministerial heads of Department to ensure that they are aware of the arrangements which exist for dealing with the year 2000 date change problem.
<P>

<a name="70602w05.html_para1">From within the Cabinet Office (OPS) departments are supported by the Central Information Technology Unit (CITU) and the Central Computer and Telecommunications Agency (CCTA). As part of that support CITU and CCTA have identified a programme of action to ensure that the Government's response to the year 2000 problem is co-ordinated and coherent. This involves each department in producing a detailed and costed action plan by October to ensure that all their systems are modified and tested by January 1999.
<P>

 The position of Eastern Caribbean banana imports into the EU market is closely related to the special provisions of the EU banana regime.

To ask the President of the Board of Trade what is the current level of taxation being levied by Japan on <i>(a)</i> Scotch whisky and <i>(b)</i> scochi; and if he will make a statement on convergence of taxation. [1365]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70602w06.html_spnew13"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 As the question asks about convergence of liquor tax rates in Japan, a clear reference to the recent dispute over Japan's discriminatory taxation of foreign spirits compared with Japanese shochu, this answer assumes that the reference to "scochi" is a mistranscription of "shochu".
<P>

<a name="70602w06.html_para2">The current level of taxation levied by Japan on Scotch whisky of 40&#176; of alcohol is 982,300 Yen per kilolitre (=Y/KL) and on shochu of 25&#176; of alcohol is 155,700 =Y/KL. However, as a result of negotiations between the EU and Japan to end discriminatory taxation of foreign spirits, the taxation on Scotch whisky will fall by 44 per cent. on 1 October 1997 to 551,000 =Y/KL and fall again on 1 October 1998 to 409,000 =Y/KL. Taxation on shochu will rise on 1 October 1997 to 201,900 =Y/KL and rise again on 1 October 1998 to 248,100 =Y/KL. A further transition period is granted for one type of shochu (shochu B). This will mean that once these changes are fully implemented the tax differential on a tax rate per kilolitre per degree of alcohol basis will be reduced from around 600 per cent. to just 3 per cent. for Scotch whisky, whilst taxation rates for shochu and white spirits will be equalised. The Scotch Whisky Association estimate that this will be worth some &#163;75 million every year.
<P>

<a name="70602w06.html_para3">Furthermore, the WTO ruling obtained in reaching this settlement provides a useful precedent for tackling discriminatory taxation in other countries. As a result, the EU is already undertaking WTO consultations with the South Korean Government and have proposed initiating WTO consultations with Chile.

 The Northern Ireland Office is based in both London and Northern Ireland, and employs staff from the Home Civil Service and the Northern Ireland Civil Service groups. Monitoring of ethnic origin is currently limited to Home Civil Service employees in Great Britain. As at 5 May 1997, there were eight employees, up to Grade 7, out of an eligible monitoring group of 108, who had identified themselves as being of Asian origin.

 The Northern Ireland Office staff group includes 108 Home Civil Service employees based in London who are eligible for ethnic monitoring. Over the last three years there has been a 6 per cent. increase, to 19.5 per cent., in the number of employees who have identified themselves as being of Black or Asian origin. Recruitment sources have included inter-departmental trawis, absorption of surplus staff from other departments and the use of the Recruitment and Assessment Service instant recruitment scheme. The Northern Ireland Office will continue to use all of these methods to meet its obligations to recruit on the basis of fair and open competition.

 The National Lottery Charities Board has already announced 446 grants with a total value of &#163;66 million for projects to assist homeless people. Its fifth grant programme, targeted at improving people's living environment, specifically aims to tackle homelessness and its effects.

 To date, 4 per cent. of the &#163;3.373 billion awarded by National Lottery distributing bodies has been for projects in the East Midlands. It is clear that some areas of the country have benefited a great deal more from the Lottery than others. We will be looking at the reasons for this as part of our overall review of Lottery distribution and considering what changes might be made as a result.

 The selection of the winning numbers in the National Lottery is a random process and any claim that a commercial product will improve the chances of winning must therefore be false. There are products available which aim to assist players in choosing their numbers randomly. It is a matter for players to decide whether or not they wish to purchase such products.

 The latest information published by the Environment Agency shows that 91.4 per cent. of Welsh rivers are classified as good quality; 6.9 per cent. as fair; with only 1.7 per cent. classed as poor or bad quality. This compares with similar percentages of 59.5, 31.5 and 9.0 for the whole of England and Wales.

 I have considered representations about the continuing difficulties that local authorities in Wales are facing in preparing for the reintroduction of Compulsory Competitive Tendering (CCT) given the pressures of reorganisation. I am of the view that I should take action to relieve these difficulties.
<P>

<a name="70602w09.html_para1">I intend to consult widely on a range of measures which I have in mind to achieve this objective while maintaining the pressure on local authorities to secure efficiencies in the delivery of services.
<P>

<a name="70602w09.html_para2">I propose to extend the moratorium on CCT until 1 October 1998.
<P>

<a name="70602w09.html_para3">Under the terms of the current moratorium, CCT has been generally suspended for work subject to the Local Government, Planning and Land Act 1980 (the 1980 Act) and for activities covered by the Local Government Act 1988 (the 1988 Act). Throughout the moratorium period, CCT has continued to apply to works of construction under the 1980 Act where the value of the work exceeds &#163;500,000. Under my proposals this requirement will continue to apply during the extended moratorium.
<P>

<a name="70602w09.html_para4">I will also continue to require local authorities to produce annual reports and to meet the financial objective specified under current CCT legislation (the 1980 and 1988 Acts) where work is carried out in-house during the

<P>

<a name="70602w09.html_para5">Under my proposals, on which I shall be consulting, CCT would be reintroduced from October 1998 for further elements of work covered by the 1980 Act. The purpose would be to extend the range of work beyond those large construction contracts which were subject to CCT under the terms of the moratorium. CCT for the remainder of work subject to the 1980 Act, and all activities subject to the 1988 Act, would be implemented on a phased and manageable basis during 1999.
<P>

<a name="70602w09.html_para6">With colleagues, I will be reviewing the existing CCT framework and will reassess the arrangements proposed for Wales in the light of the outcome of that review.
<P>

<a name="70602w09.html_para7">Our Manifesto gave a commitment to replace CCT with a duty on local authorities to achieve best value.

The committee concluded that the evidence that caffeine or coffee consumption may contribute to the development of coronary heart disease (CHD) remains inconsistent and that coffee drinking as practised in the United Kingdom does not appear to affect CHD risk. The Department is aware of more recent Scandinavian research on the capacity of some components present in unfiltered, boiled coffee to raise blood cholesterol, and on the effect of method of preparation on its content of them. Given the different coffee drinking patterns in the UK, it is not clear whether this Scandinavian research is relevant to the incidence of heart disease in the UK.

<a name="70602w11.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 Dr. Myddleton's letter contains outdated information on concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon compounds in London air. Current concentrations are less than 1 ng/m <sup>3</sup>  (annual average) compared with 26-39 ng/m <sup>3</sup>  (annual average concentration) in 1962. The risk to health posed by carcinogens in urban air is very much smaller than that posed by cigarette smoking.

<a name="70602w11.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 The carcinogenic effects of benzo(a)pyrene were examined by the Department of Health Committee on the Carcinogenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment (COC) in 1994. The Committee's conclusions were published in the COC Annual Report, copies of which have been placed in the Library. An updated assessment will be published in the 1996 Annual Report. The major sources of benzo(a)pyrene and other polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon compounds in the air are the various forms of combustion of fossil fuels including, in urban areas, motor vehicles.

independent review of the Energy Efficiency Best Practice Programme. The review, which was completed in 1996, concluded that the programme is an effective means of generating energy savings; comprehensively covers UK industry and buildings stock; and is well managed. The report on the review is scheduled for publication in the next few weeks and a copy will be placed in the Libraries of both Houses.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what estimate he has made for each metropolitan borough of the money available from <i>(a)</i> housing capital receipts and <i>(b)</i> other capital receipts to finance a housing programme. [1506]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70602w13.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 Local authorities have usable capital receipts which are available for any capital purpose (including housing). The accumulated and unspent usable capital receipts held by each metropolitan borough as at 31 March 1996 are set out in the table below. The table also shows the total of housing receipts set aside by these authorities between 1990-91 and 1995-96. However, individual authorities may have used these set aside receipts to repay debt or in lieu of further borrowing, however, and so may no longer retain them in the form of cash and investments.
<P>

<a name="70602w13.html_para1">We will be consulting the Local Government Association and local authorities on the Government's Capital Receipts initiative in due course. No decision about the basis on which resources are to be distributed to individual authorities will be made until that consultation process is complete.

 Between 1990-91 and 1995-96, the value of housing receipts set aside from the sale of local authority housing and associated land in England was &#163;5,283 million. The corresponding figure for Manchester was &#163;63.0 million and for Trafford &#163;10.3 million. However, individual authorities may have used these receipts to repay debt or in lieu of further borrowing and so may no longer retain them in the form of cash and investments.

 We have no immediate plans to remove the bar on the application of social housing grant to the improvement of former British Coal properties, although we intend to look again at this issue. Any reconsideration of the policy will, however, need to take into account the wider issues of using grant to pay for repairs or improvements to stock transferred to housing associations from ex public sector landlords, and will need to ensure that any such expenditure represents good value for money.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what action he proposes to take to replace compulsory competitive tendering with a duty on local authorities to achieve best value. [1775]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70602w14.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Armstrong: </B> 
 Well run local authorities which deliver high standard services are vital to the quality of people's lives. We are therefore very keen to press ahead with our Manifesto commitment to replace Compulsory Competitive Tendering (CCT) with a duty on local authorities to achieve best value and we will make this change as soon as Parliamentary time allows. We are using the interim period to talk to local government, the business community and others to ensure that the new framework is efficient and imaginative, but realistic, and makes the most of what local authorities, the private sector and the local community can contribute.
<P>

<a name="70602w14.html_para2">Achieving best value will not just be about economy and efficiency, but also about effectiveness and the quality of local services. The new framework will be a demanding challenge to local authorities, seeking continuous improvements in service costs and quality. It will be a permissive framework which emphasises local choices and local accountability. But it will also ensure that every local authority makes improvements. I am today writing to the Local Government Association to consult them on a draft statement of principles about best value which encapsulate these points. A copy of this letter will be placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="70602w14.html_para3">We intend to encourage authorities to develop the principles of best value and pursue innovative approaches to service delivery in advance of primary legislation on best value. We have therefore agreed with the Local Government Association that Government will seek, where possible and within the existing statutory framework, to relax CCT for a selected number of authorities on condition that they follow a best value regime. We will set out shortly criteria against which authorities' bids will be considered--including a requirement to publish the authority's plans for improving the quality of services, enhancing efficiency and reducing costs to the taxpayers. The criteria will also reflect our view that competition will be an important management tool and test of best value, but that it will not be the only such tool.
<P>

<a name="70602w14.html_para4">Because the bulk of local authorities will continue to be subject to the existing CCT regime, we will also carry out an urgent review of existing regulations and guidance to make it work better and, to the extent that it is consistent with existing CCT legislation, introduce elements of best value. The Review, which will take 4-6 weeks, will be carried out in consultation with the LGA and other interested parties. Among other matters we will specifically be considering the question of timetables, including those for authorities who are subject to recent reorganisation. The Government will then consult on proposals with a view to laying new regulations and 



<P>
<P><I>2 Jun 1997 : Column: 50</I><P>
guidance in the summer. In the meantime, local authorities must continue to plan for meeting existing statutory obligations.
<P>

<a name="70602w14.html_para5">We have an open mind on whether services are delivered by the private sector or directly within the public sector. Either way there needs to be an effective partnership, and fair and open competition where this is called for. To achieve this, we accept that direct service organisations should be able to compete for work where it makes sense to do so. So we are reviewing the framework within which local authorities carry out work for others. We are also to review the restriction on factors which local authorities can take into account in awarding contracts consistent with our obligations under European Community rules.
<P>

<a name="70602w14.html_para6">These proposals should leave no doubt that Government intends to pursue a rigorous alternative approach to the improvement of local services, confident of its success in partnership with local government and the private sector.

<a name="70602w15.html_spnew9"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 The Review of Water and Sewerage Law carried out in 1986 considered responsibilities for water supply pipes and lateral drains which link properties to the public sewer. We have no plans at present for water companies to take over ownership of that part of the water pipe or lateral drain which is the responsibility of the householder. But we have recently announced that we expect all water companies to provide a free leakage detection and repair service for supply pipes. All private sewers and drains must be constructed to the standard laid down in the Building Regulations. If they are to be adopted as public sewers by the sewerage undertaker they must be built to the set requirements used by all undertakers which are of a higher standard. We have no plans at present to make any changes to the current legislation with regard to the adoption of private sewers.

 The Government is keen to encourage employers from both the public and private sector to find ways of reducing the impact on the environment of their employees' travel patterns, particularly their commuting journeys. One of the ways in which employers can do this is to introduce company travel plans for their employees. A growing number of organisations in the UK have already successfully implemented programmes of this nature, for example, Boots, BAA and Nottinghamshire County Council. A travel plan will soon be introduced at Stockley Park. Many local authorities are working with businesses to develop similar measures as part of their TravelWise programmes. The Government will attach a high priority 



<P>
<P><I>2 Jun 1997 : Column: 55</I><P>
to promoting the introduction of more company travel plans. To this end, we have been working with Transport 2000 on their document, "Changing Journeys to Work: an employers' guide to green commuting plans" which we are helping to launch on 4 June 1997.

 Objectives received following the publication of a draft Order to de-trunk the A40 through Cheltenham and to trunk the A436 from the A40 at Shipton Solers to the A417 at Air Balloon roundabout are currently being considered. The timescale for the de-trunking depends on the possible need for a public inquiry.

 <i>[holding answer 22 May 1997]:</i> I am keen to press ahead with our Manifesto commitment to replace Compulsory Competitive Tendering with a new best value regime. After discussion with Scottish local government, I plan to move ahead quickly to develop the elements of this regime. Competitive discipline will form an important part of the new regime, but will no longer be the only method by which value for money in local government is improved.

<a name="70602w18.html_para0">I therefore intend to lay Regulations as soon as possible to suspend for a further year the planned reintroduction of CCT under both the Local Government Planning, and Land Act 1980 and the Local Government Act 1988. The statutory basis of the system will remain in place to be reactivated after July 1998 as necessary. White collar CCT, including housing management, would then be scheduled to start on or after April 1999. The suspension of CCT will allow time to start developing an alternative system to demonstrate best value in the provision of all council services. Authorities who are able to demonstrate significant progress towards achieving the key elements of the new best value regime will be able to apply for continued exemption, on an individual basis, from aspects of the CCT regime. In the meantime, however, I have made it clear that I expect councils to deal responsibly with tenders they have under way, consistent with their statutory duty to make proper arrangements for securing economy, efficiency and effectiveness in the provision of services. Decisions on the award of contracts will be subject to audit in the usual way.
<P>

<a name="70602w18.html_para1">I have agreed with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities that a task force of officials from the Scottish Office, COSLA and the Accounts Commission for Scotland will develop the key elements of a best value approach. The first meeting of the task force will take place today.
<P>

<a name="70602w18.html_para2">Because of the immediate pressure on authorities from the existing timetable for the reintroduction of CCT in Scotland I indicated how I intended to proceed at a meeting with COSLA on 27 May. I have placed a copy of the relevant press statement in the Library.

 The report by the Higher Education Funding Council for England on the influence of neighbourhood type on participation in higher education points out that the variation of participation in higher education by social group is closely related to educational achievement up to 18 years of age. The report, which has been submitted to the Dearing Inquiry into Higher Education, confirms the need for action to be taken to improve standards in schools. The Government has put the raising of standards for all pupils at the heart of its agenda for change. It has set clear targets for literacy and numeracy, namely that by the end of this Parliament every child should reach the appropriate National Curriculum levels for age 11. If these demanding targets are met, the educational opportunities for all children will be greatly improved, especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds who hitherto have often under-achieved. A copy of the report will be available shortly and will be placed in the Library.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70602w21.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Byers </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 20 May 1997]:</i> Under the Government's proposed new framework of foundation, community and aided schools, grant-maintained status would no longer exist. There is thus no further need to allocate public funds to the Grant-Maintained Schools Foundation to provide information and advice to schools about GM status. The Foundation's chairman has been informed that grant will cease at the end of June. It is for the Foundation in the first instance to consider the consequences for its employees. Provision of &#163;840,000 was made for the Foundation's grant in the Department's estimates for this financial year. &#163;213,000 is being paid as grant up until the end of June.

Care should be taken at all times and walking in city streets should be avoided at night. Use taxis wherever possible. Colombian terrorists and narcotic gangs are active in regions bordering Colombia where there has been a recent increase in kidnappings.

<P>
<a name="70602w23.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson: </B> 
 Article 118 and 119 of the draft IGC treaty would not have any direct cost implications in themselves.

 Draft Article Fa would provide a mechanism for determining whether sanctions could be imposed on a member State.

 The Presidency's draft revised article F would emphasise the principle that the European Union is founded on, and should respect, fundamental rights.

 This Department's leaflet on British Consular Services Abroad is available in large print. We also provide an automated telephone answering service providing recorded travel advice on destinations which give rise to the most enquiries. Advice on other destinations is available from the Travel Advice Unit whose members can read out the advice or provide hard copies in large print. We are currently discussing with the RNIB how we can best publicise these services through RNIB publications. Other publications aimed at an overseas audience are not available in Braille, audio tape or large print.

 The Government propose that the Governor and the two Deputy Governors will be appointed for five year terms. The non-Executive Members of the Court will be appointed for three year terms. The Government's decision to give the Bank operational responsibility for setting interest rates is a British solution, designed to meet British domestic needs for stability.

 The wholesale financial sector will be immediately affected by introduction of the single currency, whether or not the United Kingdom participates. Preparations in this sector are now advanced. The need for preparations by other businesses depends on whether the United Kingdom adopts the single currency, and the sector in which they operate, given that the introduction of banknotes and coins will take place about three years after participating countries adopt the euro. My impression is that the preparedness of companies varies, though I have no estimate of the number of firms by industrial sector which are making preparations.

 In the event of the introduction of an EU wide ban of furs from animals caught by leghold traps, fur imports from third countries will be subjected to regulatory checks by Customs making full use of their electronic entry processing system and to appropriate anti-smuggling activities.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70602w24.html_spnew14"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 Once a building society has converted to a bank, the new company is obliged to issue certificates to its shareholders, unless the shares are dematerialised. Where this is so, the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 1995 requires that new shares are issued in uncertificated form only to those who are system members of CREST. As this requires positive action, the default position is that newly converted societies are obliged to issue shareholders with certificates, unless they have elected to become members of CREST, and receive uncertificated shares. So the question of an obligation to inform shareholders that they are entitled to a certificate does not arise.
<P>

<a name="70602w24.html_para1">In addition, shareholders are free to elect a nominee to hold shares on their behalf. Those who do so would also not receive a certificate, even if the shares have not been dematerialised, because they are registered in the name of the nominee, not the shareholder.

The Chancellor of the Exchequer has asked me to reply as the Director of the Office for National Statistics (ONS) to your recent question asking how many of those eligible to vote he estimates were not registered to vote at the time of (a) the 1987 General Election, (b) the 1992 General Election and (c) the 1997 General Election.

There is not enough information to give a reliable figure for those missing from the Electoral Register. It is not possible to compare registration figures with estimates of the resident population directly because these two sources are not compiled on the same basis. The differences between the coverage of the Electoral Registers and the mid year population estimates have been published in Appendix B to the ONS publication '1996 Electoral Statistics' series EL no. 23, a copy of which is attached.
<BR>
An approximate figure has been calculated for the UK resident population who were eligible to vote in 1987 and 1992 and, relative to the number of electors registered in 1987 and 1992, this suggests that 2.6% and 4.5% of those eligible to vote were not registered in these two years respectively.
<BR>
An estimate cannot be made for those registered at the time of the 1997 General Election because mid year estimates for the resident population at the preceding mid year are not yet available. This will be possible to do when the ONS publish the 1996 mid year population estimates which is planned for August 1997.

(20) Persons aged 17 and over, together with 63 per cent of those aged 16, who became 18 during the period when each register was in use. No account has been taken of adults who died between the mid-year reference date for population estimates and the 10 October qualifying date for the following year's electoral register.<P>

<P>

The ratios in the final column suggest that coverage of the electoral register has been steady in recent years, after a decline in the period between 1986 and 1991. However, these ratios need to be treated with care and do not represent the proportion of eligible persons who were on the register at their qualifying address for a number of reasons:<P>

the electoral register (the numerator) contains some redundant entries for people who had already moved elsewhere or died at the time when it was compiled but whose names were nonetheless carried forward to a new register;<P>

the electoral register contains some legitimate dual registrations, for example by students and owners of second homes;<P>

the electoral register, but not the population estimates (the denominator) includes overseas voters and service voters who are living abroad; the population estimates include residents who were ineligible to be on the electoral register because they were neither British Commonwealth nor Republic of Ireland citizens.<P>





<P>

The effects of these various factors, which operate upon the ratios in both directions, are not known precisely.<P>

A small sample survey (Electoral registration in 1991--S. Smith, ONS (1993)) carried out by ONS following the 1991 Census of Population gave a central estimate of 92.9 per cent. (standard error 0.36 per cent.) for the proportion of eligible residents in Great Britain who were registered as electors at their usual addresses. This figure needs qualification, too. It relates to people who lived in private households, and it does not cover people who were not enumerated in the Census. On the implausibly extreme assumption that all people missed by the Census were also missing from the electoral register where they lived the proportion of eligible people covered by the latter could have been as low as 91.0 per cent.<P>

Those living in London, attainers and young adults, people who had changed their residence within the last year, New Commonwealth citizens in the non-white ethnic groups, and those living in rented accommodation were all found more likely than other people to be missing from the electoral registers.<P>

ONS produce two measures of unemployment. The first, derived from the quarterly Labour Force Survey (LFS), is defined on a consistent and internationally recognised basis set out by the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and counts as unemployed people who are: a) without a paid job; b) available to start work within the next two weeks and c) have either looked for work in the last four weeks or are waiting to start a job already obtained.
<BR>
ONS also publishes the monthly claimant count, which is based on the administrative system and includes all people claiming unemployment-related benefits (i.e. Jobseekers Allowance, Income Support or National Insurance credits) at Employment Service offices on the day of the monthly count, who on that day had signed on as unemployed and available to do any suitable work. Essentially, all people who attend an Employment Service office to sign are counted, irrespective of whether they are actually receiving benefit.

Amongst households with a pensioner head, the average gain is slightly under &#163;16 per annum. The VAT fuel subsidy was designed to compensate pensioners and other vulnerable groups with average spending on fuel and power. If the subsidy were reduced to directly reflect the reduced expenditure on fuel and power there would, on average, be no net gain or loss.

<a name="70602w28.html_para0">Until November 1994, with the exception of BSE and scrapie, none of the other TSEs were notifiable. On the other hand, the Government believe that most cases of TSE have been reported to Agriculture Departments and epidemiological investigations have been carried out where possible. With respect to exotic ruminants, risk of infection was primarily associated with consumption of feed, often produced for cattle, which contained meat and bone meal (MBM). With respect to exotic felines and domestic cats, the risk was considered to be associated with consumption of central nervous system tissue which could legally be fed to them until it was banned in September 1990.

<UL>(2) if a risk assessment, with special reference to the effect on the water table, is being undertaken regarding the disposal of carcases with BSE at the Darrington Leys quarry. [970]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70602w28.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 In the early years of the BSE epidemic, incineration capacity was insufficient to deal with all the cattle involved. Therefore, during the summer of 1988 this department approached North Yorkshire County Council seeking licensed landfill facilities for disposal of BSE suspect cattle. At that time, the County Council was responsible as a waste disposal authority for the granting and supervision of licences under Part I of the Control of Pollution Act 1974. Following an assessment by the authority of the landfill sites then in its ownership, Darrington Leys Quarry was identified by the authority as suitable for the disposal of waste of this kind. The Ministry's records, cross checked with those available to the Environment Agency, indicate that the carcases of fewer than 40 cattle affected, or suspected of being affected, with BSE were disposed of at the Darrington Leys Quarry landfill site between August 1988 and July 1990.
<P>

<a name="70602w28.html_para2">In May last year a sub-group of the independent Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee (SEAC), which advises Ministers on BSE, considered the issue of BSE and the environment, including the past disposal of BSE suspect cattle to landfill. It considered that although the spongiform encephalopathy agent was not yet fully characterised, there was good evidence to believe that individual molecules were not infectious and that infectivity was associated with macro molecular agglomerations indeed possibly with tissue fragments, albeit small ones. On this basis they concluded <i></i>it was unlikely that leachate from landfill sites would present a significant risk and there was certainly no justification for taking heroic measures to excavate sites, even those which had previously been used for material such as BSE-confirmed cattle.
<P>

<a name="70602w28.html_para3">The Environment Agency has regulatory responsibility for supervising the safe operation of landfill sites and is in possession of SEAC's advice. The Agency monitors ground water quality in the vicinity of licensed landfill sites as a check for any leachate contamination. The Agency, not this department, is assessing data in respect of all the sites concerned and, in quantitative terms, on a typical selection of identified sites to determine whether there is a possibility of impact on water quality. The Agency is progressing this as quickly as possible and are seeking the views of SEAC on the approach taken.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food how many of the cattle buried at Darrington Leys quarry near Cridling Stubbs were subsequently proved to be carrying the BSE virus following tests by his Department. [968]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70602w28.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 Compulsory slaughter of all suspects, with compensation, was introduced from August 1988. Under these arrangements the heads of suspects were removed from the carcases for confirmation of the presence, or otherwise, of BSE and were subsequently incinerated. No BSE suspects have been disposed of by landfilling since 1991, when sufficient carcase incineration capacity came on stream to process the number of cases that were coming forward.




<P>
<P><I>2 Jun 1997 : Column: 102</I><P>

<P>

<a name="70602w28.html_para4">The carcases of fewer than 40 cattle affected, or suspected of being affected, with BSE were disposed of at the Darrington Leys quarry. To establish from records how many of those cattle had BSE would involve disproportionate costs. However, we know from total national figures for BSE suspects that approximately 75 per cent. of cases examined subsequently prove positive. Applying this rate to the cases landfilled at Darrington Leys quarry would suggest that fewer than 30 of the cattle would have been confirmed cases.

<P>

 The estimated cost of the selective cull quoted in my reply of 21 May assumes 100,000 animals are slaughtered. It encompasses compensation, disposal and operating costs, but does not take account of EC receipts and consequential savings to the OTMS.

 The information requested is not yet available for the current year. Most farmers have only recently submitted their 1997 IACS applications which detail the areas they have set aside. However, the figures for 1996, as compiled by the European Commission, are given in the following table. The obligatory set-aside rate in 1996 was 10 per cent. but under the Arable Area Payments Scheme (AAPS) small scale producers do not have to set land aside. In addition, farmers may enter more than the minimum 10 per cent. of their arable area into set-aside if they wish.

[1434]<P>

<P>
<a name="70602w29.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 MAFF has carried out monitoring for radioactivity in marine materials from around the Channel Islands since 1965, and from around the Hurd Deep itself since 1989. Materials sampled include fish, shellfish, seaweed, sediments and seawater. Results of this monitoring are compiled and published annually along with other result's of MAFF's programme for monitoring levels of radioactivity in the marine environment around the UK. Copies of these publications are placed in the Library of the House. The results show that man-made radioactivity around the Channel Islands is detectable but that levels are very low and give no cause for concern.
<P>

<P>
<a name="70602w29.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Between 1950 and 1963, around 15,720 tonnes of radioactive waste was disposed of in the Hurd Deep. Most of this material originated from the UKAEA facility at Harwell, and it contained, in total, around 14.6 TBq of alpha activity and 47.0 TBq of beta and gamma activity. All of this waste was categorised at the time as low level. It is possible that very small amounts of waste which today would be regarded as intermediate level were included, but the overall levels of radioactivity in the material are low. Exposure of Channel Islanders to man-made radiation is less than 3 per cent. of the

 Levels of technetium -99 in lobsters from the Irish Sea close to BNFL Sellafield are reported in the MAFF report--Radioactivity in Food and the Environment, 1995. The average level in lobsters was 8,300 Bq/kg in 1995. In 1996 the level rose to 17,900 Bq/kg in the second quarter and then reduced to 6,430 Bq/kg in the last quarter. The annual radiation exposure to the most exposed group associated with lobster consumption was 18Sv in 1995 and 29Sv/year in 1996. This can be compared with the public dose limit of 1000Sv/year and presents no food safety concerns.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70602w30.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 There are no plans to review the need for the Maidenhead, Windsor and Eton Flood Alleviation Scheme, which was the subject of a detailed local public inquiry in 1992. The Inspector at the inquiry concluded that there was a compelling need for the scheme to proceed in order to provide protection to some 4,800 households, 700 commercial buildings and major communications links. Also, this Department was satisfied that the Environment Agency's proposed works met the technical, environmental and economic criteria for grant aid.
<P>

<a name="70602w30.html_para0">The possible impact of climate change has been fully considered by the Environment Agency during scheme design. Although there has been a trend towards lower average rainfall in southern England in recent years, studies related to global climate change suggest a possible increase in the frequency and severity of extreme events of the type against which this scheme is intended to provide protection. Whilst there is insufficient evidence to quantify any such changes at present, it would clearly be inappropriate to design the scheme for anything less than the flood conditions experienced in the past 50 years.

<P>
<a name="70602w31.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Field: </B> 
 Under the last Government the bills from social and economic failure led to spiralling Social Security costs. We plan to reverse that pattern, beginning with our programme to help young people and the long term unemployed to move from welfare to work.

 We shall consider the impact of the Welfare to Work programme on the Department's expenditure plans as we work up the detail of the various schemes. By improving the standards and skills of the workforce we would expect savings in the longer term.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70602w31.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Keith Bradley: </B> 
 The Government believe that the best way to help lone mothers is to provide them with help which enables them to move off benefit and into work. This is a high priority. Most lone mothers want to work and we will give them opportunities to do so as part of our welfare to work programme. We will also implement a national childcare strategy which will match the provision of childcare to the needs of the modern labour market. This will help parents, especially lone mothers, to balance family and working life.

<a name="70602w31.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Field: </B> 
 It is important that we do everything we can to help young people out of benefit dependency and into work. One of our first priorities is to get the New Deal up and running--this will give 250,000 under 25-year-olds, unemployed for over 6 months, opportunities for work, education and training.

 We will retain the basic state pension as the foundation of security in retirement provision; it has a vital part to play in providing a decent standard of living in retirement. We will increase it at least in line with prices.

 The poorest pensioners in Britain include the 810,000 to 1,100,000 who do not take up their entitlement to Income Support. We want to get help to them and are commissioning research to establish why they do not claim the Income Support to which is their due.

 The information is not available in the format requested.
<P>

<a name="70602w32.html_para0">The income levels of benefit recipients vary widely and, in particular, benefits which are not income-related are spread across the income distribution. Information on the distribution of benefit expenditure by household income of recipient is given in the 1997 Social Security Departmental Report, page 47. Information on the numbers of individuals reporting income-related benefit receipt by position in the income distribution is provided in Table G of 'Households Below Average Income'; the analysis for 1979 to 1993-94 was published in November 1996. The Council of Europe decency threshold relates to individual earnings, but the income levels of recipients of benefits are more appropriately measured as total income on a benefit unit or household basis as they are in the publications listed above. It is therefore not meaningful to compare these income levels with the Council of Europe threshold.
