<P>
<a name="70729w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mrs. Shephard: </B> 
To ask the Prime Minister what are the precedents for the new Joint Consultative Cabinet Committee; what will be its membership; who will provide the secretariat; what charge it will make on public funds; how often it will meet; to whom it will report, and at what intervals; and if he intends that it should serve for the duration of this Parliament. [10582]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70729w01.html_spmin2"><B>The Prime Minister</B> 
 <i>[holding answer 28 July 1997]:</i> There are several precedents for the new Committee, including the 1931 Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence. A later example was the Sub-Committee on Air Defence Research (1935-37). The membership of the Committee will be announced in due course. The secretariat will be provided by the Cabinet Secretariat. Costs related to the Committee are expected to be small and will be met from existing resources. The Committee will meet on a regular basis and, like other Cabinet Committees, its deliberations will be reported to Cabinet as necessary. I expect it to continue indefinitely.

 Enforcement of the rest period requirements of EU directive 95/29 is the responsibility of the authorities of the member state in which a rest is required to take place. For our own part, the Government will not hesitate to use the sanctions provided by the directive against transporters who are shown to have made false declarations about the journeys they have undertaken.

<a name="70729w01.html_para0">The Protection of Animals Act 1911 protects domestic and captive animals from cruelty. Exotic animals kept for farming purposes are further protected by the Agriculture (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1968 which makes it an offence to cause or allow unnecessary pain or unnecessary distress. The keeping of certain exotic species is also subject to the licensing requirements of the Dangerous Wild Animals Act 1976.

<P>
<a name="70729w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The UK has made a number of representations to the Commission about the future operation of the calf processing aid scheme and the early marketing scheme for veal, which were introduced by the Commission with the objective of reducing beef production. Under EU law, member states are obliged to operate one or both of the schemes. In May, the Commission undertook to provide the Council of Agriculture Ministers with a further report on the effectiveness of both schemes in the light of experience. I understand that the report is likely to be submitted to the Council of Agriculture Ministers in September.<i></i>

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what representations he has made to the European Commission on increased flexibility on non-food crops to be grown on set-aside land which qualifies for integrated administration and control system, IACS, payments. [11334]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70729w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 A wide range of crops may be grown on set-aside land for specific non-food uses. The European Commission has recently amended the detailed rules which apply to this aspect of the arable area payments scheme to make them more flexible in some respects. The Commission regulation concerned is expected to be published shortly and interested parties have been advised of the changes to the rules.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70729w01.html_wqn13"><B> Mr. Curry: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what estimate he has made of <i>(a)</i> the backlog of cattle awaiting slaughter under the over-30-months scheme as a result of the reduction in the number of designated abattoirs and <i>(b)</i> the total loss to farmers through being unable to get cattle slaughtered before the new price and weight regime applies in August.[11252]




<P>
<P><I>29 Jul 1997 : Column: 116</I><P>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70729w01.html_spnew5"><B> Dr. John Cunningham: </B> 
 There is no backlog of over-30-months scheme cattle awaiting slaughter as a result of the reduction in the number of abattoirs. In the months of July and August, around 15,000 over-30-months cattle are normally slaughtered each week, and the Intervention Board has made available the capacity to handle 16,000 OTMS cattle a week in the scheme abattoirs.
<P>

<a name="70729w01.html_para1">The reduction in the rate of compensation and the introduction of a weight limit, which are effective from 4 August, has resulted in significantly increased demand for the scheme because some farmers have brought forward their cull plans to try and benefit from the existing compensation arrangements. The Intervention Board has increased the amount of scheme slaughtering capacity by around 20 per cent. in the two weeks immediately preceding the rate change to assist producers, and has also issued instructions to scheme abattoirs to ensure, as far as possible, that producers are treated equitably and fairly. It is inevitable that some producers will be disappointed, but it would have been self-defeating for the Government to support a reduction in the scheme rate, and at the same time, take steps to minimise the number of cattle adversely affected by it.
<P>

<a name="70729w01.html_para2">The effect of the change in the scheme rate and the introduction of a weight restriction will reduce the return for a dairy cow weighting 560 kg by around &#163;40, and for a suckler cow weighing 620 kg by around &#163;80.
<P>
<P>
<a name="70729w01.html_wqn14"><B> Mr. Curry: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food how many abattoirs are authorised in England and Wales to carry out slaughtering of cattle under the over-30-months scheme; and if he will list the abattoirs which charge for haulage and the amounts charged in each case. [11246]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70729w01.html_spnew6"><B> Dr. Cunningham: </B> 
 Following a recent tender, the Intervention Board has let contracts to 22 abattoirs in England and Wales to slaughter animals under the over-30-months scheme. The contracted abattoirs collectively carry more than sufficient capacity for the number of animals expected to enter the scheme, with reserve capacity available to deal with seasonal fluctuations. 
<P>

<a name="70729w01.html_para3">The fee paid to the abattoirs covers the slaughter and subsequent dressing of the animals to the agency's specification, and the administration costs involved in handling OTMS animals. It does not include the cost of transporting cattle to the point of slaughter, which remains the responsibility of the farmer. Most abattoirs provide a chargeable service, on request.
<P>

<a name="70729w01.html_para4">Information about these charges is currently being collated as part of the contract process and the chief executive of the Intervention Board will write to the right hon. Member shortly to provide the information requested.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Minister has asked me to reply to your question about the number of civil servants on each payband in his Department, insofar as it relates to the Veterinary Medicines Directorate (VMD), which is a Next Steps Agency of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>As the Minister explained in his reply, only staff in the Senior Civil Service (SCS) are paid on paybands. The VMD employs two SCS Staff in payband 1, and one in payband 4. These three staff were included in the Minister's reply.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The pay for all other VMD staff is currently determined by reference to the same pay ranges and pay spines used within core-MAFF. These will be rationalised in line with the Department's 1997 pay offer, which has yet to be agreed.</FONT></UL>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>As Chief Executive of the Meat Hygiene Service (MHS) your Parliamentary Question to the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food enquiring how many civil servants there are on each pay band has been passed to me to reply; with regard to this Executive Agency.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>As you may be aware the MHS was established on 1 April 1995 as an Executive Agency of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF). It took over responsibility from local authorities for enforcing meat hygiene, inspection and animal welfare at slaughter legislation in licensed fresh meat premises in England, Scotland and Wales.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The MHS employs over 1,000 meat inspection and veterinary staff. The majority of these staff transferred to the MHS from local authorities under the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Legislation. The MHS does not have paybands equivalent to those in the Civil Service. I therefore list below the number of staff employed by the MHS according to various salary bands. This also includes the administrative and management staff of the Agency.</FONT></UL>

<a name="70729w03.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 At the July Agriculture Council, a simple majority of member states supported Commission proposals for EU-wide controls on specified materials from cattle, sheep and goats. As a result, the way is now clear for the Commission, acting on its own competence, to adopt the measure which will come into force on 1 January. It is therefore no longer necessary for the UK to introduce any unilateral measures in this area as all European beef will be subject to rigorous controls similar to those that we already have in the UK.

 There have been no reforms to the CAP during the past three years which were designed to reduce budgetary expenditure. However, reforms to the rice regime in 1995 and to the fruit and vegetables regime in 1996 will progressively reduce price support, with consequent benefits for consumers.

<a name="70729w04.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Milburn: </B> 
 Information is not collated by the Department on individual trusts' plans for hospital waiting times. The Government have inherited a situation where 39 of 100 health authorities have contracted for longer maximum waiting times in 1997-98 than in 1996-97, whereas only three have contracted for shorter maximum waiting times.

 The National Health Service Litigation Authority holds data on all cases reported to it in respect of the clinical negligence scheme for trusts and on cases falling within the existing liabilities scheme where approval has been sought from the authority to settle claims. The information is principally concerned with the handling of claims, but the authority has commissioned work to provide a comprehensive database system which will contain individual claims by type, size and level of legal costs.

 We recognise that the more severe forms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder can be treated with Ritalin or other appropriate medication. Such medication should be part of a comprehensive treatment programme which may also include psychological, educational and social measures designed to stabilise children with the condition. There is a widespread view among clinicians in this country that a higher percentage of such children are treated with medication in the United States than is desirable or necessary.

 Recent research has shown that most people do not like the idea of putting "skin", "bone" or other specified tissues--as distinct from internal organs--on the donor card or national health service organ donor register form because of fears about disfigurement of the body.

In the autumn we shall consult on guidance to LEAs on their duty under the Education Act 1997 to draw up, consult upon and publish a plan setting out the arrangements they make for pupils with behavioural difficulties. We will also consult on revised guidance to LEAs and schools on exclusions. This will confirm that, when deciding whether to exclude, head teachers should consider whether a child's disciplinary problems might be a sign of an emerging emotional and behavioural difficulty giving rise to special educational need. There are no plans to advise head teachers to look for particular disorders.

<a name="70729w05.html_para4">The second improvement is to the calculation of pension benefits for regular part-time teachers. These arrangements will mean that the average salary on which the pension is based is the same as it would have been if the teacher had been employed in a full-time capacity.
<P>

<a name="70729w05.html_para5">In the autumn, we shall invite representatives of teachers and their employers to join us in an examination of the teachers' pension scheme for the longer term, looking at a range of issues suggested by teachers' unions, teachers' employers and others.
<P>

<a name="70729w05.html_para6">We have decided not to introduce at this time the option of actuarially reduced pensions for teachers as a new form of retirement. This proposal will be looked at again in the longer-term examination.

<a name="70729w07.html_para1"><i>Letter from Tim Holt to Mr. Paul Flynn, dated 29 July 1997</i>:

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Chancellor of the Exchequer has asked me to reply, as Director of the Office for National Statistics (ONS), to your recent parliamentary question on drug casualties and fatalities. However, this information is not held centrally.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The ONS collects and compiles information on the cause of all deaths registered in England and Wales. In the case of deaths due to any form of poisoning by drugs or drug abuse, the death will be certified by a coroner following an inquest. The coroner's certificate of cause of death, used to register these deaths, includes a short section on the cause (in the format of the medical certificate of cause of death recommended by the WHO), the verdict and certain details about the circumstances of accidental deaths. The level of information therefore normally received by the ONS would include the names of all the drugs known to have been taken or found in toxicological analyses. When more than one drug is mentioned on the certificate, it is not usually stated which was responsible for the death, nor whether any interaction between them was suspected or proven.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Whether a drug was prescribed for the deceased or another person, bought over the counter or obtained illicitly is not normally recorded on the death certificate. The coroner's verdict may state that the death was due to dependence on or abuse of a drug or drugs. However. many certificates of deaths due to poisoning with controlled drugs do not mention abuse or dependence, and may have accidental, suicidal or open verdicts. Many controlled drugs can be legitimately prescribed for therapeutic purposes. A very small number of deaths are certified as due to adverse reactions to therapeutic drugs in normal use, with either an accidental or therapeutic misadventure verdict. In addition to controlled and prescription only drugs, those taken therapeutically may include over the counter preparations.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>A greater level of detail may be recorded in the coroner's inquest reports, but these are not routinely collected, coded or analysed nationally.
</FONT></UL><P>

<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Chancellor of the Exchequer has asked me to reply as Director of the Office for National Statistics to your recent question on the change in unemployment levels in each former parliamentary constituency in Great Britain.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The measure of unemployment, derived from the quarterly Labour Force Survey (LFS), is defined on a consistent and internationally recognised basis set out by the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and counts as unemployed people who are: a) without a job; b) available to start work within the next two weeks and c) have either looked for work in the last four weeks or are waiting to start a job already obtained. However, largely because it is a sample survey, information is not available from the LFS in as much geographical detail as from the claimant count measure described below.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>ONS also publishes the monthly claimant count, which is based on the administrative system and includes all people claiming unemployed-related benefits (i.e. Jobseekers Allowance, Income Support or National Insurance credits) at Employment Service offices on the day of the monthly count, who on that day had signed on as unemployed and available to do any suitable work. Essentially, all people who attend an Employment Service office to sign are counted, irrespective of whether they are actually receiving benefit.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The information you have requested is only available from the claimant count, as the Labour Force Survey does not give details down to constituency levels as explained.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Information on the levels of claimant count by former Parliamentary Constituency are based on the 1981 Census which are only available up to March 1996. Parliamentary Constituency data from April 1996 were based on the new 1991 Census. All this information can be obtained from the NOMIS database at the House of Commons Library.</FONT></UL>

 It is the responsibility of the departmental Minister, having set the framework within which the Department's executive agencies operate, to ensure that this is reflected, as necessary, in the conduct of business.

 I have asked colleagues to pay particular attention to selecting the most appropriate key performance indicators for their agencies and to setting stretching targets for them. However, most agencies produce outputs which are not directly comparable with those of other agencies. Even where similar outputs are produced, for example in those concerned with prisons, social security and public records, direct comparisons may be misleading because the agencies concerned have different customers, operate in differing social or economic environments, or work within different legislative frameworks. The Minister concerned is best placed to decide the key performance indicators taking into account individual circumstances.

 The tariffs for these two mandatory life sentence prisoners were last reviewed by Ministers in 1995-96. The outcome of that review was that the tariffs were set afresh at the same level as they had been before they were quashed by the divisional court in December 1994--20 years for Mohammed Riaz and 25 years for Quayyun Raja. Following recent representations, we have agreed to look again at the circumstances of these cases.

 Following a preliminary survey in 1987, the Home Office commissioned a survey of interest groups in 1988 into options for summer time arrangements. The views of respondents and the arguments that were advanced were reviewed in the 1989 Green Paper "Summer Time: A Consultation Document", Cm 722.
<P>

<a name="70729w09.html_para0">Responses to the Green Paper showed that there was a lack of consensus about the merits of the United Kingdom moving to central European time, also known as single/double summer time. A private Member's Bill, The British Time (Extra Daylight) Bill, which would have achieved such a move did not attract enough support for a Second Reading when it was debated on 19 January 1996. The debate illustrated the strength of feeling and diversity of opinion on the issue.

<P>
<a name="70729w09.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 Sir Donald Acheson's report contained nine recommendations. Action has been taken on these as follows:

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"1. Given the short duration of the present regime, it is premature to come to a firm conclusion on its impact on prisoners' health. We therefore advise that the general health of prisoners detained in special secure units (SSUs) be reviewed at regular intervals, taking into account their degree of susceptibility to psychological symptoms.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>Response</i>
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The SSU Operating Standards have been amended to require that medical officers should undertake formal reviews of the health of prisoners detained in SSUs every three months.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>



<P>
</UL></FONT><P><I>29 Jul 1997 : Column: 143</I><P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>2. A standard set of procedures applicable to all SSUs should be devised, circulated to all parties and enforced to ensure the most expeditious transfer of prisoners requiring emergency treatment to National Health Service hospitals.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>Response</i>
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Operating Standards have been amended to emphasise the importance of prompt action.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>3. SSUs should be provided with the same level of first aid and emergency aid equipment as other wings in the prison. Personnel trained in using this equipment should be on duty in the SSU at all times.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>Response</i>
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Healthcare in SSUs is comparable to that elsewhere in the Prison Service. Arrangements exist to ensure that first aid be administered immediately to prisoners in SSUs.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>4. Prisoners should be held in SSUs for as short a period as possible.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>Response</i>
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>This is existing policy.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>5. Prisoners should be informed when their cases are coming before the SSU committee and be given the opportunity to submit written representations. When feasible, an indication as to how long prisoners will be required to stay in the SSU system should be given.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>Response</i>
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>This is existing policy.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>6. Sentence planning should be introduced as with other long term prisoners.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>Response</i>
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The overriding consideration is determining the length of time a prisoner spends in a special unit must be security. However, the Operating Standards have been amended to provide that regular reviews are undertaken of prisoners' behaviour, attitude and other relevant issues. Review arrangements ensure that the necessary information is collected on the prisoner to inform my future sentencing planning.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>7. More opportunities for mental stimulation and physical exercise should be provided, including the provision of meaningful activity.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>Response</i>
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>This is existing policy. Opportunities for constructive activity have increased.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>8. It is the unanimous view of the group that, in the interests of health, prisoners in the SSUs should have access to open visits with members of their immediate family. We believe that it should be possible for the Prison Service to devise visits which prevent the passage of unauthorised items whilst at the same time retaining the advantages to the prisoners of physical contact possible only in open visits. Given the logistics involved in conducting secure open visits, it is for the Prison Service to determine their frequency and management.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>Response</i>
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>This recommendation has not been accepted although the policy is under review.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>9. Staff should be encouraged to form relationships with prisoners, yet remain sufficiently detached to maintain objectivity and resist being compromised.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70729w09.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 The commissioner informs me that two Metropolitan police officers are to face a disciplinary board on charges of abuse of authority and two other officers were admonished as a result of the investigation.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many police officers were employed by the Metropolitan police in each year since 1979. [11156]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70729w09.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 I am advised by the Metropolitan police service that the number of officers employed by it from 1979 is as follows:


<BR>
1979: 22,786
<BR>
1980: 23,691
<BR>
1981: 25,161
<BR>
1982: 26,350
<BR>
1983: 26,806

1986: 27,005

1996: 27,420.4

<P>

<a name="70729w09.html_para1">These figures are as at 31 December--end of year figures--and do not include any officers on secondment to or from the Metropolitan police service. Figures for 1992 onwards show a full-time equivalent figure and take account of part-time work; there were no part-time workers prior to 1992.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70729w09.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. McNamara: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make a statement on progress towards providing prisoners detained in the special secure unit at Her Majesty's prison Belmarsh with four hours of education a day on request. [9964]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70729w09.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 Prisoners in the special secure unit at Belmarsh prison can, if they wish, attend formal education classes for up to three hours a day. This exceeds the number of hours of education available in the main prison and, given the extremely low take-up of education by SSU prisoners, there are no plans at present to increase further the number of hours available.
<P>

<a name="70729w09.html_para2">In addition to formal education classes, prisoners can study in their cells if they so wish. In the past, a number of SSU prisoners have participated in Open university courses in this way.
<P>
<P>
<a name="70729w09.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. McNamara: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make a statement on provision of adequate ventilation for cells and recreation areas within the special secure unit at HMP Belmarsh. [9965]




<P>
<P><I>29 Jul 1997 : Column: 145</I><P>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70729w09.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 Adequate ventilation is available in cells in the special secure unit at Belmarsh. It has, however, been accepted by Belmarsh that the ventilation of the association areas needs to be improved during periods of hot weather.
<P>

<a name="70729w09.html_para3">To facilitate this, Belmarsh has recently changed procedures to allow prisoners to keep open cell doors and windows at times when they are out of their cells. It has also installed large fans. These measures have greatly increased the ventilation of the association areas, improving matters significantly.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70729w09.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. McNamara: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if the Police Complaints Authority has completed its investigation into the shooting of Diarmuid O'Neill on 23 September 1996; and if he will make a statement. [9962]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70729w09.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 The Police Complaints Authority's investigation is continuing. I understand that some of the evidence in the case may also be relevant to the forthcoming trial of the men arrested with Mr. O'Neill and that the Police Complaints Authority's investigation will not be completed until their trial is over, lest its inquiries prejudice the trial.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70729w09.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Burstow: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what plans he has for making an assessment of the recommendations in the SCOPE report, "Polls Apart 2", with specific reference to <i>(a)</i> increasing the grant to local authorities for providing temporary ramps for polling stations and <i>(b)</i> increasing the grant for low-level accessible polling booths. [10471]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70729w09.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 The Government are considering SCOPE's report, which we welcome. At present, 50 per cent. grants are available towards the cost of purchasing temporary ramps and 80 per cent. grants are available for polling screens adapted for use by electors in wheelchairs. Funds for such grants are not capped and since 1992 a total of &#163;213,000 has been spent towards the provision of temporary ramps. Separate figures are not kept on the purchase of specially adapted polling screens.
<P>

<a name="70729w09.html_para4">We are looking very carefully at the arrangements for future funding for this equipment.

(5) The increase between 1986 and 1987 reflects the change in prison officer working practices and the reduction in their hours worked.<P>

(6)The reduction from 1996 to 1997 can be partly explained by the fact that prison officers left under the voluntary early severance scheme.<P>

 Expenditure by the Prison Service in England and Wales for each year from 1979-80 is set out in the table at 1996-97 prices. These figures include expenditure borne on the Property Services Agency vote up to 1987-88 for the capital costs of new prisons. Because of the nature of the Government accounting system, some other costs attributable to the running of the prison system, for example superannuation, rates and common services, were charged to other votes during some of the earlier years in the table.

<P>
<a name="70729w11.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 I hope to proceed quickly to develop a diploma in probation studies, located in higher education and combined with a national vocational qualification, which will become the qualification for new probation officers. I intend that the new arrangements should be employment led and delivered by a consortium of probation services that will manage the recruitment and selection of trainee probation officers.
<P>

<a name="70729w11.html_para0">The combined diploma and NVQ will offer a mixture of academic teaching and work-based supervised practice, all based on the occupational standards that will be developed for probation officers. The new qualification should be delivered through flexible teaching methods that take account of trainees' previous work, academic qualifications and experience so that a wide range of recruits can be attracted to the probation service.
<P>

<a name="70729w11.html_para1">I have decided that training for new probation officers should no longer be linked to social work education. I will be supporting the development of a new and separate diploma in probation studies, which will equip the probation officers of the future to play their full part in this Government's plans for an integrated approach to working with offenders. It will focus on probation's top priority role of protecting the public and reducing crime through effective work with offenders. There will, therefore, be no further funding or support from the Home Office for the diploma in social work.
<P>

<a name="70729w11.html_para2">These arrangements will be developed in partnership with probation service organisations and higher education institutions to provide high-quality training for high-quality recruits.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make a statement on the implementation of the general fire safety aspects of the EU framework and workplace directives. [11817]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70729w11.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 After consulting my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Scotland, I announced on 16 July that we proposed to implement the outstanding fire safety elements of the European community framework and workplace directives. Today, I have signed and laid before Parliament the Fire Precautions (Workplace) Regulations 1997 made under the European Communities Act 1972 to apply throughout Great Britain. A compliance cost assessment is attached to the regulations showing that the estimated costs to employers attributable to these regulations will be less than &#163;30 million. I have placed copies of these documents in the Library. To assist employers, there will be a package of user-friendly guidance comprising a handy, free card summarising the regulations and employers' rights and a short booklet, both of which will be widely available.
<P>

<a name="70729w11.html_para3">The regulations take into account the views expressed in the many responses received during the consultation exercise carried out last year and the representations received since then from business interests and the fire service. I am grateful to business and fire service representatives for the assistance they have given to my officials during the drafting of the regulations and supporting guidance.
<P>

<a name="70729w11.html_para4">Where appropriate, the regulations have been drafted using copy-out language. This ensures that there is full compliance with the directives but that no unnecessary costs are imposed on business.
<P>

<a name="70729w11.html_para5">The regulations put the primary responsibility for fire safety in the workplace on employers. It is for them to determine and provide the measures they believe to be necessary to meet the risk from fire identified in their premises. In this way, what is provided will be appropriate to the risks and tailored to the specific circumstances of the workplace. The regulations incorporate a new approach to fire safety enforcement. Most significant breaches of the regulations can be dealt with by civil sanctions with the onus of proof on the fire authority rather than the employer.
<P>

<a name="70729w11.html_para6">However, to emphasise the importance of fire safety, criminal sanctions will remain for serious risks.
<P>

<a name="70729w11.html_para7">The regulations include some of the user-friendly enforcement safeguards of the Deregulation and Contracting Out Act 1994. They will be enforced by the fire authority, who will use the employer's own assessment of the risk from fire as a starting point. The fire service have an important role to play. It will offer employers advice and assistance in meeting their obligations and avoiding over-provision.
<P>

<a name="70729w11.html_para8">The Fire Precautions (Workplace) Regulations will come into effect in England, Scotland and Wales on 1 December 1997 and will make explicit what is already implicit in United Kingdom law. In light of the existing general duties of care employers owe to their staff, business should, for the most part, already have in place what these regulations require of them. As standards of fire safety in the workplace are already generally high in

Great Britain, most businesses will have little to do and this is reflected in the total estimated compliance costs of less than &#163;30 million. This is significantly lower than the previous estimate--more than &#163;1.7 billion--associated with earlier drafts of the regulations.

 The April 1997 agreement contains positive elements, notably the commitments to self-determination and to respect for human rights, but the main southern group, the Sudan People's Liberation Army, is not a party. We remain concerned about Sudanese policies in three main areas; human rights, support for terrorism and the civil war, but we welcome the Sudanese Government's acceptance of the Inter-Governmental Authority on Development's declaration of principles as the basis for talks with the SPLA and look forward to early negotiations. We and our EU partners fully support IGAD's efforts to bring peace to Sudan and are ready to consider any way to help that process.

 To date, costs of &#163;400, plus VAT, have been incurred in amending the existing logo for use on departmental computers and in altering signs in the Department's headquarters. Designs for a new departmental logo and other materials are being sought with the help of the Design Council. Value for money will of course be a prime consideration in adopting new designs later this year. I do not expect any additional expenditure as a result of the name change in 1998-99.

<a name="70729w15.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Galbraith: </B> 
 I regret that the information currently available from health boards and NHS trusts does not separately identify the cost of treating patients suffering from occupational asthma. The statistics we do collect indicate that the estimated cost of hospital care for asthma to be in the region of &#163;7.5 million for the year 1995-96. This is 0.17 per cent. of the total NHS budget. Unfortunately, there is no information available on the cost of treating asthma in the community/primary care setting. Expenditure on ingredient cost for drugs used in the treatment of asthma is &#163;47.3 million, again for the year 1995-96.

<a name="70729w16.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Galbraith: </B> 
 The relationship between intensive care beds and organ donation is complex, but there is no evidence to suggest that the number of intensive care beds in Scotland is a constraint on organ transplantation programmes. As one of a number of issues designed to increase organ donation awareness amongst staff in intensive care units, The Scottish Office Department of Health has funded publication and dissemination to ITUs of the protocols for retrieval of organs. In recognition of the current shortage of organs for transplantation, the acute services review being undertaken by The Scottish Office Department of Health is investigating organ donation and kidney transplantation.

Recurrent expenditure in 1996-97 and 1997-98 is relatively high because of the costs of training staff in the operation of the new systems.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70729w18.html_spnew1"><B> Dr. Reid: </B> 
 If it had ever been necessary to inform a foreign Government of an accident involving a UK nuclear weapon we would have employed normal diplomatic procedures and bilateral defence contacts under the auspices of arrangements governing the stationing of UK forces. The ratification of the International Atomic Energy Agency convention on early notification of a nuclear accident on 26 September 1986 gave formal acknowledgement to the procedures which we would have adopted.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70729w18.html_spnew2"><B> Dr. Reid: </B> 
 The creation of such a record followed a specific recommendation contained in the report by Professor Sir Ronald Oxburgh on the safety of UK nuclear weapons, published in July, 1992. A copy of the report was placed in the Library of the House at the time.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70729w18.html_spnew3"><B> Dr. Reid: </B> 
 There are and have been no hospitals specifically designated to receive casualties following a nuclear weapon accident. Decisions on the hospitals to be used would be a matter for the responding ambulance service in consultation with the hospitals.

No United Kingdom forces are currently deployed on operations as a result of international treaty obligations. All deployments will, however, be examined during the review.

 Accommodation requirements arising out of the stationing of the RAF, or indeed other British forces, in Germany are met by the German Government in accordance with the NATO status of forces agreement. Those requirements are notified to the German Government and agreement reached with them on the provision and use of that accommodation, which then remains at the disposal of British forces until it is no longer required. The responsibility therefore rests with the British forces to make the initial approach to the German Government. As reflected in the "Statement on the Defence Estimates 1996," Cm 3223, the RAF is to withdraw from RAF Laarbruch in 1999 and from RAF Bruggen in 2002, after which there will be no RAF aircraft permanently stationed in Germany.

 Currently, the first battalion Royal Gurkha Rifles is serving as part of the joint rapid deployment force in 5 Airborne Brigade; other elements units support the Field Army in the United Kingdom. The second battalion Royal Gurkha Rifles is deployed as the Brunei garrison. The strategic defence review, launched on 28 May, will decide how our armed forces should be structured, equipped and deployed to meet out nation's interests and commitments. It would be premature to assess the likely outcome of the review before the process is complete.

 Measuring the movement in earnings in the armed forces between 1979 and 1997 by reference to real terms changes to the annual pay bill over the same period would not produce an appropriate comparison because of reductions in the strength of the armed forces. However, a comparison of the overall annual percentage increases in the total pay bill of the armed forces since 1979, with the corresponding increases in the retail prices index for 1979 to 1997, shows that in real terms the former has risen against the latter by 35.4 per cent. This takes account of staging of pay awards where they have occurred, but does not of course reflect a universally applicable figure for any given rank.

 Our Green Paper, published today, sets out proposals and seeks views on a range of options for the nature and functions of the new strategic authority for London. It is not possible to make firm estimates of the cost of establishing and running the authority until we are clearer, following this consultation, on the final form that the new arrangements will take. Our overriding objective is that the new strategic authority should improve the efficiency with which pan-London activities are carried out. We intend that any additional spending on setting up the new authority will be offset by longer-term savings.

 The Coastguard agency actively promotes the safe use of recreational craft through national campaigns and local publicity. A national education campaign, sea smart, which was launched on 21 July, is aimed at primary and secondary school children in a co-ordinated campaign along the south coast. A series of local coastguard initiatives will concentrate on the sea and shoreline safety problems in particular areas. The agency has invited comments from organisations in this field on a consultative document about measures to improve the safety of non-regulated pleasure vessels without legislation. The sea safety liaison group, set up by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution and including the Coastguard and the Marine Safety Agency, also promotes this work. The group has produced a range of leaflets targeted at small boat safety and further literature and advertising campaigns are planned.

The Virgin Rail Group has committed to service improvements on the west coast main line through its franchise agreement with the franchising director, including improved reliability and increased capacity on the line from 2002. These depend to a great extent on the upgrading of the line on which the franchising director concluded an agreement with Railtrack in 1996. I understand that the Virgin Rail Group is currently discussing further upgrading options with Railtrack.

 The combined effect of increasing the road fuel duty escalator from 5 to 6 per cent. reducing VAT on domestic fuels to 5 per cent. and the reduction in the gas levy will be to reduce annual carbon dioxide emissions by about 0.2 million tonnes of carbon in 2000 and by 2.3 million tonnes in 2010.

 The single regeneration budget was formed in 1994 by bringing together 20 regeneration programmes in England. Details of the expenditure and the outputs achieved under each programme are set out in the departmental reports issued each year--Department of the Environment annual report 1997, Cmd 3607. Since 1995-96, new regeneration schemes have been funded through the SRB challenge fund. The table gives the regional breakdown of expenditure and jobs created for 1995-96, the first year of the challenge fund, and provisional figures for 1996-97, its second year.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what estimates he has made of the savings at current prices achieved in each year since the introduction of compulsory competitive tendering for local government services as a result of such tendering. [11303]

<P>
<a name="70729w23.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 Research commissioned by the Department has looked at both the financial and service quality impact of CCT on blue-collar services covered by the Local Government Act 1988. This has shown average annual savings on contract prices of blue-collar services of 6 per cent. for the first round of tendering under the Act, and 9 per cent. for the second round. It also shows that the savings have been accompanied by only minor improvements in service standards, and that more attention needs to be given to the development of local performance indicators.

<a name="70729w23.html_para0">Other research, commissioned outside the Department, suggests a wide variation on estimates of savings depending upon the way in which social costs and benefits are treated.

 The phaseout date for methyl bromide, and the criteria for the critical use exemption after phaseout, will be considered at the ninth meeting of the parties to the Montreal protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer, in September.

 In 1996, the Ministry for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food commissioned ADAS to review the use of methyl bromide in horticulture, and to consider what alternatives are available. Its report identifies a range of alternatives which are either being developed, or already being used in the UK, but does not identify the individual companies involved. In April 1997, the United Nations environment programme's technical and economic assessment panel and methyl bromide technical options committee produced a report on alternatives to methyl bromide worldwide. Copies of this report, and the ADAS report, will be placed in the Library shortly.

<a name="70729w23.html_para2"><i>Letter from Lawrie Haynes to Mrs. Gwyneth Dunwoody, dated 29 July 1997:
</i>

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions, has asked me to reply to your request to list the trunk road enhancement schemes and network control projects to be undertaken during the financial year 1997-98, and to give an indication of the likely cost, start and completion dates.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I have enclosed with this letter a copy of the Highways Agency's 1997-98 Business Plan which lists at Annex E the network enhancement projects (NEPS) and network control projects which the Highways Agency intends to undertake this financial year. I have attached a list showing the costs and seasonal start and finish dates for these schemes, as you requested.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Network enhancement projects cover various improvements including local safety schemes, traffic calming measures and environmental schemes and start and finish dates can be affected by external matters, some of which are outside the Highways Agency's control, such as statutory procedures or urgent statutory undertakers works or the weather. In the circumstances, it is difficult to be precise with the actual timing.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Agency is also undertaking a number of smaller projects, and may add or substitute alternative schemes to the list published in the Business Plan as priorities change and where circumstances do not permit all the named schemes to proceed as planned.</FONT></UL>

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what assessment he has made of the potential environmental benefits of advising motorists to turn their engines off when stationary; what estimate he has made of the relative benefits in respect of cars whose engines are <i>(a)</i> warm and <i>(b)</i> cold; what assessment he had made of the success of such advice in other European countries with particular reference to Germany; and if he will make a statement.

<P>
<a name="70729w24.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 Advice is regularly given to drivers in official publications, particularly with regard to environmentally conscious driving. In general, benefits can be gained in terms of reduced emissions and savings in fuel by switching a vehicle's engine off if the vehicle is likely to be stationary in traffic for more than two minutes. The Department has drawn up research proposals to assess the benefits of instructing drivers to switch engines off while waiting at, for example, traffic lights. Under some circumstances, such as when an engine is still cold following a very short journey, it is possible that re-starting could result in higher emissions than would occur had the engine remained idling. The research will therefore identify the engine parameters under which emissions reductions will be achieved. No assessment has been made of the success of advice in Germany or other European countries.

In addition, the length and nature of passenger journeys on scheduled services is such that the likelihood of seat belts being used is far less than on faster long-distance journeys. However, it should be remembered that the existing requirements for seat belts to be provided for children on organised trips in minibuses and coaches will ensure that they are available in thousands of vehicles that otherwise would not have had them fitted.

 Approval of state subsidy to national airlines is a matter for the European Commission.

 The number of passengers who flew with American Airlines through Heathrow airport in 1996 was 1.4 million. American Airlines predicts that this will increase to 2.3 million in 2005 assuming 6 per cent. growth, an open skies agreement and the capacity to use larger aircraft.

 I have asked the chief executive of the Highways Agency to write to my hon. Friend.

<a name="70729w25.html_para1"><i>Letter from Lawrie Haynes to Mrs. Gwyneth Dunwoody, dated 29 July 1997:</i>

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Minister for Transport in London has asked me to reply to your recent question asking what proposals there are to introduce bus priority lanes to Heathrow & Gatwick Airports.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Highways Agency, in partnership with Heathrow Airport Limited, are currently implementing a scheme to provide a dedicated bus and coach lane on the M4 Spur Road to Heathrow Airport. It will reduce journey times for the large number of buses and coaches that use the Spur as well as further encouraging the use of public transport for journeys to and from the airport. Work started on 27 June and is expect to take two months to complete.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>There are no plans at the present time to introduce bus priority lanes on the approaches to Gatwick Airport.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70729w25.html_wqn11"><B> Mrs. Dunwoody: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will take steps to allow only coaches and other multiple-occupancy vehicles in the outside lanes of motorways on approaches to major airports to reduce congestion. [10856]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70729w25.html_spnew11"><B> Ms Jackson: </B> 
 For safety reasons, coaches and buses have been generally banned from the outside, or overtaking lane of motorways with three or more lanes since 1 January 1996 because newer buses and coaches are restricted to 65 mph by their speed limiters. We will be reviewing this ban in 1998, once there has been a full two years operation.
<P>

<a name="70729w25.html_para2">Exceptionally, the Highways Agency is building an extra offside lane in addition to the existing three lanes on a 0.9 mile stretch of the M4 spur to Heathrow airport, which will be specifically restricted to buses and coaches. This lane is on the offside to accommodate traffic flows at the roundabout at either end of the spur road. The &#163;1 million cost is being met by BAA plc. We have no immediate plans to introduce similar measures at other airports but will be watching the effects of this experiment with interest.

 Section 4 of the Railways Act 1993 places a number of duties on the Secretary of State and the Rail Regulator. One of the key powers available to the Secretary of State under the Act, which is covered by these duties, is the power to issue objectives, instructions and guidance to the franchising director. The Government are currently reviewing the franchising director's objectives, instructions and guidance and will make an announcement in due course.

<P>

<P>
<a name="70729w26.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The COBA method does not assess the factors listed by the hon. Member. The effects of a road scheme on air and noise pollution and its impact on the natural environment are set out in the environmental impact assessment, which serves with COBA to determine the value of a road project. Public transport alternatives are considered at an early stage in the development of a scheme when assessing the options to remedy the problems identified.

 The Department is carrying out a fundamental review of transport policy with the aim of providing a balanced transport system which is efficient, environmentally sustainable and safe, which meets the needs of all sections of society and which provides genuine choice to meet people's future transport needs. The contribution of rail and other modes in achieving these objectives will be carefully examined, together with the implications for how projects should be assessed.

</i>1. Investment directly funded by passenger transport executive is not included.<P>

2. Figures for 1984-85 cover a 15-month period.<P>

3. Figures for 1994-95 and 1995-96 include investment undertaken by Railtrack, EPS and Union Railways while they were publicly owned but not part of BR. BR rolling stock investment was &#163;212 million in 1994-95 and &#163;29 million in 1995-96, both in 1996-97 prices. Total investment numbers for 1994-95 and 1995-96 are not directly comparable with figures for previous years due to the adoption of a new accounting practice by Railtrack.<P>

4. The figure for 1996-97 covers British Rail only, excluding any investment undertaken by Railtrack, EPS and Union Railways during the few weeks at the start of the year when they were publicly owned. No separate details of rolling stock investment are available.<P>

 No. The Railways Act 1993 requires the franchising director to publish notices of his acceptance of closure proposals. That has been done in this case. The Railways Act does not require the franchising director to publish the notices given to him by operators or Railtrack. Nor are these items which the franchising director is required to place on his public register.

The results of Oftel's current consultation on the proposal will help it to decide how to take the proposal forward so as to get the best possible deal for schools without harming competition.

 My Department is fully committed to strengthening our highly successful UK biotechnology industry. This will be achieved by both securing greater exploitation of our science base and by raising the awareness of opportunities offered by biotechnology to a wide range of industrial sectors.
<P>

<a name="70729w29.html_para15">On 11 July, my Department announced a second call for proposals under two initiatives, with the aim of improving competitiveness in the sector. The business mentoring and incubator challenge is designed to encourage intermediaries to address the management and business skills required by emerging biotechnology companies. The biotechnology exploitation platforms challenge aims to retain the benefits of publicly funded bioscience research in the UK, by promoting better management and exploitation of intellectual property.
<P>

<a name="70729w29.html_para16">In addition, my Department continues to promote biotechnology research and development in industry through a range of schemes, including SMART, LINK and EUREKA, which are targeted at small firms and collaborative research projects.

 <i>[holding answer 28 July 1997]:</i> The Government are fully committed to the industrial tribunals system, which plays an important role in resolving employment rights disputes. It is important that, where we can, we take steps to improve both the services offered by the tribunals and the system of dispute resolution. To this end the Government are giving their full support to a Bill which Lord Archer of Sandwell introduced in the House of Lords on 9 July 1997. The Employment Rights (Dispute Resolution) Bill, which received its Second Reading on 25 July, will streamline certain tribunal procedures and will promote voluntary alternative forms of dispute resolution, such as arbitration. These changes, which have been the subject of full consultation, will improve the service offered by the tribunals and give those involved in employment rights disputes additional methods of resolving their disputes.

 Our plans for a Welsh Assembly provide both for the rationalisation of non-departmental public bodies in Wales before it is established and the power for the Assembly to continue this process afterwards. I expect that both elements will yield long-term savings in the form of economies of scale, reduced duplication of effort and lower administration costs. However, it is impossible at this early stage to provide a quantified estimate of such savings, particularly as future decisions will be in the hands of the Assembly itself. Our proposals are in line with the election manifesto.

 The Government recognise the importance of disability living allowance in enabling individuals to enjoy greater dignity and independence.

We are planning to review provision in this area and will announce the scope of this review in due course.
<P>

<a name="70729w32.html_para2">The mobility element in disability living allowance is intended to reflect the identified need of those who suffer disability before retirement. The extension of the mobility component to those aged over 65 years, the age at which one may be eligible for attendance allowance, would cost an estimated &#163;4 billion for 1997-98 and in the current circumstances it would be unlikely that such a significant extension of entitlement would attract priority.

<P>

<a name="70729w33.html_para4">It would cost some &#163;255 million per year fully to unfreeze those pensions which are not uprated--that is, to bring them up to the rate which would be paid if the pensioners were in the UK. There are competing demands and constraints on social security spending, and it would be wrong to raise expectations that uprating these pensions would be likely to attract priority in current circumstances.

 We plan to bring the provisions of the Social Security (Recovery of Benefits) Act 1997 into force on 6 October. The Act will reform the compensation recovery scheme following a report of the Social Security Select Committee. The Act will ensure that compensation in respect of pain and suffering cannot be reduced on account of recovery of social security benefits. It will also protect public funds by ensuring that all recoverable benefits paid as a consequence of accident, injury or disease are repaid by the compensator.

We believe that pensioners should share fairly in the increasing prosperity of the nation. Our review of pensions is looking at the central areas of pensions insecurity for elderly people. Pensions are of key importance to people's lives and it is vital to build a sustainable consensus on the way forward so that everyone can look forward to a secure and dignified retirement.
