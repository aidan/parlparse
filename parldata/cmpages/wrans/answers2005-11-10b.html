 Net inward migration makes a positive contribution to growth of the UK labour force and the trend rate of output growth. Details of the Treasury&#039;s methodology for projecting trend growth and its productivity and labour input components are set out in the publication Trend Growth: Recent Developments and Prospects&quot; (2002). The projection for net inward migration is based on projections by the Government Actuary&#039;s Department. The Treasury&#039;s latest published economic forecast and underlying assumptions for trend growth and its components were set out in Budget 2005, and will be updated in the forthcoming pre-Budget report.

 I am advised by Cheshire police that operation yellow card does not involve military personnel. Operational policing is the responsibility of the chief police officer in the area concerned. Military assistance can be sought in exceptional circumstances in accordance with arrangements that include the need to seek approval of the relevant Ministers in the Home Office and the Ministry of Defence. In such circumstances, military personnel provide support to and work under the control of the chief police officer. This remains the case even in circumstances where military personnel are deployed in support of the police.

<p><a name="st_46"><a name="51110w05.html_spnew1"><b> Hazel Blears: </b> 
 The Prolific and other Priority Offenders (PPO) strategy was launched by the Prime Minister in March 2004 to target not only existing prolific offenders but also those young people who are on the cusp of a prolific offending lifestyle. The strategy has three strands: prevent and deter&#151;to stop young people becoming prolific offenders; catch and convict&#151;tackling those who are already prolific offenders; and rehabilitate and resettle&#151;working to increase the number of offenders who stop offending by offering a range of supportive interventions.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51110w05.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_16">Over 10,000 existing prolific offenders have been identified by schemes across England and Wales. In addition, approximately 4,000 young people have been identified as suitable for support as part of the prevent and deter strand. A report of the early findings of the evaluation of the PPO strategy was published in October 2005. It provides encouraging but early indicative data on the impact on the offending rates of PPOs, as well as

Those against whom the abatement notice has been served will have 21 days in which to appeal against the notice in the local magistrates court. If no appeal is made, or if the appeal is unsuccessful, the abatement notice will remain in force.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what measures are being taken to ensure that children do not undertake online gambling.  [25871]</p>








<p><a name="st_161"><a name="51110w17.html_spnew6"><b> Mr. Caborn: </b> 
 Under the current legislation British licensed operators are permitted to offer betting on-line. These operators are subject to the same regulation as bricks and mortar bookmakers, including the existing prohibitions and penalties relating to underage betting. A bookmaker in breach of these prohibitions is a risk of both losing his licence and prosecution. On-line casinos, however, cannot be based in Great Britain under existing legislation. As a result they currently operate off-shore and beyond British jurisdiction. This was one of the major reasons why the Government decided to introduce the Gambling Act 2005.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51110w17.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_100">The protection of children from being harmed or exploited by gambling is one of the key objectives of the Gambling Act, and it contains a package of measures aimed at preventing children from gambling.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51110w17.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_101">Most importantly the Act provides a new regulatory regime for on-line gambling. For the first time on-line casino operators will be able to be licensed in this country, and as such subject to strict licence conditions.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51110w17.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_102">These conditions will include explicit provisions on social responsibility, including &#039;know your customer&#039; requirements and the use, by on-line gambling operators, of age verification systems.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51110w17.html_para7">
<a name="stpa_103">These conditions will be enforced by the new Gambling Commission, which came into existence in October this year, with robust powers to investigate and ultimately withdraw licences and prosecute those in breach of the law. The Gambling Commission will be proactive in this regard, and the Act allows the Commission or the police to use children to test the robustness of a gambling operator&#039;s age verification systems.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51110w17.html_para8">
<a name="stpa_104">Under the Gambling Act it will be an offence for a licensed on-line operator to invite or permit a child or young person to participate in on-line gambling, including all casino gambling. Some very limited exceptions allow 16 to 18-year-olds to take part in on-line football pools or purchase a lottery ticket. It will also be an offence for anyone in the UK to bring gambling advertising to the attention of a person under the age of 18 years. Furthermore the Act will prevent any on-line operator based in a territory outside the European Economic Area from advertising in the UK, unless that territory has be specified by the Secretary of State in regulation. The Government believe that this will prevent UK citizens from being exposed to a large number of operators based in territories which do not offer the same protections to children and young people.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51110w17.html_para9">
<a name="stpa_105">The Act also introduces several new provisions designed to prevent children and young people from gambling, including providing that a young person of 16&#150;17 years old will him/herself commit an offence if he/she gambles. In addition, a licensed gambling operator who, for whatever reason, permits a person under the age of 18 to gamble will have to return the stake gambled to that child or young person. Operators, however, will 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>10 Nov 2005 : Column 698W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
have no rights to reclaim any winnings awarded. While we expect that the British licensed industry will readily maintain the very highest standards, we believe that this will act as a further incentive to operators to ensure that their age verification systems are robust.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51110w17.html_para10">
<a name="stpa_106">The Gambling Act will be fully implemented in September 2007. In the meantime my Department is working closely with the international gambling industry to promote socially responsible practices now. The Remote Gambling Association, the trade association for remote gambling operators, will very shortly make compliance with their Social Responsibility Code of Practice a condition of membership. This Code includes specific conditions relating to age verification. The Gambling Commission will also active push for improvements in age verification systems and will work closely with software developers, gambling operators and the banking sector to do so. My Department is also looking at building on international links with regulators in other jurisdictions to work across borders to protect our citizens from exploitation from unscrupulous remote gambling operators.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51110w17.html_para11">
<a name="stpa_107">The protection of children and young people from harm from gambling is a key priority for my Department. We remain dedicated to doing all we can under the existing legislation in preparation for the modern, more robust regime, the Gambling Act will introduce.

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_33">Bullying is a form of harassment, and describes a threatening or intimidating environment in which one or more people may become fearful or intimidated because of the negative or hostile behaviour of one or more people. It often involves a misuse of power or position. It is usually persistent, often unpredictable, and may be vindictive, cruel, or malicious. However, it can also arise without intent, such as when a person is unaware of the impact of his or her behaviour on someone else. Harassment is unwanted behaviour by one or more people, whether intentional or not, which violates a person&#039;s dignity and creates feelings of anxiety, humiliation, awkwardness, distress or discomfort which can have devastating consequences for that person.</p>

The Government&#039;s approach to noise-induced sensorineural hearing loss assessment is based on contemporary scientific evidence and understanding. This has been confirmed in recent years by several reviews carried out by independent audiological experts including an Industrial Injuries Advisory Council review. The Ministry of Defence routinely scrutinises the published peer reviewed literature to ensure that compensation policy and approaches continue to take account of contemporary evidence.

 The Government&#039;s Skills Strategy, reaffirmed in the White Paper published on the 22 March, sets clear priorities for public funding to support the drive to ensure that employers have the skills they need to be successful, and individuals have the skills they need to be employable and personally fulfilled. Funding for Further Education (FE) increased by 4.4 per cent. in 2005/06. Funding for non-vocational learning opportunities for adults, delivered mainly through local authority adult education services, has also increased. In 2004/05 we provided over &#163;207 million to the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) in support of this learning. This has risen to &#163;210 million in 2005/06.

 The role of School Improvement Partners (SIPs) who are mostly headteachers is to challenge and support schools. Their work forms part of the new accountability and support arrangements called the New Relationship with Schools. SIPs will be searching and constructive about the key issues that each school faces without imposing unnecessary bureaucratic burdens. For anybody wishing to become an SIP, there is a demanding national assessment and accreditation process. The process started in the spring and has so far accredited 243 people.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51110w23.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_128">Schools and local authorities are responding positively to becoming involved in the SIP programme. We now have SIPs allocated to secondary schools in 27 local authorities. SIPs will be allocated to the rest of secondary schools in two further waves in April and September 2006. There is a pilot of SIPs in primary schools in six local authorities, to be followed by a phased national roll-out. We are also trialling school improvement partners in special schools in seven local authorities before deciding on a wider roll-out. At the same time, we are developing national arrangements to make sure SIPs are well managed and well supported, and to assure the quality of their work.

<p><a name="st_215"><a name="51110w23.html_spnew3"><b> Jacqui Smith: </b> 
 The Education Act 2005 provided the legislative base for changing the school inspection system in line with other aspects of the New Relationship with Schools. The new inspection arrangements, which were tested extensively during the last academic year, came into effect in September.

Inspections will now take place with minimal notice and will be shorter in duration. They will draw on enhanced data and will use schools&#039; own self evaluation as the basis for planning and conducting the inspection. Schools will report on progress to parents through the new School Profile and will be supported and challenged by School Improvement Partners in planning and taking forward their improvement priorities.

<p><a name="st_216"><a name="51110w23.html_spnew4"><b> Jacqui Smith: </b> 
 In drawing up the proposals in the recent White Paper the Secretary of State took account of the relevant issues and discussions in the current academic literature on school choice and social segregation.

<p>
<a name="51110w23.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_131">Our White Paper Higher Standards, Better Schools For All&#151;More choice for parents and pupils&quot; outlines our proposals to extend choice and open up access to schools for more parents, underpinned by a fair admissions system. These proposals will reduce social segregation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51110w23.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_132">There are a number of approaches that admission authorities can adopt to ensure fair access for children. Some schools use random allocation, while others use banding. The White Paper proposes making it easier to introduce pupil banding. This provides a means of ensuring that a school&#039;s intake is representative of the full ability range of either applicants for a particular school, of children in the area as a whole, or of the national ability profile&#151;depending on the type of banding adopted.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51110w23.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_133">Furthermore, all proposals for new schools must set out their proposed admission arrangements, and indicate how these will promote community and social integration and choice. Successful schools will also be allowed to expand if they can show their admission arrangements are in line with the School Admissions code of practice, which recommends that admission arrangements should be, as far as possible, inclusive of all elements of the local community.

 The second skills White Paper, Skills: Getting on in business, getting on at work&quot;, published in March 2005, reaffirmed our commitment to the Level 2 entitlement. We undertook to use the experience of the Level 2 trials in the North East and South East in 2004/05 to develop the capacity of the further education sector during 2005/06. The White Paper confirmed that we would expand the availability of fully funded first Level 2 qualifications in all regions, using 2005/06 as a transition year, so that a wide range of colleges and training providers could offer the entitlement nationally from 2006/07.

 We expect schools will make efficiency gains in a number of ways.

The amounts realised in each way will depend on schools&#039; own decisions.

<p><a name="st_227"><a name="51110w24.html_spnew4"><b> Phil Hope: </b> 
 New arrangements for delivering learning and skills to offenders were introduced in three development regions, the South West, North West and North East, from 1 August 2005. The new offenders&#039; learning and skills service covers juvenile offenders held in Young Offender Institutions. Action research is being carried out on the new service in order to inform the planned roll-out of the new service across the rest of England from August 2006.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51110w24.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_138">The new arrangements emphasise early, intense focus on assessing the offender learner&#039;s needs, formulating them into an individual learning plan and addressing those needs in a joined-up way as the offender moves through the criminal justice system and into mainstream learning and skills. A new curriculum for offender learners is described in the Offender&#039;s Learning Journey&quot;, of which there are separate adult and juvenile versions. (See http://www.dfes.gov.uk/offenderlearning/uploads/docs/05%200111% 20Juvenile%20OLJ%20v0.4.doc) This more integrated service is particularly important for juvenile offenders, many of whom will continue their education on release.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51110w24.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_139">The new service is planned and funded by the Learning and Skills Council, working in close collaboration with the National Offender Management Service and, in the case of juvenile offenders, with the Youth Justice Board. These close working arrangements will ensure the learning and skills service commissioned meets the needs of the learners and, for those of working age, the needs of employers in the areas within which they will be resettled.

 This week the LSC announced more details of its restructuring exercise which will make it a smaller, more dynamic and more customer-focused organisation. This will build upon its existing strengths; further develop its relationships with providers and with its partners, and help push the highest proportion of its funding out through colleges and providers into front line delivery. At local level, the LSC will develop small teams of professional staff who will support the delivery of its priority objectives through strategic relationships with colleges, providers and other key stakeholders and so ensure that the needs of local employers and learners are met.

 This Government were the first to introduce statutory support for students studying on a part-time basis. We are determined to see the vibrant part-time sector sustained. To this end we recently announced an improved package of support for part-time students in 2006/07 that seeks to ensure access for those on lower incomes so that the part-time sector can continue this strong performance. The new package raises the maximum level of grant for fees by 27 per cent. from &#163;885 to &#163;1,125, while maintaining the course grant at &#163;250. Furthermore, resource from the Access to Learning Fund will increase from &#163;3 million to &#163;12 million to provide still greater additional fee support and general hardship support for students in the most challenging financial circumstances.

 The KS4 science programme of study for 2006 developed with input from the scientific community is based on the science process (how science works&quot;) but the amount of factual knowledge defined in the breadth of study section is only slightly less than at present which allows for the development of skills and understanding.

<p><a name="st_241"><a name="51110w26.html_spnew6"><b> Beverley Hughes: </b> 
 Since 2002 my Department has supported three evaluations of extended schools. The reports of these evaluations have shown that it is likely that extended services accessed through schools generate a range of educational benefits for pupils, families and communities in disadvantaged areas. These include: raised pupil attainment; improved pupil attendance, behaviour and attitudes towards learning; and increased parental involvement in their children&#039;s 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>10 Nov 2005 : Column 741W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
education. Access to extended services at or through schools can reduce barriers to learning through multi-agency working to support vulnerable children and families, help develop learning cultures in deprived communities, and support non-working parents back into work, so reducing child poverty.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51110w26.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_150">The latest of these reports, of the first year of the evaluation of full service extended schools, was published on 29 September 2005. The evaluation involved schools in areas of disadvantage and shows that there is considerable anecdotal evidence of positive outcomes from extended services accessed through schools. Although this does not yet amount to robust evidence of effectiveness it suggests that there will be longer term and wide-ranging outcome for pupils and families from low socio-economic backgrounds. Furthermore, the schools involved in the evaluation said that the extended schools initiative allowed them to address issues previously beyond their reach, such as drug problems and malnutrition, but which affect their pupils&#039; achievement and other outcomes. This evaluation will continue until 2007 by which time we hope to have more substantial evidence on impacts.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51110w26.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_151">We know, through a base line survey of extended services in schools published in September 2005, that the vast majority of schools, 95 per cent. of secondary and 87 per cent. of primary schools, are already offering after schools activities or childcare. The extended schools agenda is not about increasing the workload of existing school staff or schools providing all these services directly themselves on the school site. The evaluation of extended schools has shown that when managed properly the provision of extended services could free heads and teachers to concentrate on their core business. Schools are being encouraged to work with existing providers from both the private and voluntary sectors, other children&#039;s services and other nearby schools to deliver extended services and to make good use of their expertise and skills.

<a name="51110w26.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_152">A package of support is in place to support schools develop extended services. We have made available &#163;680 million over the period 2006&#150;08 to local authorities and schools. This is additional to the &#163;160 million we have provided to date. This funding can be used flexibly by local authorities and schools to help overcome barriers to developing extended services. The National Remodelling Team has been appointed to work with local authorities and schools to help them develop extended services and in a way that is consistent with school workforce reform.

<a name="stpa_153">By 2010 we want all schools to provide a varied range of study support activities with half of all primary schools and a third of all secondary schools doing so by 2008. Funding for a school&#039;s or local authority&#039;s study support (out of school hours learning) programme is available through their base budgets, and the School Development Grant. Furthermore, the recently published White Paper: Higher Standards, Better Schools for All&quot;, announced that &#163;335 million has been earmarked for 2007&#150;08 to support the personalised learning agenda, of which study support will form an intrinsic part. Helping children from deprived families is a priority for this funding.

The Government are also implementing the national school sport strategy. The strategy is delivering an ambitious public service agreement target to increase the percentage of 5&#150;16 year olds who spend a minimum of two hours a week on high quality PE and school sport within and beyond the curriculum to 75 per cent. by 2006 and then 85 per cent. by 2008. The long-term ambition, by 2010, is to offer all children at least four hours of sport every week. This will comprise at least two hours of PE and sport at school and at least an additional 2&#150;3 hours of sport beyond the school day (delivered by a range of school, community and club providers). In the five years to 2008 over &#163;1.5 billion is being invested to implement the strategy. The 2004/05 school sport survey results found that overall, 69 per cent. of pupils were participating in at least two hours of high quality PE and school sport a week. The results were published on 2 September 2005 and copies have been placed in the House Libraries.

 The number of domestic violence incidents reported to the Police Service of Northern Ireland continues to rise annually. The number of incidents reported rose from 16,926 in 2003&#150;04 to 20,959 in 2004&#150;05 (an increase of 24 per cent.). The number of incidents reported where offences were identified fell

slightly from 8,565 in 2003&#150;04 to 8,508 in 2004&#150;05. These figures do not include breaches of non-molestation orders (1,148 breaches are recorded).

<a name="stpa_185">The PSNI is represented on the regional steering group on domestic violence and worked in partnership with all the other agencies in the development of the Government strategy &#039;Tackling Violence at Home&#039;. The strategy was launched in October 2005 and aims to develop and implement a multi-agency co-ordinated response to domestic violence across Northern Ireland. The Police Service is also represented at various regional and local domestic violence forums and has been 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>10 Nov 2005 : Column 757W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
involved in training provided to probation officers, participants in the men overcoming domestic violence programme, and to staff in the Northern Ireland Court Service.

<a name="51110w29.html_para9">
<a name="stpa_186">In September 2004 the Police Service introduced a new domestic violence policy, The policy aims to:

<a name="stpa_188">To date the Police Service have trained 61 specialist domestic violence investigators with a further course being planned for the new year. These officers in addition to supporting victims will investigate serious physical assaults and repeat offences. In addition to the existing corporate literature the Service has published a small pocket information booklet, which provides extensive information on safety advice, Police Service policy and details of support agencies. To date over 40,000 pocket booklets have been circulated to police districts, health trusts, solicitors, voluntary and statutory support agencies. Further work is ongoing to develop risk assessment procedures and guidance.

<a name="51110w29.html_para12">
<a name="stpa_189">It is recognised that there is considerable under reporting of incidents of domestic violence and an increase in reports is a welcome indication in confidence in the police to take effective action and support victims.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what information he collects on the prevalence of spiking drinks in the Province.  [24923]</p>








<p><a name="st_282"><a name="51110w31.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Hanson: </b> 
 A range of statutory and voluntary sector organisations work together to raise awareness of the dangers of drink spiking. This has included beer mat and poster campaigns in pubs and clubs funded by the Police Service of Northern Ireland and the Health Promotion Agency.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51110w31.html_para0">
It is difficult to estimate the prevalence of drink spiking in Northern Ireland. Spiking drinks can take many forms and includes the addition of alcohol, prescription drugs and illegal drugs (eg Ecstasy) as well as the so called date rape drugs such as Rohypnol. Victims may not realise their drink was spiked, and even when a more serious offence has occurred the victim may not be aware until some time after the incident. In some cases the victim may not tell anyone what has happened to them.




<br>&nbsp;<br><i>10 Nov 2005 : Column 763W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>


<p>
<a name="51110w31.html_para1">
Drink spiking may constitute an offence under the Offences Against The Persons Act 1861 (Section 22, administering poison to endanger life; and Section 23, administering poison to aggrieve). In 2004&#150;05 a total of six cases were recorded under these Sections of the Act. However it is not possible to easily differentiate between cases of drink spiking and other poisonings. Drink spiking is difficult to prove and is often connected with more serious offences such as sexual assaults. Consequently in many cases the more serious offence will be recorded rather than those offences under Sections 22 and 23 of the Act.
