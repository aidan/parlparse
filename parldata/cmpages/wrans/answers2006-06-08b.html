<p><a name="stpa_198"><a name="60608w0001.htm_para9"><a name="06060913000330">Although there are similarities between the road traffic signalling systems in the UK and abroad, there are also differences. Many other countries use fixed time signals, where the green period is based on average flows. These periods will not necessarily be proportional to the actual flow. &#145;Turn right (left) on red&#146; is often used to overcome resultant delays. The majority in the UK are either vehicle actuated or connected to an Urban Traffic Control system using &#145;live&#146; information. Timings are proportional to the flow and &#145;turn left on red&#146; would not afford the same advantage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_199"><a name="60608w0001.htm_para10"><a name="06060913000331">There are also differences in junction type. Where &#145;turn right (left) on red&#146; is used, for example in the United States, most junctions have good visibility between side and main road traffic. Many junctions in the UK have poor intervisibility because of existing buildings and the junction geometry. Any uncontrolled movements from the side road would involve increased risks and an increased accident potential at the junction.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_200"><a name="60608w0001.htm_para11"><a name="06060913000332">Also, in the UK many pedestrian phases display a green figure on the &#145;side road&#146; while a red is shown to the &#145;main road&#146;. Allowing vehicles to turn left on red would pose increased risks to all pedestrians, especially vulnerable road users such as blind and partially sighted pedestrians, who are often given audible and/or tactile signals as an indication that all conflicting vehicular movements have stopped.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_201"><a name="60608w0001.htm_para12"><a name="06060913000333">Studies in the mid-1970s, in six states of the USA where &#145;turn right on red&#146; was introduced, showed that pedestrian and cyclist accidents increased, ranging from 48 per cent. to 123 per cent. Vulnerable groups showed the greatest increase.</p>

We also expect that all schools should have a drug policy available to all pupils and parents. We have made clear that where pupils are permanently excluded for supplying an illegal drug, the Secretary of State would not normally expect the governing body or the independent appeal panel to reinstate the pupil.

This is an encouraging start but Kenyans are calling for more to be done. When I met President Kibaki again recently, I stressed the importance of continued progress in the corruption investigations. I have also met several Kenyan Members of Parliament (MPs) to discuss progress on corruption and specifically the Public Accounts Committee report on the so-called Anglo-Leasing affair.</p>

 The World Bank&#146;s Africa Action Plan does not specifically address climate change. However, the World Bank fully recognises the severity of the impact climate change will have in Africa and is committed to helping countries address these. It is also looking at improving the ways African countries can benefit from a global shift towards cleaner energy, through carbon finance projects, for example.</p>

This work was discussed by governors at the World Bank's Spring Meetings in April. In my written statement to the Development Committee at the Spring Meetings I welcomed the valuable work the World Bank had done so far and stressed the need for this to be developed further by the Annual Meetings in September. I also said that helping member countries meet the challenges of climate change should be a key objective of the World Bank over the coming years. The statement is available on DFID's website at:</p>

Early priorities are likely to include support for ceasefire monitoring; voter education and other help relating to a constituent assembly; and resources to improve access by the poor to essential services and infrastructure. In addition to DFID&#146;s bilateral programme, consideration is also being given to financial and technical support to the peace process from the interdepartmental Global Conflict Prevention Pool (GCPP).</p>

The rising level of insecurity threatens to reverse progress made in 2005. Over the last four months alone, 250,000 people have been driven from their homes by the violence.

Moreover, if a patent application is made by a person who is neither the true inventor, nor has lawfully acquired rights to the invention, any person, including members of an indigenous community, can apply to the Office to have the matter rectified.</p>

 The difference between Government expenditure and revenue attributed to Northern Ireland has been estimated on an occasional basis since the late 1990s. These estimates indicate that public expenditure exceeds taxes collected in Northern Ireland. The estimates of this funding shortfall, often referred to as the 'Fiscal Deficit', are set out in the following table.</p>

The Environment Agency (EA) also maintains its own local, regional and national level flood contingency plans. At the national level, DEFRA is the lead role for flood emergencies within Government, and our Lead Department Plan sets out the co-ordination arrangements needed at all levels.</p>

The EA, with other stakeholders, also carries out a regular programme of exercises to test its capability at all levels. This included a national level exercise in 2004, Exercise Triton.</p>

 During 2006, the England rural development programme will continue to be funded by EU rural development money from the European agricultural guidance and guarantee fund (EAGGF) and by transfers from Pillar 1 direct payments through voluntary modulation.

This will include funds transferred from the 5 per cent. compulsory modulation applied in the old EU-15 member states. Any money from this fund must be co-financed by the national exchequer. This will normally involve equal funding by the Exchequer and the EU, although new rules allow this to be set at a ratio of 45 per cent. exchequer funding to 55 per cent.

 The Rural Payments Agency (RPA) has kept Ministers and officials informed of the impact of administering the Single Payment Scheme (SPS) on all of the Agency&#146;s programmes. Given the importance of the SPS to the farming community RPA has, with ministerial agreement, sought to focus as many staff as it can on that scheme. This has meant that less effort has been deployed on some other activities at particular points over the past year and has resulted in a reduction in previous performance levels on other schemes. The Agency has kept representative organisations informed of its approach to SPS and other activities.</p>

 The Agency did not recover assets equivalent to 100 per cent. of its budget for 2004-05 which was its second full year of operation. Civil recovery cases in the High Court can take over two years to complete litigation. This period is longer where respondents seek to use all their rights of appeal. The impact of legal challenges, although inevitable with new legislation, has delayed the progress of cases in the High Court. The Agency's Annual Report for 2005-06, which will set out progress in meeting last year's targets, will be laid before Parliament shortly.</p>

 Draft regulations were submitted to the Domestic Affairs Committee prior to being laid before Parliament. A full regulatory impact assessment was completed. It was acknowledged that small organisations would probably not be able to satisfy the minimum threshold and would need to approach other organisations in order to obtain checks on their employees and incur the associated costs. However, in some cases it was concluded that the costs of using such an organisation would be lower than the administrative costs of running and maintaining a small volume Registered Body.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_284"><a name="60608w0012.htm_para0"><a name="06060913001692">The proposed changes arose from a key recommendation of the 2002 Independent Review of the CRB and were supported by the recent Bichard Inquiry.

To this end, there are several voluntary and not-for-profit Umbrella Bodies (UBs) that serve the VCS and details of these are available on an improved web page of the CRB website. Charges by these UBs are comparatively low and in some cases, services are free to volunteers. Access to the disclosure service will be maintained by this UB network. By using voluntary or not-for-profit UBs, the cost of accessing the disclosure service will be kept to an absolute minimum for voluntary organisations and, in many cases, the charges will be less than the administrative costs associated with direct registration with the CRB.</p>

 The Identity Cards Act 2006 does not provide for any direct access to information on the National Identity Register (NIR) for organisations, either with or without the consent of the individual. The Identity and Passport Service (IPS) intends to provide an identity verification service. This does not provide direct access to the NIR but rather it intends to verify an individual&#146;s identity in a method appropriate to the situation, ranging from an electronic card authentication to the provision of information to an organisation based on a specific request.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_300"><a name="60608w0013.htm_para7"><a name="06060913001803">The Identity Cards Act 2006 establishes a number of conditions and safeguards regarding the use of the identity verification service by organisations.</p>

Section 12 covers the provision of information with the consent of the individual. It limits the information that may be provided to organisations as part of a verification check with consent and also allows for regulations to be made prescribing how the individual's authority and consent for the provision of information is to be given.  <br>

Private sector companies will only be permitted to use identity services with the consent of the individual and thus are regulated under this section.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_302"><a name="60608w0013.htm_para9"><a name="06060913001805">Sections 13-16 cover the use of identity services in relation to the provision of public services. These sections ensure that the use of identity services by public service providers must be approved by Parliament by affirmative order and may also be subject to consultation with the users of that service before it can commence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_303"><a name="60608w0013.htm_para10"><a name="06060913001806">Powers to provide information from the NIR without consent are strictly limited and laid out in Sections 17-21. Information may be disclosed without consent to Security and Intelligence Agencies for the purposes of carrying out their functions. The Police and the Commissioners of Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs may also be provided with information held on the scheme but the type of information and the circumstances in which it may be provided are limited under Section 17(3) and 17(4). Furthermore, Section 18(4) limits the provision of information on when a person&#146;s record on the Register has been checked to purposes connected with the prevention and detection of serious crime alone. Under Section 17(5) and 20(1), the provision of information without consent to any other Government Department or public authority could not occur unless it had been approved by Parliament by affirmative order.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_304"><a name="60608w0013.htm_para11"><a name="06060913001807">The Act also provides for the accreditation of organisations before they can be provided with information from an individual's record from the NIR. The accreditation process will establish the business need for the information and whether their internal systems and procedures are satisfactory. The process will also establish the terms and conditions under which an organisation can use the identity services offered by IPS.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_305"><a name="60608w0013.htm_para12"><a name="06060913001808">With regard to the use of this information by organisations, there are also a number of safeguards.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_306"><a name="60608w0013.htm_para13"><a name="06060913001809">Firstly, user organisations will continue to be subject to the provisions of the Data Protection Act 1998 in how they handle any information received from a verification check. Thus, the safeguards within that Act and the independent oversight of the Information Commissioner in relation to its provisions will apply.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_307"><a name="60608w0013.htm_para14"><a name="06060913001810">Secondly, the National Identity Scheme Commissioner (NISC) or, where appropriate, the Intelligence Services Commissioner will provide independent oversight as to how the National Identity Scheme operates and the uses to which ID cards are put. The NISC will publish a report every year, which will be laid before Parliament.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_308"><a name="60608w0013.htm_para15"><a name="06060913001811">Thirdly, IPS will also reserve the right to audit any user organisation&#146;s processes to ensure they remain compliant with the terms and conditions of the use of the identity verification services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_309"><a name="60608w0013.htm_para16"><a name="06060913001812">Finally, Section 21 of the Identity Cards Act provides for the establishment of restrictions on how the provision of information without consent may operate, which may include stipulations that only certain ranks or postholders in an organisation are permitted to receive any information provided after a request for information from the NIR.</p>

 Absconds can only take place from open prisons and only prisoners who are category D, the lowest security category, can be placed in open conditions. Open prisons take prisoners who are nearing completion of their sentence in preparation for their release. As part of the categorisation process prisoners are subject to a rigorous and robust risk assessment. Only those assessed as not being a risk to the public and of low risk of escape will be categorised as D.</p>

 The Government of Afghanistan's National Police Reform Programme has not, up to now, reached the southern provinces and training of the National Afghan Police (ANP) in Helmand province has been slow. This has been largely due to the difficult security situation in southern Afghanistan which has hampered the International Community's efforts to provide training and follow-up support. Since the establishment of the UK-led Provincial Reconstruction Team in Helmand on 1 May 2006, the UK has been working closely with the provincial government and the Ministry of Interior to accelerate progress. At the beginning of this year there were around 1,700 ANP in Helmand, of varying levels of expertise. Many will need additional training. Approximately 200 additional trained ANP officers have since been redeployed from elsewhere in Afghanistan to reinforce the current force levels while new recruits are trained and equipped under the German/US police training programme. The pay and rank review currently underway will determine the final shape of the police structure in Helmand.</p>

 The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), as the United Kingdom (UK) competent authority responsible for the regulation of medicines, has in place comprehensive systems of surveillance, including medicines testing, reporting of adverse reactions, inspections, product recall and intelligence gathering, based on an ongoing assessment of risk. The MHRA also operates a comprehensive anti-counterfeiting strategy, advising the Government and working with partners and stakeholders to ensure that current safeguards work effectively and that vigilance against counterfeit medicines entering the legitimate UK supply chain is maintained.</p>

The first report of the National Reporting and Learning System and the Patient Safety Observatory&#148;. At the time of publication, the NPSA estimated that the annual figures for NHS acute hospitals in England would be in the order of 840 patient safety incident-related deaths from 572,000 reported incidents from acute hospitals each year in England. The estimate was derived from 18 acute hospitals consistently reporting to the NPSA from October to December 2004 and was adjusted for variations in reporting, as well as deaths which had been incorrectly labelled as patient safety incidents.
