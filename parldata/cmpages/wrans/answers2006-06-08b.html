basis through test-purchase operations carried out by Police and
Trading Standards officers. In addition to this regular activity, the
fourth national Alcohol Misuse Enforcement Campaign (AMEC 4) is
currently under way. Part of this includes the provision of extra
funding for up to 5,000 test-purchase operations during the four-week
period of the campaign. Those who sell to under-18s risk a &#163;80
Fixed Penalty Notice, or prosecution. Licensees selling to uder-18s
additionally risk having their licence reviewed and conditions applied,
or even having their license
revoked.</p><p><a name="06060876001133">The Violent
Crime Reduction Bill currently before Parliament establishes a new
offence of persistently selling alcohol to under-18s. If three sales
are made in3 consecutive months, the new offence will be

their licence suspended for 3 months. The police can offer the licensee
the option of avoiding prosecution by closing their premises for 48
hours.</p><p><a name="06060876001134">In addition to
enforcement activity, Ministers and officials from the Home Office and
the Department of Culture, Media and Sport are working very closely

off-licensed sector and the on-licensed sector to seek to eliminate
sales of alcohol to children. Progress against these commitments will
be monitored closely through test-purchase failure
rates.</p><p><a name="06060876001135">The Government
are aware of the problems faced by young people when wishing to prove
their age or purchase age restricted products, also by retailers when
requesting proof of identity. Consequently, the Government are working
with the British Retail Consortium&#146;s Proof of Age Standards
Scheme (PASS) which validates the variety of proof of age card schemes
available. This allows card schemes to apply for accreditation under
PASS and entitles them to issue cards displaying the PASS holographic
logo. This is easily recognisable both to retailers and young people
and helps them know that they have a proof of age document which should
be accepted. The logo is trademark registered, making it an offence to
forge. In the longer term, the identity card can be used as proof of
age as well as proof of identity, however, this is a few years away

DFID is supporting a wide range of activities to help countries detect

outlined below.</p><p><a name="06060913000468">When I
visited the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in October 2005, the
main focus was to urge the Congolese Government to tackle
corruption&#151;particularly within the army pay
system.</p><p><a name="06060913000469">I
had frank discussions with President Kibaki of Kenya about corruption
when I visited in January 2006. Since then some steps, including the
removal of three senior ministers, has taken place in response to
public pressure following the release of the Githongo dossier and
Goldenberg report. This is an encouraging start but Kenyans are calling
for more to be done. When I met President Kibaki again recently, I
stressed the importance of continued progress in the corruption
investigations. I have also met with several Kenyan Members of
Parliament (MPs) to discuss progress on corruption and specifically the
Public Accounts Committee report on the so-called Anglo-Leasing
affair.</p><p><a name="06060913000470">I
met President Kagame and Ministers in Rwanda in November 2005.
Discussions focused on the Rwanda-UK Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)
which covers corruption among other
issues.</p><p><a name="06060913000471">When visiting
Tanzania in May 2006, President Kikwete and I focused discussions on
corruption and growth. Following progress made by his predecessor
Benjamin Mpaka, President Kikwete is determined to improve governance
and tackle high level
corruption.</p><p><a name="06060913000472">I met
President Museveni when I visited Uganda in May 2006. I discussed the

provided to organisations as part of a verification check with consent
and also allows for regulations to be made prescribing how the
individual's authority and consent for the provision of information is
to be given.

section.</p><p><a name="06060913001805">Sections
13-16 cover the use of identity services in relation to the provision
of public services. These sections ensure that the use of identity
services by public service providers must be approved by Parliament by
affirmative order and may also be subject to consultation with the
users of that service before it can
commence.</p><p><a name="06060913001806">Powers to
provide information from the NIR without consent are strictly limited
and laid out in Sections 17-21. Information may be disclosed without
consent to Security and Intelligence Agencies for the purposes of
carrying out their functions. The Police and the Commissioners of Her
Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs may also be provided with
information held on the scheme but the type of information and the
circumstances in which it may be provided are limited under Section
17(3) and 17(4). Furthermore, Section 18(4) limits the provision of
information on when a person&#146;s record on the Register has been
checked to purposes connected with the prevention and detection of
serious crime alone. Under Section 17(5) and 20(1), the provision of
information without consent to any other government department or
public authority could not occur unless it had been approved by
Parliament by affirmative
order.</p><p><a name="06060913001807">The Act also
provides for the accreditation of organisations before they can be
provided with information from an individual's record from the NIR. The
accreditation process will establish the business need for the
information and whether their internal systems and procedures are
satisfactory. The process will also establish the terms and conditions
under which an organisation can use the identity services offered by
IPS.</p><p><a name="06060913001808">With regard to
the use of this information by organisations, there are also a number
of
safeguards.</p><p><a name="06060913001809">Firstly,
user organisations will continue to be subject to the provisions of the
Data Protection Act 1998 in how they handle any information received
from a verification check. Thus, the safeguards within that Act and the
independent oversight of the Information Commissioner in relation to
its provisions will
apply.</p><p><a name="06060913001810">Secondly, the
National Identity Scheme Commissioner (NISC) or, where appropriate, the
Intelligence Services Commissioner will provide independent oversight
as to how the National Identity Scheme operates and the uses to which
ID cards are put. The NISC will publish a report every year, which will
be laid before
Parliament.</p><p><a name="06060913001811">Thirdly,
IPS will also reserve the right to audit any user organisation&#146;s
processes to ensure they remain compliant with the terms and conditions
of the use of the identity verification
services.</p><p><a name="06060913001812">Finally,
Section 21 of the Identity Cards Act provides for the establishment of
restrictions on how the provision of information without consent may
operate, which may include stipulations that only certain ranks or
postholders in an organisation are permitted to receive any information
provided after a request for information from the NIR.</p><br><notus-date day="8" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>8 Jun 2006 : Column 815W</b><br><h3 align="center"><a name="06060913000128">Opiate

the International Community's efforts to provide training and follow-up
support. Since the establishment of the UK led Provincial
Reconstruction Team in Helmand on 1 May 2006, the UK has been working
closely with the provincial government and the Ministry of Interior to
accelerate progress. At the beginning of this year there were around
1,700 ANP in Helmand, of varying levels of expertise. Many will need
additional training. Approximately 200 additional trained ANP officers
have since been redeployed from elsewhere in Afghanistan to reinforce
the current force levels while new recruits are trained and equipped
under the German/US police training programme. The pay and rank review
currently underway will determine the final shape of the police

that the Act provides. Section 11 of the Act sets out the procedure for
notifying the relevant local authority of cases of cholera, plague,
relapsing fever, smallpox, typhus and food poisoning. Regulations made
under the Act (the Public Health (Infectious Diseases) Regulations
1988) apply section 11 to certain other infectious
diseases<sup>(1)</sup>.</p><p><a name="06060913002808">However,

HIV, local and national data are collected from several sources
including reporting of diagnosed cases by clinicians and laboratories
and by unlinked anonymous surveys of HIV prevalence in population
sub-groups, such as genito-urinary medicine (GUM) clinic attendees and
injecting drug users in contact with specialist services. Similarly,
for other sexually transmitted infections, there are other surveillance
methods used including returns from GUM clinics of episodes of sexually
transmitted infections and the national Chlamydia screening
programme.</p><p><a name="06060913002810">Making HIV

does not readily pass from birds to humans and there is currently no
evidence that this pathogen is capable of spreading from
person-to-person efficiently nor of sustaining such transmission. This
infection can only be diagnosed by laboratory confirmation of the
pathogen as the clinical illness has similarities with several other
infections. H5N1 infection in birds or poultry, which comes within the
definition of avian influenza, is notifiable as a disease of animals
and as an animal disease that may transmit to humans. This allows
measures to be put in place to reduce the risk of spread to other birds
