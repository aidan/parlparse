To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will enable the Drinking Water Inspectorate to seek authorisation for a wider range of remedial works before a failure occurs.  [33034]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80312w01.html_spnew0"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 Water companies have a duty to supply drinking water which is wholesome and it is for each company to decide how to maintain their assets to avoid future breaches of the standards. If water fails to meet quality standards, the Drinking Water Inspectorate will take enforcement action against the company, or prosecute them for supplying water unfit for human consumption.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what is the cost of leasing the Jaguar 4.0i LWB for the use of the Deputy Prime Minister from the Government Car Service. [32992]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80312w01.html_spnew1"><B> Angela Eagle </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 5 March 1998]:</i> The current weekly cost to the Department of leasing the car and a full-time driver from the Government Car Service is &#163;1,185. The car is not provided for the exclusive use of the Deputy Prime Minister but undertakes other activities, such as the delivery of urgent papers and Ministerial boxes. The basis on which the leasing costs are determined are the same as those which applied to the previous Administration and apply similarly to the current arrangements under which the Government Car Service provides a car for the use of the Leader of the Opposition.

<a name="80312w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Tom King: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will review how the migration assumptions used in the sub-national population and household projections are calculated, in respect of the emphasis laid on forecasts of future regional and sub-regional economic activity rather than past trends.  [33827]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80312w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The 1996-based sub-national population projections are due to be published in the autumn of this year. Production of the household projections will follow some months later. As in the past, local authorities will be consulted on the migration assumptions within the population projections. At a consultation meeting last December, local government and academic representatives supported the view that both the population and household projections should be based on past trends. It should be noted that regional economic factors are taken into account alongside the household projections when deciding on appropriate housing figures for Regional Planning Guidance.
<P>
<P>
<a name="80312w01.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Tom King: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions when he intends that regional planning conferences should start producing the annual reports on indicators relevant to housing provision proposed in paragraph 31 of Planning for the Communities of the Future (Cm 3885).  [33822]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80312w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 As explained in paragraphs 33 and 34 of the document, the Government wish to implement the new arrangements as quickly as possible. When RPG is already under review the Government office will discuss with the Regional Planning Conferences the scope for 



<P>
<P><I>12 Mar 1998 : Column: 263</I><P>
adopting the new approach in completing those reviews. Arrangements for monitoring would be a feature of those discussions. Additionally, the Department intends shortly to publish advice on monitoring indicators.
<P>
<P>
<a name="80312w01.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Tom King: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what steps he is taking to make chairmen of county structure plan examinations in public, who have not yet finalised their reports, aware of the policy and priority changes proposed in "Planning for the Communities of the Future" (Cm 3885).  [33823]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80312w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 As a matter of Departmental policy, all those who serve as Chairmen of structure plan Examinations in Public are sent copies of new national planning policy statements and guidance when they are published. This includes copies of "Planning for the Communities of the Future", though it should be noted that some elements of that document are, or will be, the subject of public consultation before being finalised.
<P>
<P>
<a name="80312w01.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Tom King: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will define local ownership of the housing figures as referred to in paragraph 25 of "Planning for the Communities of the Future" (Cm 3885).  [33828]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80312w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 As explained in "Planning for the Communities of the Future" the new system will make local authorities more responsible for assessing their housing requirements, in partnership with the Government Offices, and more accountable for the results. This should increase their sense of ownership of the resulting housing figures.
<P>
<P>
<a name="80312w01.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Tom King: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what proposals he has to implement the provisions of <i>(a)</i> paragraph 76, in respect of low density greenfield development and <i>(b)</i> paragraph 86, in respect of a mix of size of housing units to reflect increasing demand by small households, of "Planning for the Communities of the Future" (Cm 3885).  [33821]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80312w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 Current planning policy guidance (PPG3) already enables local planning authorities to seek a reasonable mix and balance of house types and sizes to cater for a range of housing needs. Nevertheless, as the policy document "Planning for the Communities of the Future" indicates, PPG3 needs to be revised to bring it up to date. The Government's policies on housing density issues will also be considered as part of that review. We hope to issue a draft PPG3 for consultation by the summer recess.
<P>
<P>
<a name="80312w01.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Tom King: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he intends to publish detailed advice and requirements on how the sustainability appraisal of draft regional planning guidance on housing projections, proposed in paragraph 28 of "Planning for the Communities of the Future" (Cm 3885) will be implemented.  [33826]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80312w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 As indicated in the consultation paper on the future of Regional Planning Guidance (RPG), published on 15 January, when copies were placed in the Library, the intention is that future reviews of RPG will be subject to a full environmental appraisal. However, it goes on to say that we are also considering the scope to 



<P>
<P><I>12 Mar 1998 : Column: 264</I><P>
move towards a more broadly based "sustainability appraisal" of RPG. We will be letting a research project in May to determine how best to undertake a sustainability appraisal of RPG and produce good practice guidance on undertaking such an appraisal. It is intended to publish the results of the research in March 1999.
<P>
<P>
<a name="80312w01.html_wqn10"><B> Mr. Tom King: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what proposals he has for a public information campaign on the issues involved in the projections for and planning of new homes; and how much he plans to spend on this in <i>(a)</i> the current year and <i>(b)</i> subsequently.  [33824]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80312w01.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 These issues continue to be well-aired in public debate. In addition, my right hon. and hon. Friends and I will be making speeches, and my Department will be organising meetings, over the coming months, in connection with the recently published policy document, "Planning for the Communities of the Future" (Cm 3885). We do not, at this stage, see a need for a paid public information campaign.

<a name="80312w03.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Rhodri Morgan: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (1) what estimate he has made of the percentage of the United Kingdom <i>(a)</i> dunlin and <i>(b)</i> redshank over-wintering population covered by conservation agreements in connection with the agreements signed with the European Commission Environmental Protection Directorate at the time of approval for the Cardiff Bay Barrage; and if he will make a statement;  [34173]

<UL>(2) what was the timetable agreed in undertakings given to the Environmental Protection Directorate of the European Commission at the time of the approval for the Cardiff Bay Barrage for the establishment of conservation agreements for habitats of <i>(a)</i> dunlin and <i>(b)</i> redshank expressed as a percentage of the over-wintering populations in any one year.  [34174]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80312w03.html_spnew4"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 When the UK Government agreed compensatory measures for the loss of Cardiff Bay with the European Commission, it was estimated that some 80 per cent. of dunlin and 85 per cent. of redshank wintering populations would be covered by the eventual UK network of Special Protection Areas (SPAs) classified under the EU Birds Directive. There was no agreed timetable. We now know that the original population estimates, which were calculated using the total of the peak mean counts for the major sites identified in the UK's preliminary list of potential SPAs, as a percentage of the UK total wintering populations for both species, were too high. According to the most recent count data available (January 1996), 58 per cent. of all counted dunlin and 42 per cent. of counted redshank were on classified SPAs. Revised figures show that the completed SPA network will eventually cover 63 per cent. of the 



<P>
<P><I>12 Mar 1998 : Column: 269</I><P>
wintering dunlin and 48 per cent. of the wintering redshank populations. The European Commission has been informed of these revised figures.

<a name="80312w04.html_spnew3"><B> Dr. David Clark: </B> 
 The Government have today published the 1997 Next Steps Report, CM-3889, which has been laid in both Houses. This report brings together performance and trend data on 138 executive agencies and four departments operating on Next Steps lines. It is now 10 years since the Next Steps policy was launched. As the report makes clear, the percentage of civil servants working in Next Steps agencies or in departments organised on Next Steps lines last year passed the target of 75 per cent. set during the early days of the project. This is a considerable milestone in a project which, with cross-party support, has brought improvements in efficiency and customer focus across a wide range of services provided by government.
<P>

<a name="80312w04.html_para1">The Government believe that the benefits from this change to civil service organisation can be developed further. Analysis of agency performance data shows that the need for continuous improvement has not always been given sufficient attention, in part because it has been overshadowed by the emphasis on agency creation. The Government are therefore marking a change in priorities by moving on from the agency creation phase of the Next Steps policy, and launching a new phase with the focus on performance. While agencies will continue to be created, the primary focus will be on further improving the quality, efficiency and convenience to users of agency services.




<P>
<P><I>12 Mar 1998 : Column: 273</I><P>
Ministers will be concerned to ensure that agency targets set out sufficiently clearly the level and direction of achievement required. Agencies will be encouraged to share best practice, including harnessing the full potential of IT and cooperating with other bodies beyond the agency boundaries. These themes will be further developed in the Better Government White Paper to be published later in the Spring. Building on the sound principles of Next Steps, it is our intention to see that the agencies of government are among the world leaders in delivering high quality, efficient and effective public services for the new Millennium.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80312w05.html_spnew16"><B> Mr. Fatchett: </B> 
 The International Maritime Organisation and the International Atomic Energy Agency set extremely high standards for shipments of nuclear waste. My right hon. Friend the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary was able to assure Caribbean Ministers that the ships that BNFL use for such cargoes fully meet or exceed these standards. The casks containing the waste are massive steel structures designed to withstand collision, fire and submersion. The waste itself is in a solid glass-like form which could not cause widespread contamination in any credible accident scenario. These are regular commercial shipments; the companies involved are substantial and are required to carry liability insurance. I have placed copies of the Statements issued at the end of the UK/Caribbean Forum in the Libraries of both Houses.

<a name="80312w07.html_spnew0"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The latest figures from the University and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS) show that the fall in applicant numbers by 15 December was--at some 4 per cent.--even lower than the figure it announced before Christmas (6 per cent.); and by 5 February the fall in applicant numbers compared with the same date last year was down to just under 3 per cent. It is still too early to use these figures as a definitive guide to final applicant or entrant numbers. Last year, applicant numbers as at 15 December represented about 75 per cent. of the final number received. However, they are a welcome sign that many prospective students and their parents now understand the fairness of the Government's proposals.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80312w07.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 Musical instrument tuition is usually given by peripatetic instructors. It is the responsibility of schools and LEAs to decide if instructors are adequately qualified. No minimum qualification requirements are laid down nationally. If, however, such instruction in a state funded school is given by a person who is employed as a teacher, it is a condition of their employment that they should normally hold qualified teacher status.

 The Department's requirements for courses of initial training do not stipulate age limits for entry to PGCE or other initial training courses. Providers, who are responsible for the selection of candidates, are expected to use their discretion to ensure that all trainees who successfully complete a course will be employable.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, pursuant to his oral answer to the hon. Member for Bolton, North-East (Mr. Crausby) of 16 February 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, column 747, what was the basis of the calculation of the figure of &#163;450 million a year with reference to the cost of extending the concessionary television licence scheme.  [33502]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80312w08.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Fisher: </B> 
 The figure of &#163;450 million a year referred to in my reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Bolton, North-East (Mr. Crausby) relates to the estimated cost in lost television licence fee revenue of providing concessionary television licences for all pensioner-only households. These costs are estimated at &#163;463 million in the case of free licences and &#163;437 million for &#163;5 licences.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport (1) what would be the cost of introducing a concession of 50 per cent. on television licences for all pensioner households;  [33468]

<UL>(2) what would be the cost of extending the present entitlement to concessionary television licences to all pensioners over <i>(a)</i> 75 and <i>(b)</i> 80 years of age.  [33469]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80312w08.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Fisher: </B> 
 To provide a 50% reduction in the licence fee for all pensioner-only households would cost approximately &#163;232 million annually in lost television licence fee revenue. To extend the existing &#163;5 concessionary television licence scheme to households where all members are aged 75 or over would cost an estimated &#163;153 million a year; to extend the scheme to households where all members are aged 80 or over would cost approximately &#163;79 million a year.

Standard Grade courses for pupils aged 14-16 provide opportunities to study history in Scottish, British and other wider contexts. Further opportunities for the study of Scottish, British and other areas of history are provided in the current Revised Higher and Certificate of Sixth Year Studies courses.

To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland if he will list, for each offer of regional selective assistance made during 1997, the percentage of the project's capital cost represented by the grant offered; and if he will indicate, for each offer, if it related to an area of full or intermediate assisted area status.  [33704]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80312w08.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 Each year there are more than 200 offers of Regional Selective Assistance in Scotland. Information about the capital costs of individual projects is commercially confidential. The percentages of grant to capital costs for the total of RSA offers in 1997 in the Scottish Development Areas range from a minimum of 2.8 per cent. to a maximum of 29 per cent., and 2.8 per cent. to 14.9 per cent. respectively in Intermediate Areas. These figures are calculated on the basis of Net Grant Equivalent, which is expressed as the discounted value of grant, net of tax, as a proportion of the discounted fixed capital costs. These vary widely according to the type of project and reflect the selective nature of the RSA scheme whereby projects are secured for the minimum necessary costs.

 A new quality assurance scheme for accommodation providers and for visitor attractions has been introduced by the Scottish Tourist Board.
<P>

<a name="80312w09.html_para3">Promotional activity for tourism in Scotland will benefit from the Government's decision to allocate &#163;19.3 million to the Scottish Tourist Board in 1998-99, an increase of &#163;1 million over the planned provision by the previous Administration.
<P>

<a name="80312w09.html_para4">The Scottish Tourist Board, with assistance from the Department of Trade and Industry sector challenge fund, is implementing an information technology strategy for the industry. This will enable tourists to access information and make bookings more easily. Trade communication has benefited from the work of the Scottish Tourism Forum, an industry representative body established by The Scottish Office.
<P>

<a name="80312w09.html_para5">I announced in October 1997 the establishment of a group to consider and advise on how the tourism industry in Scotland can maximise its performance as we enter the new Millennium. The group will be chaired by Lord Gordon of Strathblane, the new Chairman of the Scottish Tourist Board, and will report to the Scottish Tourism Co-ordinating Group, which I chair.
<P>

<a name="80312w09.html_para6">I am announcing later this month further action designed to promote tourism training and tourism as a career.

I shall ensure that the hon. Member receives a copy, and that copies are placed in the Libraries of both Houses of Parliament.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80312w10.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The objective of the support to the rendering industry was to avoid the disorderly collapse of the meat chain in the immediate aftermath of the BSE crisis. This was achieved. A wide range of industry bodies and representatives were involved in drawing up the Schemes, which were always intended to cover only the financial years 1996/97 and 1997/98, and to provide reduced support in the second year to allow the meat chain to adjust to the post BSE economic and regulatory realities.
<P>

<a name="80312w10.html_para13">The Government are neutral on the issue of hunting. They have made no specific assessment of how a hunting ban would affect livestock farmers who dispose of casualty stock. The Government are, however, fully aware of the current difficulties faced by farmers in the disposal of fallen stock and the important role played by hunt kennels in the disposal chain. Officials are liaising with farming representatives to consider how farmers should, in future, dispose of fallen stock and to encourage the industry to put suitable arrangements in place.

The Technical Standards Directive requires that there shall be a three-month standstill period from the date of notification. During this period, the Commission and other member states have the opportunity to comment on the proposed regulations. It is a matter for individual member states whether, and on what basis, they choose to consult outside interests about measures notified under these procedures.

 Measures against potato brown rot are kept under review, in the light of findings in the UK and other Member States and the results of research. Since the Netherlands announced a number of outbreaks in 1995, the Department has increased the number of inspections and laboratory tests on Dutch ware potatoes, but has not confirmed any findings of brown rot. In these circumstances, a ban would not be justified. There is evidence that, although in certain conditions brown rot could cause significant damage to UK crops, localised outbreaks can be eradicated. The Department is discussing with interested parties plans for eradicating the bacterium from infected watercourses, where it could present a risk of further spread.

 I had useful recent discussions with IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus on the current financial problems in Asia, at both the ECOFIN meeting of EU Finance Ministers on 16 February and at the meeting of G7 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors on 21 February. In addition, I have been keeping in close and regular touch with the UK's Executive Director to the IMF in Washington. I am encouraged that confidence is beginning to return in those countries where reforms are being implemented with vigour. But the situation in Indonesia remains of serious concern, and renewed commitment to the IMF programme will be vital if financial stability is to be restored.

initiative that was launched by the IMF and World Bank in September 1996. In my speech to Commonwealth Finance Ministers in Mauritius last year, I called on the international community to commit itself to dealing with the problem of unsustainable debt burdens faced by the world's poorest countries once and for all. I urged creditors and debtors to undertake concrete action in order to ensure that at least three-quarters of the twenty countries, initially identified by the World Bank and IMF as probably needing debt relief under the HIPC initiative, have had decisions on the size and timing of their relief by the year 2000. I also encouraged all countries identified under the initiative to embark on the process of securing debt relief by the millennium. The Government propose to continue their efforts to ensure that these targets are met.
<P>

 In July 1997 the European Commission issued outline proposals for the next Financial Perspective, which they proposed should run from 2000 to 2006.

 After the launch of the euro on 1 January 1999, the national currencies of participating countries will continue to exist as national currency denominations (or units) of the euro during a transitional period of three years. Conversion from one of these national denominations to another national denomination will need to be effected via a conversion to the euro unit, or by another process producing the same result, to ensure that mathematical discrepancies do not arise. This process is described as triangulation and is set out in Council Regulation (EC) No 1103/97 on certain provisions relating to the introduction of the euro, adopted on 17 June 1997. Given that it applies to conversion between national currency units of participating countries and not the euro unit itself, its use will not arise for the calculation and presentation of accounts in euro.

<a name="80312w14.html_spnew11"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 We have received a large number of comments and representations on the proposal to withdraw the cash basis practices. A few of these suggested that there was a double taxation effect of the proposed catch up charge, but we do not accept that there is. The catch up charge brings into account, only once, the receipts which would have been included had the business always been taxed on the accruals basis, and which would otherwise escape tax altogether on moving to that basis, because they were earned in an earlier period.
<P>
<P>

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer, pursuant to his answer to the hon. Member for Preseli Pembrokeshire (Ms Lawrence) of 22 December 1997, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>471</i>, on business profits, in what way the imposition of the catch up charge proposed in the Government's proposals to withdraw the cash basis of taxation for professional businesses <i>(a)</i> corrects an anomaly and <i>(b)</i> creates a level playing field for all businesses.  [33200]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80312w14.html_spnew12"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 The normal way in which those carrying on a business compute profits for tax is on the 'earnings' or 'accruals' concept under which items are brought into account not as money is received or paid, but 



<P>
<P><I>12 Mar 1998 : Column: 312</I><P>
as receipts are 'earned' or expenses 'incurred'. However, the Inland Revenue had long-standing published practices under which self-employed people carrying on a business which counts as a 'profession or vocation' may choose a special basis for computing their tax profits, often called a 'cash' basis. Professionals on a cash basis can, subject to certain conditions, compute their tax profits by bringing into account money only as it is received or paid out. Many professional businesses do not adopt a cash basis, but the tax profits of those that do are generally lower than they would be if they were computed on an earnings or accruals basis.
<P>

<a name="80312w14.html_para1">The idea of withdrawal of the cash basis was to level the playing field for all businesses. The catching up charge is necessary to ensure that the transition from cash to accruals basis does not leave out tax receipts, less any expenses, which have not yet been included in their tax returns, but which would have been included if the accruals basis had always applied.

 I have today placed in the Library a table showing what further progress has been made in the period up to 28 February 1998 by the 41 firms the Government have been monitoring.
<P>

<a name="80312w15.html_para3">Continuing the trend established in recent months, the table shows that the firms have made further progress during the month, and that about 65 per cent. of the cases identified for review are now completed.
<P>

<a name="80312w15.html_para4">The general trend hides a wide range of different performances. A few firms--8 in all--have yet to complete even half their cases. One is still some way short 



<P>
<P><I>12 Mar 1998 : Column: 316</I><P>
of the 10 per cent. mark. At the other end of the scale seven of the 41 firms I am monitoring have now completed over three quarters of their cases identified for review.
<P>

<a name="80312w15.html_para5">In previous announcements, I have underlined the importance that both the Government and the regulators attach to all firms, including small firms, taking all possible steps to complete their reviews. I have also made it clear that firms will not escape sanction if they fail to act. That was not an empty threat. Two days ago, the Personal Investment Authority (PIA) announced it was investigating apparent failures to meet the regulator's targets for completing the most urgent case reviews in respect of about 600 small firms, with a view to taking disciplinary action. The firms concerned should have completed at least 90 per cent. of the top priority cases--which include people who are already retired or have died--by the end of December 1997. Far too many small firms appear to have failed to tackle even these most pressing cases. This is simply not acceptable, and PIA's action is to be commended.
<P>

<a name="80312w15.html_para6">As noted above, a number of large firms have resolved over three quarters of their cases. Some of these firms are now getting close to the point where they will have completed their priority cases. This is welcome news. However it highlights the importance of looking forward beyond the first phase of the review of pensions mis-selling. The first step has rightly been to address the more pressing categories of cases, for example the cases of those who are most likely to have lost out and those either in or close to retirement. But they are not the only victims of pensions mis-selling and it is now important to look ahead at how to address the less pressing cases, which have in the past been referred to as "non-priority" cases.
<P>

<a name="80312w15.html_para7">The regulators--Financial Services Authority (FSA) and the PIA--have today issued a consultation document setting out proposals for taking forward the review of personal pensions mis-selling into its second phase. Copies have been placed in the Library. The Government welcome this step forward, which reflects the outcome of research on the extent of the problem.
<P>

<a name="80312w15.html_para8">The document sets out the regulators' proposed approach for firms to tackle the second phase of the review, building on experience of the first phase. It is important to note that this policy is not yet finalised. The way forward must be practicable. It must work. That is why the regulators have chosen to consult.
<P>

<a name="80312w15.html_para9">This is particularly important given that initial research commissioned by the FSA suggests that it will be a large task--potentially involving as many as 1.8 million cases. Whatever the final figures turn out to be, it is clear that the scale is such that it is in everyone's interests that the process adopted is the right one. To that end I urge everyone that is involved or has an interest to participate in the consultation--including investors, occupational pension schemes and of course the firms themselves. In doing that I hope that everyone will make constructive contributions. That is the only way to see that the final policy that the regulators adopt is the best way forward, in the interests of investors and ultimately in the interests of the industry.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>As Director of the Office for National Statistics (ONS), I have been asked to reply to your parliamentary question on the implications of the proposed changes in the calculation of the main figure for GDP.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>From September 1998 the UK will implement the new European System of Accounts (ESA95), both for UK publication and for data provided to Eurostat and other international organisations. As part of this process, GDP at market prices would become the main figure reported for GDP. This is one of a number of changes being considered which would affect the presentation of the UK national

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will make a statement on the Council Meeting of the Economic and Finance Ministers of the European Union held on 9 March.  [34326]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80312w16.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Gordon Brown: </B> 
 I chaired the Economic and Finance Council--ECOFIN--of the European Union in Brussels on 9 March. The Economic Secretary represented the UK.
<P>

<a name="80312w16.html_para0">The Council began by discussing its recommendation to the Parliament that they discharge the Budget for 1996. Prof. Friedmann, President of the European Court of Auditors (ECA), gave a full presentation of the key findings from his report on the implementation of the 1996 Budget. Both Commissioner Liikanen and other colleagues responded. Although I was able to congratulate Prof. Friedmann on an excellent and thorough report, and Commissioner Liikanen on the significant steps forward in financial management, I also noted the Council's disappointment that the ECA was again unable to provide us with a positive Statement of Assurance on the implementation of the Budget.
<P>

<a name="80312w16.html_para1">I also drew colleagues' attention to my intention to use the 19 May ECOFIN for a wide-ranging discussion of Community financing issues, including follow-up to the criticisms made in the ECA report, the next Preliminary Draft Budget (for 1999), and the future financing of the Community (on the basis of the Commission's Agenda 2000 proposals).
<P>

<a name="80312w16.html_para2">The Council next considered the follow-up to the code of conduct for business taxation agreed at the 1 December ECOFIN. We agreed the setting up of the assessment group provided for in the code. Commissioner Monti presented his draft directive regarding the taxation of interest and royalty payments between associated companies in different states.
<P>

<a name="80312w16.html_para3">The Council considered a memorandum on a coordinated European response to the challenges posed by the development of electronic commerce. After some contributions from Commissioner Monti and other colleagues, I noted that this was a matter of some interest to ECOFIN, and that we should return to it.
<P>

<a name="80312w16.html_para4">Under the preparation of Stage 3 of EMU, the Council received information from the Presidency, Commission, and Council Secretariat on the timetable for the EMU decision-making process. I also took the opportunity to remind colleagues of the importance of ensuring that national legislation, including the statutes of national central banks, is made compatible with the Treaty requirements for EMU.
<P>

<a name="80312w16.html_para5">On the basis of a presentation from Commissioner de Silguy, and a response from Sir Brian Unwin (President of the European Investment Bank), the Council discussed the principle of the Community guaranteeing EIB lending to Bosnia-Herzegovina.

 A programme of immunisation against anthrax is currently being offered to UK Service personnel and MOD civilians in the Gulf region.

 CR gas is a riot control agent designed to cause temporary irritation. The Ministry of Defence currently holds stocks of approximately 260kg for use if necessary by those units responsible for maintaining an effective counter terrorist response capability. This policy is consistent with the Chemical Weapons Convention, which permits the use of certain toxic chemicals for law enforcement purposes. Stocks of CR are held at the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency's Chemical and Biological Defence sector at Porton Down and at the relevant unit level. Figures for the annual cost of storing CR cannot separately be identified.

To ask the Secretary of State for Wales how much was spent from public funds on training how many people <i>(a)</i> in Wales and <i>(b)</i> in connection with LG companies in 1996-97; and if he will estimate expenditure and numbers in respect of <i>(a)</i> and <i>(b)</i> in (i) 1997-98 and (ii) 1998-99.  [33285]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80312w18.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 Welsh Office expenditure on the main youth and adult training programmes delivered via Training and Enterprise Councils in 1996-97 amounted to &#163;83.2 million and covered 37,734 starts by people on the programmes. Comparable provision in the current financial year amounts to &#163;86.1 million and it is estimated that, by the outturn, there will have been some 31,540 starts. For 1998-99, the equivalent figures are &#163;77 million and 29,000 starts, although target activity and funding levels are subject to on-going contractual negotiations with the TECs. These figures do not include training linked to TEC funding from their Business Growth and Start-Up budget and Local Initiative Fund, or training under the New Deal.
<P>

<a name="80312w18.html_para0">No public funds were spent on training in connection with LG companies in 1996-97. The above figures for 1997-98 and 1998-99 include 32 Modern Apprentices in training linked to LG companies, supported by Welsh Office funding of &#163;50,000 in 1997-98 and &#163;125,000 in 1998-99. In addition, in 1997-98, Gwent TEC has been allocated &#163;2 million for the training of 547 people from LG companies. The equivalent figures for 1998-99 are &#163;6 million for 1,660 people. Finally, LG (Electronics) has free occupancy of a Welsh Development Agency building to use as a training centre for 3 years. The value of this is estimated at some &#163;206,000 a year for 1997-98 and 1998-99. The costs of training at the Centre are being met by LG (Electronics), drawing on the funding assistance noted above.

The future of the Welsh coal industry depends on a number of factors, including the ability to compete and the availability of markets. These issues were considered at the Coal Workshop in Cardiff last December, the report of which will be issued for comment shortly.

 These goods, and others, are controlled under different entries in Part 1 of Schedule III to the Export of Goods (Control) Order which are known as the ratings for these goods: tear gas under entry ML7; and plastic bullets under entries ML3 or PL5021.
<P>

Between 1 January 1992 and 12 January 1998, 73 standard individual export licences were issued for the export to end users or consignees in Kenya of goods with these ratings. 61 of these licences covered goods rated ML3 and 12 covered goods rated PL5021; none covered goods rated ML7.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80312w19.html_spnew3"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 The entry in the legislation under which the export of goods is controlled is known as their rating. The export of tear gas is controlled under entry ML7 of Part III of Schedule 1 to the Export of Goods (Control) Order (the so-called "Military List"), and that of plastic bullets under entries ML3 or PL5021. Certain security and paramilitary police goods are specified under entry PL5001, but other goods with possible security uses may be controlled under various other entries in the Military List.

<a name="80312w19.html_para4">The Export Control Organisation's computer databases have been interrogated and the results are as follows. Between 1 January 1992 and 12 January 1998, 380 standard individual licences were issued for the export to end users or consignees in Kenya of goods described on the Military List. Between 1 January 1994 and 12 January 1998, 49 Open Individual Export Licences were issued for such exports. None of these licences covered goods rated ML7. Individual export licences can cover a range of goods, controlled under several entries in the legislation. Where this is so the licence is included in the Table in the total shown against each of the relevant ratings.

 The DTI is committed to providing a high quality of service to all its contacts. Staff are expected to deal with telephone calls in an efficient, effective and courteous manner, and this includes ensuring that calls from members of the public are returned. Tailored training is available for staff to help them meet this requirement. Consideration will also be given to introducing guidelines on call handling as part of the induction process for new staff.

Our understanding from initial reports is that good progress was reached in a wide range of areas but that agreement has still to be reached on a number of issues, notably on Taiwan's taxation of alcoholic spirits and in particular of Scotch Whisky where the UK has a strong interest. UK officials will continue to keep in close contact with the European Commission on this issue and to work hard towards a mutually acceptable solution.

 The Government believe that offenders--especially young offenders--should be made to face up to the impact of their offences on other people. We are following closely the development of restorative justice both in this country and abroad and recognise that, in appropriate circumstances, this approach may well be able to provide a useful tool for addressing law and order problems, particularly where young people are involved. We welcome the work to develop these ideas, such as that undertaken by the Thames Valley Police and the Northamptonshire Diversion Scheme.

 Final assessments of the amount of compensation payable were made some time ago by the independent assessor; in March 1995 in the cases of five of the men, and in the sixth case in July 1996. These have not been accepted. Significant interim payments have been made in all six cases, but it is not the practice to disclose the amount of such payments in individual cases. The assessor has considered further representations on behalf of all six men: the outcome of his consideration of the most recent representations in the cases of five of the men was communicated to their representatives last August and we await their response. The assessor has just completed his consideration of representations on behalf of the sixth man, and my officials will write to his representatives shortly. My officials have not met representatives of the six men to discuss compensation; nor would such a meeting be appropriate as the assessment of the amount of compensation payable is solely a matter for the independent assessor.

 During 1998 the Government will be preparing the Second United Kingdom Report to the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child in accordance with the requirements of Article 44 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, 1989. That process will also allow a review of the original reasons for the UK's reservations to the Convention made in 1991 and to what extent they remain valid in 1998. One particular reservation with respect to Article 37(d) was withdrawn by the previous Government on 18 April 1997.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80312w23.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 We have no such plans. Children's rights officers are usually appointed by local authorities. There is no statutory requirement that authorities should have such a post and it is up to each authority to determine the priority for this type of development.

 We have no plans to establish a Minister for Children with responsibilities for England. There are already systems in place to ensure cross-departmental co-operation in areas of shared interest. The Scottish and Welsh Offices have appointed Ministers for Children, but in their case, unlike in England, all social affairs responsibilities rest in the same department.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what action his Department has taken to ensure that doctors are aware of the contents of the leaflet "Sheep Dipping" published by HSE, VMD, MAFF and Department of Environment (9AS 29 (rev) 3/95 C250). [32057]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80312w23.html_spnew9"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 We have been advised that the leaflet AS29 issued by the Health and Safety Executive and the Veterinary Medicines Directorate (Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food) has recently been revised and the 



<P>
<P><I>12 Mar 1998 : Column: 348</I><P>
latest version is to be launched on 12 March. It is aimed at farmers and primarily gives advice on the safe use and disposal of sheep dips. The leaflet also refers to issues of health surveillance of people regularly using organophosphate sheep dips. We would expect occupational hygienists or occupational health professionals to be better placed to assist farmers on these matters than local general practitioners or hospitals. If contractors or employers need advice on health surveillance of employees, the HSE Employment Medical Advisory Service can and does provide it.
<P>

<a name="80312w23.html_para2">However, the Department has taken steps to increase awareness among medical practitioners. The Chief Medical Officers have written to doctors on a number of occasions since 1991 to remind them of the possibility of adverse effects from exposure to pesticides and certain veterinary medicines and to remind them of the reporting schemes. We are currently considering whether any further action may be necessary to advise doctors in this area and I will write to the hon. Member when a decision has been taken.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what percentage of British children suffer from malnutrition; and what was the figure in 1990.  [32550]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80312w24.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 Malnutrition can mean over-nourishment as well as under-nourishment. As there is no clearly defined or accepted definition of malnutrition, the Department does not have information in the form requested.
<P>

<a name="80312w24.html_para0">Nevertheless, the nutritional status of children can be assessed in several ways. The most widely adopted measure is height. An increase in height indicates an improvement in the nutrition of children. A continuous survey of English and Scottish children aged 5-11 years between 1972 to 1994 showed a year by year increase in the average height of all age groups. The same survey showed an increase in the mean weight for height index (an indicator of fatness) since about 1982, especially in girls. Another measure of fatness is Body Mass Index (BMI) and a recent survey indicated that the BMI of English children aged 2-15 years was generally higher than the 1990 reference figures. This indicates that children are generally getting fatter which represents an unsatisfactory trend.

<a name="80312w24.html_para1">The Health Survey for England 1996 provides some information on anaemia in children, which can be caused by iron deficiency. It indicated that in the 12-14 age group, about 3 per cent. of white boys and girls might have had an iron deficiency. A survey in 1992-93 of British children aged between 1&#189; and 4&#189; years indicated that over 8 per cent. might have been deficient in iron. However, there is no comparable information for 1990. The problems of deficiencies of iron are being investigated to identify how best to prevent the disorder in all population groups.

 There are currently no provisions for specific training for general practitioners before or post qualification for the diagnosis and treatment of myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME).
<P>

<a name="80312w25.html_para0">It is not practicable or desirable for the Government to prescribe the exact training that any individual doctor will receive. In general practice each trainee general practitioner will, during their year of general practice training, regularly see patients who present with those illnesses which are most common, which may well include patients with chronic fatigue syndrome/ME. This is in addition to the training received in medical school and during the pre-registration year and during their two-year hospital rotation.

Radiological Protection Board (NRPB) provides advice to Government on the risks to human health from both ionising and non-ionising radiations. NRPB's view is that mobile phone handsets currently used in the United Kingdom comply with the recommended exposure restrictions.
<P>

<a name="80312w25.html_para5">At locations accessible to the public, the electromagnetic radiation emitted by mobile phone transmitters is below maximum exposure levels recommended by the NRPB, published in Documents of the NRPB, Vol 4, No 5, 1993, copies of which have been placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="80312w25.html_para6">Wider concerns about the alleged health effects of long term use of mobile phones are currently being addressed by a range of research undertakings. The Department has commissioned three studies on biological effects of mobile phone microwave frequencies. The first is investigating the influence of radiation on learning ability and behaviour, the second is a laboratory study looking for biological responses of human cells in an electromagnetic radiation field and the third is a human volunteer study investigating possible effects of mobile phone usage on cognitive ability.

<a name="80312w25.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Keith Bradley: </B> 
 Our society is more divided than it has been for generations, and our policies are aimed at addressing these inequalities. We aim to offer educational and employment opportunities for all. The best way of improving the living standards of most people at the bottom of the income distribution is to help them into work, and we are implementing a range of policies under the New Deal to achieve this aim. We have also established a Social Exclusion Unit to co-ordinate action across Government to find new and more integrated ways of tackling the worst problems.
<P>

<a name="80312w25.html_para9">We continually evaluate our policies using a variety of methods. In particular, the annual Government Statistical Service publication "Households Below Average Income" contains detailed data on the position of those at the lower end of the income distribution.

<P>
<a name="80312w25.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Rendel: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security if Millennium Award grants given to benefit claimants will affect the levels of benefit which they receive.  [34121]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80312w25.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Keith Bradley: </B> 
 Guidance issued by the Millennium Commission to organisations wishing to take part in the Award scheme (known as Award Partners) makes it clear that they are expected to take account of the implications an award might have for individuals, including eligibility for benefits, and to set out how this will be addressed so that individuals receiving benefits are not penalised. Prospective Partners normally discuss their proposals with this Department, as the potential effect of an award in an individual case would depend on a number of factors. These include the type of benefit concerned, the purpose of the award, whether any cash payment was to be made to the individual and, if so, whether it was to be paid as a one-off grant or a regular series of payments.

It is based on the assumption that the rebate remains unchanged, and that the number and type of schemes which attracted that rebate do not alter.<P>

<P>

<a name="80312w26.html_para2">As the report by the Secretary of State for Social Security on Certain Contracting-out Terms (Command 3888) explains, there is evidence to show that a significant percentage of schemes which previously contracted-out on a salary-related basis are switching to contracting-out on a money purchase basis. Some are doing this to take advantage of the higher age-related rebates, and others for business reasons unconnected to the rebate. Irrespective of the reasons why schemes are switching to become COMPS, given that many will now be larger schemes, the expense margin contained within the rebate is inappropriate.
<P>

<a name="80312w26.html_para3">Both this Government, and the previous one, made it clear that action would be taken to prevent further losses from the National Insurance Fund if it became apparent that the nature of COMP provision was changing. It is impossible therefore to provide a reliable estimate of what the various changes and behavioural effects imply for the National Insurance Fund. But clearly there would be huge costs if all schemes switched to take advantage of the current higher average rebates for COMPS.
