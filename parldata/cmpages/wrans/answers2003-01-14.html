 In all procurement, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport follows the requirements of Government accounting, Government procurement guidance and Office of Government Commerce advice. As with environmental considerations those of fair trade are given due consideration but the absence of fair trade credentials are not used to disqualify an otherwise suitable contractor. Where the demands of propriety and value for money can be met equally by all tenderers, the social impact of fair trade will be added to the balance.

<a name="30114w01.html_spnew13"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 The Scottish Office ceased to exist on 30 June 1999 and the Scotland Office was established on 1 July 1999. Details of expenditure by the Scotland Office are set out in the departmental report and the accounts. As the department was set up during the course of financial year 1999&#150;2000, and expenditure since then has reflected the fact that the department is still moving towards its agreed staffing and operational levels, it would therefore be premature to make estimates of real terms changes in expenditure.

 The gold sales programme announced in May 1999 was part of a restructuring programme to reduce the riskiness of the Reserves portfolio.
<P>

<a name="30114w02.html_para0">This was a long-term investment decision and as such it is inappropriate to measure gains or losses resulting from fluctuations in market values on a particular day or over a short-term period. Gains and losses should be measured over the longer term, taking account of all the elements of the restructuring programme. In particular, the returns gained from the foreign currency assets purchased with the proceeds of the gold sales should also be included (see Part 2 of the National Audit Office Report on XThe Sale of Part of the UK Gold Reserves", published on 12 January 2001).

<P>

<a name="30114w04.html_para4">There have been no discussions between Ministers and private companies who manufacture digital hearing aids. Manufacturers of moderate powered digital hearing aids were invited to tender for the national health service contract let in 2000 in an advertisement placed in the Official Journal of the European Communities (OJEC). At present the NHS purchasing and supplies agency are tendering for high powered and paediatric digital hearing aids and as part of this process have been in discussions with suppliers who expressed an interest in that OJEC advert placed earlier this year. All interested suppliers were invited to a pre-offer briefing meeting where the requirements of the tender were outlined including the specifications.

 The Department of Health has allocated #30.75 million to its modernising hearing aid services project over the financial years 2000&#150;01 to 2002&#150;03 to national health service trusts in England. This modernised service includes the provision of digital hearing aids. Twenty sites joined the project in the first wave, with a further 30 second-wave sites joining in 2002&#150;03.
<P>

<a name="30114w04.html_para6">For second wave sites the Department pays the cost of upgrading information technology and other systems, 75 per cent. of additional staff costs and 75 per cent. of the difference between the cost of providing digital and analogue aids. Local primary care trusts pay the remaining 25 per cent. of revenue costs.

<a name="30114w04.html_spnew7"><B> Jacqui Smith </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 7 January 2003]:</i> The emergency readmission rates collected by the Department use number of discharges from hospital as the denominator, rather than number of emergency admissions. The information requested, therefore, is not available.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30114w04.html_spnew12"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 There is no requirement on the General Social Care Council to undertake criminal checks to register an applicant. In December 2002 the GSCC provided the Department of Health with an assessment of the potential demand on the Criminal Records Bureau if the GSCC decided to make such checks. The result of this assessment was that theGSCC estimated their output, once fully operational, would be in the region of 5,000 applications per month.

 The Department of Health has received no assessment from the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) regarding the effects of landfill sites on public health.
<P>

<a name="30114w05.html_para7">The HSE contributes to a grant to the small area health statistics unit (SAHSU) at Imperial College, jointly with the Department of Health, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, the Environment Agency, the Scottish Executive, the National Assembly of Wales and the Northern Ireland Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety. SAHSU was commissioned to carry out a national study of birth outcomes and cancer around landfill sites.
<P>

<a name="30114w05.html_para8">The results for birth outcomes were published in the British Medical Journal in 2001 (Elliott et al BMJ 2001: 323: 363&#150;8: available at http://www.bmj.com).

A fuller report of the study may be found at the Department of Health website at: http://www.doh.gov.uk/pdfs/report augl3.pdf. The study found a small increase in congenital anomalies in populations living close to landfill sites. There was no suggestion of excess risks of cancer associated with landfill sites. The Department sought advice on the study from the independent expert Committee on the Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment (COT). COT noted that the findings for birth outcomes were not consistent, and that the study provided no evidence that the rates of anomalies increased after sites had opened.

 The Department will be launching a comprehensive framework for black and minority ethnic mental health later this year. The framework will cover accessibility of services and relevant research. The National Institute for Mental Health in England (NIMHE) has set up a national black and ethnic minorities mental health innovations and research and development expert group to support the NIMHE research network to support implementation of the framework.
<P>

<a name="30114w06.html_para2">The Government White Paper, XValuing People: A New Strategy for Learning Disability for the 21st Century", is clear that the national service framework for mental health applies to all adults of working age, including people with learning disabilities who have a mental illness. They should be enabled to use generic psychiatric services whenever possible. Each local service should have access to an acute assessment and treatment resource for the small number of individuals with significant learning disabilities and mental health problems who cannot appropriately be admitted to general psychiatric services, even with specialist support.

 The Government have made no assessment of the contribution of professionals' codes of conduct to mental health care and treatment.

A private sector organisation awarded the management franchise of a hospital trust would not retain any money received for itself through this arrangement, but it would go into general funds.

2. Three month vacancies are vacancies which trusts are actively trying to fill, which had lasted for three months or more (whole-time equivalents).<P>

3. Three month Vacancy Rates are three month vacancies expressed as a percentage of three month vacancies plus staff in post.<P>

4. Three month Vacancy Rates are calculated using staff in post from the Vacancy Survey, March 2002.<P>

5. Staff in post data is from the Non-Medical Workforce Census, September 2001.<P>

6. Staff in post data excludes staff employed by Health Authorities, as vacancy information was only collected from Trusts, PCTs and Special Health Authorities.<P>

7. Percentages are rounded to one decimal place.<P>

The NHS will receive an annual average increase of 7.5 per cent. above inflation over the five years 2003&#150;04 to 2007&#150;08. This represents an increase of #34 billion in funding and is the highest sustained growth in funding in the history of the NHS.

 Since 1997, the number of consultant urologists has increased by 27 per cent. to 436 in March 2002. We are increasing the number of consultant urologists through expansion of registrar training places, improved recruitment and retention, international recruitment and promotion of flexible retirement.
<P>

<a name="30114w07.html_para12">In 2001 there were 0.9 urologists per 100,000 population.
<P>

<a name="30114w07.html_para13">As at 30 September 2001 there were 204 doctors in the registrar group for urology in the national health service in England. The output from these existing registrar training places, when combined with other increases and offset by expected retirements in the specialty is expected to result in around 582 trained specialists being available in surgery by 2010. The number of urologists per capita is therefore likely to increase significantly.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment she has made of the effect of the European Union's chemicals management system REACH on <i>(a)</i> the relative costs of the manufacture and use of chemicals in member states in competition with finished manufactured articles imported into the EU and <i>(b)</i> the confidentiality of commercially-sensitive product manufacturing information; and if she will make a statement.

<a name="30114w08.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 In May 2001, the Government prepared a partial regulatory impact assessment to consider the impact of the European Union's chemicals management system REACH. A full regulatory impact assessment, with a more detailed cost benefit analysis, taking into account the wider economic impact will be carried out once the Commission has published its proposals.
<P>

<a name="30114w08.html_para1">The Government are committed to having a transparent system and would expect to see as much information as possible made publicly available, which would certainly include basic hazard and exposure data associated with substances. However, in order to avoid free riders and to avoid stifling innovation, adequate controls on access to genuinely commercially sensitive data are needed whilst recognising the right of the public to have access to relevant and meaningful information on hazards and risk. We have had discussions with a number of stakeholders and will seek to work with the European Commission to ensure practical proposals come forward.

<P>

<a name="30114w08.html_para4">The increase in the number of days with poor air quality in 2001 compared with the previous three years is partly due to the larger number of measurement sites in use in 2001 and partly due to the natural fluctuations in weather conditions leading to very localised high concentrations. The overall trend over the whole period from 1993 is downward.

 In England, all on-farm bovine inspections take place during a single combined visit to a producer's premises. The actual inspections included will depend on the subsidy schemes against which the producer claims. 247 inspectors in the Rural Payments Agency's Inspectorate are trained to carry out inspections across the range of bovine schemes. These inspectors also carry out inspections under a wide range of other livestock and land based schemes.

 This Department has overall policy responsibility for coastal erosion risk but operational responsibility, for assessing risks, identifying the need for defence measures and deciding which projects to promote and their timing, rests with local authorities.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30114w09.html_spnew3"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 Statutory guidance (PG6/30) was issued by the Government on what constitutes Best Available Techniques Not Entailing Excessive Cost for the mushroom substrate sector in February 1992, with a revision in February 1997. A second review of the guidance is currently being undertaken by the Environment Agency's Local Authority Unit. A draft, which can be found of the Agency's website: www.environment-agency.gov.uk/business/lapc/ is currently out for stakeholder comment, with a deadline of 20 January. The guidance will then be forwarded, within approximately two months, to my Department for a final consultation stage, and thereafter published.
<P>

<a name="30114w09.html_para2">Most processes manufacturing mushroom substrate are regulated under Part I of the Environmental Protection Act 1990. As such they must be authorised by the relevant local authority with the objective of using the Best Available Techniques Not Entailing Excessive Cost to minimise air polluting emissions, including odour.
<P>

<a name="30114w09.html_para3">Ultimately it is for local authorities to determine what constitutes Best Available Techniques Not Entailing Excessive Cost for any particular plant. While they must have regard to the statutory guidance, they are not bound by it, and could (subject to appeal) impose more stringent requirements if they considered it necessary and provided they met the relevant statutory test.

 The Rural Land Register is designed to cover all fields in England which are registered for IACS purposes. Although this does not cover all agricultural land in England, it includes forage land used to support claims for livestock subsidies. I cannot quantify this precisely but coverage is likely to be in the region of 60&#150;90 per cent. of agricultural land.

 The target is for relevant operating authorities to have in place, and provide to DEFRA, a programme for updating Shoreline Management Plans (SMPs) in accordance with DEFRA guidance. Further to full consultation, DEFRA has provided revised SMP guidance reflecting the experience gained in producing the original plans. This will be supplemented later this year with more working guidance which is being produced by DEFRA alongside the first three updated SMPs. All the relevant authorities have advised DEFRA of their proposed starting dates for updating SMPs and these are being made available publicly on the DEFRA website.

 We have undertaken a regulatory impact assessment, which was published in March 2001 as part of The First Consultation Paper on the Implementation of the Water Framework Directive (available on the Defra website at http://www. defra.gov.uk/environment/consult/waterframe/index.htm). This includes estimates of the costs of complying with the directive and discusses the implications for typical businesses, including farms. Competitiveness is affected by a multitude of factors acting in combination, and it is not possible to identify the effect of this directive in isolation.
<P>

<a name="30114w09.html_para4">We are working with other members of the European Union as part of a common implementation strategy to ensure a consistent approach to implementing the directive across the European Union. Also, we are currently undertaking a review of diffuse pollution by agriculture to identify the most cost-effective mechanisms for reducing such pollution. This review is considering the full range of policy measures that could be applied, including economic instruments and voluntary action, not just regulation.

 There have been two main British operations in Afghanistan: Operation Jacana and Operation Fingal. Operation Fingal began in December 2001 and is the on-going United Kingdom support to the International Stabilisation Assistance Force (ISAF), assisting with the provision of security and stability in Kabul. Operation Jacana, which took place from April 2002 to July 2002, was the deployment of 45 commando and elements of 3 commando brigade in support of UK forces operating in south-eastern Afghanistan to deny and destroy the al-Qaeda terrorist infrastructure. Operation Veritas (rather than Neritas) is the name given to the overarching UK contribution to the US-led campaign against international terrorism, and encompasses Operations Fingal and Jacana. Ptarmigan, Snipe, Condor, and Buzzard were names given to objectives within Operation Jacana.

 Pay rates for the armed forces are recommended annually to the Prime Minister and my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence by the independent Armed Forces Pay Review Body (AFPRB). Under its terms of reference, the Review Body is required to have regard to the need to recruit, retain and motivate suitably able and qualified people, taking account of the particular circumstances of Service life. The Ministry of Defence has therefore provided the Review Body with information on the manning situation and those areas it considers merit particular attention. The AFPRB is currently considering its recommendations, and is expected to submit its 2003 report to the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State for Defence before the end of February 2003.

<a name="30114w10.html_spnew1"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 We are not aware of any improved types of vaccine against biological warfare agents currently licensed for use in the United States. The only vaccine against biological warfare agents currently licensed for use in the United Kingdom is a vaccine against anthrax. The Ministry of Defence has a range of research, development and procurement programmes aimed at improving our armed forces defences against chemical and biological attack, including programmes to develop new vaccines. This work includes close co-operation and liaison with the United States.

<a name="30114w10.html_para0">It is not possible to immunise against chemical warfare agents.

 The policy of the Public Record Office is to select the final reports of research work and trials for preservation rather than the working documents. Therefore, the trial plan for Programme 3/61 has not been selected for preservation.
<P>

<a name="30114w10.html_para1">However, a copy of the final report Porton Technical Paper 794, entitled XComparison of radio xenon & zinc cadmium sulphide particle tracers over medium distances of travel", can be found at WO189/1105. Additionally, a copy of the trial plan for programme 3/61 has been located in the historic archive at Dstl Porton Down and can be made available to the hon. Member.

 Public funding for the Royal Navy and Royal Marines Families' Association commenced under the terms of an agreed Charter in 1999. No formal performance indicators were set for the Association, but the Charter laid down its objectives and other requirements. Funding was withdrawn from October 2002 because the Association had consistently failed to meet its objectives, and had also failed to meet other requirements of the Charter, including the production of annual reports and accounts and the maintenance of an appropriate management structure. The decision to withdraw funding was made by the Second Sea Lord, as the top level budget holder accountable for these funds.
<P>

<a name="30114w12.html_para0">The Department's aim in setting up the Association was to develop an independent organisation to represent the views of Naval Service families. This remains our firm intention and we intend that a new body, with the title, 'Naval Families' Federation', will be in place this spring. We are considering a number of options to ensure that the new Federation grows safely into a well-managed and independent body, preferably with charitable status. This will include the use of carefully selected performance indicators, and the achievements of the Federation against these indicators will be monitored by the Second Sea Lord's Personal and Family Service staff.

<a name="30114w12.html_para1">Royal Navy warships are equipped with both fixed and portable nuclear and chemical detection equipment. All Royal Navy ships, with the exception of the survey vessels, have a citadel as an integral part of their design. This area provides a positively pressurised, toxic-free environment supplied with filtered air. In the ships with no citadel, a range of 'sanctuary procedures' is followed to avoid ingestion of contaminated materials.
<P>

<a name="30114w12.html_para2">Ships can also be protected by spraying sea water over the upper deck to remove contamination and to minimise the subsequent decontamination effort. Likewise, ships carry equipment to decontaminate any aircraft and vehicles aboard.

 Twenty-six countries have qualified for relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative. Of these, six countries (Bolivia, Burkina Faso, Mauritania, Mozambique, Tanzania and Uganda) have reached their completion point and are receiving full debt relief. The remaining 20 (Benin, Cameroon, Chad, Ethiopia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Guyana, Honduras, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Nicaragua, Niger, Rwanda, Sao Tome & Principe, Senegal, Sierra Leone and Zambia) are receiving interim relief. The main objective of the initiative is to ensure that countries exit the HIPC process with sustainable levels of debt. The HIPC Initiative has the flexibility to provide, when appropriate, additional debt relief at completion point. The UK is pressing the World bank and the IMF to widen their approach to topping up, so that any HIPC eligible country facing unsustainable debts, that has demonstrated its commitment to poverty reduction and economic reform, should qualify for this additional relief.

On 20 March 2003, NORCA is to be replaced by a corridor of Class A controlled airspace. This will afford extra protection, and further measures to enhance air safety may be introduced next year.

 The United Kingdom Accreditation Service (UKAS) is recognised by my right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, as the sole national body for the accreditation, against international standards, of certification and inspection bodies, testing and calibration laboratories. The Department for Education and Skills will use UKAS accreditation services whenever it is appropriate to do so. For example, we are exploring with the Guidance Accreditation Board, which is sponsored by the Department, the appropriateness of the UKAS accreditation process to its work.

<P>
<a name="30114w14.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 The new Regulations and Codes of Practice were finished later than planned because the Education Act 2002 did not receive Royal Assent until late July. The consultation schedule had to be compressed, to have the Regulations and Codes ready to come into effect from January 2003, so that admission authorities could have regard to them when consulting on their admission arrangements for September 2004. But much of the content was similar to that of September 2001's XConsultation on School Admissions", which had a longer consultation period; and we supported the latest written consultation with a number of meetings around the country, at which over 400 local authority representatives and head teachers were able to give their views on the Regulations and Codes.

 The Connexions service has a broad remit: to offer to all young people between 13 and 19 information, advice and guidance (including on careers) to improve participation and achievement in learning, and to signpost personal development opportunities. Since type and level of need is a key determinant of the kind of personal adviser support made available, it is not appropriate to set maximum waiting times. Rather, the Connexions service has developed access to personal adviser support via a wide range of traditional and modern-day channels. In addition to conventional appointment systems, personal advisers are available on a Xdrop-in" basis in schools or colleges as well as in High Street Connexions centres, that are open at times young people want. Instant access is a key feature of Connexions Direct, a telephone and web-based service currently being trialled in several areas of England. Here, support is available from 8 am to 2 am seven days per week and 365 days per year. This is in fulfilment of one of the key Connexions principles: to design and deliver the service around the needs of young people and to listen to their views.

<a name="30114w15.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 The Government set out its future vision for the Connexions Service in XYouth Support Services for 13 to 19-year-olds: A vision for 2006". This is a forward-looking document, which shows how Connexions will bring together a range of existing agencies to deliver seamless support for 13 to 19-year-olds, and reduce the number of 16 to 18-year-olds who are not in learning or work. We will use the following criteria to judge progress towards meeting the vision:
<P>

<a name="30114w15.html_para4"><i>Youth Services</i>
<P>

<a name="30114w15.html_para5">The Department has published a clear statement of what is expected of local education authorities who are responsible for delivering youth services. In December 2002 the Government launched the document XTransforming Youth Work Resourcing Excellent Youth Services" which provides a cross-Government view of the key elements of a high quality, well managed and properly resourced youth service. The document underpins the Transforming Youth Work programme and the Government's commitment to work with local authorities to ensure the delivery of a high quality youth service for young people which is at the heart of the Connexions Service.
<P>

<a name="30114w15.html_para6"><i>Making more young people active citizens and engaging them in developmental activities</i>
<P>

<a name="30114w15.html_para7">This aspect will be assessed by the extent to which Connexions Partnerships provide access to opportunities for young people to broaden their horizons, develop their talents and become actively engaged in their communities, through for example Millennium Volunteers and other volunteering initiatives, sports, arts and recreational activities; and through specific programmes such as the Neighbourhood Support Fund.
<P>

<a name="30114w15.html_para8"><i>Support for Connexions from parents, carers and teachers</i>
<P>

<a name="30114w15.html_para9">The views of young people and a range of key stakeholders involved in Partnerships will be sought on a regular basis through a comprehensive programme of opinion surveys starting in December 2002. In addition, the findings of national and local evaluations, the self-assessments undertaken by Partnerships and the outcome of Ofsted inspections will be used to assess progress and inform the development of Connexions Partnerships.
<P>

<a name="30114w15.html_para10">One of the key criteria for judging the overall effectiveness of Connexions Partnerships will be the progress they make towards meeting their target of reducing the proportion of 16 to 18-year-olds not in learning and work. With the exception of recently established Partnerships, all Partnerships have been set a target of reducing by 10 per cent. the proportion of young people who are not in education, employment and training by November 2004.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30114w15.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 The total running costs budget for the Connexions Service National Unit (CSNU) in 2002&#150;03 is #5.791 million (budgets are not yet agreed for 2003&#150;04).
<P>

<a name="30114w15.html_para13">CSNU is responsible for a range of programme budgets including the main Connexions Service budget, which totals #449 million in 2002&#150;03. Of that total, #337 million is allocated directly to Connexions Partnerships through the Connexions grant, while roughly one half of the remainder (c. #52 million ) is used to maintain careers services in those areas where Connexions Partnerships are not yet operational. A further third (c. #35 million) goes to Partnerships to fund the pre-launch development costs of those starting during the year and to support Summer Plus activity in response to the Government's street crime agenda. The remaining funds are used centrally to support the Partnership network, for example, through the training of Personal Advisers and the development of tracking systems.
<P>

<a name="30114w15.html_para14">In 2003&#150;04, the total Connexions Service budget will be #475 million, of which #439 million will be allocated directly to Partnerships through the Connexions grant. Of the remainder, #17 million will go to Partnerships to continue supporting Summer Plus while #20 million will, as this year, fund work centrally in support of the Partnership network.
<P>

<a name="30114w15.html_para15">The table shows the funding allocated via the grant to each Connexions Partnership in both 2002&#150;03 and 2003&#150;04. In addition to the main Connexions budget, CSNU is responsible for a range of other initiatives such as the Neighbourhood Support Fund, the Millennium Volunteers programme and a number of Youth Service funds. The total programme funding available for these other initiatives is #77.4 million in 2002&#150;03 and #62.9 million in 2003&#150;04.

1. The allocations for 2002&#150;03 reflect the fact that several Partnerships were launched during the year so, in some cases, represent only a proportion of the hypothetical full-year cost (e.g. the South Central Partnership was launched on 1 September so its 2002&#150;03 allocation is 7/12 of what it would have been had the Partnership operated for the full year).<P>

2. Those Partnerships starting during the current year received additional development funding to help them prepare for full operation. Those same areas have also received funding to maintain careers service operation prior to the launch of their Connexions Partnerships.<P>

3. Some Partnerships have received further funding during 2002&#150;03 for Summer Plus activities, Personal Adviser Drugs Education, etc.<P>

<a name="30114w17.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 The voluntary recognition system will be formally introduced in 2005. Prior to that, the system will be trialled. The Department is working with a number of key partners, including the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA), the Centre for Information on Language Teaching and Research (CILT) and the Nuffield Languages Programme to develop the system. We will work with the QCA in inviting the national awarding bodies to tender for the opportunity to operate the system. The level of funding will depend on the pace of implementation and the number of languages covered by the system.

The SSA figure for 2003&#150;04 is provisional and not comparable with 2002&#150;03. The figures for 2002&#150;03 and 2003&#150;04 exclude provision transferred to the LSC from 2002&#150;03. The figure for 2003&#150;04 includes grant and pension funding transferred into EFS in 2003&#150;04.<P>

In 2003&#150;04 Newcastle's Education Formula Spending Share rose by 6 per cent. per pupil or 5.7 per cent. in cash terms. The overall cash increase does not compare with last year's Education SSA because of the transfers mentioned above.<P>

The education budgets for 2001&#150;02 and 2002&#150;03 are derived from Newcastle's S52 Budget Statements for those years&#151;as submitted to the Department.<P>

 <i>[holding answer 13 January 2003]:</i> Teachers and those who work with children and young persons, in effect, act in loco parents for those in their charge, and they require a high standard of physical and mental fitness to undertake the demands involved. The provisions of the Education (Teachers' Qualifications and Health Standards) (England) Regulations 1999 ensure that such workers are fit for the job, and are essential in adding to the safeguards aimed at protecting the health, welfare and education of children.
<P>

<a name="30114w18.html_para2">It is vital that people who work on a regular basis with children and young persons (for example, home tutors, support staff, and welfare officers) are fit to do so. It would not, therefore, be appropriate to limit this requirement to teachers.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30114w18.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 The Department for Education and Skills (DfES) has provided #1 million to support an Early Support Pilot Programme, which is a pan-disability national initiative aimed at identifying and developing good service provision for pupils with special educational needs (SEN) and disabilities and their families. The Programme includes a number of projects looking at services for children with visual impairment. It will support development in a number of areas, including: initial assessment of need; co-ordination/multi-agency support for families; better information and access for families; improved professional knowledge and skills; service review and development; and improved partnership across agencies and geographical boundaries.
<P>

<a name="30114w18.html_para3">The Programme is being evaluated by a team from the National Children's' Bureau on an ongoing basis. The evaluation will inform the future development of the Programme.
<P>

<a name="30114w18.html_para4">The Department of Health is responsible for the provision of eye checks undertaken by local primary health care teams in accordance with professional advice. The principal threats to eye health and impaired vision development should be detected at or before school age is reached and be identified during a visual screening on school entry. Consideration is currently being given to the introduction of a universal test for all children when they start school at four or five. Older children may develop myopia (short sight) which is usually recognised when they complain of difficulty seeing clearly at distance. Since the onset of myopia commonly occurs between the ages of nine and 16 it is not possible to identify optimum ages for screening. Children may Xpass" a routine screening examination only to find problems within the next few months. There is then a possibility that some children might not receive advice to attend an optometrist until after their next routine screening appointment. All children up to the age of 15 are entitled to a free sight test as are children aged 16&#150;18 if they are in full-time education. Whenever parents or carers suspect that there is a problem with their child's sight they should take them to the optician's.
<P>

<a name="30114w18.html_para5">There are no plans to collect data on children in school, whose visual needs have not been diagnosed. However, from January 2004 the DfES will be collecting data by type of SEN as part of the Pupil Level Annual Schools Census. Information will be collected on pupils with statements of special educational need and those receiving additional or different help to support their SEN&#151;School Action and School Action Plus. One of the categories will be visual impairment and schools will be able to record it as either a primary need or a secondary need. It is hoped that this will provide more detailed data on pupils with a range of SEN, including visual impairment.




<P>
<P><I>14 Jan 2003 : Column 581W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="30114w18.html_para6">No assessment has been made of the impact of undetected sight problems on the educational attainment and inclusion of children in school. Nor has an assessment been made of current arrangements for eye health education in schools.
<P>

<a name="30114w18.html_para7">Students undertaking initial teacher training are required to understand their responsibilities under the DfES's SEN Code of Practice and to know where to go to seek advice. They are also required to be able to demonstrate that they can differentiate their teaching to meet the individual needs of pupils with SEN, including those with visual impairment.
<P>

<a name="30114w18.html_para8">Support for training and development in relation to SEN and disabilities is available to local education authorities (LEAs) and schools through the SEN component of the DfES's Standards Fund. The funding is designed to be used flexibly to support developmental opportunities ranging from basic awareness-raising to more in-depth studies, possibly leading to formal qualifications. It is for individual LEAs and schools to determine expenditure priorities according to local needs and circumstances, but it would certainly be possible to use the funding to support training for teachers in the area of visual impairment.
<P>

<a name="30114w18.html_para9">The SEN Code of Practice provides practical advice to LEAs, maintained schools and others on carrying out their statutory duties to identify, assess and make provision for children's SEN, including for children with visual impairment. The Code aims to promote consistency of approach, but, within its guidelines, it is for individual schools and LEAs to determine appropriate intervention based on an assessment of each child's individual needs and circumstances.
<P>

<a name="30114w18.html_para10">It would be for schools and LEAs to decide whether it was appropriate to carry out a specific visual assessment, if it was thought that visual impairment was contributing to a child's other educational difficulties.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30114w19.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Pearson: </B> 
 Clarification of the nature of stage payments to Northern Ireland Railways (NIR) to purchase new trains confirmed that they did not create an asset, and hence those payments were not a charge on the Department's departmental expenditure limit (DEL). Although the Department for Regional Development made substantial grant payments to NIR in 2001&#150;02 and 2002&#150;03 in respect of trains, none of this scores in the budget under the resource budgeting rules that apply for those two financial years. As soon as this technicality was clarified, in August 2002, #49 million was made available for re-allocation, under the normal rules that apply to all Departments. This funding, together with other funds identified by Departments, has been allocated to good effect across Departments and is profiled to be spent in the current financial year. The revised budget for 2003&#150;04 to 2005&#150;06 published on 11 December 2002 includes the required provision for the purchase of the new trains and delivery in 2004 is on schedule.

 The introduction of Devolution in 1999 involved the restructuring of NI Departments, and an increase in number from six to 11. This factor, combined with the introduction of resource accounting and budgeting in the 2001&#150;02 financial year, means it is not possible to make meaningful comparisons between outturn information across the span of five years requested. However, the table shows the five most significant capital projects which contributed to departmental underspends in Northern Ireland in 2001&#150;02, the latest year for which information is available.

 <i>[holding answer 7 January 2003]:</i> My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary and I recognise the detrimental impact that crime has on the retail industry and other business sectors. That is why I launched a consultation process in December to seek the views of business organisations and other stakeholders on the best means of creating and maintaining effective partnerships to reduce the opportunities for crime against business and enhance the contribution that business can make to crime reduction.

<a name="30114w19.html_para4">It is our intention to build on the good work already done by organisations like the British Retail Consortium in the development of retail crime reduction partnerships in main town and shopping centres. We will continue to support such partnerships.
<P>

<a name="30114w19.html_para5">The Home Secretary announced in April last year a new survey of crime affecting retail and manufacturing business. This will give a range of information about the types of crime which most impact on these business sectors and provide insights into the most effective interventions to address them. Results of the survey should be available in the summer.
<P>

<a name="30114w19.html_para6">The Government have allocated #15 million over the years 2001&#150;02 to 2003&#150;04 to improve the security of small retail businesses in deprived areas. Nearly 3,000 shops benefited from the first year's funding and a further 4,500 individual shops and businesses will benefit directly from the #6 million made available under the second year of the scheme. A further #6 million will be available in the third year to enable more shopkeepers to benefit from extra security.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what command and control measures will be introduced in the event of a major terrorist incident; and how long this would take to set up in the event of such an emergency.  [88387]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30114w19.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Blunkett: </B> 
 The police have the primary role in responding to a terrorist incident and the force in whose area the incident takes place would take operational control and command of the incident at the scene. The Government response is co-ordinated at ministerial level through the Cabinet Office Briefing Room (COBR) in London. COBR is responsible for determining the overall political strategy in relation to the incident including responding to any political demands made by a terrorist group. COBR would also arrange for the provision of any necessary assistance requested by the police incident commander. In the event of a terrorist incident, the police and Government level response would be deployed as a matter of urgency.

<P>
<a name="30114w19.html_wqn8"><B> Patrick Mercer: </B>

<P>
<P>
<a name="30114w19.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Blunkett: </B> 
 The Home Office takes lead responsibility for co-ordinating the response to a terrorist incident within the UK. A set of classified contingency plans exist for responding to a wide range of terrorist threats. The response to any terrorist incident relies upon a co-ordinated approach and the Government draws upon the resources of other Departments, the security and intelligence agencies, the police, the military, scientific and other specialist advice, local authorities and the emergency services.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30114w19.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Blunkett: </B> 
 At the local level, counter terrorism is the responsibility of the police. This work is carried out in close conjunction with the Home Office, which has lead responsibility for this issue. Police forces will issue advice as necessary, as well as taking the lead as and when a terrorist incident arises. Local authorities do not have a direct involvement in counter terrorism.
<P>

<a name="30114w19.html_para10">Local authorities have a general role in emergency planning, dealing with the consequences of all emergencies, including those arising from terrorist attack. My right hon. Friend the Lord Macdonald of Tradeston and Cabinet Office officials have regular contact with local authorities on this issue, through the provision of formal guidance, funding and co-ordination of local arrangements with national policy.

 <i>[holding answer 13 January 2003]:</i> There are regular discussions on the whole range of counter terrorist issues through a number of committees. Where intelligence exists about specific threats we seek to thwart them and take whatever response we believe necessary to ensure the protection of the public.

This is why we introduced the citizenship curriculum in schools in September and why we have appointed an independent group under the chairmanship of Professor Sir Bernard Crick to make recommendations on the standard of language skills it might be reasonable to expect of someone seeking naturalisation.

 Government works closely with the Association of Chief Police Officers, individual forces and the National Criminal Intelligence Service in tackling football disorder. The police and courts in England and Wales have been provided with extensive legislative powers for combating football hooliganism. This includes empowering the police to seek football banning orders against individuals who pose a risk of violence or disorder in connection with football matches. The orders prevent attendance at domestic matches and travel to matches played overseas. There are currently over 1,400 people subject to banning orders. There is no comparable legislation in Scotland or Northern Ireland.

 By the time the concession was abolished about 80 per cent. of new applications were receiving an initial decision within the initial six months.

 There is no published data on decision times specifically to determine applications for settlement of spouses of British citizens. We aim to screen all postal applications within three weeks and decide those that are straightforward at that point. However, because of the high number of applications in the latter part of 2002 this is currently taking around 10 weeks on average. Some that need further inquiries or more detailed consideration can take around 12 months to decide subject to how easy it is to obtain the information and how quickly applicants respond to such requests. We are taking measures to improve this situation and expect to make significant progress towards our three week target for initial screening over the next two to three months, and to reduce the turnaround time for deciding more complex cases. There are no guidelines on average processing times for specific types of application.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30114w22.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 These are matters for the Chief Constable of Sussex. I understand that the changes in question stem from a force operational review that the chief constable established with the aim of getting more capacity at the front line of policing. The review acknowledged the important role the traffic division played in the policing of Sussex and concluded that the best way forward was the establishment of a smaller road policing unit (RPU) and a dedicated force wide unit taking advantage of automatic number plate recognition technology. The RPU will concentrate on the investigation of road death, potential road death and serious injury collisions, on patrolling and dealing with incidents on the strategic road network, and on assisting district commanders by providing specialist expertise.
<P>

<a name="30114w22.html_para3">These changes reflect the priorities contained within the National Policing Plan 2003&#150;06. They will enable officers to concentrate on core police business and ensure a high level of service to the community, while also allowing the effective use of specialist skills.
<P>

<a name="30114w22.html_para4">I understand from the chief constable that within the new arrangements the established RPU base at Chichester will remain, with an enhanced staffing and vehicle level. Adur and Worthing, with Chichester, are within the West Downs division. Deployment profiles are in the process of being established to provide a response across the division. Road policing lends itself to a flexible approach and support will also be provided from other base areas such as North Downs and Brighton and Hove.
<P>

<a name="30114w22.html_para5">The chief constable and force operational review identified the number of differing shift and rest day patterns across the force area as adversely affecting the force's ability to mobilise resources quickly and effectively. A force working pattern was therefore proposed. In line with Police Regulations this pattern was put to the workforce, who voted overwhelmingly for its adoption. A shift pattern has now been developed by the RPU, which maximises resourcing levels at times of operational need such as the morning and evening traffic peaks.

 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister Department is currently involved in a project to consider options for strengthening and updating the Indices of Deprivation 2000 (ID 2000), including the way housing deprivation is measured.

 The decent home standard does not include a measure of energy efficiency. There are two measures in the standard that will impact on the energy efficiency of homes. The standard requires dwellings to achieve a reasonable degree of thermal comfort through provision of efficient heating and effective insulation.

<a name="30114w23.html_para3">Under the fitness standard, which is another component of the decent home standard, a property must have adequate provision for heating. This is defined as sufficient to achieve a temperature of 18oC in the main living room and 16oC in other habitable rooms when the outside temperature is minus 1oC.

 Local planning authorities have a wide range of enforcement powers to enable them to deal with unauthorised development that is harming amenity in the neighbourhood. If they consider that unauthorised development is unacceptable on planning grounds, they have the power to take enforcement action.

 The Adviser Discretion Fund was introduced to give personal advisers more flexibility in the help they can offer their new deal clients. Advisers have the discretion to make awards from the fund, normally up to a maximum of #300, to pay for any goods and services needed to help an individual overcome the barriers preventing them applying for or taking up a job.
<P>

<a name="30114w24.html_para2">The Adviser Discretion Fund cannot be used: as a cash inducement to take up a job; to pay for things funded in other ways under the new deal; to pay for Criminal Records Bureau disclosure certificates; or once a client has taken up a job. Payments can be made in error if an adviser mistakenly makes awards for these purposes, or in cases where the total monetary value of the awards made to an individual exceeds #300 (without prior authorisation from the Jobcentre Plus business manager). Information on the level of such erroneous payments is not available.

<a name="30114w24.html_para3">Since the launch of the Adviser Discretion Fund in July 2001, 56 allegations of fraud have been or are currently being investigated, involving a total of #10,921. This represents 0.03 per cent. of awards made and 0.07 per cent. of their total monetary value.

<a name="30114w24.html_spnew4"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 We recognise that many people making a claim to benefit will be in need of immediate financial support. To avoid unnecessary hardship, discretionary payments on account of benefit (interim payments) can be made where a claim has not been determined but the Decision Maker is satisfied that the basic conditions of entitlement for the benefit are likely to be met. The amount of any interim payment is automatically recoverable from the main benefit when it is awarded. No record is kept of the number or value of interim payments made.
<P>

<a name="30114w24.html_para4">Crisis Loan alignment payments can be made to people awaiting their first payment of benefit which is paid in arrears, or their first payment of wages. Crisis Loans made to people awaiting benefit payments will cover their needs until their first benefit pay-day, following which full or interim payments of benefit can be made. In the main, these payments are made to people of working age (as pensioners are generally paid in advance).

 The Department makes limited use of postcodes to assist policy development and the delivery of services to our customers.
<P>

<a name="30114w25.html_para7">We do not publish any statistical information by postcode areas in their own right. However, it does use information based on postcodes as a building block to publish statistics on administrative or electoral districts, such as Government Office Regions or Parliamentary Constituencies. All of the department's National Statistics outputs are published on a regular basis and copies are placed in the Libraries of the Houses of Parliament.
<P>

<a name="30114w25.html_para8">Most of the grants and awards made by the Department are distributed on criteria devised at a national level. However, the award Cold Weather Payments is based on local conditions and does use postcodes to define eligible areas.
<P>

<a name="30114w25.html_para9">The delivery of services to our customers has been re-organised following the creation of the Department in 2001. In most cases, the departmental agencies are organised into regions and districts whose boundaries are aligned with Government Office Regions and one or more Local/Unitary Authorities.
<P>

<a name="30114w25.html_para10">Jobcentre Plus customers can access services through their nearest or most convenient Jobcentre Plus Office, Jobcentre or Social Security Office, regardless of their postcode. Postcodes are used to identify customers required to attend a work- focused meeting as the new integrated Jobcentre Plus service is introduced, in areas where ONE pilots operate and in some other parts of the office network.
<P>

<a name="30114w25.html_para11">The Pension Service will comprise of a network of 26 pension centres, supported by a national local service, dedicated to the needs of today's and tomorrow's pensioners. Customers can access services through an 0845 local rate telephone number. Each pension centre handles the work of a defined geographical area aligned to Government Office Regions.
<P>

<a name="30114w25.html_para12">Postcode listings used within the Department are updated each quarter. The use of postcodes to produce information, distribute grants and awards and deliver services in the most efficient manner possible is reviewed on a regular basis.
