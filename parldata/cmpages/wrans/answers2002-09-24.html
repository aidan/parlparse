<a name="20924w02.html_para0">It is not possible to measure how many United Kingdom nationals resident in Zimbabwe have returned to the United Kingdom to settle. As holders of British passports, United Kingdom nationals are free to enter, and to remain in, the United Kingdom without requiring leave to do so they are not subject to immigration controls.

The aim is to improve substantially the service to the Public Enquiry Office callers and as far as possible reduce the waiting time and long queues.
<P>

<a name="20924w02.html_para1">The Public Enquiry Office Croydon is currently in the process of recruiting an additional team of 17 staff, increasing its same day service capabilities. There are plans to rebuilt the entrance into Lunar House to provide better access to all of those who need to come to Croydon. It is hoped that building work may commence towards the end of this year. Moreover the Public Enqiry Office has improved its signage and website information so that callers are more informed of the service provided and all of the other options available to them.

Paragraphs 104&#150;09 of the Immigration Rules (HC395) provide for the entry and employment of foreign students under the Seasonal Agricultural Workers Scheme (SAWS). The recent Home Office White Paper "Secure Borders, Safe Haven" signalled, in paragraph 3.25, our intention to review the operation of this scheme. A consultation document was published on 29 May 2002, is available on the Home Office website and has been sent to a wide range of organisations with an interest in the scheme. In addition, officials have held meetings with key stakeholder groups. The consultation ended on 23 August 2002. Any changes to the scheme resulting from the consultation will be announced in due course.

To ask the Solicitor-General what proportion of allegations of rape made to the police were brought to trial by the Crown Prosecution Service in each of the last five years.  [68798]<P>

<P>
<a name="20924w02.html_spmin0"><B>The Solicitor-General </B> 
<i>[holding answer 15 July 2002]: </i>There are no wholly reliable or national figures which touch on the precise statistics that the hon. Member seeks.
<P>

<a name="20924w02.html_para2">Some information about the extent to which reported cases reach trial may be found in the Report on the Joint Inspection into the Investigation and prosecution of cases involving Allegations of rape, published in April 2002 by HMCPSI and HMIC. The Inspection included examination of a sample of 1,741 reported complaints of rape. The offender was charged in 467 of these cases. Therefore, of the 1,741 reports of rape, some 26 per cent. resulted in a charge or summons.
<P>

<a name="20924w02.html_para3">The Inspectorates' analysis does not show how many of those 467 prosecutions proceeded to trial or to guilty plea. However, the Inspectorates' Report also analysed 88 rape cases that did proceed to court. Of these 88, approximately 56 per cent. proceeded to trial (35 defendants were found not guilty after a trial and 14 were convicted after a trial). A further 39 defendants, or approximately 44 per cent. pleaded guilty without the need for a trial, which amounts to a conviction rate (including guilty pleas and those convicted after a trial) of 60.8 per cent.
<P>

<a name="20924w02.html_para4">The 1,741 crime reports were drawn from ten Police Forces, and the 88 rape cases that proceeded to court were drawn from nine of these ten Police Forces. The cases were initially recorded as rape for the period 31 December 2000 or before (each Police Force was asked to provide up to a specified number of cases). In view of the limited nature of the file sample, it would be unwise to extrapolate national statistics from these figures.
<P>

<a name="20924w02.html_para5">I take very seriously the need to ensure that all parts of the criminal justice system adopt best practice when dealing with rape cases. In response to the Thematic Review, the Crown Prosecution Service, Home Office and Court Service have drawn up an Action Plan to improve practice in the investigation and prosecution of offenders, and to ensure better treatment of victims and witnesses. The Plan was published on 22 July.

<a name="20924w02.html_para6">In line with United Nations (UN) sanctions, no exports of military equipment to Somalia are permitted apart from items of humanitarian end-use approved by the UN Sanctions Committee. UNSCR 733 (1992) imposed an arms embargo on Somalia covering "all deliveries of weapons and military equipment to Somalia until the Council decides otherwise". UNSCR 1356 (2001) amended the scope of the embargo to allow the export of humanitarian exports and protective clothing approved by

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence in respect of the attack by allied aircraft on 19 July in the Qadissiya province of Iraq, how many salvos were fired during the mission, what hostile acts the target area had been responsible for in provoking the attack and how many of the people injured and killed were deemed to be military personnel.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20924w03.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Ingram:  </B> 
On the night of 18 July, when the incident in question occurred, coalition aircraft responded to multiple attacks on them by Iraqi air defence weapons, including anti-aircraft artillery and missiles, by releasing precision guided munitions.
<P>

<a name="20924w03.html_para0">Coalition aircraft conduct patrols of the Iraqi no fly zones in support of UN SCR 688 which demanded that Saddam Hussein end the brutal repression of his own people. The pilots conducting these wholly legitimate patrols are regularly shot at by Iraqi air defences. They are authorised to respond in self-defence to efforts to shoot them down. This is the only basis on which weapons have been released over Iraq since Operation Desert Fox in December 1998.

<P>

<a name="20924w03.html_para1">The coalition targets Iraqi air defence facilities that pose a threat to its forces patrolling the no fly zones. Exceptional lengths are taken to ensure civilian casualties are kept to the absolute minimum possible, including the employment of very carefully controlled targeting procedures and precision guided munitions. It is in Saddam's interests to distort the truth in his attempts to convince the world that the coalition is responsible for causing widespread suffering to the Iraqi civilian populace. Saddam would readily persecute these people, as he has done in the past, if we did not patrol the no fly zones. We are not prepared to abandon these people.

The Lord Chancellor's Department is responsible for one designated Area Based Initiative; the roll out of Community Legal Services Partnerships (CLSPs). CLSPs are voluntary groupings made up of providers and funders of advice and help services and are not funded by the Lord Chancellor's Department. However, CLSPs are supported by regional staff of the Legal Services Commission. The total cost of these staff has been &#163;3.5 million for each of the two years, 2000&#150;01 and 2001&#150;02. As this support varies according to need between CLSPs it is not possible to answer the question precisely for each local area.

Currently there are no plans to open new Immigration Appeal Tribunal (IAT) premises. At present all IAT hearings are conducted from Field House in London. However, there are extensive plans to open new Adjudicator hearing centres as part of the Immigration Appellate Authorities' (IAA) expansion programme. The IAA has been tasked with increasing its capacity from the current 4,500 asylum appeals per month to 6,000 cases per month from November 2002.
<P>

<a name="20924w03.html_para2">Centres are planned for Newport, Stoke-on-Trent, North Shields, Bradford and Manchester, opening between November 2002 and June 2003. In addition to the new locations, the hearing capacities of existing centres in Birmingham and Hatton Cross are being increased. The precise timescales for the expansion programme remain subject to lease and planning considerations.

<a name="20924w03.html_para3">The capacity of the IAT will also need to increase, but this will not require accommodation outside its London base.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what plans he has to improve the enforcement of fines imposed by the courts.  [73228]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20924w04.html_spnew0"><B> Yvette Cooper:  </B> 
The Government are committed to improving the enforcement of financial penalties. Following the transfer of lead responsibility of warrant execution from the police to Magistrates' Courts Committees in April 2001, my Department has been taking forward a programme of work aimed at improving enforcement. Magistrates' Courts Committees have also been given nearly &#163;10 million extra from April 2002, ring-fenced for enforcement purposes.
<P>

<a name="20924w04.html_para0">The White Paper, "Justice for All", published in July, heralded new legislative proposals aimed at improving enforcement rates. The proposals could include giving court staff a range of discretionary powers to manage the collection of fines on behalf of the court. While those facing genuine difficulties should have access to support and advice, defaulters who refuse to co-operate with the court would face greater sanctions, including for example increasing the fine if the offender fails to pay on time.
