<P>
<a name="90318w01.htm_wqn0"><B> Mr. Tyrie: </B> 
To ask the President of the Council if she will list the total number of occasions when <i>(a)</i> departmental and <i>(b)</i> non-departmental special advisers have travelled abroad in an official capacity since 2 May 1997.  [76824]<P>

<P>
<a name="90318w01.htm_spnew0"><B> Mrs. Beckett: </B> 
 Between 2 May 1997 and 28 February 1999, special advisers in my Department have made one visit overseas in an official capacity. All travel complied with the requirements of the Ministerial Code and the Civil Service Management Code.

<a name="90318w01.htm_sbhd2"><H4><center>Hamilton v Al Fayed Case</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="90318w01.htm_wqn2"><B> Mr. Peter Bottomley: </B> 
To ask the Attorney-General when he was first notified of <i>(a)</i> the libel claim by Neil Hamilton and <i>(b)</i> the Court of Appeal hearing on appeal from the Queen's Bench Division; when he first responded to Mr. Hamilton's solicitors; when he decided to intervene in the case; when he first notified the House that he was intervening; and for what purpose.  [77125]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90318w01.htm_spmin0"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 The Attorney-General was first notified that Mr. Neil Hamilton was pursuing a libel action against Mr. Al Fayed in a letter from Mr. Hamilton's solicitors dated 30 June 1998. A response was sent to Mr. Hamilton's solicitors on 7 July 1998 saying that the Attorney-General did not propose to be represented at the hearing. the Attorney-General was notified that the Court of Appeal had granted leave to Mr. Al Fayed to appeal against the decision of Mr. Justice Popplewell in a letter from Mr. Al Fayed's Solicitors dated 24 November 1998.
<P>

<a name="90318w01.htm_para0">Following consultations with the House Authorities, the Attorney-General decided to seek to intervene in the action in December 1998. A letter recording that decision was sent to the Clerk to the House on 7 December 1998.




<P>
<P><I>18 Mar 1999 : Column: 712</I><P>

<P>

<a name="90318w01.htm_para1">The purpose of the Attorney-General intervening was to present submissions to the Court of Appeal as to parliamentary privilege, in furtherance of the interests of the House.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90318w01.htm_wqn3"><B> Mr. Peter Bottomley: </B> 
To ask the Attorney-General if he will place in the Library the Solicitor General's skeleton argument and appendices used in the Hamilton <i>v</i> Al Fayed case, together with a transcript of proceedings.  [77126]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90318w01.htm_spmin1"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 I have arranged for a copy of my skeleton argument, together with its appendices, to be placed in the Library. It is important to note, however, that there were several modifications to the argument when presented orally. I have also placed in the Library a note prepared for the Court on the role of HM Attorney- General as intervenor in these proceedings. I am afraid that a transcript of the proceedings is not available and would take some weeks to prepare and approve. The Court of Appeal has reserved judgment in the matter, but as soon as an approved version of the judgment is available I will arrange for that, too, to be placed in the Library.

<a name="90318w01.htm_wqn4"><B> Mr. Gordon Prentice: </B> 
To ask the Attorney-General how many secondments have been arranged in each year since 1995, between staff employed by the Serious Fraud Office and the relevant Financial Services Regulator.  [76971]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90318w01.htm_spmin2"><B>The Attorney-General:</B> 
 No secondments were arranged in 1995. One secondment to a regulator or disciplinary body has been arranged in each subsequent year. In addition, one secondment was arranged prior to 1995 and was in place in 1995, and one secondment to the Financial Control Directorate General of the European Commission took place between 1994 and 1997.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90318w01.htm_wqn5"><B> Mr. Redwood: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry on how many occasions the Minister for Science has met officers or representatives of <i>(a)</i> Diatech Ltd., <i>(b)</i> Innotech Ltd., <i>(c)</i> Floranova Ltd., <i>(d)</i> Floranova Service Corp America, <i>(e)</i> Elite Seeds, and <i>(f)</i> Floranova s.a., Costa Rica, since becoming a Minister.

<P>
<a name="90318w01.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Byers </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 25 February 1999]:</i> I am informed that on no occasion has Lord Sainsbury met with officers or representatives of any of these companies acting in an official capacity since his appointment. I understand that he has met with Christopher Stone of Diatech Ltd. on a number of times on a personal basis, but on no occasion were any aspects of the work or investments of any of the companies placed in the blind trust discussed.

<P>
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if he will make a statement on the 



<P>
<P><I>18 Mar 1999 : Column: 713</I><P>
Government's support for shipbuilding in the United Kingdom, with particular reference to the Kvaerner Govan yard.  [74881]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90318w01.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 To support the UK shipbuilding industry, I established in July 1998 the Shipbuilding Forum whose membership comprises representatives of the shipbuilding industry, its unions, equipment suppliers and customers, both private and public sector. Also involved are the training organisations and relevant Departments. The Forum's terms of reference from me were to consider the current situation of the shipbuilding industry and how to improve its competitiveness so as to increase its share of the European market, leading to increased output, profitability and employment. The Forum is currently preparing an Implementation Plan which it plans to deliver to me within the next few months. These Recommendations--currently more than 40--are to all the participants, not just to the Government. The Forum believes that these Recommendations will go a long way towards a marked improvement in the fortunes of the UK shipbuilding industry and I look forward to reading their Implementation Plan.
<P>

<a name="90318w01.htm_para2">My Department gives Shipbuilding Intervention Fund grants to eligible UK yards, including Kvaerner Govan, at the maximum level permitted by the European Union's Shipbuilding Regulation and the Scottish Office made an offer to Govan of a grant under the Regional Selective Assistance programme.

<a name="90318w01.htm_sbhd6"><H4><center>EU Life Patents Directive</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="90318w01.htm_wqn7"><B> Mr. Baker: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what is his policy in respect of the appeal by Italy and the Netherlands to the European Court of Justice against the EU Life Patents Directive.  [74827]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90318w01.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Battle </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 5 March 1999]:</i> It is primarily a matter for the Council and European Parliament (as the institutions who adopted the Directive) to lodge the defence against the Netherlands' application seeking to annul Directive 98/44/EC on the Legal Protection of Biotechnological Inventions. EU member states had the opportunity to intervene in this case. The Government have carefully considered the terms of the Dutch action before the European Court of Justice and a decision has been taken not to intervene. We do not wish to add anything to the Council's arguments already lodged before the Court in response to the Dutch action.

<a name="90318w01.htm_sbhd7"><H4><center>Select Committee Reports</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="90318w01.htm_wqn8"><B> Mr. Maclean: </B>

[75882]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90318w01.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. Byers </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 10 March 1999]:</i> I refer the right hon. Member to the answer given by my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister to the hon. Member for Spelthorne (Mr. Wilshire) on 1 March 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>531</i>. There have been no instances of members of Select Committees giving me drafts of Select Committee reports, or parts of reports including their conclusions, before publication. Nor, to the best of my

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what proposals he has for the World Class Performance Programme for the United Kingdom's top athletes.  [78043]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90318w03.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Chris Smith: </B> 
 The Sports Cabinet met for the second time on Wednesday last week and decided on a package of Lottery support to back our top sportsmen and women.
<P>

<a name="90318w03.htm_para0">The Government will shortly lay before Parliament an Order which will make the UK Sports Council a Lottery distributor and earmark a percentage of the Lottery Sports Fund for them to distribute for the UK's best sportsmen and women for them to train and prepare for competition.
<P>

<a name="90318w03.htm_para1">A joint scheme has already been pioneered by the four Sports Councils for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.




<P>
<P><I>18 Mar 1999 : Column: 720</I><P>

<P>

<a name="90318w03.htm_para2">This decision builds on that scheme and its success, makes a strong commitment to future funding, and, for the first time, ensures that the top UK athletes from whatever part of the country are backed by a single unified and well run scheme.
<P>

<a name="90318w03.htm_para3">Regular and independent reports to Ministers and to the UK Sports Council on the way the money is being spent, and its effectiveness in helping the UK's top athletes to maximise their potential and achieve sporting success, and in bringing medals and championship titles to the UK, will be built in from the outset.
<P>

<a name="90318w03.htm_para4">This programme will be closely linked to the development of the UK Sports Institute. The Government has already announced the new direction it is giving with more of the Institute's facilities built throughout the country where athletes actually want to live and train, and a strategic Headquarters to co-ordinate services and set standards across the national network.
<P>

<a name="90318w03.htm_para5">As a consequence, the balance of expenditure between Headquarters and regions will change with more being spent on the regional facilities in line with the results of wide consultation of athletes and governing bodies which the Sports Councils have carried out, and the required funding for capital work on the Headquarters building being accordingly substantially reduced. The Headquarters will concentrate on its crucial role of oversight of the provision of the best in sports science and medicine, and quality assurance of the network sites, and will now be the direct responsibility of the UK Sports Council.
<P>

<a name="90318w03.htm_para6">In line with that policy, Ministers have now decided that greater emphasis should be placed on training and preparation programmes. The proposed Order will earmark a percentage of Lottery funding, which should generate &#163;20.5 million for the World Class Performance and Events Programmes.
<P>

<a name="90318w03.htm_para7">Within this sum of Lottery funding, it is expected that the UK Sports Council should have about &#163;2 million annually to help attract to and stage major sporting events in this country. The Sports Cabinet sees a close link between these programmes. They will both benefit all parts of the UK fairly, where close joint working is needed if we are to succeed on the international scene--and the best possible place for a top performance is in front of an enthusiastic home crowd against the best world competition.
<P>

<a name="90318w03.htm_para8">These two programmes will be closely co-ordinated with the work of the four Home Country Sports Councils, who will continue to back excellence in sports which compete separately as England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and in helping to identify and support up-and-coming talent.

 Direct access to the Schengen Information System (SIS) by the National Criminal Intelligence Service and other law enforcement agencies could be secured only if the United Kingdom was a member of the SIS.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90318w04.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The temporary reduction in service standards does not apply to all areas in the new Directorate. The Public Caller Unit, for example, has been able to maintain productivity throughout the

However, in other areas there has been a fairly significant reduction in service and productivity during the months of January and February, when we were moving offices. Now that much of the move has been made, the position is improving: productivity has been rising and we are mounting special exercises to target priority cases such as work permits. Our aim is to reach the levels of throughput previously achieved within a few weeks.

<P>
<a name="90318w04.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The disruption caused by the reorganisation of the Immigration and Nationality Directorate (IND) has meant some temporary delay in the processing of cases, particularly during the months of January and February. The position is improving: productivity has been rising and we are mounting special exercises to target priority cases. In the majority of straight forward cases, the delay is now a matter of weeks only. The expectation is that the situation will continue to improve.
<P>

<a name="90318w04.htm_para1">We do, however, recognise that there is a large backlog of IND cases, the great majority preceding the reorganisation. There are, for example, currently 104,356 cases in IND's central Work in Progress Store, many of which are over five years old. Our plans for dealing with this backlog are set out in the Government's White Paper "Fairer, Faster and Firmer--A Modern Approach to Immigration and Asylum".

 Airport development is promoted by developers through the normal planning process, though major schemes will usually be decided by the Secretary of State following a public inquiry. Airports projects for which planning applications have already been made, or are expected to be made shortly, will not be within the scope of the Regional Air Services studies, because it would cause duplication and delay if we were to study projects which are being considered in the land use planning system at the same time; the study will therefore examine a range of scenarios based on those projects either going ahead or not going ahead, and will concentrate on strategic medium and long term issues.

<a name="90318w05.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Meale: </B> 
 Environment Agency monitoring of groundwater has not shown concentrations above the analytical detection limit, and mercury is generally not present in groundwater. However, there may be sites where processes using mercury (including parts of the millinery and electrical industries) have resulted in contamination, with consequent risks to groundwater, although mercury contamination from such sites would not be widespread. The Groundwater Regulations 1998 prohibit the discharge of mercury to groundwater, and provide for controls over activities which might result in the discharge of mercury to groundwater.

 Under the Mandatory Occurrence Report Scheme currently established by article 106 of the Air Navigation (No. 2) Order 1995, the commander of a UK registered or operated aircraft must report to the Civil Aviation Authority any incident

<P>

<a name="90318w05.htm_para0">The CAA's MORS database does not have a classification of "air rage" and it is therefore not possible to provide the figures requested. However, we have recently reviewed the 1997 MORS reports relating to passenger behaviour. This revealed some 88 incidents of disruptive behaviour by passengers which had actual or potential safety implications. Of these, some 24 incidents involved physical violence or the need by the crew to restrain a passenger.
<P>

<a name="90318w05.htm_para1">It is because of the lack of accurate information on the scale of the problem that we have established a new system for airlines to report to the CAA all incidents of disruptive behaviour by passengers on board UK aircraft. The first figures from this new reporting system should be available later this year.

 <i>[holding answer 16 March 1999]:</i> The Government are considering the role of waste incinerators with energy recovery as part of the review of the waste strategy for England and Wales. Their consultation paper <i>Less Waste: More Value</i> published in June 1998 said:

<BR>

<a name="90318w05.htm_spnew7"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 Manufacturers have been closely involved throughout the process of developing standards for accessible buses.

An informal consultation on regulations under the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 to require improved access to buses and coaches took place in 1998, and a formal consultation on the draft regulations is planned for this year.
<P>

<a name="90318w05.htm_para4">The regulations will progressively require a lower first step height, provision for wheelchair users and other passengers with a wide range of disabilities, starting in January 2000.

They may also undertake very limited temporary borrowing for revenue purposes. The Aggregate Credit Limit changes frequently and figures are not collected centrally.

 During my visit to India I addressed the Millennium Tiger Conference and, as a guest of the Indian Government, visited Ranthambore Tiger Reserve where tiger numbers are slowly recovering as a result of positive protection and co-operation to meet the needs of local people.
<P>

<a name="90318w06.htm_para0">I was impressed by the clear commitment to tiger conservation shown by the Indian Government and in particular, by Suresh Prabhu, the Indian Environment Minister, and Director of Project Tiger, Mr. P. K. Sen. However, in spite of their efforts, and those of many committed Indian officials, reserve wardens and NGOs, tigers in India still face serious threats. These are set down in the Millennium Tiger Conference's final communique and include the loss of habitat to large scale development projects; habitat degradation from livestock grazing and increased human population; and poaching to supply the continuing demand for tiger body parts.
<P>

<a name="90318w06.htm_para1">The Conference agreed to address these by recommending that land use policies recognise the importance of tiger habitats and that revenues from Protected Areas be reinvested in tiger conservation. The meeting also emphasised the importance of improving legislation and strengthening enforcement. The Declaration calls for more effort from consumer countries in controlling domestic trade in tiger parts and derivatives, an issue that the CITES Tiger Missions, launched in London by my right hon. Friend the Minister for the Environment and the Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office, my right hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, Central (Mr. Fatchett), will pursue when visiting range states including India, and consuming countries such as Japan, in the early summer.

<a name="90318w06.htm_para2">Whilst in India, I announced the UK's intention to join the Global Tiger Forum, together with a new grant of &#163;50,000 to go towards enforcement work in India and an Indonesian project to protect the Sumatran tiger.

 There are over 300 authorised local authority Gypsy caravan sites in England and Wales although we know of none which would accommodate more than 150 caravans.

The Government have no plans to make Crown land available specifically for Gypsies and Travellers proposing to celebrate the millennium.

<a name="90318w06.htm_para4">My Department and the Home Office have recently published joint good practice advice for local authorities and the police for managing unauthorised camping by travellers generally. The good practice was developed with the assistance of a number of groups representing Gypsy/Traveller interests, including the National Gypsy Council.

 The 1998 Annual Report of the Independent Commission for Police Complaints is being laid before Parliament today. The Report, which follows the format of previous years, comments on the work of the Commission in 1998, its 11th year dealing with alleged complaints against the RUC.
<P>

<a name="90318w07.htm_para1">I should like formally to record the Government's thanks to the Chairman and Members of the Commission and to the staff for their continued excellent work during this past year and for producing this Report. In this respect, I would like to highlight and endorse the Chairman's introduction to the Report in which he says that in spite of the already heavy workload of (Commission members and) staff, and the extra demands on them in facilitating the transition to the establishment of the Ombudsman's office, their
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"commitment, professionalism and enthusiasm stand as a tribute to each and every one of them."</FONT></UL>
<P>

<a name="90318w07.htm_para2">I know that the police, particularly in Complaints and Discipline Department, have shown similar commitment, and I would like to place that on record also.
<P>

<a name="90318w07.htm_para3">The work on establishing the Office of the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland is continuing and we will be re-advertising the Ombudsman post shortly. This is an important new office, which, along with the other changes in policing that are in train, should contribute further to improving public confidence in the police in Norther Ireland.
<P>

<a name="90318w07.htm_para4">The 1998 Report notes that there was a reduction of nearly 15 per cent. in the number of cases of complaint received by the Commission, compared with the number received in 1997, down from 3,111 to 2,651. The figures since 1991, however, have remained around the 2,500 level. It also notes that the number of cases for mandatory supervision has remained at about 100 and the number of discretionary cases was lower than expected at 171. Of the 2,383 cases closed in 1998, 562 were withdrawn, 682 were dispensed with (usually because a complainant would not co-operate with an investigation) and disciplinary action was considered in over 1,000. The DPP directed 5 criminal charges, there were 19 formal disciplinary charges and 104 informal disciplinary actions.
<P>

<a name="90318w07.htm_para5">In light of the appalling murder of Rosemary Nelson, I think it important and appropriate to highlight the reference in the report to the complaints made by and on behalf of Mrs. Nelson. The Commission refer to their "serious concern" about the conduct of the investigation. They raised these with the Chief Constable and me last Summer. As a consequence, the Chief Constable appointed Commander Mulvihill, with the approval of the ICPC, to continue the investigation. The ICPC will shortly be issuing its statutory statement on the conduct of this to 



<P>
<P><I>18 Mar 1999 : Column: 735</I><P>
the Chief Constable and complainants. As is normal the investigation file will then be sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions for consideration.
<P>

<a name="90318w07.htm_para6">A number of additional points are worth recording. One is the Commission's helpful historical analysis of the evolution of the complaints system in Northern Ireland. Another is the decision to supervise all complaints alleging intimidation of solicitors. As we have already told the Commission, this is a sensible and helpful approach to a contentious subject. A third is the decision to take on a small number of cases concerning incivility. These may be regarded by some as less serious allegations, but to complainants they are all serious, and I think it important to audit such cases in the way the ICPC has done.
<P>

<a name="90318w07.htm_para7">Finally, the Government echoes the concluding words of the Chairman that:

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland when the preliminary view of the coming year's parades is to be published by the Parades Commission; to whom the preliminary view of the coming year's parades is formally submitted; to whom the Parades Commission is formally accountable; on what parades the Parades Commission has issued a formal determination since its inception; how many parades have taken place which have contravened rulings made by the Commission; and if she will make a statement on the work of the Parades Commission over its first 12 months.

 <i>[holding answer 16 March 1999]:</i> The current text of the Procedural Rules, one of the three statutory documents published under the Public 



<P>
<P><I>18 Mar 1999 : Column: 736</I><P>
Processions (Northern Ireland) Act 1998, indicates that the Commission will
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"express an informal broad view of the overall pattern of parades in the areas in which they are contentious"</FONT></UL>
<P>

<a name="90318w07.htm_para8">(Procedural Rules, p1, para. 1.2).
<P>

<a name="90318w07.htm_para9">The Commission is currently reviewing the Procedural Rules, together with the Code of Conduct and the Guidelines, in line with its statutory remit, and has issued its proposed changes to the documents in draft form for consultation. One of the proposed changes to the Procedural Rules is the removal of the requirement to make a preliminary view. In reaching its decisions in respect of contentious parades in the 1998 season, the Commission set out clearly the action it considered necessary by parties to parades disputes in order to remove the need for Commission involvement. Therefore, it considers that to issue a preliminary view in 1999 would simply be to restate what is already in the public domain.
<P>

<a name="90318w07.htm_para10">The Chairman and his colleagues on the Commission will, of course, consider carefully the responses they receive in relation to the documents, including proposals relating to the preliminary view. The revised documents are, as the hon. Gentleman knows, subject to Parliamentary approval before publication.
<P>

<a name="90318w07.htm_para11">In relation to accountability, the Commission was established by Parliament under the Public Processions (Northern Ireland) Act 1998 as an independent body. In addition to the statutory requirements in relation to the Code of Conduct, Procedural Rules and Guidelines, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State is required to present to Parliament the Commission's Annual Report on the discharge of its functions for that year.
<P>

<a name="90318w07.htm_para12">I have placed in the Library of the House a list of parades in relation to which the Parades Commission has issued a determination since receiving its statutory powers enabling it to impose conditions on parades.
<P>

<a name="90318w07.htm_para13">Statistics on the number of parade which have contravened the Commission's rulings are not available.
<P>

<a name="90318w07.htm_para14">Finally, I wish to congratulate the Parades Commission for their integrity and commitment over the last year. They have a difficult job and they have carried out their role in a totally fair and impartial manner in the best interests of all the people of Northern Ireland.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will list the waiting periods for <i>(a)</i> angioplasty, <i>(b)</i> angiogram procedures and <i>(c)</i> heart by-pass surgery in each health trust.  [74887]<P>

 Available information on the number of patients waiting for angioplasty and heart by-pass surgery by health authority is shown in the table.
<P>

<a name="90318w07.htm_para15">An angiogram or angiography is the main means of investigating the need for these procedures. Dye is injected into the blood stream and radiology is used to view the vessels. This is not a surgical procedure and information on waiting lists is not available centrally.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90318w08.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 Payment of allocations of a special grant to local authorities is dependent each year on Parliamentary approval. In the case of the carers' special grant, payment will, subject to approval by Parliament of the special grant report for 1999-2000, be dependent on a number of conditions including provision of an action plan and demonstration of progress on that plan. The 



<P>
<P><I>18 Mar 1999 : Column: 740</I><P>
allocations to individual local authorities of the funding of &#163;50 million for 2000-01 and &#163;70 million for 2001-02 will be determined according to a formula, using the most recent data available. It is therefore not possible to confirm detailed final allocations for future years at this stage.

<P>

<a name="90318w08.htm_para1">The comparisons between June 1996 and January 1999 are affected by the reduction in the registration period to 15 months for all new registrations from September 1996 and by a reduction in the number of duplicate entries. The introduction of the Personal Dental Service (PDS) in October 1998 will also have affected figures since some GDS practices which became PDS pilots transferred their patients into the PDS.
<P>

<a name="90318w08.htm_para2">Dentists are given monthly payments for registering children, and for children up to 5-years old these payments are higher in deprived areas to encourage dentists to register more children in these areas of high oral health need.

<a name="90318w08.htm_para3">Regulatory control of the welfare of animals potentially to be used as sources for xenotransplantation lies with the Home Office. A Code of Practice on the welfare of high health status pigs as xenotransplantation source animals is currently being developed by the Home Office (Scientific Procedures) Inspectorate. In considering any application, the UKXIRA would expect to see evidence of animal welfare standards at least equal to those to be included in the Code of Practice. However, the UKXIRA also recognises that there may be circumstances in which advice on the animal welfare aspects of specific applications is required. The appointment of appropriate assessors is currently being pursued.

 The information requested is not available in the form requested. Bed data are collected by broad ward classification rather than by clinical specialty. The data are also collected only from National Health Service trusts and there is no split between the different types of hospitals. The publication, "Bed availability and Occupancy for England" contains information for individual NHS trusts along with summary tables for England.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will list for each health authority the expenditure on <i>(a)</i> damages for negligence and <i>(b)</i> out-of-court settlements for each of the last five years.  [77305]<P>

<P>
<a name="90318w08.htm_spnew11"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 Until recently, health authority accounts did not separate clinical negligence costs from others made under legal liability and personal injury. We cannot, therefore, give figures going back 5 years. In addition, the accounts do not distinguish between costs incurred through court awarded damages and those arising from out of court settlements. We are, however, able to give details of total clinical negligence costs by health authority (HA) for the last two years, and these are in the table.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90318w09.htm_spnew8"><B> Mr. Jon Owen Jones: </B> 
 The new integrated rural development regulation, part of the Agenda 2000 CAP reform package agreed last week, makes it mandatory to introduce new agri-environmental schemes in all parts of all member states. In Wales, this is already in place in the form of Tir Gofal.




<P>
<P><I>18 Mar 1999 : Column: 748</I><P>

<P>

<a name="90318w09.htm_para8">The regulation will also allow the UK to introduce a new scheme to replace Hill Livestock Compensatory Allowances and deliver support to hill farmers more effectively while taking account of environmental protection requirements. The new scheme can be tailored to cater for differences and priorities in different areas within member states.
<P>

<a name="90318w09.htm_para9">The creation of the new integrated rural development regulation creates a good basis on which future reforms will be able to implement a switch from supporting agricultural production to environmental measures. The current reforms have not moved very far in this regard and the significant shift to environmental measures is a matter which will have to be pressed further in reform of the CAP in future.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90318w09.htm_spnew9"><B> Mr. Jon Owen Jones: </B> 
 The provisional agreement reached by the Agriculture Council represents a significant change in the direction of the CAP-- a direction for which the UK Government have been strongly pressing. The Welsh Office is assessing how the proposed reforms will affect farmers in Wales.

<P>

<a name="90318w11.htm_para0">Over &#163;700 million will be allocated for schools purchase of ICT networking and infrastructure by the year 2002.

<P>

<a name="90318w11.htm_para1">The Department published last year the results of a survey of ICT provision in schools, which indicated that 17 per cent. of primary schools and 83 per cent. of secondary schools were connected to the Internet by March 1998. This is in comparison to the previous year's survey (published in 1997), which indicated that 5 per cent. of primary schools and 47 per cent. of secondary schools were connected to the Internet at that time. Subsequent annual surveys will indicate the growth of schools with such connections. The latest estimates are that approximately 30 per cent. of primary schools, 90 per cent. of secondary schools and 45 per cent. of special schools in England may currently have some form of Internet access. The Government are committed to ensuring that all schools are connected to the Internet by 2002.

 To date, five prototype Employment Zones have been established in Glasgow, Liverpool and Sefton, North-West Wales, Plymouth and South Tees. Three smaller projects are also underway in Birmingham and Solihull, Wembley and Doncaster and Wakefield.
<P>

<a name="90318w12.htm_para3">The effectiveness of the prototypes is constantly being reviewed and evaluated. A qualitative evaluation is being undertaken jointly by Manchester and Leeds Metropolitan Universities and a quantitative survey is planned to run from May 1999 to June 1999. The outcome of the evaluation will be published at the end of the year.
<P>

<a name="90318w12.htm_para4">The lessons learned from the prototypes will feed into the framework for fully fledged Employment Zones, which will run on the personal job account model from April 2000.

 The notes in the EC Budget have no legal status and are indicative only. Under Article 205, the Commission retains the obligation to implement the budget as adopted on its own authority. The notes are proposed by the Commission and amended by either arm of the budgetary authority (Council or European Parliament). For non-compulsory expenditure, as in the case of this budget line, the Parliament has the final say.
<P>

<a name="90318w13.htm_para2">The Government believe that information spending from the Community budgets should not be used for propaganda, but should contribute to increased transparency and understanding of the EU, its activities, its structure and its functions, by the citizen.

 Extension of the European Parliamentary franchise to Gibraltar will require amendment of the 1976 EC Act on Direct Elections. This will require the agreement of all EU Member States. HMG will seek such an amendment in the current negotiations in Brussels on establishing Common Principles for EP Elections. Once an amendment Act is agreed, it will require ratification in all Member States. We will also need to amend UK domestic legislation.

Transparent and accountable government, freedom of expression and association, and the rule of law are also essential to genuine democracy. Rather than producing league tables, which are liable to be misleading, we are working, through political pressure and practical assistance, to promote the establishment and strengthening of such democratic systems around the world.

Friend the Prime Minister's assessment, as set out in the answer of 16 March 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>573</i>, of the Iraqi memorandum about the non-distribution of $275m worth of medical supplies. It is an unconvincing attempt by Iraq to divert responsibility for the distribution problems in the centre and south on to others. In the northern governorates, where distribution is carried out by UN agencies, no problems in the distribution of medical goods were noted in the UN Secretary-General's report.

 HMG has always worked to ensure that UN Security Council resolutions on Iraq are implemented. We were at the forefront of efforts to introduce the UN "oil for food" humanitarian programme and continue to do all we can to help the Iraqi people. Recently, the UK mission has been working at the UN to press Iraq to prioritise contracts effectively, so that the food and health needs of the Iraqi people, including vulnerable groups such as infants, are put first. They have, for example, raised concerns that Iraq has not so far submitted contracts to the Sanctions Committee for high protein biscuits (for pregnant and lactating mothers) and has submitted contracts for only $1.5 million (out of $8.7 million) for high protein milk for infants.

 The No Fly Zones were established in April 1991 and August 1992 in support of UN Security Council resolution 688 which called on Iraq to end its repression of the civilian population. The No Fly Zones are justified under international law in response to a situation of overwhelming humanitarian necessity.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90318w14.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. Fatchett: </B> 
 We have seen press reports that the Government of Iraq have blamed external forces for the murder of Ayatollah al-Sadr. But others, including credible Iraqi Shia sources, hold the Iraqi regime responsible for the assassination. The UN Special Rapporteur previously expressed his fears that such killings formed part of a systematic attack on the independent leadership of Shia muslims in Iraq. We urge the Iraqi authorities to conduct a full investigation into al-Sadr's death and bring the perpetrators to justice.

 96 per cent. of the contracts submitted by Iraq to the Security Council under the UN "oil for food" programme have been approved. The majority of holds are put in place because paperwork is either incorrect or insufficient. The UK currently has holds on six contracts for medical supplies because the full details required by the UN have not been provided (and in one case because the contract is illegible). I can assure my hon. Friend that the equipment and drugs he specifies do not feature on any of these contracts.

 5,179 chargeable export services were performed for UK companies during financial year 1997-98 yielding a total of &#163;1.23 million. This revenue accrues to the Department of Trade and Industry. These services fall into two main categories: Tailored Market Information, which can include basic market information, identification and assessment of potential agents/ distributors, market assessments for a company's product or service, advice on a company's market approach and general information on local investment opportunities; and Commercial Publicity Services. To provide a breakdown of the services provided to individual companies during this period would involve disproportionate cost.

 An important element of the White Paper's objective of reducing global poverty, is socially responsible partnership with British Business. In Central Asia, we are hoping to work with British Gas. Through a special scheme, we have helped British companies investigate investment opportunities. Our main programmes of assistance in these countries necessarily focus on supporting their transition (to market economies and pluralist democracies) in an equitable and sustainable manner. To this end, in Central Asia we are working with governments to tackle agriculture and health reform, whilst at the same time also helping build civil society.

 The best way to proceed is for financial institutions to achieve a high degree of Year 2000 compliance. The primary responsibility for achieving that lies with the industry. The Financial Services Authority regards this as a major supervisor priority and has made it clear that firms which fail to implement appropriate measures face regulatory intervention.

 <i>[holding answer 17 March 1999]:</i> Some 26 written representations in support of the continuing designation of the Falkirk area as an Assisted Area have now been received by The Scottish Office. Comments have been made on the criteria which might be used in designating the new Assisted Areas and the geographical units which could be employed, and all such representations, of course, imply support for regional aid towards investment assistance to industry to continue to be made available. The main form of this aid is currently Regional Selective Assistance, which may only be granted in the Assisted Areas.

 <i>[holding answer 16 March 1999]:</i> Each local authority in Scotland is responsible for setting its own budget. The Scottish Office provides funding to authorities through Aggregate External Finance (AEF) in support of their net current expenditure. The table shows AEF funding at cash and constant 1998-99 prices by local authority for 1995-96 to 1999-2000. The distribution of AEF at a local authority level for 2000-01 and 2001-02 is not yet decided, but overall support for local authority expenditure for each of these years is planned to increase by 3.0 per cent. and 2.7 per cent. respectively.

<a name="90318w19.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Dewar: </B>

To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland what progress has been made on implementing measures to improve the throughput of cases entering the children's hearing system; and if he will make a statement.  [78045]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90318w19.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Galbraith: </B> 
 Following receipt of the "Just In Time" report in December 1997, I asked Mrs. Sally Kuenssberg, Chairman of the Scottish Children's Reporter Administration to re-form her working group to consider with the agencies concerned how best to implement the report's recommendations.
<P>

<a name="90318w19.htm_para0">At my request, Mrs. Kuenssberg's group has now produced a blueprint to apply to all relevant agencies. It consists of a code of practice and comprehensive standards and targets for the handling of all cases referred to the hearings system, whether on grounds of offending or care and protection. I have endorsed the Blueprint which is published today. Copies have been placed in the Libraries.
<P>

<a name="90318w19.htm_para1">The care of our children, especially those at risk, is of greatest importance. Effective and early action in co-ordinated working for children and families is widely recognised as beneficial. I am determined to see improvements in services for children and families. This blueprint offers a systematic and innovative approach to tackling both quality and timing issues.




<P>
<P><I>18 Mar 1999 : Column: 788</I><P>

I have been very encouraged by the wide measure of support for the principles and practical measures contained within the blueprint and now look to the agencies concerned to take forward its introduction. The targets will be a challenge for some and progress towards achieving them will secure improvements over current arrangements. The key to successful introduction and further progress on the Blueprint depends on the active co-operation between the agencies to improve the delivery of their service. The blueprint paves the way for this and I look to Chief Executives and senior managers to take action to monitor its implementation and development within their agencies.
<P>

<a name="90318w19.htm_para2">I have asked Sally Kuenssberg's group to continue to meet periodically to assess progress and, in the light of experience, where standards and targets might be reviewed and improved upon.

To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland how many beds dealing with incontinence are available in Scotland in <i>(a)</i> all service hospitals, <i>(b)</i> general hospitals, <i>(c)</i> specialist hospitals, <i>(d)</i> teaching hospitals and <i>(e)</i> hospitals in other categories.  [77009]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90318w19.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Galbraith: </B> 
 It is not possible to say how many beds are available for dealing with incontinence in Scotland, as most treatment is now carried out on an out-patient basis by specialist nurses and physiotherapists. Patients rarely require in-patient treatment for incontinence per se, but may require to be admitted for treatment of the underlying cause of the incontinence. The causes of incontinence are wide ranging, and treatment therefore takes place in many different settings. Beds are not specifically set aside for treatment of incontinence, in the same way as they are not specifically set aside for many other conditions.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. A "major means-tested benefit" was defined as being one of Housing Benefit, Council Tax Benefit, Income Support (including Income Support for the unemployed, before October 1996), Family Credit or Jobseeker's Allowance (Income Based, from October 1996 onwards). However, on the 1996-97 Family Resources Survey dataset, it was not possible to distinguish Unemployment Benefit from Jobseeker's Allowance (Income Based), which was introduced in October 1996. Thus, Jobseeker's Allowance (Income Based) has not been included in analyses in the table. Analysis of the Family Resources Survey from April to September 1996 (inclusive) show that the proportion of people in households in receipt of at least one of the four means tested benefits given in the table was 27 per cent.<P>

2. Estimates are subject to sampling error and to variability in non-response. Receipt of Social Security benefits are also based on respondents' own assessment and may be subject to misreporting.<P>

3. Percentages are rounded to the nearest integer. The symbol "--" indicates less than 0.5 per cent.<P>

 The provision for making direct payments from Income Support and income based Jobseeker's Allowance for water charges will continue to operate when disconnection of household water supplies is prohibited.

 The mandatory War Pension disregards are funded in the same way as other expenditure for Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit. The bulk of this expenditure is met by central Government subsidy. Local authorities have discretionary powers to disregard up to the full amount of a War Disablement Pension and War Widow's Pension not already covered by the statutory disregard. However, any benefit payable as a result of such discretion is funded from local authorities' own resources. It is for each local authority to decide, how much, if anything, it can afford.

 The Personal Advisers' prime purpose will be to help clients explore ways in which they can overcome barriers that prevent participation in the labour market. However, the role will encompass much more than this. They will advise claimants on benefit entitlement, including any current welfare needs, and provide the first point of contact for any queries or difficulties. They will also help individuals gain access to a range of services, such as childcare provision, specialist counselling, housing support and training, and will be able to provide clients with information about their potential eligibility for in-work benefits so that clients can understand what their income levels might be if they moved into employment.

 We are producing a programme of learning to ensure that all Personal Advisers will be able to provide advice, guidance and counselling to help clients identify and overcome their barriers to employment, and also to provide clients with access to a variety of help and information on work, benefits and services.
<P>

<a name="90318w21.htm_para1">The programme will ensure that Personal Advisers have the necessary balance of skills in order to deal with a wide range of clients in differing circumstances, and will not be specific to particular client groups.

 The Single Work-Focused Gateway will be fully evaluated. The evaluation will compare the outcomes of participants in the pilot areas with those for similar people from other, comparable areas.

 All partners involved in the Single Gateway (Employment Service, Benefits Agency and Local Authorities) will deal with both a wider range of clients and with a wider range of issues affecting those clients. This will necessitate much closer working relationships, including improved communications; management arrangements and Information Technology links.
<P>

<a name="90318w21.htm_para2">Existing business processes will be affected and work is currently underway to identify these, in particular the need for business information flows between the partners and effective integration between the new Personal Adviser service and existing processes.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90318w21.htm_spnew7"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 The proposed design for the pilot exercises is based on extensions of, and where possible some development of, existing Employment Service, Benefits Agency and other systems.

 Information about Housing Benefit fraud is not available for each of the last ten years. The first Housing Benefit Accuracy Review in 1995 estimated annual losses from fraud and strongly suspected fraud to be &#163;905 million. The equivalent estimate from the second Review in 1997-98 is &#163;600 million. However, due to the different methodology used in each review, it is not possible to state with an acceptable level of statistical certainty that there has been a decrease in the level of fraud and suspected fraud.

The procedure for returning items to stock is being re-evaluated by the Agency, its Customers and Consumers and are being addressed by the ABSDA/Defence Logistics Agency (USA) Benchmarking partnership. Indications for the current year are that performance for Stores Unit Returns has improved significantly.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>Key Target 2</i>--To meet the Standard Priority System 96 Supply Chain Processing Times (SCPT) for material authorised for issue. This KT breaks down into 21 parts, of which the Agency missed 6. The Agency missed two targets primarily because of the low volumes of this type that exaggerated the impact of such few failures. The 2 lowest Stores non-operational low priority targets were not met but the non-compliance had the agreement of the supported commands and resulted from reduced resources being concentrated on meeting high priority operational demands. Two Vehicles Issue targets were missed mainly due to difficulties encountered with vehicles that had been mid life extended and refurbished. Vehicles classed as fit for issue on selection were found to have faults that required rectification. It has been a difficult balancing act between the achievement of improved performance via a process review and a significant reduction in resources. In the current year all Stores operational and high priority performances are within target.</FONT></UL>

 <i>[holding answer 25 February 1999]:</i> Safety is of prime importance to all involved in the operation of the Atomic Weapons Establishment, AWE, Aldermaston. The AWE operating contractor, Hunting BRAE, publishes an annual report entitled "Environment, Safety and Health", which includes information on safety performance and the activities that are undertaken at Aldermaston to ensure that safety requirements are met. The 1998 Report is due to be published, as normal, early in the summer. This public report is underpinned by regular internal audits conducted by the contractor.
<P>

<a name="90318w23.htm_para0">The Ministry of Defence on site Compliance Officer conducts regular confidential assessments of AWE's activities and was satisfied that they met the requirements of the Term Contract. Additionally independent assurance of the safety of AWE is provided by the Health and Safety Executive's Nuclear Installations Inspectorate NII. Aldermaston was awarded a licence to operate by the NII for the first time in July 1997. Maintenance of the licence is subject to the licensee's satisfying the licence conditions in the face of the NII's rigorous inspection regime.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90318w23.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson: </B> 
 In my announcement on 2 March of the Army's basing proposals within the United Kingdom, I indicated that it was provisionally planned to deploy an AS-90 artillery regiment of around 700 personnel to Larkhill, a tank regiment of around 600 to Tidworth, an engineer regiment of around 550 men to Perham Down, and to increase the numbers of the existing REME regiment at Tidworth by some 100 men. Initial estimates are that this will lead to a requirement for 450 more single-soldier bed spaces at Larkhill, 350 single- soldier bed spaces at Tidworth and 350 new family quarters in the Tidworth, Bulford and Larkhill area. In addition, there will be a requirement to build garaging and stores for the extra vehicles and additional recreational and support facilities for the increased number of troops. These proposals are subject to planning agreement, and the detailed accommodation requirements for those units to be based at Tidworth and Larkhill will not be finalised until a strategic environmental assessment has been carried out and discussions with local planning authorities have been concluded.

<a name="90318w23.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 8 March 1999]:</i> Between April 1997 and March 1998, there were a total of 9,075 road traffic accidents involving military personnel and MOD civilians. Based on the only available mileage data, for Royal Marine and Army units, this represents an estimated rate of two accidents per hundred thousand miles driven. The actual cost of insurance claims against the MOD, after taking into account costs recovered from third parties, was &#163;13.62 million. The actual cost of MOD vehicle repairs was &#163;5.07 million. The illustrative cost of fatalities and injuries to the Department, based on recognised costs provided by the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions, was &#163;34.9 million. The estimate total cost to the Department, using Health and Safety Executive research methodology, may be up to &#163;149.52 million. The specific cost of accidents to the Army, for loss of man hours, medical treatment, damage to other property, damage to other vehicles and replacement vehicles, is not held centrally and could be provided only at disproportionate cost.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90318w23.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 8 March 1999]:</i> The Service Level Agreements (SLA) between my Department and the NHS, which underpin the Ministry of Defence Hospital Units (MDHUs), were reviewed and renegotiated during 1998-99. While the initial agreements with our three original MDHU Trusts (Derriford at Plymouth, Frimley Park, and Peterborough) have been clinically highly successful, the financial and contract arrangements for these partnerships have, however, not been so successful.
<P>

<a name="90318w23.htm_para1">The principles of a new SLA were developed to form a revised contract from 1999-2000. Following detailed discussions with the NHS at local, regional and national levels during 1976 and 1998, contracts based on these principles are currently being negotiated locally, and will be in place for 1999-2000 at the three original MDHUs and at the new MDHU at Northallerton. The new contract model will also form the basis for all future MOD contract relationships with the NHS for hosting staff or 



<P>
<P><I>18 Mar 1999 : Column: 804</I><P>
providing treatment and will underpin a new era in understanding and clinical relationship between the MOD and the NHS.
<P>

<a name="90318w23.htm_para2">The financial arrangements for the new model will involve a Public Expenditure Survey (PES) transfer from the MOD to the Department of Health to compensate affected Health Authorities for the loss of free provision of MOD staff, and to enable the Defence Secondary Care Agency to negotiate directly with the relevant NHS Trust. The PES transfer will amount to some &#163;3.5 million a year. There will also be direct payments by the MOD to NHS Trusts for Service staff and the treatment of Service patients.
<P>

<a name="90318w23.htm_para3">Under the new arrangement, the financial cost and financial risk associated with the absence of military medical or nursing personnel falls on the MOD. In terms of treatment, the host Trust is expected to meet the throughput and waiting times targets set by the MOD, which are included in the contract with provision, as with any NHS purchaser, for appropriate financial adjustment if they are not met.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90318w23.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 10 March 1999]:</i> The Armed Forces' position on the employment of women is quite clear; service-women are excluded from posts only where their presence would be to the detriment of combat effectiveness or on the ground of health and safety.
<P>

<a name="90318w23.htm_para4">96 per cent. of posts in the RAF and 73 per cent. of posts in the Naval Service have been open to women for some time, but recently, as the result of a further review, 1,300 specialist posts, filled by Royal Navy and Army personnel attached to the Royal Marines, were opened to women. On 1 April 1998, the Army increased the posts open to women from 47 per cent. to 70 per cent. The remaining posts closed to women will remain closed until we can properly assess the impact on combat effectiveness of the recent changes; this work will be completed in two to three years.
<P>

<a name="90318w23.htm_para5">Following recent studies by the Royal Navy, I announced on 24 February 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, columns <i>300-01</i>, that women will remain excluded from service in submarines and mine clearance diving for the present time.

You may be interested to know that when The Met. Office was formed in 1854, as part of the Board of Trade to provide meteorological and sea-current information to mariners, it employed just 4 people. Today, our activities include global weather forecasts for defence and civil aviation; specialist services to commerce and industry (including the utilities); a wide range of public meteorological services, including severe weather warnings; and a substantial climate research and prediction programme.

 The Government's aim in enforcing the no-fly zones is to continue the essential humanitarian task of preventing Saddam Hussein from using his airforce to repress his own people. In undertaking this mission, we have made it clear that we will take robust but appropriate defensive measures in response to any attempts by Iraq to threaten our aircrew. Current military action is purely in self-defence, and taken in response to threats to the coalition.

 My right hon. Friend from time to time receives representations from hon. Members, the ex-service organisations and from individuals, on widow's and widower's pensions, including suggestions that the widows or widowers of post-retirement marriages to former members of the Armed Forces who left the Services before 6 April 1978 should be entitle to a Forces Family Pension. Widow's and widower's pensions will be examined as part of the review of the Armed Forces Pension Scheme, which is expected to report later this year. This will include a re-examination of the entitlement of such individuals, but I cannot yet predict the outcome. It would be a departure from normal practice to make retrospective improvements to the terms of pensions already in payment.

 As I have said before, a deployment to Kosovo would represent a challenging new commitment for the Army, especially as implementation of the Strategic Defence Review is still at an early stage. The consequences for overstretch would obviously depend on the size and duration of any deployment, and on what happens to other commitments in the meantime.

 I have laid before Parliament this morning the Food Labelling (Amendment) Regulations 1999, which will come into force tomorrow.

A proportion of this would have been derived from GM crops. However, in the absence of crop segregation and specific labelling requirements, it is not possible to know the precise amount. In addition, farmers will have fed material from home-produced crops which would not have contained any genetically modified materials.

<a name="90318w27.htm_wqn11"><B> Mr. Colvin: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (1) what research his Department has <i>(a)</i> commissioned and <i>(b)</i> evaluated into Horse Chestnut disease; [R] [75850]
<P>
<UL>(2) what publicity his Ministry has undertaken to ensure that the symptoms of Horse Chestnut disease can be recognised; and what estimate he has made of its prevalence in the United Kingdom; [R] [75832]
<P>
(3) what discussions he has had with ministers of European Union countries about the spread of Horse Chestnut disease; [R] [75833]
<P>
(4) what arrangements he has made for effective measures to be taken to combat Horse Chestnut disease. [R] [75834]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90318w27.htm_spnew11"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The horse chestnut leaf miner causes horse chestnut trees to lose their leaves; these symptoms are sometimes referred to as Horse Chestnut disease. The leaf miner has not been found in the United Kingdom; it prefers the warmer summers found in other parts of Europe.
<P>

<a name="90318w27.htm_para6">The Forestry Commission has studied the problem and evaluated the risks it poses to trees in the United Kingdom, drawing on experience and research in continental Europe. The Commission concluded that the risk of the leaf miner becoming established in the United Kingdom is very small, and that there is therefore no need for further research in the United Kingdom at present. We shall, of course, continue to monitor the spread of the leaf miner elsewhere in Europe, in association with other European countries.
<P>

<a name="90318w27.htm_para7">As the leaf miner is not present in the United Kingdom, we do not think that a publicity campaign to heighten awareness is necessary. We shall, however, continue to enforce our strict plant health regulations which should ensure that the leaf miner does not enter the country on imported plants or timber.
<P>

<a name="90318w27.htm_para8">Neither my right hon. Friend the Minister nor I have discussed the problem with fellow Ministers in the European Union. Our officials in the Forestry Commission are, however, keeping in close contact with their colleagues in other Governments and research institutes throughout Europe.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what representations Ministers in his Department have received on genetically modified organisms and the biotechnology industry from the US Government.  [72760]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90318w28.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Rooker </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 1 March 1999]:</i> Genetically modified organisms and the biotechnology industry have been raised on three occasions by representatives of the US Government since May 1997. This took place during meetings between my right hon. Friend the previous Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the US Ambassador to London on 26 November 1997; and between my right hon. Friend the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and (a) the US Trade Representative, Ambassador Barshefsky, on 23 October 1998 and (b) Mr. Dan Glickman, the US Agriculture Secretary, on 22 January 1999.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what are <i>(a)</i> the maximum permitted quota for English wine, <i>(b)</i> the current output of English vineyards and <i>(c)</i> the types of grapes which are allowed to be grown in England.  [76159]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90318w28.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 There is no quota for English wine. Because of the UK climate, vineyard output is variable: average production in England and Wales over the period 1993-97 was 16,344 hectolitres, while in 1997 (the last available year) it was 6,523 hectolitres. The vine varieties which may be used for table wine and quality wine in the UK are set out in the CAP (Wine) Regulations 1996, as amended.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food when he expects to publish his Department's revised Flood and Coastal Defence Project Appraisal Guidance Notes.  [76372]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90318w28.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 We plan to replace the Project Appraisal Guidance Notes with a series of six documents covering strategic planning and appraisal; economic appraisal; risk assessment; environmental appraisal; post project evaluation in addition to an introductory volume. The series will be published over the next eighteen months. The guidance on economic appraisal is nearing finalisation and publication is due by the summer.
<P>

<a name="90318w28.htm_wqn3"><B> Mr. Gummer: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food if he will list those who have been formally asked to comment on drafts of his Department's Flood and Coastal Defence Project Appraisal Guidance Notes; and if he will publish a list of consultees and their responses.  [76380]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90318w28.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Prior to embarking on a review of the Project Appraisal Guidance Notes operating authorities--the Environment Agency, local authorities and Internal Drainage Bodies--the Ministry's Flood and Coastal Defence Policy and Review Group consultants and contractors were consulted on their effectiveness and provided the opportunity to contribute to a revision. We concluded that the current Notes should be replaced with a series which would continue to elaborate Treasury

guidelines, but would update and present existing guidance in a single series. Preparation of these documents is being progressed under the guidance of specific steering groups with appropriate representation drawn from among operating authorities, English nature, and consultants.

 <i>[holding answer 16 March 1999]:</i> The Government are committed to a continuing expansion of areas under agreement under the major agri-environment schemes and are making an extra &#163;40 million available over the next three years for these schemes in England.

<a name="90318w28.htm_para1">Other measures include introducing stronger protection for internationally important wildlife sites from flooding and coastal erosion, persuading the European Commission to simplify the arrangements for voluntary set-aside to enable it to be of greater benefit for wildlife, encouraging the development of the flax protocol, and updating Codes of Practice for Pesticides and the Protection of Water, Soil and Air.

<P>
<a name="90318w28.htm_spnew7"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 16 March 1999]:</i> My Department has every confidence in the security of food supplies due to the diverse make-up of the sector which ranges from a myriad of small domestic companies through to a small number of large multinational companies. Each has its own important role to play in the market place.
