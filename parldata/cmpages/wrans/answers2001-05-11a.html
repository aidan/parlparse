<P>
<P>
<a name="10511w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Fearn: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what reports he has assessed of radioactivity ratings of silt and mud produced by sand winning plant screening processes on the north-west coast of England.  [157153]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10511w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The Environment Agency routinely monitors the coastline of north-west England for radionuclides and the results are published in its annual "Radioactivity in the Environment" report.
<P>

<a name="10511w01.html_para5">In addition, an ad hoc assessment programme was initiated at the end of 1998 to assess the radiation levels in the lagoons that receive the waste washings from the sand winning process at Southport. Samples of sediments were taken from the lagoons in 1998 and 1999 and analysed for radionuclides and the results were reported back to the Environment Agency. The reported levels for the two most significant radionuclides present in the sediment, caesium-137 and americium-241, were as follows:
<P>

<a name="10511w01.html_para6"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>caesium-137 ranged from 60.5 to 1510 Bq/kg with a mean value of 585 Bq/kg;

<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>americium-241 ranged from 19.7 to 394 Bq/kg with a mean value of 180 Bq/kg.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="10511w01.html_para8">The Environment Agency undertook an initial radiological assessment based on these levels. They used Generalised Derived Limits (GDLs) for marine sediments, published by NRPB as a yardstick. GDLs are levels of radioactivity which, using pessimistic exposure assumptions, would result in a dose of 1 milliSievert per year.
<P>

<a name="10511w01.html_para9">Using pessimistic exposure assumptions, and taking account of direct external exposure, inadvertent ingestion, and inhalation of re-suspended particulate (i.e. dried sand and mud being blown by the wind), these mean values would lead to a maximum dose of respectively 12 per cent. and 0.2 per cent. of the 1 milliSievert per year dose limit for the general public.
<P>

<a name="10511w01.html_para10">The radioactivity levels in the sediment were not considered high enough to warrant a full radiological risk assessment, and detailed assessment of the effects of ingestion/inhalation over time has not been carried out. These results are consistent with the Agency's routine coastal monitoring programme. I understand that no further monitoring of the lagoons has been undertaken.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if the United Kingdom has made a submission to Euratom, pursuant to <i>(a)</i> Article 34 and <i>(b)</i> Article 35 of the Euratom Treaty since the United Kingdom joined the European Community.  [158426]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10511w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 Under Article 34 of the Euratom Treaty, any member state in whose territories particularly dangerous experiments are to take place is required to take additional health and safety measures, and in advance to obtain the opinion on the European Commission. The assent of the Commission is required where the effects of such experiments are liable to affect the territories of other member states. No such submissions have been made by the United Kingdom.

<P>
<UL>(2) how much was spent by his Department in each of the last four years on removing litter and debris from the side of motorways and roads for which his Department is responsible.  [159196]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10511w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Prescott: </B> 
 Responsibility for removing litter and debris from the motorway network in England rests with the Highways Agency which employs a number of maintenance contractors to carry out the work. Because these contractors carry out this task together with other routine maintenance work, it is not possible to disaggregate the cost of litter collection from the total cost of maintenance.
<P>

<a name="10511w01.html_para12">The responsibility for litter collection on the all purpose trunk road network rests with district and borough councils and the information requested could be obtained only at disproportionate cost.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10511w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 The financial requirements of London Underground under the public-private partnership will not finally be known until negotiations with preferred bidders have been completed. The PPP is about obtaining best value in the way that farebox revenue and any public subsidy is spent. The Government have made it clear that, as long as it proves value for money to do so, then Transport for London will receive the appropriate level of central government grant to allow for London Underground's need to make payments to the PPP contractors.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10511w02.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The waste effluent in question has arisen from two sources, the Great Orton mass burial site in Cumbria and the Birkshaw mass burial site, near Lockerbie in Dumfriesshire. The waste effluent consists of the natural breakdown products which occur as the carcases decompose, primarily blood, fats, grease etc.
<P>

<a name="10511w02.html_para2">Both the mass disposal sites in question are operated on the "containment principle". As a result, it is an essential part of the site operation that effluents are removed from the disposal cells in order to prevent pollution of local surface and groundwaters, and to be treated at appropriate facilities.
<P>

<a name="10511w02.html_para3">In the case of the Great Orton waste effluent, it is removed from the disposal cells and is then treated on site by means of ph adjustment to ensure that no active foot and mouth virus remains before being sent to Workington Wastewater Treatment Works (WTW). Like abattoir waste, this effluent is a readily biodegradable material and as such ideal for treatment at the WTW facilities. On discharge to the WTW it receives a dilution equivalent to 1 in 400 with the sewage already at the works for treatment. At the point of the consented discharge from the WTW to the Irish Sea, via a long sea outfall, it is estimated that a further dilution rate of 1 in 10,000 occurs and a dilution rate of 1 in 100,000 upon reaching the 



<P>

<a name="10511w02.html_para10">The Environment Agency has made it clear to both MAFF, who operate the Great Orton site, and to United Utilities, who operate the Workington WTW, that the use of this works as a means of effluent disposal could only be considered as a short-term disposal option. In the medium to long term more sophisticated and robust treatment facilities must be developed on the Great Orton site in order to pre-treat the effluents and reduce their biological strength before they leave the site. This combined with the natural reduction in effluent strength as the rate of decomposition slows in the site will greatly increase the available range of off-site treatment options as an alternative to discharging to the Irish Sea.
<P>

<a name="10511w02.html_para11">Removal of effluent from Great Orton to Workington WTW began on 6 April 2001. As of the 9 May 2001, 8,900 cubic metres of effluent had been removed to Workington WTW.
<P>

<a name="10511w02.html_para12">Effluent from the Birkshaw mass burial site in Dumfriesshire is removed from the site for the same reasons as at Great Orton. It is also subject to the same virus control measures which ensures that no active virus leaves the site. In this case the effluent is taken to a licensed waste management facility near Workington, operated by ALCO Waste Management Ltd. The site is licensed to receive such wastes under the terms of its waste management licence conditions. The effluent is deposited into the landfill site where the natural biological processes taking place within the site begin the treatment of the effluent. All effluents from the site are then subject to further treatment, in the site's purpose built effluent treatment facility, before being discharged to foul sewer under and in accordance with the terms of a trade effluent consent issued by United Utilities.

<P>
<a name="10511w03.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Mackinlay: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what research has been carried out by the Health and Safety Executive into the long-term health effects and hazards presented by medium-density fibreboard; and if he will make a statement.  [161051]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10511w03.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 In 1997 the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) undertook a review of all available scientific evidence about the possible ill-health effects arising from exposure to medium-density fibreboard (MDF) dust.
<P>

<a name="10511w03.html_para0">HSE's review and research concluded that the health hazards associated with exposures arising from working with MDF are similar to those associated with working with natural wood (e.g. softwood and hardwood).
<P>

<a name="10511w03.html_para1">Under the Control of Substances Hazardous to Health (COSHH) Regulations 1999, there are duties on employers to control exposures to substances which may be hazardous to health. Under these regulations formaldehyde, hardwood dusts and softwood dusts (the usual constituent parts of MDF) are subject to maximum exposure limits (MELs). These are limits on the airborne concentrations of substances in the workplace, measured over specific reference time periods. There is a duty to control exposure to substances with a MEL to a level as low as is reasonably practicable, and in any case below the value of the MEL. This duty does not stop once the MEL level has been achieved but continues until all that is reasonably practicable has been done.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10511w03.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Mackinlay: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what information the Health and Safety Executive has collated from <i>(a)</i> European Union countries and <i>(b)</i> North America on (i) the rules governing the use of medium-density fibreboard and (ii) research undertaken into respiratory and other hazards presented by its use; and if he will make a statement.  [161052]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10511w03.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 In many European Union (EU) countries and the USA, the rules applying to use of medium-density fibreboard (MDF) at work are similar in principle to those applied in Great Britain. Adequate control of exposure through inhalation of dust or fume is assessed by compliance with occupational exposure limits for wood dust and formaldehyde. There is some variation in the scope of the limits (i.e. which types of wood are covered), the numerical values, and the detailed nature of the duties on employers associated with inhalation control.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions to what extent his Department has been able to make progress with its proposals to remove Crown exemption from statutory planning controls, currently contained in DETR circular 18/84, as envisaged in a letter from his Department to the Chairman of the Westminster Society of 4 May 2000, which envisaged action as soon as a suitable legislative opportunity arose.  [161107]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10511w03.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The Government remain committed to the removal of Crown exemption from planning controls as soon as a suitable opportunity arises to amend the Town and Country Planning Act 1990. In the meantime the non-statutory procedures for the consideration of objections to development proposed by the Crown, set out in DOE Circular 18-84, continue to apply.

<a name="10511w03.html_para3"><i>Letter from Richard Thorndike to Mr. Archie Norman, dated 11 May 2001:</i>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Secretary of State for the Environment Transport and the Regions has asked the Chief Executive, Tim Matthews to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question about spending on landscaping, horticulture and tree planting on motorway verges. I am replying in the absence of Tim Matthews.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Responsibility for landscaping, horticulture and tree planting on the motorway and trunk road network in England rests with the Highways Agency. Because of the way our records are kept, we cannot readily separate spending on the motorway network from spending on the trunk road network.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The table below therefore shows total spend recorded on all landscaping, horticulture and tree planting across the network. This includes significant expenditure associated with the environmental treatment of major new schemes, expenditure on the maintenance of existing landscaping and on schemes aimed at supporting the UK's biodiversity strategy, which aims to protect and encourage the diversity of plants and animals. This is in line with the Government policy to reduce the environmental impact of roads, which was one of the major aims of the 1998 Roads Review "A New Deal for Trunk Roads in England".</FONT></UL>
<P>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The A34 Newbury Bypass was completed in 1998/99, with its substantial environmental treatment contributing to the overall spend in that year.</FONT></UL>

 <i>[holding answer 23 April 2001]:</i> The Department uses available information to detect discrepancies in declared income.
<P>

<a name="10511w04.html_para0">When a claim is made for Income Support (IS) or Jobseekers' Allowance (JSA) claimants are required to provide evidence of any declared income, for example wage slips for earnings or payment slips for occupational pensions. Details on the pay slips are checked by Benefits Agency (BA) staff for deductions from pay, including the rate of income tax. Where the amount of tax deducted is disproportionate to the gross payment, or the tax code quoted seems inappropriate, further inquiries are made to establish if there is another source of taxable income being paid to the claimant.
<P>

<a name="10511w04.html_para1">Regular checks are made on continuing claims where there is a declared source of income to ensure that any changes have been reported. These checks confirm not only the net payment made to the claimant but the details of any deductions for tax and NI. Once again, this information can act as an indicator of other taxable income.
<P>

<a name="10511w04.html_para2">In addition to checks made on claims where there is a declared income, the Department work closely with Inland Revenue (IR) to detect those claimants in receipt of IS and JSA who fail to declare that they have commenced remunerative work. Tax form P46 is completed by employers for all new employees who are unable to provide a P45. IR is able to provide data to the Department of all P46 completions on a monthly basis.
<P>

<a name="10511w04.html_para3">The Department match the NINOs of all employees who appear in the P46 data with the NINOs of claimants who have a current claim to IS or JSA. Where the employment start date overlaps a benefit claim by more than four weeks, the case is referred to the Benefit Fraud Investigation Service (BFIS) for investigation.

<a name="10511w04.html_para4">The number of people who receive Disability Living Allowance continues to increase. Significant backlogs of work accrued in the processing of this benefit last year, because of the growing case load and introduction of a new system of decision making and appeals. The Benefits Agency tackled the backlog as a priority and it has now been substantially cleared. The continuing high level of appeals cleared outside of the target clearance time reflects in the numbers received following the introduction of the new procedures.

Analysis of the change in expenditure arising from legislation since May 1997 affecting social security benefits for pensioners and families has been made using administrative data and statistical models. The figures provided by the different analyses are not mutually exclusive, in that some of the changes in expenditure arising from legislative change will have applied to unemployed people and lone parents, notably the increases in child amounts in income-related benefits. Therefore, the change figures cannot be added together. The figures do not account for all the changes since 1991-92, nor do they cover all groups of recipients.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10511w05.html_spnew10"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 The draft directive would not affect products which are not classified as medicines.
<P>

<a name="10511w05.html_para11">In discussions with herbal interest groups, the Medicines Control Agency has reached a wide measure of consensus that the current regulatory arrangements which permit unlicensed herbal remedies under section 12(2) of the Medicines Act 1968 do not provide adequate safeguards for the public: there are no specific standards for the safety and quality of individual products under this regime, and there are inadequate arrangements for providing the public information about the use of the product.
<P>

<a name="10511w05.html_para12">Although work is still at a relatively early stage, we are encouraged by progress in Europe on developing a draft directive on traditional medicinal products. We expect that if negotiations are successful, this legislation would provide systematic regulatory arrangements for a wide range of traditional herbal remedies of the kind currently sold and supplied under section 12(2).
<P>

<a name="10511w05.html_para13">Any systematic updated regulatory regime for traditional herbal remedies is likely to place greater constraints on companies than is currently the case with the weak regulatory arrangements for unlicensed herbal remedies. A potential advantage for companies, however, is the greater confidence the public could have in the safety and reliability of these products.
<P>

<a name="10511w05.html_para14">We take the view that traditional herbal remedies properly classified as medicines should be appropriately regulated within a medicines regime. Standards should be consistent with those applying to other licensed medicines, including the many herbal medicines which have received a marketing authorisation under Directive 65/65/EEC. We also wish to ensure that relevant regulatory requirements developed for traditional medicines are in practice applied in a way that is appropriate to the nature of the specific product under consideration.
<P>

<a name="10511w05.html_para15">The current draft directive includes several features which would have the effect of containing the burden of regulatory requirements: for example, the possibility of a positive list of traditional medicines where in certain defined circumstances the safety of the product and the requirement to demonstrate traditional usage could both 



<P>
<P><I>11 May 2001 : Column: 395W</I><P>
be accepted as met without the applicant presenting evidence, and the possibility of simplified quality dossiers for defined categories of traditional medicines.
<P>

<a name="10511w05.html_para16">On product innovation, a key feature of the proposed directive is that the usual requirement for medicines to demonstrate efficacy would be replaced by a requirement to show evidence of traditional use. There will need to be continuing discussions about many aspects of the detailed contents of the directive. Our starting point, however, is that where companies are seeking to bring a new medicine, natural or otherwise, to the market the normal route should be through demonstration of the product's safety, quality and efficacy.

 Data published in the British Heart Journal in 1994 states that heart failure affects between 0.4 per cent. and 0.8 per cent. of the general population in the United Kingdom. However, the authors of that report estimated that the prevalence of heart failure is more likely to be in the region of 1.5 per cent., which suggests about two thirds of people with heart failure are undiagnosed.

 Our position on treatment of heart failure is set out in the National Service Framework for coronary heart disease. The NSF standard states that people with a confirmed diagnosis of heart failure should be offered treatments most likely to both relieve symptoms and reduce their risk of death. First line treatment should be with ACE inhibitors, which can be used in combination with beta-blockers.

 <i>[holding answer 8 May 2001]:</i> The independent Committee on Medical Aspects of Radiation in the Environment (COMARE), which advises Government on such matters had already recommended an investigation of the geographical distribution of childhood cancer and leukaemia in Great Britain and how the pattern of cases around nuclear installations compares with the national pattern. This study is nearing completion and my Department has asked COMARE to advise on which, if any, nuclear installations have incidences of childhood cancer and leukaemia in their vicinity which are statistically outside the distribution seen nationally. COMARE are hoping to report this year. In addition the health authority will examine any research sent to them around the Oldbury nuclear power station.

 In 1994-95 Professor Van Velzen undertook research into bowel strictures (fibrosing colonopathy) reported in children with cystic fibrosis, as one of several pathologists, paediatricians and epidemiologists. The study report, together with other information, led to warnings from the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) on the use of high-strength pancreatic enzymes. There have been no new confirmed cases of fibrosing colonopathy reported to the CSM since their advice was issued in 1995. The study to which Professors Van Velzen and Dodge contributed was published in The Lancet, and I refer my hon. Friend to correspondence on this issue published in The Lancet dated 12 May 2001.

Their aim is to tackle inequalities in health in the most deprived areas of the country through health and social care modernisation programmes. As well as tackling key priorities such as coronary heart disease, cancer and mental health, and issues such as teenage pregnancy and smoking cessation, they are addressing other interdependent and wider determinants of health, such as housing, education and employment, and linking with other initiatives. As part of their local involvement programmes, many HAZs run "Community Chest" schemes where they invite applications from the local community to bid for funds for specific local projects.

available, the final evaluation scores are not released. This is common practice in the wider evaluation industry and is consistently followed throughout the armed forces regardless of rank or Service. The evaluation system and its use are periodically scrutinised by independent consultants on behalf of the Office of Manpower Economics and the Armed Forces Pay Review Body.

 To date, few Officer posts have been evaluated using the current evaluation system. Priority has been given to evaluating non-commissioned personnel to underpin the introduction of the new pay system, Pay 2000. However, a comprehensive programme of Officer evaluation will begin this year and the first tranche of results will be provided to the Armed Forces Pay Review body in September. While copies of the full job descriptions generated by the evaluation process are made widely available, the final scores are not published. This is common practice within the wider evaluation industry.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10511w10.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 During the course of a discussion with a group of Royal Navy Senior Ratings at HMS Dryad on 28 February 2001, the Second Sea Lord explained that officers below one star rank (Commodore Royal Navy and Brigadier Royal Marines) have not yet been job evaluated. He stated that this was in part due to the career patterns of officers, which can complicate the evaluation process. In addition, the priority has been to complete sufficient job evaluation for non-commissioned personnel to support the introduction of the new pay system, Pay 2000. Prior to its adoption in 1997, the present Job Evaluation system was extensively tested over a wide variety of posts, including over 400 officer posts.
<P>

<a name="10511w10.html_para10">It was demonstrated to be a sufficiently robust system for evaluating jobs at all ranks, including officers. Most senior officer posts at two star rank and above have now been evaluated, and a comprehensive programme to evaluate the remaining officer ranks is about to begin. The aim is to complete the first tranche by September 2001 in accordance with the stated requirements of the Armed Forces Pay Review Body.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10511w10.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The Job Evaluation (JE) system used in the armed forces evaluates the post, not the individual postholder. In view of the numbers of posts involved, it is not possible to evaluate them individually. In practice, a representative sample of jobs is evaluated and the results applied to like jobs undertaken at the same rank. The single services are extensively involved in the evaluation process. In the Royal Navy, the Director of Naval Manning nominates the individuals whose posts will be evaluated. RN warrant officers conduct the corresponding interviews. A tri-service team of three evaluation judges at RN Captain rank and equivalent then score the jobs.




<P>
<P><I>11 May 2001 : Column: 414W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="10511w10.html_para11">It is not normal practice within the wider JE industry to release the results for individual posts. This is also the case in the armed forces, regardless of rank or service. Individual results are normally combined with others in the sample population to arrive at scores for a whole trade. On its own, therefore, the result for an individual post is open to misinterpretation. The process used to evaluate the jobs of service personnel is subject to periodic scrutiny by independent consultants acting on behalf of the Office of Manpower Economics and the Armed Forces Pay Review Body.

 In the Ministry of Defence, seven members of the senior civil service, about 2.5 per cent. of the total, have currently signed waivers to disapply the 48-hour limit on average weekly working time. It is Ministry of Defence policy to discourage long hours of working.

<a name="10511w11.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 Under the Proceeds of Crime Bill, for which the Government published draft clauses on 5 March (Cm 5066), a court in England or Wales which is considering whether to make a confiscation order against a convicted defendant who has a criminal lifestyle will be required to assume that any property held by the defendant at any time after conviction, and any property transferred to the defendant during the six years preceding the commencement of the criminal proceedings, was obtained by him as a result of criminal conduct; and that any expenditure incurred by him during the six year period was met from property obtained as a result of such conduct. The court will however be prohibited from making the assumption if it is shown to be incorrect or if making it would give rise to a serious risk of injustice.
<P>

<a name="10511w11.html_para7">A defendant will be considered to have a criminal lifestyle if convicted of drug trafficking, money laundering or any other of a list of offences to be specified in regulations; or if the offence constitutes conduct forming part of a course of criminal activity (this term is defined in draft clause 69); or if the offence was committed over a period of six months or more.
<P>

<a name="10511w11.html_para8">These provisions represent an extension of the circumstances in which such assumptions may be made under existing legislation.
<P>

<a name="10511w11.html_para9">The Bill will also empower the Director of the proposed new Criminal Assets Recovery Agency, which the Bill will create, to seek civil recovery in the High Court of property which has been obtained through unlawful conduct (Part V of the draft Bill). Civil recovery will apply to property obtained through conduct committed before the Bill comes into force. The Government are not minded to insert a limit on the period after the conduct during which property will be recoverable, but are considering this point carefully.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what procedures exist for members of the public to require police forces to disclose information held about them.  [161028]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10511w12.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The Data Protection Act 1998 (which amended the Data Protection Act 1984) governs procedures in respect of the disclosure of information. Members of the public may exercise their right under this Act by applying to the main police station nearest to where they last lived in this country to make a subject access inquiry. When the application form is completed, this should be sent back to the police together with any accompanying documents that are required and a &#163;10 fee for each category of information that they wish to access. The police are then under a legal requirement to respond to their inquiries within 40 days.
<P>

<a name="10511w12.html_para3">Currently, legislation relates to computer-based records only until the new Act takes effect from 24 October 2001 when structured manual files are also included. Applications to make a subject access request can be obtained from all major police stations or by contacting the relevant force's Data Protection Officer.

<P>
<a name="10511w13.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 There are no specific provisions covering harassment by covert filming. A course of conduct causing another person harassment, alarm or distress is an offence under the Protection from Harassment Act 1997. The Act also provides for a second offence of causing someone to fear on two or more occasions that violence will be used against them. The courts can impose on anyone convicted of either of these two offences a restraining order preventing further harassment or fear of violence. A breach of such an order is a serious matter, and attracts a maximum sentence of five years' imprisonment. The Act also provides for a civil order, a breach of which is a criminal offence.

<P>
<a name="10511w13.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The Prison Service has a duty of care but compulsory treatment may be provided only in certain circumstances. Generally, prisoners who are assessed to be of sound mind, who have no evidence of mental illness, and who fully understand the consequences of their actions, cannot be treated compulsorily and therefore 



<P>
<P><I>11 May 2001 : Column: 422W</I><P>
cannot usually be fed artificially against their will by prison authorities. In such situations, some prisoners may, in consultation with their legal advisers, make directives to the effect that they do not wish for medical intervention in the event of a deterioration in their well-being. However, even where advance directives have been made, all aspects of prisoners' conditions are reviewed, including mental capacity and well-being. They are reminded of the consequences of their actions should they wish to continue to refuse food.
<P>

<a name="10511w13.html_para0">The Prison Service issued detailed guidance to prison doctors, in January 1996, on the subject of food refusal, which discussed the question of mental capacity and the implications of advance directives.

 We announced in 1997 our intention that licences under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 will never be issued for programmes of work involving the use of Great Apes (chimpanzees, pygmy chimpanzees, gorillas and orang-utans) and that exceptional justification is required for the use of wild-caught primates.
<P>

<a name="10511w13.html_para3">In addition, the 1986 Act requires that non-human primates cannot be used unless no other species is suitable. Along with regulatory testing to help ensure the safety of medicines, non-human primates (mainly marmosets and macaques) are also used for other important areas of fundamental research. For example, they contribute to programmes of work relating to Parkinson's disease, visual impairment, stroke, diabetes, disorders of reproduction and vaccine development.
<P>

<a name="10511w13.html_para4">Table 2 of the Statistics of Scientific Procedures on Living Animals Great Britain 1999 records 418 non- human primates used in scientific procedures as coming from outside the European Union. The detailed information requested in relation to these animals is for the most part not held centrally by the Home Office and it is, therefore, not possible to provide all of the information required about them. However, Home Office records confirm that none of these 418 animals were wild caught.

 Costs of policing operational activities are matters for the police authorities and chief police officers concerned. Such costs are met from the budgets and reserves held by each authority. I have made no estimates of the costs incurred on the 1 May protests.

<a name="10511w13.html_para8">The additional cost of public order events in London is already partly reflected in a special payment for national and capital city functions which is added to the annual police grant for the Metropolitan Police Authority.

<P>

<a name="10511w13.html_para9">I am prepared to consider applications from forces for special grant towards extraordinary costs which may be incurred from time to time in exceptional circumstances. The normal criteria for grant are that the event could not reasonably have been anticipated and financial provision made; that the cost is a significant proportion of the force budget; and that having to meet the cost unaided would materially affect the efficiency of the force concerned.

The withdrawal of payable credits removed a distortion in the tax system which encouraged companies to pay out their profits as dividends, rather than retain them for reinvestment in the business. These and other measures help to improve investment performance. The effect of these changes on the size of UK pension funds varies depending upon many factors, such as the type of scheme; the take-up of private pensions; the level of future contributions and the investment policy adopted by fund managers.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10511w17.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 Liquid petroleum gas (LPG) has been available in the market for a long time and the technology involved is well developed. The Government have not viewed it as appropriate to carry out their own research programme into LPG.
<P>

<a name="10511w17.html_para2">Over the past five years, the DTI has provided support averaging some &#163;1 million per year for research on fuel cells, which could provide a major application for hydrogen in the medium term. The DTI is currently reviewing hydrogen research, and a report has been commissioned.
<P>

<a name="10511w17.html_para3">It is unclear what the hon. Member intends by his reference to research on the use of electricity as an alternative to fossil fuels, since of course electricity can be generated from both fossil fuels and other fuels such as renewable energy. My recent announcement of &#163;55.5 million funding for R&D on renewables over the next three years represents a substantial boost for renewables R&D, as part of the Government's &#163;260 million wide-ranging package of incentives for renewable energy.

 The new money announced in the 2000 Spending Review and the other new funding for renewable energy, comprising a total package in excess of &#163;250 million, relates to the three year period 2001-04.
<P>

<a name="10511w17.html_para4">The package includes &#163;89 million for capital grants for offshore wind, energy crops and biomass generation; &#163;55.5 million for an expanded DTI R&D programme; &#163;12 million from MAFF for their energy crops planting scheme; an initial &#163;10 million as the first phase of a market stimulation programme for photovoltaic roofs; &#163;3 million investment in a solar housing trial; and &#163;100 million to be allocated later in the year.
<P>

<a name="10511w17.html_para5">My Department is working in consultation with the wind energy industry on detailed arrangements for the new capital grants scheme for offshore wind energy projects.

<P>

<a name="10511w17.html_para6">The precise allocation of the &#163;100 million announced by the Prime Minister for different renewable technologies will be decided in the light of recommendations of the Cabinet Office's Performance and Innovation Unit later in the year. The Prime Minister indicated that this new money will help promote solar photovoltaics, give a boost to offshore wind, kick start energy crops and bring on stream other new generation technologies.
<P>

<a name="10511w17.html_para7">Decisions on the allocation of the DTI's increased R&D budget for renewable energy will be made in the light of consultation with industry and the universities. Of the &#163;18 million available for renewables R&D in the current financial year, some &#163;8 million has already been allocated to a range of renewable energy projects.

 The figures published in the DTI's March Expenditure Plans Report show DTI actual staff numbers of 9,640 in 1996-97 and an estimated figure of 10,324 for 2000-01 . This represents an increase of 684 staff (or 7 per cent.) over four years, principally reflecting caseload increases in demand-led activities:

 <i>[holding answer 9 May 2001]:</i> According to my Department's records, neither I nor my Ministers have attended meetings with Manpower to discuss the millennium dome. My right hon. Friend the Member for Hartlepool (Mr. Mandelson), the Minister without Portfolio, held one meeting with Manpower in April 1998. His successor as shareholder, Lord Falconer, met Manpower in June 1999 and January 2000. It was normal practice for the shareholder to be kept informed of progress on issues surrounding the Millennium Experience, including progress on the zones in which the sponsors had an interest.

 Through their commitment to public service broadcasting, the Government have helped to foster an environment in which a creative, commercially successful broadcasting industry provides a wide range of UK-made, high quality, original programmes catering for all viewers and listeners. We have ensured a secure funding base for the BBC, while giving them the freedom to develop commercial operations which complement and support their public service remit. We have made clear in the Communications White Paper that public service broadcasting will continue to have a key role to play in the digital future.
<P>

<a name="10511w19.html_para1">The Government have also introduced free television licences for people aged 75 or over from 1 November last year. Information on the number of beneficiaries by constituency is not available, but estimates based on the 1991 census indicate that there were approximately 5,200 people aged 75 or over living in the Glasgow, Pollok constituency.

<a name="10511w19.html_para2">According to the information supplied to us by the distributing bodies for the national lottery awards database, there have been 76 national lottery awards to Glasgow, Pollok, totalling &#163;2,268,974, since 2 May 1997. 38 millennium award winners have been identified from Glasgow, Pollok and between them they have received grants totalling &#163;107,947. There have been no specific awards to Glasgow, Pollok from the millennium festival, however, Glasgow as a whole did receive grants totalling &#163;546,000 for the New Year's Eve celebrations.

On 21 February, I announced the 16 areas in which it is hoped creative partnership pilots will be developed. The Black Country is one of these areas, including Walsall. The Arts Council of England, which is delivering the initiative, will be consulting schools and creative organisations in each location over the next few months to establish which bodies and schools will be involved. Details on how schools and cultural organisations can take part in creative partnerships will be available from the Arts Council shortly. Funding for the initiative will come on stream in April 2002.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport if English Heritage's Grant Aid Budget for privately-owned Grade I and II* listed buildings will remain unchanged in the current year; and what plans it has to alter the balance of funding between such buildings and those owned by English Heritage.  [161042]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10511w20.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Alan Howarth: </B> 
 English Heritage's (EH) Strategic Plan indicates that they currently plan to offer &#163;12.3 million in Grant Aid to privately owned Grade I and II* listed buildings in this financial year, and the same amount in each of the next two years ie 2002-03 and 2003-04 respectively.
<P>

<a name="10511w20.html_para0">The outbreak of Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) has had an adverse impact on revenue from EH's historic properties and sites that are open to the public. Consequently, all aspects of the organisation's 2001-02 budget are currently under review. It is too early to predict the full impact of FMD on EH and firm decisions about budget allocations have yet to be taken. It is for EH to decide on grant allocations within the resources available to them.

 A backlog of replies to right hon. and hon. Members' letters had accumulated due to a shortage of staff in the Visa Correspondence Unit. This has now been addressed. I assumed ministerial responsibility for entry clearance in October 1999. In that month 38 per cent. of letters received from hon. Members were replied to within 15 working days.

<P>
<a name="10511w21.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Vaz: </B> 
 If an applicant decides not to pursue a visit visa application after the preliminary assessment, the visa application form may be retained. If the applicant subsequently lodges a formal application, the interviewing entry clearance officer can consider any evidence relevant to the application when making a decision on the case. The information taken at the pre-assessment stage may be put to the applicant, who would be invited to explain any discrepancies that emerge.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10511w21.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Vaz: </B> 
 The pre-assessment is the procedure whereby an entry clearance officer can give advice to an applicant that their application is unlikely to succeed. The applicant does not have to accept this advice and can proceed with the application at any time. If an applicant therefore believes that his or her statements have been misunderstood during the preliminary assessment, he or she will be given the opportunity to make this clear during the formal visa interview.

<a name="10511w21.html_para1">Alongside the special exercise, it was felt that less emphasis should be placed upon the documents submitted with an application when making a decision on the case.

Applicants are offered the INF series of visa information leaflets, which clearly explain the Immigration Rules and how to make an application.

In the absence of a formal response from the Turkmen Foreign Minister, EU and US Ambassadors called on him again on 2 May to press him once more to release Mr. Atakov. The Foreign Minister maintained that as Mr. Atakov refused to ask the Turkmen Government for a pardon he could not be released except under a general amnesty. The Government will continue to press the Turkmen Government for Mr. Atakov's release.

The Government are already doing all they can to help and have raised these cases with relevant countries in the region and will continue to do so, pressing particularly for access to the hostages for the ICRC. We also support the ICRC's wish to have access to all those held by Israel in administrative detention.

 Since the signing of the Declaration of Principles on Interim Self-Government Arrangements ("Oslo 1") in 1993, both Israel and the Palestinians have consistently committed to pursuit of a just, lasting and comprehensive peace settlement in the middle east on the basis of non-violence. The key now is to look forward. We call on both parties to commit every possible energy to bring about an end to violence. We urge them to take immediate parallel steps to break the cycle of violence and build confidence, in the context of a renewed political re-engagement, aimed at an agreement based on United Nations Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338, the principle of "land for peace", security for Israel within recognised borders and an end of occupation.

<a name="10511w24.html_para0">From the outset, the Government put stringent disease control measures rapidly in place, based on the advice of the Chief Veterinary Officer. Movement restrictions were imposed within an 8 km zone as soon as the first case was reported on 19 February. All animal movements in a 10 km infected area were halted as soon as the first case was confirmed on 20 February. On 23 February, on the same day as the first case outside Essex was confirmed at Heddon-on-the-Wall, a nationwide prohibition on animal movements was imposed.

 All farmers are paid full market value as compensation for any animals slaughtered as a result of the foot and mouth outbreak.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10511w24.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 26 March 2001]:</i> The 1967 report investigated the time taken between suspected disease being reported, confirmation and slaughter, and found that in approximately 98 per cent. of cases slaughter was completed by the day following diagnosis. The report commented that veterinary inspectors had to consult MAFF Headquarters by telephone in order for disease to be confirmed, and suggested that diagnosis could instead by made by the veterinary inspector. However, the report also recognised that this procedure ensured that HQ was promptly informed of outbreaks and that it did not delay slaughter.
<P>

<a name="10511w24.html_para2">The Government accepted the recommendations made by the 1967 report at that time and incorporated them into legislation and standing instructions as appropriate.
<P>

<a name="10511w24.html_para3">In the current outbreak, as soon as notification of a suspected case is received by the Divisional Veterinary Manager Form A restrictions are placed on the premises which prohibit any animal, person or thing entering or leaving the premises without permission. A veterinary inspector is required to visit the premises and inspect any susceptible animals within two hours. If the vet believes that disease is present, HQ is contacted, disease is confirmed and all susceptible animals are slaughtered. If the vet is in any doubt as to whether disease is present, all susceptible animals are 'slaughtered on suspicion' and samples are taken for testing at the Institute of Animal Health. If the vet is satisfied that there are no clinical signs of foot and mouth disease or any reason to suspect that disease may be present, slaughter does not take place.

<a name="10511w24.html_para4">In the majority of suspected cases clinical diagnosis, rather than laboratory diagnosis, is made in order to speed up the process of confirming the disease.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10511w24.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 29 March 2001]:</i> An EU risk assessment analysing the costs and benefits of both a vaccination and slaughter policy was published in 1993. This concluded that a slaughter policy would cost less than a vaccination policy. It was therefore decided that EU policy should be to slaughter and dispose of affected animals, or those animals exposed to infection, and that this was the most effective way of controlling the disease.
<P>

<a name="10511w24.html_para5">The results of this cost-benefit analysis confirmed the results of a cost-benefit evaluation of alternative control policies for foot and mouth disease which was published in 1973 following the 1967 outbreak.

<a name="10511w24.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Nick Brown: </B> 
 On 21 September last year we were advised by the European Commission that the South African Authorities had declared 16 magisterial districts as controlled areas in the Kwa-Zulu-Natal Province and as a consequence the South African authorities were not issuing health certificates required for imports of meat into the EU. The Government were content with this situation at that time. However, it became clear from later reports to the Standing Veterinary Committee that the disease situation in South Africa was deteriorating. In view of this, on 5 January the Government issued a Declaration under Regulation 35 of the Products of Animal Origin (Import and Export) Regulations 1996, prohibiting meat imports from all of South Africa. A Customer Information Note explaining the situation was sent out on 8 January, as was a letter to all UK Border Inspection Posts. Similar action to the above was taken by Scotland and Northern Ireland shortly after the dates specified. After 21 September our records show that there were no imports of meat from South Africa into the UK.

<P>
<a name="10511w24.html_spnew9"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 EC rules only permit the importation of meat from a limited number of third countries where foot and mouth disease is present in circumstances where the veterinary authorities have contained the disease in specified regions. The meat must come from those regions of the relevant countries that are not considered to pose a risk to human or animal health. Fully matured boneless beef, which does not pose an FMD risk, may be imported from other regions subject to veterinary certification. Countries to which these controls currently apply are Botswana, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland, Zimbabwe, Argentina, Brazil, Colombia and Uruguay.
<P>

<a name="10511w24.html_para6">Domestic legislation in England and Wales currently prohibits the import of meat from South Africa and Swaziland (since 5 January 2001), Argentina (since 14 March) and Uruguay (since 26 April) and Brazil (10 May). Scotland and Northern Ireland took similar action for each of these countries shortly after each of the dates specified. All meat imported from third countries is subject to veterinary checks at Border Inspection Posts to ensure that import requirements are met.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10511w24.html_spnew10"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 We will continue to use all safe disposal methods available to us. At present the main options are burial or burning on farm, incineration in authorised incinerators, rendering, disposal in specially identified landfill or mass burial sites, or burning in mass burning sites. Commercial landfill sites are used primarily for the disposal of animals slaughtered under the Livestock Disposal (Welfare) Scheme.
<P>

<a name="10511w24.html_para7">In Worcestershire, there are no suitable incinerators or rendering facilities, so these are not options. Although the Waresley site in Worcestershire has been approved by the Environment Agency for carcase disposal, there are no plans at the present time to use this site.
<P>

<a name="10511w24.html_para8">There is a mass burial site currently being used, at Throckmorton airfield. There are currently no plans to use additional sites in Worcestershire.
<P>

<a name="10511w24.html_para9">With the help of the armed forces, we have been able to reduce significantly the time taken to dispose of carcases in the majority of cases. The statistics collected for Hereford and Worcester show that for animals slaughtered in this area in the week commencing 22 April, the average time taken to dispose of carcases was 28 hours.

[158306]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10511w24.html_spnew12"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answers 4 April and 23 May 2001]:</i> Contingency planning against foot and mouth disease operates at two levels. The GB contingency plan provides a general overview of our planned response to an outbreak. It was approved by Commission Decision 93/455/EEC on 23 July 1993 as being in compliance with the requirements of European Commission Decision 91/42/EEC. The revised version of the contingency plan submitted to the European Commission in July 2000 did not require formal approval by the European Commission.
<P>

<a name="10511w24.html_para10">No bodies outside my Department were consulted during this revision of the contingency plans. The update was a purely factual one to expand the section on publicity and disease awareness so that it covered the same ground as the Classical Swine Fever contingency plan. The State Veterinary Service Standing Instructions for foot and mouth disease set out the detailed procedures to be followed during an outbreak. It was not necessary for Ministers to approve the revision to the contingency plans last year.
<P>

<a name="10511w24.html_para11">As the outbreak of foot and mouth has progressed, Ministers have been involved in daily discussions with officials, other Government Departments and interested parties on the development and implementation of our disease control strategies.
<P>

<a name="10511w24.html_para12">A copy of the foot and mouth contingency plans for Great Britain will be placed in the Libraries of the House. The Standing Instructions of the State Veterinary Service are already available in the MAFF library. A copy of this document, which has had certain commercially confidential sections removed on legal advice, is being placed in the Libraries of the House.

<a name="10511w24.html_wqn13"><B> Dr. Cable: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what economic analysis his Department has conducted into <i>(a)</i> the costs and benefits to the UK economy and <i>(b)</i> the costs to public funds of (i) a cull to eradicate and (ii) a vaccination without eradication approach to foot and mouth disease; and if he will publish the analysis.  [157070]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10511w24.html_spnew13"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 5 April 2001]:</i> European Union rules on the control of foot and mouth disease were amended in 1990 when it was decided that eradication was preferable to vaccination. This decision was taken after consideration of a risk assessment to compare the costs and benefits of a vaccination and non-vaccination policy and on the assumption that disease outbreaks would be stamped out in both cases. This study concluded that the economic costs of a vaccination policy to the food chain would be substantially higher than the costs of a slaughter policy. This confirmed the conclusions of an earlier study carried out in the UK following the 1967 outbreak and published in the Journal of Agricultural Economics in 1973.

<P>
<a name="10511w24.html_spnew14"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 6 April 2001]:</i> We have modified the FMD longer distance movement scheme to remove the welfare test which normally needs to be satisfied before animals can be moved.

 <i>[holding answer 23 April 2001]:</i> The Ministry relied on the Northumberland Report when drawing up revised contingency plans after the 1967-68 outbreak. The Western Command Report was an internal Ministry of Defence Report. The GB contingency plan for dealing with outbreaks of Foot and Mouth Disease, in accordance with Article 5 of Council Directive 90/423/EEC, provides a general overview of our planned response to an outbreak.

 As in other parts of the country the epidemiology of the outbreaks in Worcester is complex and multifactoral. However, as elsewhere, introduction and subsequent dissemination relates to sheep movement and sheep husbandry practices.
<P>

<a name="10511w24.html_para25">Detailed epidemiological studies of individual cases are still being pursued with a view to ensuring that origin and spread is correctly identified.

[158249]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10511w24.html_spnew28"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 There are many different strains of foot and mouth disease (FMD) virus. The strain responsible for the current outbreak is a new strain to the UK of FMD virus, but is related to other strains belonging to the type O PanAsia group. Although the Institute for Animal Health, Pirbright, has carried out experiments with other viruses belonging to the type O PanAsia group, no work could be done on this new strain before the current outbreak, so nothing was known about the virulence or genetic characteristics. It was therefore not possible to make any assessment of the risk of this particular strain infecting the national herd and flock.

 A risk assessment analysing the costs and benefits of both a vaccination and slaughter policy was carried out by the EU and published in 1993.

 There are no restrictions on the movement of fodder in either the controlled area or infected areas unless the fodder is being moved from infected premises, when it can only be moved under licence.

 Live virus and viral antigen can be found in milk, blood, throat and faeces of infected animals. Specific antibody can be found in the blood and saliva of animals recovered from foot and mouth disease. Recovered sheep and cattle, and vaccinated sheep and cattle which have had contact with live foot and mouth disease virus continue to carry the virus in the pharyngeal region for up to three years in cattle and nine months in sheep; this virus can be recovered using a probang sampling technique which collects saliva and cellular material from the pharynx. Tests for foot and mouth disease virus antigen and antibody are outlined in the OIE Manual of Standards for Diagnostic Tests and Vaccines (2000). These are the tests used at the IAH laboratory in Pirbright. However, Pirbright scientists are constantly investigating new and more sensitive methods of diagnosis, such as polymerase chain reaction and the use of monoclonal antibodies.

 <i>[holding answer 23 April 2001]:</i> The whole of Great Britain was declared a controlled area on 23 February and since then livestock may be moved only under approved movement schemes and subject to licence. The conditions attached to these licences vary depending on the proximity of the movement to an infected place and the requirement of the particular scheme.
<P>

<a name="10511w24.html_para29">The tightest restrictions are in the infected areas drawn around infected premises. The boundary is at least 10 km from the infected premises but may extend in places to slightly more than this, e.g. where a geographical feature such as a river provides a natural barrier. Within the infected area, a protection zone is drawn at a radius of 3 km from the infected premises.

<P>
<a name="10511w24.html_spnew62"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 [holding answer 1 May 2001]: The Department of Health has recently published a risk assessment "Foot and Mouth--Effects on health of Emissions from Pyres Used for Disposal of Animals" available on www.doh.gov.uk. The risk assessment provides estimates of the release of dioxins and other air pollutants from pyres and predicted concentrations in air.
The Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions has undertaken monitoring of dioxins, furans and other air pollutants in the vicinity of some larger pyres, being used to dispose of animal carcases. Some local authorities have also instigated such monitoring. In addition the Environment Agency have assisted Government by monitoring and modelling air pollution in the vicinity of pyres.
An initial assessment by the Food Standards Agency suggests that the dioxins deposited onto farmland near pyres will lead to only a small increase to the current levels of dioxins in food.
The Food Standards Agency will measure dioxins in agricultural produce, grass and soil in the vicinity of pyres as part of a concerted programme of monitoring with the Environment Agency. The results will be used to inform decisions about the safety of livestock grazing pasture and the growing of other crops.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10511w24.html_spnew64"><B> Mr. Nick Brown </B> 
 [holding answer 3 May 2001]: Carcase disposal has been and continues to be defined for official statistical purposes by reference to the date on which disposal was completed. This is reflected in the statistical data published on the Ministry's website http://www.maff.gov.uk.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10511w24.html_wqn66"><B> Mr. Edwards: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what plans he has to make interim payments of compensation to farmers affected by foot and mouth disease.  [160702]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10511w24.html_spnew65"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 None.
All farmers are paid compensation for any animals slaughtered as a result of the foot and mouth outbreak. Stock is valued immediately prior to slaughter and the Ministry's target is to process and pay all compensation claims within three weeks of slaughter. The Ministry is putting in further resources to help meet this target. However, we are aware that in some areas, such as Cumbria where a particularly large number of claims have had to be made, this target is not being met. This is a problem that is currently being addressed and the Ministry is doing all it can to process all claims as quickly as possible. To make interim payments would add further delay.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10511w24.html_spnew66"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 The information requested is not readily available.
The Ministry's target is to process and pay all compensation claims within three weeks of slaughter. However, we are aware that in some areas, such as Cumbria where a particularly large number of claims have had to be made, this target is not being met. This is a problem that is being urgently addressed with extra resources and the Ministry is doing all it can to process all claims as quickly as possible.

<P>
<a name="10511w24.html_wqn68"><B> Mr. Jenkin: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what livestock has been slaughtered in North Essex constituency in the past seven days due to foot and mouth disease.  [160609]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10511w24.html_spnew67"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 [holding answer 9 May 2001]: There have been no livestock slaughtered in the North Essex constituency in the past seven days (1-7 May). Two infected premises were previously reported in this constituency (foot and mouth disease numbers 125 and 401). Animals from these sites were slaughtered and disposed of by 22 March. Slaughter of livestock on premises identified as a dangerous contact to foot and mouth disease 125 took place on 28 April, and disposal occurred on 30 April.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10511w24.html_wqn69"><B> Mr. Edwards: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food if he will make a statement about the proposed reduction in the rates payable to farmers under the welfare disposal scheme.  [160700]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10511w24.html_spnew68"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 Revised payments under the Livestock Welfare (Disposal) Scheme (LWDS) for those categories of animals intended for the human food chain took effect for all animals collected for slaughter or slaughtered on-farm from Monday 30 April. LWDS was introduced to provide a means of resolving serious animal welfare problems arising directly from the FMD movement restrictions. It was specifically not to be used as an alternative to the market, where the market was available. With the introduction from 23 April of scope to market animals from inside Infected Areas and, more recently, from inside protection zones, the route into the market has now been largely re-established. There was already considerable evidence that the original payment levels were encouraging farmers to use LWDS as their preferred alternative to the market. In light of the greatly increased opportunities some payment rates were reduced to between 70 per cent. and 80 per cent. of market prices. Payment rates for animals not intended to enter the food chain remain unchanged.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10511w24.html_spnew69"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 [holding answer 9 May 2001]: The total cost of acquiring the site, including costs and compensation was &#163;350,000. We are unable to give details of further costs at this time.

<P>
<a name="10511w24.html_wqn71"><B> Mr. Edwards: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food if he will meet the Minister for Rural Affairs in the National Assembly for Wales to discuss the operation of the Welfare Disposal Scheme in Monmouthshire.  [160701]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10511w24.html_spnew70"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 We meet regularly with Ministerial colleagues from the devolved Administrations to consider aspects of agricultural policy and their implementation.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10511w24.html_wqn72"><B> Mr. Opik: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food if the laboratory samples taken from stock at Eirianfa Farm, near Ardleen in Powys indicated <i>(a)</i> the existence of the foot and mouth virus or <i>(b)</i> an unreadable or other result; and if he will make a statement.  [160741]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10511w24.html_spnew71"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 The farm mentioned does not appear to be on the list of confirmed cases published on the Ministry's foot and mouth website. For reasons of data protection and confidentiality we only release information such as that requested by the hon. Member to organisations that require it for the purpose of safeguarding public health and for co-ordinating rural recovery programmes, unless the individual concerned has given written consent.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10511w24.html_wqn73"><B> Mr. Davidson: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food how much money has been paid in total to farmers in compensation for slaughtered livestock in the course of the foot and mouth outbreak to date; what the <i>(a)</i> average amount paid to each farmer and <i>(b)</i> largest payment to a single farmer has been; and if he will make a statement. [160904]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10511w24.html_spnew72"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 Up to 9 May, the compensation paid to farmers was &#163;116 million for 1,135 claims. The average claim was therefore &#163;102,000. The largest payment to a single farmer is &#163;4,238,800.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10511w24.html_wqn74"><B> Mr. Steen: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food when he will deal with the claim lodged by Mr. and Mrs. Rogers of the Corner Cottage, Ashprington, Devon for their 10 in-calf cattle under the Welfare Scheme; and if he will make a statement on the reason for the delay in dealing with this claim.  [160903]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10511w24.html_spnew73"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 It is not practicable or appropriate to comment on the position of individual cases. The Livestock Welfare (Disposal) Scheme has attracted a very high number of applications--apparently 1.6 million animals initially registered from 6,000 applicants. Every effort is being made to minimise delay in processing these, and we are giving priority to the most urgent welfare cases. Given full information on individual applications, the Intervention Board will be happy to provide details of progress.
To date over one million animals have been dealt with under the Livestock Welfare (Disposal) Scheme.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what criteria have been used in the appointment of valuers used in the valuation 



<P>
<P><I>11 May 2001 : Column: 484W</I><P>
of livestock to be culled as a result of <i>(a)</i> foot and mouth disease contact and <i>(b)</i> inclusion in the Livestock (Welfare) Disposal Scheme.  [160752]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10511w24.html_spnew74"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 [holding answer 10 May 2001]: Valuation of animals which are to be compulsorily slaughtered is carried out by a valuer appointed by the Ministry's local Divisional Veterinary Manager. In addition to existing contacts and nominations by farmers, DVMs may refer to lists of valuers for pedigree stock and commercial stock provided by the Central Association of Agricultural Valuers. No valuer is required if standard rates are used.

<P>
<a name="10511w24.html_spnew77"><B> Mr. Nick Brown: </B> 
 EU rules govern the production requirements of animal feed in the Community and also provide the conditions for import from third countries. With regard to FMD controls on imports from third countries which have had recent outbreaks, domestic legislation in England and Wales currently prohibits the import of meat from South Africa and Swaziland (since 5 January 2001), Argentina (since 14 March) and Uruguay (since 26 April) and Brazil (10 May). Scotland and Northern Ireland took similar action for each of these countries shortly after each of the dates specified. All meat imported from third countries is subject to veterinary checks at border inspection posts to ensure that import requirements are met. The UK will prohibit the import of any animal products which do not meet Community standards.

 EU law governs Community production of materials likely to be used in animal feedstuffs and sets down the import conditions, which must be met by third countries approved to export such products into the Community. EU law also provides for safeguard measures to be applied to imports of animal products and plants when there is a risk to human, animal or plant health. Under World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules animal health requirements for trade are expected to be based on the international standards laid down by the Office International des Epizooties. Any provisions in excess of these rules would need to be supported by a risk assessment in relation to animal or public health. Directorate General SANCO of the European Commission, who are based in Brussels, represent all EU member states, including Her Majesty's Government, in WTO fora.

 MAFF has received representations from both the general public and trade sources from time to time over the last three years on the importation of meat. In some cases this referred to "wild game" meat which we take to include bush meat although there is no working definition of the latter term. Where we were asked for advice, we provided information about the UK's import requirements for all kinds of meat. Where we have been advised of the possibility of illegal imports of meat, the relevant enforcement authorities have been advised and the appropriate action taken. Where illegal meat has been identified it is seized and destroyed.

 All meat and dairy products imported into the UK, whether from other EU member states or third countries, must have been produced in accordance with Community legislation, which lays down animal and public health conditions. Imports are accepted only from third countries and establishments, which meet those requirements and are approved to export into the Community. The list of countries and establishments allowed importing into the community and the products concerned are available on the Commission's website at the following address: http://forum.europa.eu.int/irc/ sanco/vets/info/data/listes/table0.html
<P>

<a name="10511w26.html_para0">These lists are quite long and are subject to change by the European Commission. Countries may also be listed but have no approved establishments in which case they cannot export into the Community.
<P>

<a name="10511w26.html_para1">Ensuring that member states comply with the obligations in properly implementing and applying the rules is the responsibility of the European Commission, whose Food and Veterinary Office carries out regular programmes of inspection visits to all member states. Responsibility for ensuring that third countries meet these four requirements lies with the Food and Veterinary Office of the European Commission. The UK will prohibit the importation of animal products that do not meet Community standards.

This responsibility extends to carrying out routine inspections of manifests and other sources of information in an effort to identify all animal products and ensure they are checked. On 5 April 2001 the Food Standards Agency in consultation with MAFF, issued guidance to Heads of Environmental Health Services and Chief Port Health Officers, copies of which I am placing in the Library.

 <i>[holding answer 5 April 2001]:</i> Between July 1998 and April 2001, the Minister and/or I attended 17 meetings of the EU Agriculture Council at which matters affecting he British livestock industry were discussed. In addition, the Minister has attended six informal meetings of the Agriculture Council and I have attended one. These are a forum for discussion on the future direction of EU agri-food policy, based on a Presidency paper. The dates of these meetings, both formal and informal, are set out at Annex A. The outcome of each Council is formally reported to the House.
<P>

<a name="10511w26.html_para2">The most significant set of proposals to date has been the Agenda 2000 proposals on reform of the Common Agricultural Policy. First discussed at the Agriculture Council in March 1998, these were refined and finalised in March 1999. The package included reductions to the

<P>
<a name="10511w26.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 10 May 2001]:</i> We have been able to allow movement to slaughter under licence so that the risk of the spread of foot and mouth disease is reduced as far as possible. This has enabled the meat trade to resume operations but no estimate of the value of this to the Lancashire meat trade has been made.

<P>
<P>

 The temporary veterinary inspectors appointed to assist with foot and mouth disease work are paid a flat rate of &#163;250 per day. The total number of veterinary surgeons who have been engaged by MAFF to deal with foot and mouth disease since the outbreak began is 1971. The average number of hours spent by vets specifically employed on foot and mouth is not available centrally.

 Published Ministry estimates of total consumer savings from the Agenda 2000 reforms measure the benefits for the year 2008, when the reforms will be fully implemented, against the forecast position in that year had no reform taken place. No estimate has been produced on a comparable basis of the savings that consumers would make in 2008 if all price supports for all commodities were removed.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10511w27.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 MAFF does not hold statistical information on a constituency basis relating to the Department's policies. As many of the Department's policies flow from measures agreed within the framework of the EU common agricultural policy, statistical data are normally available on a UK or Scotland basis.
<P>

<a name="10511w27.html_para0">Farmers in the UK receive approximately &#163;3 billion per year in direct CAP payments. This does not include the significant additional costs to consumers as a result of CAP price supports which keep EU prices above prevailing world prices.
<P>

<a name="10511w27.html_para1">Consumers in Glasgow, Pollok will benefit from the Agenda 2000 reforms of the CAP in the form of reduced food bills, with the average saving for a typical family rising to &#163;65 a year by 2010.
<P>

<a name="10511w27.html_para2">The Government are committed to securing a more economically rational CAP. This will benefit both consumers and taxpayers in Glasgow, Pollok. We aim to redirect public money from agricultural price support mechanisms to rural development measures of benefit to the wider rural community and visitors to the countryside.
<P>

<a name="10511w27.html_para3">One of the most important outcomes of Agenda 2000 was the establishment of the rural development regulation. As agriculture is a devolved matter this is being implemented in Scotland by the Scottish Executive through the Scottish rural development programme

(SRDP). Over the lifetime of the programme, around &#163;685 million is being invested in agri-environment measures, forestry and the new less favoured areas support scheme. In addition, around &#163;100 million will be spent in Scotland on measures including the processing and marketing scheme and the agricultural business development scheme.

<P>
<a name="10511w27.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 As my right hon. Friend the Minister said in his statements of 27 March and 3 May, MAFF is co-ordinating action across Government to ensure that rules on both commercial and personal imports at ports and airports are enforced effectively. In addition, he has also asked the European Commission to give urgent attention to ensuring that the law on personal imports is clear and robust to enable consistent and effective controls across all the Community's borders. No assessment of the annual tonnage of illegal meat smuggled through British ports is available.

<a name="10511w27.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 We recognise that current systems of broiler chicken production raise a number of animal welfare issues on which more scientific knowledge is needed.

[160896]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10511w27.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 We are currently considering, together with FAWC and the industry, the best way to take forward the issues they have identified on broiler chicken leg health, including the need for an independent survey. Completion of this work has been disrupted by activity on foot and mouth disease. The state veterinary service's programme of animal welfare farm inspections has been similarly disrupted.

<P>
<a name="10511w27.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 In England, the welfare of broiler breeding chickens is regulated by the Welfare of Farmed Animals (England) Regulations 2000. Separate regulations apply in the devolved Administrations.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10511w27.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 The Ministry has issued advice to local authorities on the Foot and Mouth Disease (Amendment) (England) Order 2001 and the Foot and Mouth (Amendment) (No. 2) Order 2001. These regulations allow local authorities to prohibit the movement of members of the public on to any land where there may be animals and on to any footpath or right of way within identified areas in their districts, for the purpose of preventing the spread of foot and mouth disease.
<P>

<a name="10511w27.html_para5">The Dartmoor national park is within an infected area, as defined by my Department. Infected areas are revoked only when it is considered that there is no risk of further outbreaks of foot and mouth disease and surveillance has confirmed that the area is free of disease.
<P>

<a name="10511w27.html_para6">We are working with the local authority and the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions to ensure that the Dartmoor national park is opened to the public as soon as it is safe to do so.

 The indications are that such attacks are attributable to each of the main Loyalist paramilitary groupings, their associates or sympathisers. Unfortunately, these attacks have occurred throughout the Province but primarily occur within the major conurbations. It is not possible to be definite about the numbers attached to each grouping.

<a name="10511w29.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. McNamara: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland how many of the groups identified as meeting the 1999 NCIS definition of organised crime comprise <i>(a)</i> fewer than 10 members, <i>(b)</i> 10 to 25 members, <i>(c)</i> 25 to 100 members and <i>(d)</i> more than 100 members; how many groups in each size band have their origins or initial association in a local unit of (i) Republican, (ii) Loyalist and (iii) other paramilitary organisations; and how many groups in each size band are focused around criminal activity within a local or district territory.  [158787]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10511w29.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The information cannot be made available in the form requested. However, I can state that 78 groups involving some 400 individuals have been identified as meeting the 1999 NCIS definition of organised crime. Of these 78 groups, no one group exceeds 25 members. Just over half of the groups identified have current or historical links to Republican or Loyalist paramilitary organisations. The vast majority of the groups identified are focused around criminal activity within a local or district territory.

<P>
<a name="10511w29.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The Royal Ulster Constabulary, encouraged and supported by the Government, has taken a number of strategic and tactical steps to address the occurrence of crime across the Province.
<P>

<a name="10511w29.html_para1">The recent restructuring of the RUC and the establishment of District Command Units has devolved greater autonomy to local commanders in the use of their resources to tackle 'volume crimes' such as burglary, assaults and criminal damage. They are supported in their efforts by the introduction of the National Intelligence Model throughout the Province. The on-going training and provision of police analysts to highlight problem crimes and problem areas will further assist the maximum effective use of resources through 'directed patrolling'. This information led approach is underpinned by the RUC's community policing model which will ensure that local officers and local partnerships work together in 'sectors' to more readily address local crimes and anti-social behaviour.
<P>

<a name="10511w29.html_para2">At a strategic level the Royal Ulster Constabulary and its partner agencies, including the Government, are working within the Organised Crime Task Force in furtherance of the drive against organised criminal gangs. The Government remain committed to ensuring that law enforcement agencies and other partners within the criminal justice system have the necessary legislative powers to be fully effective against criminals at all levels. The Criminal Justice Review has been completed and work is continuing on the Criminal Justice Bill and implementation plan.

serving; how many days he has served in solitary confinement; and if he will make a statement on the circumstances of his punishment.  [159563]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10511w29.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Charles Conlon's criminal record currently runs to 16 pages and spans a period of 22 years. It includes convictions for 12 counts of criminal damage, 18 counts of burglary, theft, five counts of riotous/ disorderly behaviour, 12 counts of common assault, 17 road traffic offences, 25 assaults on police, three counts of deception, 15 serious assaults, four robberies, two counts of possessing an offensive weapon, eight counts of obstructing police and two incidents of arson. Charges in relation to an incident in which he bit a prison officer twice are currently being investigated by the police.
<P>

<a name="10511w29.html_para4">His most recent conviction was on 16 January 2001 when he received two six-month sentences for assaulting two prison officers. These sentences were to be served consecutively to a two and half year sentence, imposed on 14 October 1999, for threats to kill, assaults on police, perjury and assault. His current earliest date of release (EDR) is 29 July 2001.
<P>

<a name="10511w29.html_para5">Mr. Conlon has an unenviable record of poor behaviour during his present period of imprisonment. He has been charged and adjudicated upon for offences against prison discipline on 70 separate occasions. He has a propensity for, and history of, serious assaults on prison staff and other prisoners. He has been held in the Punishment and Segregation Unit (PSU) at HMP Maghaberry since 21 November 1999, under Rule 32 of The Prison and Young Offenders (NI) Rules 1995. This is to restrict his association for the maintenance of good order and discipline within the prison. Recent efforts to reintegrate Mr. Conlon into the ordinary prison population have been unsuccessful.
<P>

<a name="10511w29.html_para6">Judgment on a Judicial Review hearing earlier this year to examine Mr. Conlon's conditions of imprisonment has been reserved.
