Primarolo</b><i> [holding answer 1 November 2006]:</i> The
increase in the tax credits income disregard is part of a package of
measures announced in the 2005 Pre-Budget Report. The Government have
always been more confident about the overall cost of the PBR package
which is based on the total level of overpayments. The estimates were
based on data from the first year of the system and provisional
information from the second
year.</p><p><a name="stpa_469"><a name="61107w0016.htm_para6"><a name="06110850002720">The Exchequer
effect of the changes to the tax credit system depend crucially on the
source of overpayments. At that stage there was only limited
information available on the sources of overpayments as HMRC only had
complete data on 2003-04 overpayments, which were not representative of
the system in steady state. This difficulty in accessing good quality
data in the past made costing the individual elements of the package
difficult.</p><p><a name="stpa_470"><a name="61107w0016.htm_para7"><a name="06110850002721">However
following publication of the 2004-05 overpayment statistics in May
2006, HMRC now has two years of overpayment statistics to inform this
costing. And crucially, unlike in 2003-04, awards in 2004-05 were based
on the previous years income making them much more representative of
future years awards. In addition the first stage of the finalisation
process for 2005-06 was completed in August 2006, adding to this body
of knowledge. This additional information has not led the Government to
change the costing of the disregard&#151;or the package as a
whole&#151;however it has allowed it to feel more confident in the
costing of the individual elements of the

needs to carefully distinguish between the change in claimants&#146;
entitlement from the change in the disregard and the cost to the
Exchequer. The cost of the disregard is not the change in entitlement,
but the forgone recovery of overpayments. The basic principle is that
when money is paid out to tax credit claimants, it scores as a cost to
the Exchequer. On the other hand, when any overpaid tax credits are
recovered, there is a yield. The higher disregard does not necessarily
affect the amount of money paid out to claimants in any one year. But
by reducing the amount of overpayments, the higher disregard will mean
there is less money to be recovered in future years. Hence the profile
of costs shown
above.</p><a name="qn_185"><a name="61107w0016.htm_wqn13"><p><a name="06110850002736"><b><a name="61107w0016.htm_spnew26"><a name="06110850003271">Mr.

Merron:</b> The Education Act 1996 places a duty on local
education authorities (LEAs) to make arrangements for transport where
it is necessary to ensure a child&#146;s attendance at school. LEAs
have wide discretion in deciding whether transport is necessary, but
case law requires them to provide free home to school transport for
pupils of compulsory school age who are attending their nearest
suitable school, provided that the school is beyond &#145;statutory
walking distance&#146;. In addition, many LEAs use their
discretionary powers to provide transport to school in circumstances
where they are under no legal obligation to do so. The law requires
LEAs to publish their transport policies covering support provided
under their statutory duties and discretionary powers.</p><p><a name="stpa_521"><a name="61107w0020.htm_para0"><a name="06110862000391">Where LEAs make arrangements
using their discretionary powers, they are free to consult on and
change those policies. While there is no legislation governing the
conduct of such consultations, good practice suggests that
consultations should involve all interested parties, with consultations
taking place during term time. Guidance issued by the Department of
Education and Skills states that good practice suggests that any
changes should be brought in at the end of the school year, and that
they should be phased in as pupils change or leave
schools.</p><p><a name="stpa_522"><a name="61107w0020.htm_para1"><a name="06110862000392">The position
is however different if a school bus service is a local service
receiving a subsidy from the local transport authority. The Transport
Act 1985 requires local transport authorities, when considering
policies on subsidised bus services, to consult other authorities who
may be affected by those policies and bus operators in their area.
There are no specific requirements as to how they should do
this.</p><p><a name="stpa_523"><a name="61107w0020.htm_para2"><a name="06110862000393">In developing
their bus strategies and accessibility strategies, local authorities
also need to consider the passenger transport needs in their areas and
consultation with various stakeholders can play a part in
this.</p><br>

from the Food Standards Agency that operators of abattoirs pay charges
for meat hygiene official controls either on the basis of standard
European Community fees for animal throughput, or on the basis of the
cost of the controls if this would provide a lower charge. In 2005-06,
about 95 per cent. of operators of abattoirs paid charges for hygiene
controls based on European Community fees for animal throughput. These
fees have not been increased since they were introduced in
2001.</p><p><a name="stpa_578"><a name="61107w0025.htm_para1"><a name="06110862001446">The other 5 per
cent. of abattoir operators, mainly of the largest abattoirs, pay
charges based on the cost of the meat hygiene official controls that
are carried out. These charges include an element for veterinary costs
in addition to the costs of other classes of official control staff and
overheads. The veterinary cost element of the charge in Great Britain
comprises the cost of veterinarians employed by the Meat Hygiene
Service (MHS) or the cost of veterinary services provided under
contracts that are let competitively by the MHS and are individual to
each abattoir. The veterinary cost element of meat hygiene charges for
services provided by veterinarians employed by the MHS increased by
approximately 24 per cent. from 2002-03 to 2006-07. The change in the
average cost of contract veterinarians in the last five years could not
be obtained without disproportionate

outset of the programme, 91 per cent. of expectant parents said they
intended to use disposable nappies. Work done for the Environment
Agency suggested the figure may be higher at 94 per cent. WRAP intends
to survey parents again at the end of the programme and to establish
the change in intended behaviour. An estimate of the diversion will be
made and published by WRAP at that time taking account of the survey

Credit Act 1974 regulate extortionate credit bargains. These ensure
that where bargains are extortionate, the courts may reopen the credit
agreement and set aside the whole or part of any obligation on the
debtor, require the creditor to repay the whole or part of the sums
paid, to return surety or alter the terms of the agreement. These
provisions will be replaced by a test of whether a credit relationship
is unfair when the Consumer Credit Act 2006 comes into force. This will
enable the courts to take into account all the circumstances of the
relationship between the borrower and lender, not just the terms of the
agreement when it was made. The new Act will also strengthen the test
of fitness to hold a consumer credit licence and provide the Office of
Fair Trading with greater powers to take action against lenders who do
not behave in a fit and proper
manner.</p><p><a name="stpa_600"><a name="61107w0026.htm_para12"><a name="06110872000194">In addition,

1. Deciles shown here represent groups of the child population in Great
Britain. The lowest decile group is the 10 per cent. of the population
with the lowest household incomes. The second decile group contains
children whose household incomes are above the lowest decile point but
below the second decile point. Successive deciles follow
similarly.  2. The percentages by decile are based on the
equivalised incomes of households with children. Equivalisation is the
process by which the household income is adjusted for size and
composition as a proxy for material living standards.  3. All
estimates are subject to sampling error and response bias and small
changes between years may be influenced by these.  4.
Percentages may not sum to 100 per cent. across a year, due to
rounding.  <i> Source:</i>  Family Resources

begin by explaining that mortgage interest relief benefit is not a
stand-alone benefit, but forms part of a customer&#146;s entitlement
to Income Support (IS). In cases where a customer&#146;s mortgage was
taken out after October 1995, they would not ordinarily qualify for
assistance with their mortgage interest payments for the first 39 weeks
of their claim.</p></ul><a name="61107w0034.htm_brev4"><a name="06110874001486"><ul><p class="tabletext">Mr
Thompson claimed IS on 24 May 2006. When his claim was assessed we
decided that he was not entitled to IS at this time as without his
mortgage interest payments being taken into account his household
income exceeded his IS
entitlement.</p></ul><a name="61107w0034.htm_brev5"><a name="06110874001487"><ul><p class="tabletext">Following
your enquiry we reviewed Mr Thompson&#146;s claim and found that we
had overlooked the fact that he had a current claim for Incapacity
Benefit dating from 8 May 2005 for which he was receiving National
Insurance credits. The effect of this claim was that his mortgage
interest payments should have been taken into account from the start of
the claim to IS he made on 24 May 2006. I have asked for Mr
Thompson&#146;s entitlement to be reviewed to establish if he now
qualifies for IS or mortgage interest relief from this date, and I am
sorry for any inconvenience or distress Mr Thompson has been
caused.</p></ul><a name="61107w0034.htm_brev6"><a name="06110874001488"><ul><p class="tabletext">When Mr

consider backdating this to 9 May 2005. We wrote to Mr Thompson on 27
July 2006 requesting further information to enable us to consider this
request. However, we did not receive the information requested. We
therefore asked him again to supply this information on 1 November.
When we receive the necessary information we will consider Mr

2006]:</i> The Child Protection Database, maintained by the
Commission for Social Care Inspection, provides the following data on
the numbers of confirmed Serious Case Reviews (SCRs), following the
death of a child, in each local authority since 2000. Accurate data
prior to 2000 are not available. We do not hold information on dates of
publication. The following table includes only those authorities where
a child death has led to a confirmed SCR and provides an overall total
for between 2000-05. SCRs were commissioned by Area Child Protection
Committees (ACPCs) throughout the period covered by the table. ACPCs
were nearly all based on local authority boundaries but there were a
few areas in England where an ACPC covered two or more local
authorities with social services functions. In order to maintain the
confidentiality of individual children who were the subject of a SCR, x
denotes fewer than three SCRs. The data for 2006 is not yet
complete.</p><table border="1"><tr valign="top"><td class="tabletext"><i> Responsible

recommendations of this report was set out in an action plan which
included the setting of ill-health retirement targets for participating
Departments. These targets required Principal Civil Service Pension
Scheme (PCSPS) employers to reduce ill-health retirement rates, by
2005, to no more than 3.72 per 1,000 staff; a higher rate of 4.84 per
1,000 staff was set for the Prison Services. Active management by
employers resulted in the target being met and, for the year to Friday
31 March 2006, the overall ill-health retirement rate for employers
generally was 1.76 per 1,000 staff and the rate for the Prison Services
was 3.40 per 1,000
