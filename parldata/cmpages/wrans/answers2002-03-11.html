<a name="20311w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Menzies Campbell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence on how many occasions <i>(a)</i> coalition aircraft and <i>(b)</i> UK aircraft patrolling the southern no-fly zone in Iraq have (i) detected violations of the no-fly zones, (ii) detected a direct threat to a coalition aircraft and (iii) released ordnance in (1) January and (2) February, stating for each month the tonnage of ordnance released; what has been (A) the nature of the violation detected, (B) the nature of the threat detected and (C) the category of target attacked in percentage terms; and if he will make a statement.  [38414]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20311w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The information is:
<P>

<a name="20311w01.html_para0">(i) No-fly-zone (NFZ) violations are detected in several ways, though rarely (if ever) by tactical aircraft. For reasons of operational security we do not release details of detection methods. No violations of the southern NFZ were detected in January or February.
<P>

<a name="20311w01.html_para1">(ii) In January and February, coalition aircraft recorded threats on a total of 11 occasions, as follows:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>January&#151;8
<P>
<BR>
February&#151;3.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="20311w01.html_para2">10 of the recorded threats were attacks by anti-aircraft artillery. The remaining one was an attack by other weapons.
<P>

<a name="20311w01.html_para3">(iii) Coalition aircraft in the southern NFZ released 9 tons of ordnance in January, and none in February.
<P>

<a name="20311w01.html_para4">100 per cent. of ordnance released was in self-defence responses by coalition aircraft against military targets in the Iraqi Integrated Air Defence System.

<P>
<a name="20311w01.html_spnew2"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 As my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence announced to the House on 10 July 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 676&#150;85, the timing of the contract was dependent upon the completion of satisfactory negotiations between the Ministry of Defence and the prime contractor, BAE Systems Electronics, and between the prime contractor, BAE Systems Marine and Vosper Thornycroft.
<P>

<a name="20311w01.html_para5">While it was originally planned that by September 2001 the parties would enter into a legally binding agreement, intensive work on the programme has clarified the timescales in which the shipbuilders had to make their investment decisions to maintain the T45 programme. The commitment, as announced by the Minister for Defence Procurement on 18 February 2002, has been made in time to allow the shipbuilders to make their investment decisions and participate in the programme as planned.
<P>

<a name="20311w01.html_para6">It should be emphasised that both shipbuilders have been working hard in the Type 45 programme under the prime contractor for around two years. The ship design, which is rapidly maturing, has been unaffected by the negotiations between the prime contractor and shipbuilders over the build contracts.
<P>

<a name="20311w01.html_para7">There are no additional costs due to the later than anticipated contract signing and we remain fully committed to achieving our scheduled in service date for the First-of-Class of 2007.

The purpose of this experiment was to help us to ensure that UK nuclear weapons remain safe and reliable.

There are typically in excess of 1,000 capital projects and sub-projects under way in the Ministry of Defence at any given moment. It is not possible to attribute the sum transferred to individual projects, the spend profiles of almost all of which will have changed since the expenditure limits were set for the current year.

 We have received several representations from hon. Members and industry. The Government have a close interest in the success of the aerospace industry, with whom we maintain regular dialogue. We have examined ways in which it may be possible to bring orders forward, and we are always happy to discuss any specific proposals. At this time we have not identified any orders which could be brought forward within our available resources and industrial capacity but the UK aerospace industry already benefits from a large programme of work on Ministry of Defence projects including JSF, Eurofighter, A400M, Nimrod, and Apache.

 No. Where Ministry of Defence civil servants are required to travel on official business they are expected to do so in the most effective and economic way. When journeys are made by rail then the class is determined by reference to the individual's grade. There are no plans to change the current entitlements, which form part of the terms of employment and cannot unilaterally be altered.

<P>
<a name="20311w02.html_spnew3"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The contract to remanufacture Tomahawk missiles is between the United States Department of Defense and Raytheon, which is the only manufacturer of this equipment. The Ministry of Defence requirement has been added to the US purchase under a Foreign Military Sales agreement with the US DoD. The performance of the remanufactured missiles will match that of the Tomahawk Block IIIC missiles already in service with the Royal Navy.

 14 Apache attack helicopters have been accepted into service by the Army. A further three aircraft are engaged in trial work. The balance of 50 aircraft have yet to be delivered.

 The UK Apache helicopter will be armed with a combination of Hellfire Missiles, CRV7 rockets and a 30mm gun. The aircraft is being acquired through a combined development and production contract for the aircraft, support equipment and spares. As such, the contract does not specify a unit price. However, for internal resources accounting purposes, we have estimated the attribution of the contract price and this gives a value of some &#163;27.5 million per aircraft. This estimate is based on necessarily subjective assessments and should not be regarded as an accurate replacement cost for the aircraft.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20311w02.html_spnew9"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The Ministry of Defence's policies on the payment to its civil servants of relocation expenses follow the general principles set out in the Civil Service Management Code and are detailed in the MOD Civilian Transfer Manual.
<P>

<a name="20311w02.html_para2">Staff who are transferred in the public interest are entitled to a range of financial assistance to enable them to take up their new duties. Depending upon the circumstances, the individual may be entitled to support for a move of home or, where a move of home is not justified, assistance with additional commuting costs.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence, pursuant to his answer of 28 February 2002, ref. 38529, on the Snagge report, for what reason he will not publish Colonel Snagge's report "The Command Structure in the United Kingdom"; and if he will discuss this with the Open Government Task Force.  [40971]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20311w02.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The "Snagge Report" was an unsolicited piece of work by the Chief of Staff of the Division then based in York. It argued for keeping the headquarters of 2 Division in York and, as such, provided a very one- sided opinion. It did not represent a balanced Army view, and its publication would be highly misleading. For these reasons, I decided not to release it.

 <i>[holding answer 14 February 2002]:</i> A budget to meet basic running costs needs&#151;excluding fixed accommodation costs&#151;is allocated to each CPS area. Its use is not prescribed. Areas are empowered to apportion it between staffing and any other costs in accordance with their judgment of local circumstances. Thus staffing mix can vary from area to area, depending on the local judgments made in each area.

<P>

<a name="20311w05.html_para8">The CPS does not keep historical data on the number of vacancies within the Department. Areas decide the numbers and mix of staff against the budget available to them, rather than against an overall complement figure.

 Since May 1997 the Department has used only one company and has a contract with only one company for relocating civil servants, Cendant Relocation Services (previously known as Bradford and Bingley Relocation Services and Black Horse Relocation Services). The contract was let in November 1999. The contract was not advertised; six companies were invited to tender. The contract runs until 31 October 2002 (with provision to extend if necessary).

[41755]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20311w07.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 The Department and the claimants' solicitors representatives have recently agreed the terms on which safety officers and under managers&#151;who were not originally incorporated within the claims handling agreement&#151;may be compensated for respiratory disease. They have also agreed that claims from mines rescue workers and assistant area salvage reclamations managers may be referred to the Dust Reference Panel on a case by case basis, for a decision on the terms on which they may be compensated. Group 3 employment relates to claims for Vibration White Finger, not for respiratory disease.

Of this number, 5,011 reports (11 per cent.) were returned by IRISC and 2,701 reports (6 per cent.) were returned by solicitors.

 A separate method of assessment is required for those deceased claimants who died prior to 1 January 1983 to reflect the law prior to that date. Under the previous law, a miner's claim for the years that he lost due to respiratory disease and his loss of expectation of life passed on to the estate as part of the claim under the Law Reform Act (LRA) 1934. The compensation paid to the beneficiary of that claim would be deducted from any entitlement that the beneficiary has to a dependency claim under the Fatal Accidents Act (FAA) 1976.
<P>

<a name="20311w07.html_para1">It has been agreed with the claimants' solicitors that these claims will be dealt with in the following manner:

<P>
<P>
<a name="20311w07.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 The latest official data available are for the year 2001. Provisional data published recently on the DTI Energy Statistics website show that the UK was a net exporter of gas to the order of 107,771 Gigawatt hours, equivalent to 8.7 per cent. of gross UK production of 1,233,754 Gigawatt hours.
<P>

<a name="20311w07.html_para2">Whether and to what extent there will be net exports of gas from the UK over the next five years will depend on the balance between UK supply and demand. Demand is subject to a number of factors, including weather conditions and the relative price of gas and other sources of energy, none of which is easy to forecast. Gas production from the UK continental shelf is currently projected to peak in the next few years, but it is not possible to predict precisely when UK supply will fall short of UK demand. However, on present evidence, on an annual basis the UK is likely to become a net importer of gas in or soon after 2005.

<P>
<a name="20311w07.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 Since the announcement of a possible PPP on 13 July 1999, the Department has been working closely with BNFL on all aspects of its business, including liabilities management. This work, and that carried out under the auspices of the UKAEA Quinquennial Review between April 2000 and August 2001, resulted in the proposals outlined on 28 November. Ministers were given regular reports on the work as it progressed.

 <i>[holding answer 27 February 2002]:</i> The DTI has been closely involved with a series of studies, both on its own behalf and in collaboration with other agencies, such as the Languages National Training Organisation, with a view to measuring the impact of language skills on export companies. These studies took place in 1997, 1999 and with the LNTO in 2001 and 2002. Details of lost contracts are not held on an individual company basis, though the number of exporting companies explicitly stating they had lost business due to language barriers varies from 5 per cent. to 21.6 per cent.

 The project in Rafah has led to improvements in both the quality and quantity of water. Sanitary standards have also increased as the majority of households are now connected to a new sewage network. But Rafah is a target for the Israeli military. This has disrupted project implementation.

<a name="20311w10.html_para4">The establishment of a water network and communal cisterns, and the rehabilitation of springs have increased the quality and volume of water in Dura.

 The Presidency, with full UK support, has conveyed the EU's grave concern to the Israeli Government. It has been made clear that we view the damage and destruction of all EU-financed development projects in the Palestinian Territories to be out of proportion to any military, security, or political needs. Financial compensation may be sought. A provisional assessment has been made of the affected projects. It has been emphasised that this is not simply an accounting exercise to form the basis of a financial claim; such actions are counter-productive and perpetuate the cycle of violence.

<a name="20311w12.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 The cultivation and trafficking of opiates is of serious concern to the UK. The UK maintains a dialogue, and co-operates closely, with the EU and G8 countries as well as all countries in south-west and Central Asia. The Bonn Agreement concluded in December 2001 urged the international community to assist the Afghan Interim Authority to combat the cultivation and trafficking of illicit drugs. When I met Hamid Karzai, the Chairman of the Interim Administration, during my visit to India at the end of last month I stressed the importance of progress on tackling drugs. Mr. Karzai has already signalled his intent by announcing in January a ban on drugs production, processing and trafficking. The international community, including the UK, has expressed its determination to help the Afghan authorities to implement this ban as soon as possible.
<P>

<a name="20311w12.html_para4">It was decided at the Tokyo Reconstruction conference in January that drugs should be treated as a cross-cutting issue and that drugs-related objectives should therefore be reflected in all assistance programmes. The UK pledged &#163;200 million at Tokyo which, among other things, will be aimed at projects designed to reduce the dependence of the Afghan economy on drugs.
<P>

<a name="20311w12.html_para5">In financial year 2002&#150;03 the FCO will provide around &#163;4.5 million for practical anti-drugs assistance in the form of training and equipment to countries in south-west and Central Asia.
<P>

<a name="20311w12.html_para6">A UNDCP report published at the end of February 2002 stated that between 1,900 and 2,700 tones of opium would be produced in Afghanistan this year. Opium production in other south-west and Central Asian countries is negligible by comparison.

As in recent years, the EU will table a resolution on the death penalty at the forthcoming session of the UN Commission on Human Rights (CHR).

 On Wednesday 6 March I chaired a meeting of parties involved in handling asbestos claims related to Chester Street Insurance Holding Ltd. Present 



<P>
<P><I>11 Mar 2002 : Column 694W</I><P>
at the meeting were PricewaterhouseCoopers (the Chester Street administrators); the Association of British Insurers; the Financial Services Compensation Scheme and Iron Trades Management Services (claims handlers).
<P>

<a name="20311w13.html_para4">At the meeting, I made it very clear that delays in dealing with agreed claims are not acceptable. All parties acknowledged that agreed claims should be paid as quickly and as efficiently as possible. The administrators, the ABI, the FSCS and ITMS made the point to me that the arrangements set up following the insolvency of Chester Street are unique. There had been complexities, particularly in relation to establishing liabilities. In some cases, solvent policyholders (i.e. the companies, or their successors, for whom the claimants had originally worked) have been traced and their liabilities have had to be established. However, this type of work has now largely been completed. As a result, it should be possible to process claims payments more quickly in the future.
<P>

<a name="20311w13.html_para5">In a number of cases, those present at the meeting indicated that settlement forms had been sent out to claimants' lawyers, for the claimant to sign. Clearly, it is important for these forms to be signed and returned as soon as possible, to speed the process along.
<P>

<a name="20311w13.html_para6">I am anxious to ensure that individual claimants are kept informed of the process. It was agreed that a newsletter will be produced within the next week, to be distributed to Members of Parliament with a constituency interest. We will also consider other ways of keeping individual claimants informed.
<P>

<a name="20311w13.html_para7">We also discussed whether it would be possible to establish a system so that once a claim against Chester Street is agreed, the claimant would know how long it should take for the claim to be processed. The administrators, the ABI, FSCS and ITMS agreed to consider this further and report back to me.
<P>

<a name="20311w13.html_para8">I will convene a further meeting in six weeks' time to discuss the claims handling process. I made it clear that, when this next meeting takes place, I want to see significant progress made in paying claims. We will invite other relevant parties to the meeting, such as claimants' solicitors. We will also have detailed statistical information available on the number of claims made; the number settled and the number still outstanding.
<P>

<a name="20311w13.html_para9">The Government are determined to make sure that the arrangements put in place following the insolvency of Chester Street last year work as efficiently and as quickly as possible.

In short, if the accommodation is wholly or mainly provided for short periods to individuals whose sole or main residence is elsewhere then it will no longer be domestic and must be treated as non-domestic and, therefore, will be liable to business rates.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The National Statistician has been asked to reply to your recent questions on information collected on business turnover. (40834, 40835).</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The ONS collects monthly turnover data directly from businesses in the production, retail and services industries. These statistics are key inputs to monthly short-term indicators of economic activity such as the Index of Production, the Retail Sales Index and the Experimental Index of Services. The same data are used to give timely measures of quarterly Gross Domestic Product. These economic indicators are used by government and the public to help monitor the performance of the UK economy, and by the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of England to help set interest rates. Other key users of the data are the Treasury, the Department of Trade and Industry and the European Union.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Turnover information is also collected on an annual basis via the Annual Business Inquiry. Here it is one of a set of data items needed on a coherent basis from the annual accounts of a business and cannot be taken in isolation. This set of data is used to compile the National Accounts (including estimation of Gross Domestic Product and Investment) and for other important statistics such as Productivity. Key users again include the Treasury, the Department of Trade and Industry and the European Union.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>VAT returns made by businesses to Customs and Excise do include data on turnover. However VAT sources are far from ideal for the purposes of producing national statistics. The data are for the most part collected on a quarterly basis and they are less timely. Also, some businesses are exempt from VAT so that coverage is incomplete.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The possible use of these returns to replace or partially replace directly collected survey data is part of ONS' long term strategic development programme. In 2000 a feasibility study suggested that it might be possible to use VAT sources more directly. In 2001 ONS piloted and introduced a secure system for transmitting VAT turnover data from Customs and Excise to ONS and confirmed that there would be no legal barriers to such data transfer. We plan to further develop the methodology adopted in the 2000 feasibility study, to prepare inputs to the Index of Production and Index of Services in parallel with those based on business surveys and to quality assure the alternative sources with key users. If this is successful ONS will then move to the much greater use of VAT returns.</FONT></UL>

<a name="20311w16.html_wqn2"><B> Mrs. Curtis-Thomas: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what incentives are in place to aid investment in research for smaller quoted companies; and what steps the Government are taking to make competition for investment capital less biased towards larger quoted companies.  [40248]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20311w16.html_spnew2"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 An R&D tax credit for small and medium sized companies was introduced in Budget 2000. The credit increases the tax deduction for current spending on qualifying R&D from 100 per cent. to 150 per cent., reducing the cash cost of R&D by 30 per cent. for a company paying tax at the small companies rate. The credit can also be paid to companies that are not yet in profit, at a rate of 24 per cent. An R&D tax credit for larger companies will be introduced in Budget 2002. There are also 100 per cent. allowances for R&D capital spending, which are available to all companies and allow immediate tax deductions for qualifying capital expenditure.
<P>

<a name="20311w16.html_para1">The Government commissioned the Myners Review in 2000 to look at factors that may be distorting the investment decision-making of institutions. The review reported in March 2001 and found weaknesses in the investment process that affect all quoted companies, including smaller quoted companies. The Government have accepted all the recommendations made in the review in principle and have published consultation documents on specific issues that were highlighted.

<a name="20311w16.html_spnew3"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 The costs of raising equity finance are treated consistently between taxable profits and commercial accounts&#151;they are not allowed as a deduction against profits because they relate to ownership of the company. The Government have not stated any intention to change this rule.

<P>
<a name="20311w16.html_spnew4"><B> Dr. John Reid: </B> 
 11 prisoners on the run have successfully applied to the Sentence Review Commissioners for early release under the terms of the Northern Ireland (Sentences) Act 1998. In addition eight prisoners on the run have met the principles of the early release scheme but a strict application of the Sentences Act has created an anomaly whereby the Sentence Review Commissioners are unable to grant an early release. In those circumstances the Secretary of State's powers under the Northern Ireland Prisons Act 1953 or the Royal Prerogative of Mercy have been used to provide early release. It has always been the Government's policy that they do not name individuals released under the early release scheme.

 While information about prisoners' home addresses prior to custody is not collected centrally, we know that many young prisoners have a multiplicity of serious problems and social exclusion. For some, prison can be the first chance to address the problems that contribute to their offending.
<P>

<a name="20311w17.html_para4">In the spring, the Social Exclusion Unit are to publish a report into how the Prison Service, the National Probation Service and other agencies can better tackle the problems, including social deprivation, that contribute to prisoners' offending and reduce their likelihood of re-offending on release. A copy of the report will be placed in the Library.

 There are no centrally held statistics. However, recent research suggests that 25 per cent. of male young offenders and 39 per cent. of female young offenders are parents.

role while in custody. Young offender institutions have introduced programmes which support this process, including the appointment of family liaison officers, extended family visits and parenting skills courses. For low income families, the Assisted Prison Visits Unit provides financial support for the cost of visiting, or escorting children to visits.

<a name="20311w17.html_spnew12"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 The aim of all youth offending team (Yot) spending is to prevent offending. National standards issued by the Home Secretary in April 2000 state that a minimum of 2.5 per cent. of the Yot budget must be spent on preventive services for children and young people at high risk of offending. The remainder prevents offending by working with young people in the youth justice system who have admitted or been convicted of an offence.

Most recently, 19 November 2001, Communities That Care reported on risk and protective factors associated with youth crime for the Youth Justice Board. It showed that youth offending risks were increased by among other things family conflict, family structure, poor quality parental supervision and discipline, a poor relationship between the child and one or both parents and low family income. I am arranging for copies to be placed in the Library.

 The Avon and Somerset police authority has received extra funding of nearly &#163;1 million in the past two years to improve policing in rural areas.

They will provide a visible, reassuring presence to the public, and will have sufficient powers to deal with minor disorder and antisocial behaviour.

That is why he has sought advice from the Advisory Council on the misuse of Drugs on their assessment reclassifying cannabis from Class B to Class C; we launched an action plan to reduce drug-related deaths; we launched a campaign to raise the awareness of the risks of drugs and to encourage young people, their parents or carers to call the National Drugs Helpline on 0800 776 600; we set up an expert group to consider best practice guidance on the treatment of Crack Cocaine addiction; we are reviewing guidance on heroin prescribing; and also in conjunction with the Department of Health we are implementing a further series of measures to minimise the harm drugs cause.

<P>
<a name="20311w19.html_spnew0"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 One of the principal aims of the prison service is to reduce re-offending. In order to provide regimes which are effective at reducing re-offending the Prison Service increasingly draws upon research about "What Works" to develop a more evidence based approach to tackling offending behaviour and the factors which contribute towards re-offending. The recently launched What Works Strategy provides a clear direction for the Prison Service for the further development of constructive regimes to reduce the risk of re-offending. The Prison Service and the Probation Service have been set a challenging but achievable target of reducing the level of predicted reconvictions by five per cent. by 2004.
<P>

<a name="20311w19.html_para0">The What Works in Prison Strategy encompasses accredited Offending Behaviour Programmes, drug treatment programmes, increased eduction provision with a target of delivering 23,400 accredited education or vocational qualifications in 2001&#150;02 and an associated Custody to Work Strategy, which is investing &#163;30 million between 2001 and 2004 to improve resettlement outcomes.

 We are increasing prison education funding by 15 per cent. in real terms over the next two years. We have set challenging basic skills targets for every prison.

Numbers of recorded crimes after this date are therefore not directly comparable with previous years.
<P>

<a name="20311w19.html_para5">It should be noted that recorded violent crime is subject to changes in reporting and recording. The 2001 British Crime Survey found that, over England and Wales as a whole, reporting to the police of violent offences in total rose from 37 per cent. in 1997 to 45 per cent. in the 2000 calendar year.
<P>

<a name="20311w19.html_para6">Also, the British Crime Survey has shown that, in England and Wales as a whole, the number of violent crimes recorded in the survey decreased by 23 per cent. between the 1997 and 2000 calendar years, whereas violent crime recorded by the police increased by an estimated 14 per cent. Violent crime recorded by the police may therefore not necessarily be a reflection of real changes in the level of violent crime.

<a name="20311w20.html_para4">The main determining factors in the size of the prison population are the numbers of offenders being sentenced at the courts, the proportions given custody, and the average lengths of sentences received.

offences has remained stable over the last eight quarters. Custody rates (the proportion of those sentenced at court who are given immediate custody) have increased for adult males and females, and have decreased for male young offenders. Average sentence lengths have remained stable for adult males, and have increased for young males, and also for females.
<P>

<a name="20311w20.html_para5">The projections take into account the average year on year changes over the last four quarters for which information is available. Three scenarios, based on different possible sentencing trends at the courts, are used to project forward the prison population. These scenarios apply to prisoners sentenced to four years or less. Prisoners with sentences of four years or greater are assumed to increase in line with the long-term trends. Males are expected to increase by 70 prisoners per month, and females by 20 per month.
<P>

<a name="20311w20.html_para6">As well as assumptions about court sentencing behaviour, the projections also take into account known changes in legislation and policy. That is, where the proposals are law, that relevant legislation has been enacted, and there is an agreed timetable for implementation. Various changes can act to increase or reduce the prison population. On 1 March 2002 the population had exceeded the higher projection for six weeks. The reasons for this are as yet unclear.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. All figures are estimates and are taken from the Households Below Average Income (HBAI) data set which is derived from the Family Resources Survey (FRS). The FRS does not include Northern Ireland and 1999&#150;2000 is the latest year for which data are available.<P>

2. The estimates are sample counts, which have been adjusted for non-response using multipurpose grossing factors that control for tenure, council tax band and a number of other variables. Estimates are subject to both sampling error and to variability in non-response and are presented on both a Before Housing Costs (BHC) and an After Housing Costs (AHC) basis in line with HBAI conventions.<P>

3. The income measure used is weekly net (disposable) equivalised household income, that is to say income that is adjusted to reflect the composition of the household. This process reflects the common sense notion that a family of several people needs a higher income than a single person in order for both households to enjoy a comparable standard of living. Equivalence scales conventionally take a couple with no children as a reference point, with the cash incomes of larger households adjusted downwards, and smaller households upwards, relative to this benchmark. The income figures quoted therefore relate to the 'cash' income of a couple with no 



children only, and the equivalisation process must be reversed in order for them to be converted into cash incomes for other family types.<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what percentage of possession proceedings for rent arrears in local authority and RSL accommodation related to tenants who have had their benefit reduced as a result of one or more non-dependent deductions in the last 12 months for which figures are available; what the average age is of housing benefit claimants affected by non-dependent deductions; what percentage of housing benefit claimants affected by non-dependent deductions are <i>(a)</i> registered disabled, <i>(b)</i> over 60 years old, <i>(c)</i> in receipt of income support or JSA and <i>(d)</i> lone parents; and what estimate he has made of the percentage of housing benefit claimants affected by non-dependant deductions who are left with a disposable income below income support level, once the non-dependent deduction has been taken into account.

 We believe it is right that adult members of a household who are not eligible for housing benefit should contribute towards the cost of rent where they are financially able to do so. Non-dependent deductions are designed to reduce housing benefit to take account of the contribution towards rent that other members of the household should make. We would therefore expect any shortfall in housing benefit resulting from a non-dependent deduction could be met by the non-dependant person.

2. The figures are based on a 1 per cent. sample and are subject to a degree of sampling variation.<P>

3. The data refer to housing benefit recipients which may be a single person, a couple or a family. More than one benefit recipient can live in one property, for example two or more adults in a flat or house share.<P>

4. The percentages have been rounded to the nearest whole number.<P>

5. The average age of housing benefit recipients affected by non-dependant deductions is 59 years.<P>

 Approximately 8 per cent. of DTLR central staff work part-time. Of these, a smaller percentage job share. Information specifically on job sharers is not held centrally and can be provided only at disproportionate cost.

<a name="20311w26.html_para1">Job sharing forms just one strand of a range of possible alternative and flexible working arrangements. Other options include home working and flexitime. Under DTLR central posting arrangements, all posts are open to part-time workers or job sharers. The central Department supports a part-time workers network and operates a job share register to assist staff in identifying job share partners.
<P>

<a name="20311w26.html_para2">The DTLR agencies, in almost all cases, also operate a policy of advertising all posts as open to part-time workers or job sharers. All operate a range of flexible working options. Several also support part-time working or carers networks.

 Responsibility for the provision of pilotage services was assigned by the Pilotage Act 1987 to competent harbour authorities who have statutory powers in relation to the regulation of shipping movements and the safety of navigation. We have no plans to change this arrangement.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20311w28.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The term "competent harbour authority" is used in the Pilotage Act 1987 for harbour authorities who have more general statutory powers in relation to the regulation of shipping movements and the safety of navigation. The Act extended these powers to include the provision of pilotage services. Harbour authorities are fully accountable for the exercise of their powers, as the prosecution of the Milford Haven Port Authority, following the Sea Empress grounding, has shown.
<P>

<a name="20311w28.html_para1">The purpose of the Department's Port Marine Safety Code has been to establish an agreed national standard as a measure by which a harbour authority can be more openly accountable to a wide range of interests for the policies and procedures adopted to ensure that the harbour is run safely.

 The review of the Railway Industry Advisory Committee (RIAC) was carried out in early 2001 by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE), at the request of the Health and Safety Commission (HSC), and as part of a general review of their industry advisory committees. Copies of the conclusions of the review and RIAC's revised terms of reference have been placed in the Libraries of the House.
<P>

<a name="20311w28.html_para4">The HSC considered these following publication of part 2 of Lord Cullen's public inquiry report, and implemented a key review conclusion through the replacement of the Chief Inspector of Railways as Chair by an independent member of the HSC (Margaret Burns) in November 2001. RIAC agendas and HSC minutes are available on the HSE website and indicate areas on which RIAC has advised the HSC.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20311w29.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The UK National Aviation Security Programme has for many years contained a range of measures to deter and prevent the hijacking of passenger aircraft. These measures were substantially enhanced in response to the attacks on 11 September. In particular it has been a requirement since 18 September 2001 for cockpit doors to be kept locked.
<P>

<a name="20311w29.html_para1">In addition, the Cabinet Office commissioned, through the Committee on Domestic and International Terrorism, a wide-ranging review of aviation security following these attacks. As a result a number of potential measures have been identified on which work is currently being taken forward. However it is too soon to say what will be introduced as a result.

<P>
<a name="20311w29.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 My Department's National Travel Survey indicates that 47 per cent. of rural households in England, defined as households in a settlement with less than 3,000 population, lived within about 10 minutes' walk of a bus service operating at least hourly in 1998 to 2000. This figure should be treated with caution as sample sizes for rural areas are small, despite aggregation of data over a three year period. For this reason, these data cannot be broken down to a constituency level.

<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions what additional funding is being made available to meet the target laid down in the Rural White Paper for the proportion of the rural population living within 10 minutes' walk of a bus service operating at least hourly by <i>(a)</i> 2004 and <i>(b)</i> 2010.  [41446]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20311w29.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 We have made available &#163;198 million for rural bus services in England over the period 2001&#150;02 to 2003&#150;04, through the Rural Bus Subsidy Grant and Rural Bus Challenge schemes. Funding for these schemes beyond 2003&#150;04 will be decided in light of future spending reviews, reflecting our 10-year plan and Rural White Paper targets and commitments for rural transport. Local authorities also have the discretion to use revenue support funding allocated by my Department for additional rural bus services.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20311w29.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 The Government recognise the enormous importance of personal mobility for many disabled people. We are committed to making regulations in due course to require an exemption from local road user charges for at least some disabled people covering the whole of England including London. These regulations will set a minimum standard which local authorities must meet. They will be free to introduce more generous concessions or exemptions if they wish.
<P>

<a name="20311w29.html_para2">We shall consult on the possible form of the England wide exemption after the current review of the disabled persons' parking badge scheme (the Blue Badge Scheme) is completed later this year.

<P>

<a name="20311w29.html_para3">SEEDA has invested funding of &#163;35,000 since April 2001 on the study (which includes consultation costs) in regard to the Maritime Vision for Shoreham Harbour.

 The Government's advice on housing as set out in "Planning Policy Guidance note 3" (PPG3) give precedence to locating new housing on previously developed land within urban areas. Regional Planning Guidance for the South-east (RPG9) advises that development plans should seek to achieve at least 60 per cent. of all new development in the South-east on previously developed land.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills, pursuant to her answer of 19 November 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 61W, on fair trade goods, if she will review and increase the amount of fairly traded goods purchased by her Department during Fair Trade Fortnight.  [35916]<P>

 My Department takes every opportunity to encourage suppliers and partners to promote and purchase fair trade products. As the vast majority of goods purchased are via third parties my direct influence to purchase these goods is limited. However I continue to support ethical trading in mainstream business and encourage suppliers and partners to become increasingly aware of fair trade products during Fair Trade Fortnight.

 <i>[holding answer 4 March 2002]:</i> Our assessment is that for a school that must pay the climate change levy (CCL), the increase in fuel costs in the financial year 2001&#150;02 due to the levy was of the order of 10 per cent.
<P>

<a name="20311w31.html_para0">Not all schools have to pay the CCL. Those schools which are eligible to pay the lower rate of VAT on fuel of 5 per cent. are exempt from the levy.

<a name="20311w31.html_para5">Detailed evaluation criteria are not held centrally and could be collated only at disproportionate cost. However, every campaign is measured vigorously against specific communication objectives using pre- and post-campaign research, conducted by independent research companies, to record shifts in awareness, attitudes, knowledge or behaviour among the target audience(s).
<P>

<a name="20311w31.html_para6">The Department employs tracking research to monitor these shifts over time and typically conducts telephone surveys of respondents to advertising campaigns to monitor satisfaction with the services offered and actions taken as a result of the campaign. It routinely tests the likely effectiveness of different creative approaches on the target audience(s) through market research, as part of the development of advertising campaigns. Lessons learned from previous campaigns are used to inform future ones.

<a name="20311w31.html_para10">Students who started their course in 1997&#150;98, or earlier, repay their student loan on a mortgage-style (fixed-term) basis. Students commencing their course in 1998&#150;99, or later, will repay their loans on an income-contingent basis. Their repayments will be linked to their income after leaving higher education so that leavers only repay when their income exceeds the threshold of &#163;10,000 per annum.

 The Law Commission published a draft Termination of Tenancies Bill in 1994. It proposed the abolition of a landlord's right to terminate a tenancy by physical re-entry and by way of a court order for possession. A subsequent Law Commission consultative document reiterated the proposal to abolish all means of forfeiture. It also proposed, in relation to commercial properties only, that either the original proposals stand or that there should be a statutory right in very limited circumstances for a landlord physically to re-enter the property. The majority of responses to the consultation favoured the second option.

1. The figures are for the "core" of the Department as none of its agencies, nor non-departmental public bodies have owned any empty properties.
<BR>
2. Excluded from the figures is the project, commenced in 1998&#150;99, to refurbish three vacant buildings. The first of these (Admiralty Arch) was completed and occupied by staff in 2000&#150;01. When the other two buildings (Kirkland House and the Ripley Building) are completed in 2002&#150;03, they will form 22 Whitehall; one of the Department's major buildings.

<P>

<a name="20311w35.html_para8">In the 3km cull animals were culled under the powers in the Animal Health Act 1981, on the basis that they had been exposed to infection. However, it was implemented by dealing first with those farms where keepers were willing to co-operate with the cull, hence the use of the term "voluntary cull" as a shorthand for the 3km cull operation.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20311w35.html_spnew10"><B> Margaret Beckett </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 28 February 2002]:</i> During last year's outbreak, diagnosis of food and mouth disease (FMD) was normally confirmed by the National Disease Control Centre on the basis of clinical observations of a veterinary inspector on the spot. Some cases were confirmed on the basis of laboratory tests which confirmed the presence of FMD antibodies or virus. It is nearly five months since the last outbreak of foot and mouth and confirmation of any future case would need to be based on laboratory tests that confirm the presence of the virus.

has also been collected from these triplets including the prevalence of TB in badgers caught in the trial, locations of capture, and the number and location of cattle TB breakdowns in trial areas. These data have not been released so as not to discourage participation in the trial, or encourage either illegal killing of badgers or interference with trial operations.

 Safety and standards in the maritime industry are a matter for the Maritime and Coastguard Agency. With regard to standards for animal welfare, the MV Kalifeh 1 is known to have carried sheep twice from the UK. Both voyages were from Northern Ireland and the vessel was inspected by the Northern Ireland Veterinary Service and assessed as suitable to carry sheep. The vessel has not been refused entry to a European port following departure from the UK. However, on 16 February 2002 the French authorities refused a consignment of 274 sheep as a result of alleged irregularities in procedures relating to the animals which originated in the Republic of Ireland. This matter was resolved between the authorities in France and the Republic of Ireland.

 This Department and its agencies offer a broad range of land management agreements, which may provide landowners with financial support to promote stewardship of wetlands, woodlands and other types of land. Examples include the Environmentally Sensitive Areas, Countryside Stewardship and Farm Woodland Premium Schemes. The Forestry Commission's Woodland Grant Scheme provides financial support for the management, and planting, of woodland. These schemes are available through the England Rural Development Programme which offers &#163;190 million in this financial year. 



<P>

It would be well-nigh impossible to separate out the spending on wetlands or woodlands and a couple of examples may help to explain why this is the case.

<a name="20311w38.html_para4">The Environmentally Sensitive Areas (ESA) scheme includes some well-known wetlands (Somerset Levels; Broads; Suffolk River Valleys; Essex Coast; North Kent Marshes; Avon and Test Valleys). Total ESA payments to farmers in these areas will amount to &#163;10 million this year. However, this figure would be difficult to separate into categories of land. In addition, the Environment Agency, English Nature and the Countryside Agency all make contributions to individual cases through their own mechanisms in pursuance of the objectives we have agreed with them.
<P>

<a name="20311w38.html_para5">Taking the Somerset Levels as an example, in the raised water level area, the Environment Agency provides funds for sluices and the ESA scheme contributes towards land management and ditch maintenance. In parts, there is SSSI land on which England Nature provides grants under the Wildlife Enhancement Scheme. In the Suffolk River Valleys ESA, financial support to farmers comes from a combination of ESA funds and Countryside Stewardship support. The Environment Agency and English Nature also support some cases. Further public sector support is also available from the local authority. Some schemes are supported by private money from the RSPB and National Trust. Many of these cases would also cover land other than wetland and woodland.

At that time DTP vaccine was not provided by the Department but was either purchased by local health authorities or obtained by general practitioners (GPs) from local retail pharmacists. Thus, information on whether batches 3741 and 3732 were supplied to United Kingdom doctors is not held centrally. Should such vaccines have been issued, the only information on who might have received them will depend on GPs or local health authority clinics maintaining records that will be now over 30-years-old. The Department has asked the then manufacturer's present owners, GlaxoSmithKline, to investigate their records.

It should be noted that a report of a suspected adverse reaction does not necessarily mean that it was caused by the vaccine. Many vaccines are administered in combination and in these circumstances it may be difficult to ascribe the cause of the reaction to an individual vaccine.

<i>Notes</i>:<P>

Waiting time statistics from HES are not the same as the published waiting list statistics. HES provides counts and waiting times for all patients admitted to hospital within a given period whereas the published waiting list statistics count those waiting for treatment at a given point in time and how long they have been on the waiting 



list. Also, HES calculates the waiting time as the difference between the admission and decision to admit dates. Unlike published waiting list statistics, this is not adjusted for self-deferrals or periods of medical/social suspension.<P>

A finished consultant episode is defined as a period of patient care under one consultant in one health care provider. The figures do not represent the number of patients, as one person may have several episodes within the year.<P>

Figures in this table have not yet been adjusted for shortfalls in data.<P>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Q3 access survey shows the NHS is on target to meet the 2004 primary care access milestones.
<P>
<BR>
Since May 1997, 68 major hospital developments (64 PFI and four public) worth over &#163;7.6 billion have been approved to proceed. 10 of these (eight PFI and two public) are already operational and are treating patients.
<P>
<BR>
Since 1997 the number of nurses has increased by 31,520. Between September 1999 and September 2001 the number of nurses increased by 20,740 or 9.9 per cent. This means the NHS

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>plan target has been reached well in advance of the 2004 target. We are now focusing on achieving the manifesto commitment and on retaining existing staff.
<P>
<BR>
There are now 20 per cent. (4,320) more consultants than there were in 1997. The number of consultants increased by 10.6 per cent. (2,460) between the NHS plan baseline (September 1999) and September 2001.
<P>
<BR>
668 new critical care beds since January 2000 represents a 28 per cent. increase, putting us on course to achieve the target of a 30 per cent. increase by January 2003.
<P>
<BR>
714 new beds in general and acute wards puts us over a third of the way towards the target of 2,100 by April 2004.
<P>
<BR>
163 rapid access chest pain clinics were open by the end of quarter 3. The plan target was 100 clinics by April 2002.
<P>
<BR>
The target of 6,000 extra heart operations by April 2003 should be achieved this year.
<P>
<BR>
91.3 per cent. (67,650) of patients referred urgently with suspected cancer were seen within two weeks during Q2 2001&#150;02.
<P>
<BR>
By the end of March 2002 no patients should have to wait more than 15 months from the time of being placed on an in-patient waiting list. Latest figures show that, at the end of January 2002, 72 per cent. of trusts are already meeting this target.

 Our proposals for the new consultant contract were published in February 2001 and these, alongside the British Medical Association's own proposals, form the basis of continuing negotiations
<P>

<a name="20311w51.html_para0">The proposals envisage that for an initial period, perhaps seven years, the terms of the contract would prevent newly appointed consultants engaging in similar work outside the national health service whether the individual is employed on a full-time or part-time basis. This is designed to maximise consultants' contribution to the NHS, but not to prevent doctors from working part-time if they wish to do so.

 In 1991, guidance was issued to the national health service which set out eligibility for transport (HSG(91)29 issued in 1991 with booklet "Ambulance and other patient transport services"). A copy is in the Library. The guidance states that if a patient has a medical need for transport as determined by the clinician in charge of their case, then transport should be provided free of charge, as part of NHS treatment. Medical need for non-emergency patient transport must be determined locally by a clinician and will depend on the medical condition of the patient, the availability of private or public transport and distance to be travelled. The principle applied is that a patient should be able to reach hospital in a reasonable time, in reasonable comfort, without detriment to their medical condition.

<P>
<a name="20311w52.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The cost of producing and distributing "Primary Care" magazine and its accompanying website is approximately &#163;38,900 per edition, depending on advertising revenue. It is mailed to 27,000 GPs and practice managers working in primary care and distributed to 1,000 Department of Health managers 10 times a year. A further 1,000 are printed for potential advertisers, requested copies and storage. This is a cost of approximately 1.3 pence per copy.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what criteria he uses to judge the success of the Better Hospital Food programme being implemented in NHS hospitals.  [42264]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20311w52.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 The Better Hospital Food programme was announced in the NHS Plan and is a long-term initiative designed to improve the quality, availability of and access to food in hospitals. The programme is supported by an additional &#163;38.5 million over four years.
<P>

<a name="20311w52.html_para0">There are two key areas through which success will be judged&#151;patient satisfaction and nutritional outcomes.
<P>

<a name="20311w52.html_para1">The NHS Plan required NHS trusts to secure year-on-year increases in patient satisfaction levels with the standard of food. From this year the National Patient Survey includes questions related to the food served in hospital, and in addition hospitals undertake regular surveys of patients on this issue. Through the Better Hospital Food programme a Patient Catering Survey has been designed to test the quality of the services on offer against criteria designed in consultation with patients which addresses those issues which patients have said are important. This will be available for all hospitals to use shortly.
<P>

<a name="20311w52.html_para2">There are clear links between good nutrition and good health. Through an ad hoc working group which includes nutritional experts, representatives of the British Dietetic Association, NHS dietitians and nurses, principles for nutritional screening are being devised which will facilitate the measurement of both under and over- nutrition on entry to hospital. This will allow early intervention of clinical and dietetic staff to address problems which, unchecked, may lead to prolonged ill health. In addition research will be undertaken to establish the clinical outcomes of improved nutrition and to provide a tool to ensure that the nutritional aims of the Better Hospital Food programme are taking effect.

 Figures for reported incidents of violence against national health service staff in 2000&#150;01 are currently being analysed by the Department. The figures will be published as soon as the Department is satisfied the figures are sufficiently robust and reflect NHS trust mergers and other organisational changes in NHS.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what the policy is of the Brighton Healthcare NHS Trust for isolating patients who contract hospital-acquired infections.  [42281]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20311w54.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 The management of patients who contract hospital acquired infections at Brighton Health Care NHS Trust is dependent on their medical condition and the location of their care, such as an intensive care unit. Patients would be placed in a degree of isolation taking account of these two factors.
