<P>
<P>
<a name="00328w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Steen: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment if he will make arrangements to ensure that the children of political asylum seekers attend pre-school facilities; and what the cost of that would be to public funds.  [116535]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00328w01.html_spnew0"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 Local education authorities already have a legal duty to ensure that all eligible four-year-olds, including children of asylum seekers, are entitled to a free part-time place in any registered pre-school setting. In addition, from April 2000, all local education authorities will receive funding to provide a free early education place to the most needy three-year-old children in their area. It is up to local education authorities to set their own criteria of social need which may include providing places to children of asylum seekers.
<P>

<a name="00328w01.html_para0">Local education authorities receive funding from this Department for the provision of pre-school places in the form of a nursery education grant which is &#163;1,130 per child per year for each eligible three and four-year-old child.
<P>

<a name="00328w01.html_para1">It is not possible to calculate the overall cost of pre- school education for children of asylum seekers, as separate records are not kept.

<a name="00328w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Gray: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what provision has been made for the funding of the teachers' threshold pay rise after the first two years.  [116528]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00328w01.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 Provision for teachers' pay beyond March 2002 falls into the next spending period and will be taken into account along with other factors when deciding future funding levels for education.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00328w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Gray: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment if he will make a statement on funding for schools in respect of post-16 education reforms.  [116527]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00328w01.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 The &#163;35 million that the Government have identified as the cost to LEAs in 2000-01 of implementing its post-16 curriculum reforms was added to Education Standard Spending (ESS) for that year. It is for local education authorities to decide how much funding to allocate through their individual schools budget to each of their schools to allow them to implement the reforms successfully. In addition, schools will receive &#163;290 million in special grant for 2000-01. Secondary schools will receive between &#163;30,000 and 



<P>
<P><I>28 Mar 2000 : Column: 72W</I><P>
&#163;50,000, depending on their size. This funding will be part of their delegated budgets: those with sixth forms will therefore be able to use it if they wish to supplement funding received through their local authority's allocation formula to implement the post-16 reforms.

<a name="00328w01.html_sbhd3"><H4><center>Teacher Dismissals</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="00328w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Clappison: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment how many teachers have been dismissed under the fast-track provisions.  [116091]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00328w01.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 Teacher dismissals are not recorded centrally. The National Employers' Organisation for School Teachers have carried out a survey of LEAs in England and Wales on the use of the new capability procedures for teachers which have now been incorporated in most schools. The survey collected responses from 116 LEAs (68 per cent.) for three school terms ending with the spring term 1999 and suggests that for all LEAs over 3,000 teachers had been subject to some form of capability review during the year, with over 600 dismissals under the new procedure. In addition, 194 teachers showed sufficient improvement and a further 439 cases are currently being processed. Work continues on monitoring and reviewing practice in schools and LEAs and the Secretary of State will be issuing further guidance for schools on staff capability after further consultation.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00328w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Boswell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what actions he will take in connection with the Prime Minister's recent internet initiative to forward the interests of disabled people, with particular reference to <i>(a)</i> access to public buildings housing internet terminals, <i>(b)</i> provision of sufficient large screens for those with reading difficulties, <i>(c)</i> availability of computers on a personal basis for rehabilitation and employment advisers and <i>(d)</i> the creation of a website for disabled jobseekers.  [115759]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00328w01.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Hodge </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 21 March 2000]:</i> We are determined that people with disabilities should benefit fully from the Prime Minister's recent internet initiative, particularly in their working lives.
<P>

<a name="00328w01.html_para2">Access to buildings housing internet terminals and the provision of large screen facilities intended for public use is covered by the goods and services provisions of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995. The new duties on providers of goods, facilities and services to the public to make reasonable adjustments for disabled people came into force in October last year.
<P>

<a name="00328w01.html_para3">Many of the Department's services used by people with disabilities are provided through the Employment Service. Its services are designed to meet the needs of all its clients, including people with disabilities. We believe that wherever possible help for disabled people should be offered as part of programmes used by a wide range of clients.
<P>

<a name="00328w01.html_para4">The Modernising Employment Service Programme is developing new ways in which all jobseekers can have improved access to services through information and communications technology. People with disabilities will gain from this programme. For example, the specification for the touch screen kiosk technology to be available in 



<P>
<P><I>28 Mar 2000 : Column: 73W</I><P>
Jobcentres across the country from autumn 2001 has taken account of the needs of clients with visual impairment. The same programme will also make sure computer workstations are available in sufficient numbers to ensure that every member of ES staff will have access whenever they need it.
<P>

<a name="00328w01.html_para5">The Employment Service will continue to upgrade the information it provides on services used by jobseekers with disabilities on the Employment Service website. This includes information about the Access to Work programme and other specialist measures, as well as links to the DfEE Disability page at www.disability.gov.uk. The Employment Service plans to make improvements which will make their website even more user friendly.
<P>

<a name="00328w01.html_para6">Large screen technologies and other forms of help will continue to be available under the Access to Work programme when needed for employment.

<a name="00328w01.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Berry: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment if he will break down the numbers of people whose level of Access to Work support last year fell into the bands <i>(a)</i> &#163;0 to &#163;1,000, <i>(b)</i> &#163;1,000 to &#163;5,000, <i>(c)</i> &#163;5,001 to &#163;10,000 and <i>(d)</i> more than &#163;10,000.  [115519]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00328w01.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Hodge: </B> 
 The Employment Service does not collect information on Access to Work in the form requested. Access to Work has no upper or lower limit for support and applications fall within all the bands listed, including more than &#163;10,000.
<P>

<a name="00328w01.html_para7">In 1998-99, &#163;19.5 million was spent helping 16,000 disabled people in employment. The average cost of support was &#163;1,200.

<a name="00328w02.html_spnew1"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 The Schools Access Initiative (SAI) is part of the overall schools capital programme and so support is delivered through the usual capital mechanisms, which for local education authorities is by way of credit approvals. It is not possible to introduce a different funding arrangement for the SAI or to make an exception for an individual authority.

<a name="00328w02.html_para5">Mr. Takolia's role will be key to driving forward the Government's commitment to build a civil service which reflects the diversity of the society which it serves. His responsibility will include driving forward our efforts to increase the diversity of the civil service and to tackle the under-representation of ethnic minorities, particularly at senior levels. He will also be tasked with achieving early progress to demonstrate that faster change is possible, and to increase the level of appointments and secondments at senior levels from under-represented groups.




<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="00328w03.html_spnew3"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The cab of the Foden Thompson Carmichael MWD meets accepted European Safety Standards (ECE 29) set for roof crush, rear crush and front impact. There is no evidence to suggest that it is an unstable vehicle and there are no plans to fit roll bars to it. As I indicated in my earlier response on 7 March 2000, <i>Official Report,</i> column 648W, a modification programme to bring all MK1 vehicles up to full compliance with the Construction and Use Regulations has begun and will include the fitting of an anti-lock braking system (ABS). No other anti-crash features are planned and the vehicle is considered safe in all regards.

<a name="00328w03.html_spnew4"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The evidence referred to was given to a Board of Inquiry which investigated a fatal road traffic accident in Bosnia in July 1997. In respect of all the evidence considered by the Inquiry on the braking system fitted to the Foden Thompson Carmichael MWD, recommendations were made to review the driver training procedures for the vehicle, and to introduce an additional check in regard to the pawl lever on the Jacob's Brake--the engine brake system which is complementary to the service braking system. The recommendations have been acted upon.

All three vehicles were returned between January and July 1996 for repair following road traffic accidents while operating in Bosnia. It has not been possible to identify any Foden Thompson Carmichael MWD vehicles being returned to the Base Vehicle Depot (BVD) Ashchurch in August 1996.

<a name="00328w04.html_para3">The consumer interest in food safety will become the principal responsibility of the Food Standards Agency.

Our goal is to ensure that consumer concerns are fully reflected in decision making across the Ministry's responsibilities.

<a name="00328w04.html_para7">We will also be looking to change existing arrangements, which no longer serve to deliver real benefits to consumers. The Consumer's Committee for Great Britain was established under the Agricultural Marketing Act 1958. Despite its name, the Committee's statutory responsibilities relate only to the interests of consumers in the operation of marketing schemes made under the Act. As a result of changes over the years, only one such scheme now remains, covering wool, and this scheme does not have any direct impact on consumers. We are considering, along with the Scottish Executive and the Welsh Assembly, whether the Agricultural Marketing Act 1958 should be amended. In the meantime, I intend to leave the Committee in abeyance and not re-appoint members.

 We believe that the most important factor in reducing the numbers of lost passports is the rapid turnaround of casework and the elimination of backlogs. Over 70 per cent. of all after entry casework is now completed within two weeks and we expect the backlog to be eliminated by the summer. In addition, we are examining our processes with a view to improving the security of passports. We are also examining the costs that would be associated with returning passports by recorded delivery.

 Information is recorded centrally on the numbers of persons issued with notice of illegal entry as clandestine entrants.

We have no estimate of the number of persons entering clandestinely whose illegal entry has not yet come to light or of those who claim to have entered illegally, but where a notice of illegal entry has not yet been served. For these reasons, I am unable to provide the information requested.

 No decision has been made yet on where to run the pilot scheme. However, as the Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the hon. Member for Leicester, East (Mr. Vaz), announced on 20 March 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 833-36, it will not operate in any of the countries in the Indian Subcontinent.

the arrangements for the financial accountability of non-departmental public bodies linked to his Department.  [116529]<P>

<P>
<a name="00328w05.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 I have no plans for such a review. Responsibility for reviewing the arrangements for the financial accountability of non-departmental public bodies (NDPBs) lies with Her Majesty's Treasury and the Cabinet Office. Each Home Office NDPB has an Accounting Officer who is responsible to the Home Office Departmental Accounting Officer, and operates in accordance with a financial memorandum agreed by the Department.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what the current average processing time is for immigration applications requesting leave to remain indefinitely.  [116580]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00328w05.html_spnew8"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 The time taken to process an application for indefinite leave to remain in the United Kingdom is affected by a number of factors, including the complexity of individual cases. Over 70 per cent. of all after-entry casework, which includes applications for indefinite leave to remain, is now completed within two weeks of receipt. Applications where further inquiries are needed may take considerably longer. However, streamlined procedures have been introduced throughout the Integrated Casework Directorate to speed up the consideration of all applications, and these processes are regularly reviewed.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department when he intends to implement the rolling electoral register under the provisions of the Representation of the People Act 2000; if he will publish regulations relating to the rolling register in draft form; and if he will make a statement.

 My intention is to bring regulations providing for rolling electoral registration into force with effect from 16 February 2001 (when the next electoral register will take effect). I hope that it will be possible to publish the regulations in draft form.

 There is no statutory prohibition on police officers swearing new oaths voluntarily. However, to take a new police declaration the attestation which they have already made would have to be set aside by statute.

<P>
<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="00328w06.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The Department of Higher and Further Education, Training and Employment has worked with the Further Education Sector to develop guidelines for colleges on a number of health related issues, including physical activities. Further, it has undertaken a mapping exercise on the provision and use of physical education and sports facilities, as part of the Northern Ireland Physical Activity Strategy Action Plan 1999-2002, and as a result has written to the colleges encouraging them to make increased use of such facilities.
<P>

<a name="00328w06.html_para0">The Department has also recently nominated a representative to the Northern Ireland Physical Activity Implementation Group (NIPAIG) which will oversee the implementation of the NI Physical Activity Strategy. One of the key activities of the groups is to consider ways in which Further Education and Higher Education students' participation in fitness and sporting activities can be enhanced and how the time allocated to higher education based teacher training in Physical Education might be increased.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what the student dropout rates were for each further and higher education college in Northern Ireland in each of the past three years; and if he will make a statement.  [114678]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00328w06.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 This Department does not calculate drop out rates for Higher Education institutions. The Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) has calculated projected non-completion rates for full-time students starting first degree courses in Higher Education institutions in the UK. Currently, values are available for 1996-97 only. The values for the Queen's University of Belfast are 10 per cent., and for the University of Ulster are 17 per cent. It should be noted that differences between institutions, such as subject mix or the qualifications on entry of their students make comparisons between institutions unreliable. For this reason HEFCE has produced benchmarks against which an institution's value can be compared. The benchmarks for the Queen's University of Belfast and the University of Ulster are 12 per cent. and 18 per cent. respectively. The methodology used to calculate values and benchmarks is contained in the HEFCE publication "Performance indicators in higher education 1996-97, 1997-98".

<a name="00328w06.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B>

<P>
<P>
<a name="00328w06.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The Department fully recognises the importance of promoting community relations programmes in post-school education.
<P>

<a name="00328w06.html_para2">The Department is setting up a working group together with representatives from the further education sector and the National Union of Students/Unions of Students in Ireland (NUS/USI), to consider how cultural diversity can best be recognised and promoted.
<P>

<a name="00328w06.html_para3">The Northern Ireland Universities have affirmed their commitment to promoting a pluralist environment which celebrates diversity across their campuses. They are working closely with the Student Unions in support of their programme for promoting community relations among students.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00328w06.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The PAFT analysis of the student support arrangements introduced from the 1998-99 academic year recognised that the changes would have beneficial effects for some groups of students, but might also have the potential to act as a disincentive for others entering higher education. It concluded that, in general terms, the policy of maintaining parity in student support matters with England and Wales has been, over the long term, to the advantage of Northern Ireland students and that, in value for money terms, it represented an effective use of resources.

<P>
<a name="00328w06.html_spnew15"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 My Department has written to the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS) asking it to include a question about community background on UCAS application forms completed by Northern Ireland-domiciled students. The request is under consideration and a conclusion may not be reached for some months. Pending the outcome I should say there is no question of my Department forcing UCAS to include a question on community background. Such a question would in any event be subject to voluntary response by the student applicant.

<a name="00328w07.html_para7">Inevitably, however, reductions had to be made in a number of student support programmes to allow priorities to be clearly targeted and, as a consequence, some difficult decisions had to be made. Underpinning these decisions was the objective of concentrating available resources on those students awards which support domestic provision and which have the most economic relevance to Northern Ireland, such as research studentships.
<P>

<a name="00328w07.html_para8">In light of this it was decided not to continue to fund the very small number of awards usually made available to Northern Ireland students wishing to undertake courses at residential institutions for adult education in Great Britain from 1999-2000 academic year.
<P>

<a name="00328w07.html_para9">Nevertheless, support has been sustained for adult education access courses to higher education in Northern Ireland, both through continuing bursaries available at Magee College, University of Ulster and, more importantly, through funding of higher education access courses provided by the Further Education and Higher Education Colleges in conjunction with the local universities. These provide a very important domestic route to higher education for mature students in Northern Ireland who would otherwise be unable to enter higher education through conventional academic channels.

 I refer to the written answer given by the Minister for Europe to my hon. Friend the Member for Gedling (Mr. Coaker) on 14 March 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 142W. The EC Regulation required to give effect to Common Position 2000/176/CFSP suspending the flight ban against the FRY was adopted by the Council of the European Union on 20 March 2000. EC Regulation 607/2000 came into force on 22 March and, in addition to suspending EC Regulation 2151/1999 imposing the flight ban until 28 August 2000, permits, in relation to the suspension of the flight ban, specific exemptions from Regulation 1294/1999 concerning a freeze of funds and a ban on investment, and from Regulation 2111/1999 prohibiting the sale and supply of petroleum products to certain parts of the FRY.

<a name="00328w08.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Corbett: </B> 
To ask the Prime Minister, pursuant to his oral statement on 22 March 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 981-84, what is the proportion of national income that is estimated will be spent on health by the end of 2003-04.  [116869]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00328w08.html_spmin0"><B>The Prime Minister:</B> 
 As announced by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer on 21 March, provision has been made available for the UK which will allow the average real-terms increase for the UK health service over the next four years to be 6.1 per cent. So health service spending will rise from last year's &#163;45.1 billion, and this year's &#163;49.3 billion, to: next year, &#163;54.2 billion; the year after, &#163;58.6 billion; then &#163;63.5 billion; and then from April 2003, &#163;68.7 billion.
<P>

<a name="00328w08.html_para0">As a result, on current forecasts, UK health spending as a proportion of GDP will increase to around 7.6 per cent. by 2003-04. It is expected that spending within the private health care sector will remain at around 1 per cent. of GDP and the overall rise to 7.6 per cent. is almost solely accounted for by the real terms increase in NHS spending.
<P>

<a name="00328w08.html_para1">The 8 per cent. EU average, as calculated by the OECD, is based on total health care spending. It is therefore directly comparable to the 7.6 per cent. figure.

 I do not consider such a system to be necessary, as there are adequate facilities available already. In addition to the taxi light and bell at the Members' Entrance in New Palace Yard, there is an auto-dial telephone programmed with two numbers to the Millbank taxi rank. Hon. Members have absolute priority at all times in summoning taxis at the Members' Entrance, and prior booking arrangements with taxi firms should remain the responsibility of individual hon. Members.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00328w08.html_spnew6"><B> Kate Hoey: </B> 
 The reference to the 20 ft high proposed platform was based on fact. The reference to a size of 10 acres was an unfortunate error, picked up from descriptions given at earlier meetings; the reference should have been to a size of about 5 acres. The proposed 



<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, pursuant to his answer of 28 February 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 51-52W, on the visit of British nuclear officials to Japan, for what reason details of the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate report on irregularities and safety of MOX production at Sellafield were released to the Japanese authorities prior to their official release in the United Kingdom; and which bodies in Japan received the NII reports and under what conditions of confidentiality.  [114141]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00328w08.html_spnew7"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 The Health and Safety Executive's Chief Inspector of Nuclear Installations visited the Japanese nuclear regulator, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), on 7 February 2000 when he made a detailed presentation of his findings into the falsification of pellet diameter quality assurance data in the MOX Demonstration Facility at Sellafield. He also handed over to MITI a pre-publication copy of the report prepared by HM Nuclear Installations Inspectorate (NII), "An investigation of pellet diameter data in the MOX demonstration facility at the BNFL Sellafield site and the effect of this on the safety of MOX fuel in use"<i>.</i> He did this as part of the on-going dialogue between HSE/NII and MITI, as the relevant safety regulators, in view of the importance to Japan of the issues in the report and to allow the Japanese authorities sufficient time to prepare for any inquiries they might receive. The Japanese authorities agreed to make no public comment about the report or HM Chief Inspector's discussions with them before its publication.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00328w08.html_spnew9"><B> Mrs. Liddell </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 27 March 2000]:</i> The length of service of non-executive directors of BNFL varies according to the needs of the company. Subject to this, a non-executive director can normally expect to be appointed for a period of up to three years and, assuming satisfactory performance, can expect a re-appointment for a second term of a similar duration. Further 



<P>

 <i>[holding answer 13 March 2000]:</i> Safety is of paramount importance in the electricity distribution industry and an issue which transcends price controls. Companies have statutory obligations, enforced by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) as well as the Electricity Supply Regulations 1988, which is the responsibility of the Engineering Inspectorate in my Department. The Office of Gas and Electricity Markets, in proposing price controls, takes account of these obligations, and companies, in accepting the price controls, accept their obligations to operate safe networks with the revenues provided.

 I have announced that we shall be exploring with the European Commission the scope for allowing a temporary exemption from climate change levy for natural gas in Northern Ireland for a period of up to five years. This reflects the very different nature of the energy market in Northern Ireland and the fact that gas is only as yet available in a limited area. A temporary exemption will facilitate the development of the infrastructure and make gas available to a greater number of potential customers.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00328w10.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 Climate change levy is only charged on supplies to final consumers. If the proposed exemption from climate change levy for natural gas in Northern Ireland is approved by the European Commission, climate change levy will be charged on all sales of products within the scope of the levy where the customer is located in the United Kingdom, except for sales of natural gas where the customer is located in Northern Ireland. The location of the supplier is not relevant.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will make a statement on the levels of duty on unleaded petrol and lead replacement petrol.  [116119]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00328w11.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 In October 1999 the duty rate for higher octane unleaded petrol was cut from over 5 pence per litre to 2 pence per litre above the rate for unleaded. This was to facilitate the introduction of lead replacement petrol (LRP) which is treated as higher octane unleaded petrol for duty purposes. Following increases in road fuel duties announced in the Budget the rate of duty on higher octane unleaded petrol is now 2.07 pence per litre above that on unleaded petrol.
<P>

<a name="00328w11.html_para0">Although LRP does not contain lead, it will generally be used by cars that formerly used leaded petrol. This part of the car population tends to be older, less fuel efficient than newer cars and, consequently, to have poorer emissions performance. The twin aims therefore are to have a duty rate that is not as high as that on leaded petrol--indeed is less than the former rate on higher octane unleaded--but at the same time to leave in place a measure that encourages replacement of less fuel efficient cars.

There is no single measure which captures the complex problems which need to be overcome.
<P>

<a name="00328w11.html_para4">We are determined to tackle the problems that condemn many individuals and communities to poverty. That is why we set out our strategy for tackling poverty and social exclusion in our first annual report "Opportunity for All" (Cm 4445). The report includes a range of indicators that capture the many aspects of poverty and social exclusion.
<P>

<a name="00328w11.html_para5">We are unable to present low income statistics for Leeds, Central parliamentary constituency and the City of Leeds because they are not statistically robust for areas smaller than geographical regions.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00328w13.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 Each health authority where there is a proposal to establish a primary care trust (PCT) receives a contribution from central funds of &#163;25,000 towards the costs of preparing the proposal for local consultation and of the consultation itself. If the proposal is approved by the Secretary of State, a further central contribution is made towards the preparatory costs of the PCT. This contribution comprises &#163;100,000 for a commissioning only PCT or &#163;175,000 for a PCT which will also provide services. In addition, local health systems are expected to contribute to the costs of establishing and developing a new PCT.

<a name="00328w13.html_para3">Seventeen PCTs have been approved to begin operating from 1 April at a total central cost of &#163;3.325 million. Information is not, however, held centrally on the total cost of establishing each PCT.

 In January, the Government announced a &#163;100 million cash injection which will pay for the most up to date equipment (computed tomography, scanners, simulators and planning computers to calculate radiotherapy doses) to diagnose and treat cancer more quickly and effectively. This &#163;100 million cash boost for cancer is the biggest-ever single investment in cancer equipment in the history of the NHS.

<a name="00328w13.html_para4">This record investment is on top of the allocation of &#163;93 million from the National Lottery that has been allocated for cancer diagnosis and treatment equipment (breast screening equipment--mobile trailers, ultrasound and mammography machines, MRI scanners and linear accelerators) to over 200 NHS hospitals.

 Each National Health Service trust has a nurse executive director who is a member of the trust board. Some are titled "chief nurse", and they could, if they so chose, be called "matron". They are therefore very senior people with influence in their organisation and are responsible for, among other things, quality and nursing standards.
<P>

<a name="00328w14.html_para4">Some are also patient services managers and their role equates more closely to the span of responsibility of the traditional matron. The role of the matron therefore still exists in many trusts across England, albeit with a different title.

 The new resources for the National Health Service announced by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer in his Budget will help the NHS to run balanced budgets year after. A substantial part of the accumulated deficits represent longer term liabilities such as clinical negligence costs for which funding is made available as payment falls due.

<P>
<a name="00328w15.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 Modernising services for older people, including older women, is a priority for this Government. This is why we should be publishing a National Service Framework for Older People later this year. In the meantime, we have already launched an osteoporosis strategy and published an important resource pack for older women called "Enjoy your later life: Physical and Emotional Wellbeing for Older Women". These have been widely welcomed.
