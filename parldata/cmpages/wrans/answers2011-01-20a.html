<i> Notes:</i><br>
1. We interpreted the question's mention of pension pots as a reference to DC pension wealth and therefore provided figures in that context. The estimates quoted reflect DC pension wealth held by employees who are currently contributing to DC occupational pension schemes. These estimates may include DC pension wealth held in more than one pot. They exclude those individuals with zero pension wealth.<br>
2. We provide figures for both mean and median DC occupational pension wealth. The median may provide a better measure compared to the mean since the distribution of private pension wealth can be skewed by a small number of very large amounts of wealth at the top of the distribution.<br>
3. The Wealth and Assets survey (WAS) is a large scale nationally representative longitudinal survey of over 30,000 private households in Great Britain that provides comprehensive information on people's assets and net wealth.<br>
4. The first wave was conducted from July 2006 to June 2008. It collected detailed information on financial and non-financial assets, wealth components such as savings, pensions, property, mortgages and debt as well as people's attitudes and savings behaviour over time.<br>

The four leased C-17 aircraft were bought-out on cessation of the seven year lease period in autumn 2008 and are now owned by the Government.

This was partly offset in 2008-09 to 2009-10 by the withdrawal from Iraq but each tonne of cargo flown to Afghanistan travels considerably more distance than a tonne flown to Iraq, particularly given the requirement for flight routes to avoid Iran. It must also be borne in mind that the landlocked nature of Afghanistan coupled with security constraints demand that we fly much more cargo as a proportion of the total than we did into Iraq.</p>

These are initial estimates and are subject to change as HEIs and students respond to the new funding arrangements. Forecasts are not available at institution level.</p>

 Pursuant to the answer of 10 January 2011, <i> Official Report</i>, column 142W. Government launched consultations on a package of options for reforming the electricity market on 16 December 2010.

 The impact of unconventional gas production on the development of low-carbon energy in the UK will be principally driven by its impact on UK gas prices. The impact of further unconventional production on UK prices will depend on the extent and location of any production, whether production levels exceed or fall short of market expectations, and how it alters the costs of the marginal source of gas supply.</p>

In respect of the sustainability of wood as a feedstock, Government policy is that mechanisms beyond the planning system in the form of the renewables obligation are better placed to ensure the sustainability of fuel used in large-scale biomass electricity generating stations.</p>

 DECC intends shortly to publish a public consultation on the options for the long-term management of the UK's civil plutonium. As part of the work supporting that consultation, the Government commissioned the NDA to examine the costs of the various options, which included the reuse of the plutonium to make MOX fuel. No external work has been commissioned at this stage. We anticipate that further analysis of the costs for a number of options will be necessary to support a final decision, which will only be taken following the consultation process.</p>

 High level radioactive waste (HLW) arises as a liquid from the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel and all the UK's current HLW is located at Sellafield where reprocessing takes place. Liquid HLW is stored at Sellafield in custom designed tanks before being immobilised in a passively safe, solid glass waste-form, through a process known as vitrification. The solid HLW is safely stored and monitored in a purpose built store at Sellafield pending return to overseas customers or final disposal in the proposed geological disposal facility. The UK has a strong and effective nuclear safety regulatory regime that ensures the safe storage and management of radioactive waste including HLW.</p>

<i> [holding answer 20 December 2010]:</i> On 13 December, the Government announced that in 2011-12, the level of the pupil premium will be £430 per pupil and will be the same for every deprived pupil, no matter where they live. The pupil premium will be allocated to those pupils eligible for free school meals identified by the January 2011 census figures for pupils in years from Reception to Year 11. The premium will be funded by financial year not academic year. However, were the January 2010 census figures used then there would be a notional allocation for pupils in Durham of £6 million. This figure could rise or fall depending on the number of eligible pupils at January 2011, and is indicative only.</p>

<i> [holding answer 20 December 2010]:</i> We have made estimates of the number of pupils eligible for the pupil premium for each local authority, based on 2010 data. According to these estimates for Staffordshire, 13,250 pupils eligible for free school meals would attract the premium, as well as 485 children looked after by the local authority, and 315 children of service personnel. This totals 14,050 pupils eligible for the pupil premium in Staffordshire, attracting a pupil premium of £5.97 million in total. The actual level number of eligible pupils in Staffordshire and therefore the amount payable will be taken from the January 2011 school census.</p>

 We believe that schools are best placed to decide the most appropriate support for their pupils.

 For 2011-12, we are continuing with the current methodology for funding local authorities and schools to allow for the clear and transparent introduction of the pupil premium. This means that local authorities will continue to be responsible, in consultation with their Schools Forums, for deciding how to allocate money between the schools they maintain.

 As has been the practice for a number of years Ministers do not directly receive draft Independent Monitoring Board reports when the IMBs submit them. The reports are firstly submitted to the IMB Secretariat. Then NOMS officials prepare a draft response to all the points on which the individual IMBs have requested a response both directed to Ministers and NOMS. I then consider the reply and, having also examined the issues raised directly for Ministers, write to the Chair. At the time of the disturbance the Board had submitted its report and the draft response was being prepared. The report was available in Gold Command directing the incident at Ford, where I first saw it. It was confirmed to me that the report would form part of the documentation of the investigation into the incident. I will respond to the Chair of the IMB in February after I have been informed of the findings of the NOMS investigation report.</p>

If a patient does not provide evidence of exemption when the prescription is dispensed, he or she may subsequently be randomly selected for verification checks (by the primary care trust, local counter fraud section).

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health what the difference is in the number of projected deaths from swine flu between the Government's vaccination policy and a policy to vaccinate all those aged under five. [34940]</p>

 The Government's policy on influenza vaccination is informed by the expert advice of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI). The policy focuses on offering the vaccine to those at greatest risk from the effects of influenza. JCVI does not recommend that children under the age of five outside the at-risk groups should be vaccinated.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_503"><a name="110120w0003.htm_para75"><a name="11012064000315">On 30 December, JCVI met to review its advice on seasonal influenza vaccination. It issued the following statement:</p>
<a name="110120w0003.htm_brev36"><a name="11012064000503"><ul><p class="tabletext">"JCVI was presented with data on the current seasonal influenza epidemiology, seroepidemological data collected during the 2009-10 pandemic, modelling of the impact of vaccination strategies during the pandemic, data on the effectiveness of influenza vaccines in the young and vaccine uptake and safety data.</p>
</ul><a name="110120w0003.htm_brev37"><a name="11012064000504"><ul><p class="tabletext">JCVI noted that a large proportion of those individuals with severe disease are in recognised risk groups for influenza but were not vaccinated. JVCI re-iterated its previous advice that all individuals in risk groups should be vaccinated as soon as possible, particularly those aged less than 65 years.</p>
</ul><a name="110120w0003.htm_brev38"><a name="11012064000505"><ul><p class="tabletext">The committee considered the issue of offering vaccination to healthy children either 0-4 years and/or 5-15 years of age. However, although there is a high incidence of influenza-like illness currently in these age groups, a significant proportion of this is due to other viruses such Respiratory Syncytial Virus. In addition, only a very small proportion of those with severe disease are in these age groups. Based on previous seasonal influenza epidemiology it would be hoped that influenza circulation will have subsided within a month. We do not believe that seasonal or pandemic vaccine should be used for these or other healthy person groups. The greatest gain will be achieved in increasing vaccine uptake in the clinical risk groups."</p>

Such projections, if conducted, would be highly uncertain as they would depend on a number of factors that are unknown or uncertain including, the existing immunity to swine influenza infection in different age groups of the population, the vaccination coverage in different groups of the population and how quickly immunity would accrue in these groups, and the effectiveness of vaccination.</p>
