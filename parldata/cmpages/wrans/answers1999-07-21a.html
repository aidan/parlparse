 Promotion of the use of the rail network will be one of the main objectives of the Strategic Rail Authority, to be established by the Railways Bill which received its second reading on 19 July. Meanwhile the shadow Strategic Rail Authority has been in operation since 1 April and is making a head start on the strategic planning which the industry needs. We have made three key rail appointments, which look to the future of railway industry.
<P>

<a name="90721w01.htm_para1">February's National Rail Summit produced commitments from the industry to deliver year on year improvements in terms of new drivers, new trains and better performance.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what plans he has to allow motorcycle couriers to use bus lanes in London.  [91488]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90721w01.htm_spnew2"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 We currently have no plans to allow motorcycle couriers to use bus lanes in London. Two pilot projects have been conducted in Bristol and Reading on the use of bus lanes by powered two wheelers. These were a useful source of information about the traffic and safety effects on powered two wheelers. But there was no monitoring of the situation before implementation and there are unanswered questions about their impact on pedal cyclists and the abuse of bus lanes by other drivers. We would, therefore, welcome proposals from local authorities interested in conducting properly monitored pilot studies of the use of bus lanes by motorcycles to help inform decisions on whether there is a case for motorcyclists to be allowed to use bus lanes.

 The London-wide expansion of the Traffic Director/Metropolitan Police to use cameras to enforce bus lanes was announced last year. Every bus lane in London will be covered by March 2003.

 None. Should the proposed Task Force identify any projects where support for physical regeneration may be required then it is for English Partnerships to consider each project proposal on its merits, against London-wide priorities, and in light of the resources available to the Agency.

 Issues relating to accommodation are a matter for the North West Development Agency. The English Partnerships office at Cockermouth transferred to the Agency on 1 April 1999. I understand that the portfolio of premises, including the offices at Lakeland Business Park, is valued annually by independent valuers. The most recent valuation took place on 31 March and reflected the occupation of the premises by Agency staff. For commercial reasons the precise detail of the annual valuation is confidential.

The estate at Lakeland Business Park consists of a number of office blocks, one of which is occupied by NWDA staff. The premises at Lakeland Business Park are owned by the NWDA and any proceeds from the sale of those premises would come to the Agency subject to the Department of Environment, Transport and the Regions' accounting regulations.

 Enforcement of the law in respect of cycling offences is an operational matter for individual chief officers of police. The hazards caused by cyclists who ride through red lights and who cycle inconsiderately on the pavement are recognised by chief officers and appropriate action is taken where such offences are detected. In order to assist the police, we are introducing, from 1 August, a fixed penalty for the offence of cycling on the pavement. Chief officers recognise that the fixed penalty will need to be used with a considerable degree of discretion and it cannot be issued to anyone under the age of 16. But it will provide the police service with a direct and simple means of dealing with inconsiderate cycling.

 The available information is on grants of British citizenship and the issue of non- settlement entry clearance at the British Embassies in Tirana, or in Rome and Istanbul which were the designated entry clearance issuing posts for applicants resident in Albania before the British Embassy in Tirana provided full entry clearance-issuing facilities in 1999.

<P><I>21 Jul 1999 : Column: 530</I><P>
Union for the Abolition of Vivisection (BUAV) in so far as they relate to possible contraventions of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986; the terms and conditions of licences and certificates issues under the 1986 Act; and the Codes of Practice issued under section 21(2) of the Act. I have asked that, should any other indications of possible contraventions be uncovered during the course of the investigation, these be investigated too. The investigation is not restricted to any particular part of the establishment or to the material contained in the BUAV's report or compilation video tape recording.
<P>

<a name="90721w05.htm_para9">One Superintending Inspector is heading the investigation. He is being assisted, as necessary, by other members of the Inspectorate and by other civil servants in the Animal Procedures Section at the Home Office.

<a name="90721w05.htm_para10">I have not set a time limit on the investigation. We are still waiting to receive from the BUAV the evidence that they collected, and the amount of time needed will depend on what this material shows and the other findings that emerge from the investigation. I expect, however, that it could take two to three months to complete. I will receive reports at appropriate points during the investigation and any immediate action needed to protect animal welfare will be taken.

widely circulated to interested parties across Northern Ireland and further copies may be obtained by contacting the Authority. As demonstrated by the announcement in March last year of the new Targeting Social Need initiative, the Government remain committed to securing equality of opportunity and equity of treatment for all the people of Northern Ireland. The rules of this competition have been developed in line with this policy and the awarding of funds will also be so governed.

 Individual partnerships will receive a full report on any police objections to proposed town centre CCTV schemes.

 Eurofighter workshare entitlements are based on the number of aircraft each of the four partner nations is purchasing.

Any imbalances that arise between production activity levels and entitlements will be addressed during the life of the programme using mechanisms established in the Eurofighter Memoranda of Understanding signed by the four partner nations in December 1997.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how many redundancies there will be in Exeter following the removal of 43 Brigade to Bulford, Netheravon and Tidworth.  [91566]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90721w06.htm_spnew10"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson: </B> 
 Our current estimate is that 27 people may be made redundant; this excludes members of the MOD Guard Service. The effect on MOD Guard Service personnel will depend on the future access control requirements at Wyvern Barracks, Exeter, which are yet to be finally determined.

<a name="90721w06.htm_spnew11"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson: </B> 
 The 'garrison radio' service at Colchester is part of a trial facility over a 12 month period from April this year at the four largest UK mainland Army garrisons, as part of the Army's Corporate Communications Strategy. The facility uses a short-term (28 day) restricted service licence granted by the Radio Authority and each location (Bulford/Tidworth, Catterick, Colchester and Aldershot) will be covered twice during the trial period. A decision on the future of this service will be made following an assessment of the outcome of these trials and the availability of suitable frequency licences.

 <i>[holding answer 20 July 1999]:</i> A large number of official documents were generated during the period of the previous Administration, many of which were published or put in the public domain. Since May 1997, the Department has been guided by the convention governing access to the papers of a previous Administration, as set out in the then Prime Minister's reply to a written question on 24 January 1980, <i>Official Report</i>, columns <i>305-07</i>.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence when he plans to announce the outcome of his Department's review of the defence response to the threat posed by biological and chemical weapons; and if he will make a statement.  [92694]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90721w07.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. George Robertson: </B> 
 I have today placed in the Library of the House a paper setting out the conclusions of our review. The paper entitled "Defending Against the Threat from Biological and Chemical Weapons", explains our policy and the ways in which we plan to develop our capabilities further.
<P>

<a name="90721w07.htm_para0">We will continue to pursue, through international agreement, the verifiable elimination of biological and chemical weapons. Valuable progress has been made in recent years as a result of our efforts, but there is a long way to go before our objectives are met in full. In the meantime, we recognise that the use, or threatened use, of these weapons remains one of the potential challenges we must face.




<P>
<P><I>21 Jul 1999 : Column: 537</I><P>

<P>

<a name="90721w07.htm_para1">I therefore place a high priority on ensuring that our Armed Forces are protected, with the training and equipment they need to deal with the risks such weapons continue to pose. We are enhancing our capabilities with a range of equipment programmes, for example by bringing into service additional Prototype Biological Detection Systems. We are also establishing the Joint Nuclear, Biological and Chemical (NBC) Regiment, and an NBC Defence Headquarters. As a result of our review, I have also set up a new Central Staffs Directorate in the Ministry of Defence to co-ordinate and take forward further work on NBC defence issues. They will maintain a rolling plan of action and report progress to me on a regular basis. In total we plan to spend over &#163;270 million in this area over the next three years.
<P>

<a name="90721w07.htm_para2">No potential adversary should believe that the use, or threatened use, of biological or chemical weapons would determine the outcome of a conflict or deter this government from taking action it believes is right.

<P>

<a name="90721w07.htm_para3">These figures include new appointments as well as reappointments.
<P>

<a name="90721w07.htm_para4">Appointments to the Armed Forces Pay Review Body are not included as they are made by the Prime Minister. Appointments to the technical Boards under the Defence Scientific Advisory Council are not included (they have previously been included in answers to similar questions). The Cabinet Office has recently agreed that as these Boards are sub-Committees of the Council they should not be classified as advisory NDPBs. Appointments to the Council itself are included.
<P>

<a name="90721w07.htm_para5">Within the overriding principle of selection based on merit, MOD is committed to increasing diversity in appointments to its NDPBs and raising the representation of women, people from ethnic minority groups and disabled people in line with government-wide objectives. To this end MOD publishes an annual Plan for Public Appointments and Equal Opportunities (the plan for 1999-2002 was published in "Quangos: Opening up Public Appointments") which sets objectives and targets.

To date we have received one representation on the availability of pre-1066 English history at A-level, as well as early day motion 829 tabled on 15 July.

 In June 1997, this Department and the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions jointly commissioned the London Research Centre to carry out a study on the impact of the rent restriction rules introduced in 1996--the Local Reference Rent and the Single Room Rent. The study also focused on exceptional hardship payments and pre-tenancy determinations. The findings have been published by DETR in the report entitled "Housing Benefit and the Private Rented Sector", a copy of which was placed in the Library.

 I met Senator Jocelyn Newman, the Australian Minister for Family and Community Services, on 12 July. Senator Newman informed me that, because the United Kingdom Government do not uprate State Retirement Pensions paid in Australia, her Government intended to terminate the bilateral social security agreement between the United Kingdom and Australia. Senator Newman subsequently issued a public statement to this effect.
<P>

<a name="90721w09.htm_para0">It would be unfortunate if there was an end to this long-standing agreement. UK and Australian pensioners would lose out, although no one already receiving a benefit under the agreement would be affected. The UK Government will continue to work closely with the Australian Government on issues of common concern.

(6) In January, the Trust decided that they wanted to review their establishment with aim of possibly reducing the number of board members from five to four. At the end of April the Trust made the decision to stay with five board members. A collective decision was made that in trying to identify candidates that recommendations should go at the same time as recommendations to fill the November appointment.<P>

<P>

(7) Submission to fill the vacancy sent to Minister on 8 June 1999. Delay in putting forward recommendations due to Chairmanship not being filled until March and wanting to take in to account new chairman's views on possible recommendations.<P>

<P>

(8) Vacancy has been outstanding since June 1998. RO have been searching for suitable female candidates to put forward after discussing the requirements with the local chair. Have now identified suitable candidates who are meeting the local chairman informally later this month. A submission will go forward after local discussions are complete.<P>

<P>

(9) New chairman appointed 1 December 1998--taking opportunity to assess the strength and weaknesses of the board before considering candidates for this vacancy.<P>

(10) Minister indicated that he wanted ethnic minority candidate to consider for the remaining vacancy on this board. Suitable candidates specific to the local area are still being identified.<P>

<P>

(11) When making the submission in November 1998 there were three appointments which came to an end plus on ad-hoc vacancy that needed to be filled. Regional Chairman recommended that only two of the four posts be filled. This would allow them to identify other suitable candidates coming forward from the national ad. Given that the Trust are now likely to merge the vacancy is being held open pending possible merger.<P>

We collect ethnicity and disability data using the Cabinet Office's classification. Further details are available from http://www.doh.gov.uk/public/stats1.htm.

 We have pledged to tackle unacceptable levels of geographical variations in access to infertility treatment and have set in motion a programme of work to achieve that aim. A Departmental survey of current health authority infertility service provision is taking place at the moment to enable the cost implications of any policy changes to be estimated. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists aim to complete their third, and final, set of evidence based clinical guidelines on infertility this autumn and these will indicate the circumstances in which infertility treatment can be most clinically effective. We can then move towards fairer access to National Health Service infertility services where those most able to benefit from such treatment receive it.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health, pursuant to his letter of 30 June, regarding beta interferon, what plans he has to improve the quality of life for multiple sclerosis sufferers.  [90810]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90721w10.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The National Health Service is there to provide services for everybody on the basis of clinical need and it provides a considerable number of services to which people with Multiple Sclerosis have access. Under the present system it is, of course, for health authorities and primary care groups to plan and arrange the services available to people in their care. They are closest to the people they serve and best placed to respond sensitively to their needs.
<P>

<a name="90721w10.htm_para0">We remain committed to improving standards of healthcare. We have set out our plans to address unacceptable variations in services via a modernisation programme to deliver more consistent and higher quality care for patients. New treatments, including new medicines, are introduced into the NHS as fast as possible where they represent a genuine therapeutic advance and are cost effective.
<P>

<a name="90721w10.htm_para1">In addition, the move to new commissioning arrangements will bring about improvements in services for people with conditions like MS. Longer term agreements, reflecting dialogue between clinicians and focusing on health improvement and quality objectives will increase the emphasis on programmes of care that cross the traditional boundaries to meet patients' needs best.
<P>

<P>
<a name="90721w10.htm_spnew3"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 The United Kingdom voted in favour of the proposal for the injury prevention programme set out in Common Position 70/98 under the qualified majority voting procedure and now adopted by Decision No 372/1999/EC.
<P>

<a name="90721w10.htm_para4">The programme is a valuable initiative which we believe will enhance injury prevention work in the UK for a relatively modest outlay. In particular it will allow for the further development of a Community injury database, initially a continuation of the European Home and Leisure Accident Surveillance System (EHLASS), which has driven the raising of safety standards safety throughout Europe.
<P>

<a name="90721w10.htm_para5">Implementation of the programme is expected to cost euro 14 million (estimated &#163;9.9 million) over five years, of which the UK contribution is estimated at &#163;358,000 per annum. This, however, will be offset by payments the UK will receive under the programme for the supply of information to the database. The precise figures for these payments has yet to be determined but similar payments to the UK under the EHLASS system in 1996 amounted to &#163;216,000.

 Local authorities and health authorities are responsible for determining local needs and priorities for drug and alcohol treatment in their areas and for arranging the provision of services accordingly through the statutory or voluntary sector. Such services could include detoxification where a need for such a service is identified.
<P>

<a name="90721w10.htm_para7">One of the objectives of the Government's drugs strategy is to increase the participation of problem drug users in treatment programmes. One of the main objectives of the United Kingdom anti-drugs co-ordinator's first annual report and national plan is that by the end of 1999-2000 each Drug action team will have to produce an action plan to meet the local demand for detoxification and substitute prescribing services and community based structured therapeutic programmes.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90721w10.htm_spnew9"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 The Government are keen to reduce the availability of prescribed controlled drugs such as methadone on the illicit market. Revised clinical guidelines for doctors treating drug misusers were launched in April and sent to all GPs as well as specialists working within the field of drug misuse. They emphasise the importance of supervising the consumption of controlled drugs such as methadone, to improve patient compliance and prevent prescribed drugs reaching the illegal market. Instalment dispensing is also recommended, to avoid drug misusers receiving prescriptions for large quantities of drugs. The working group of experts which drew up the Clinical Guidelines also made a number of recommendations for additional controls on prescribing to addicts. These are intended to underpin the Guidelines by ensuring that only doctors who are properly trained and resourced engage in addiction treatment. The Government will soon be consulting on these proposals.

It takes about four weeks to process a certificate application (against one week for registration cards) because of the compliance checks. Where a subcontractor applies for a certificate late there may now not be enough time to make sure that it is processed before 1 August. Where the Inland Revenue consider that there is not enough time to process the certificate application they will arrange for a registration card, or temporary tax payment card to be issued so that the subcontractor can be paid.

 <i>[holding answer 20 July 1999]:</i> There is no waiting list for subcontractors who wish to apply for registration cards or certificates for the construction industry scheme. A subcontractor must complete an application form and take it to a tax office for an identity check. This can be done almost immediately. On average it takes one week to process an application form for a registration card.

 BNFL and the Government regard safety, health and the environment as being of paramount importance. That is why the targets set for BNFL look to the company to achieve continuous and measurable improvement against the Safety, Health and Environment (SHE) Index. The Index is based on similar indices used in the United States, including the US Department of Energy, and will measure the company's performance against standards achieved in conventional, radiological and environmental safety, and health. The Index is being developed by BNFL in close discussion with the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate and the Environment Agencies.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what proportion of those ex-miners receiving compensation for respiratory diseases are having their cases settled under the expedited payment system; and what proportion are receiving payments under the system by which compensation is reduced due to other factors.  [92062]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90721w14.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 To date Healthcall--the service provider--has carried out some 3,300 spirometry tests. Of these, we have processed 1,793 and offers of expedited payments have been made to 500 of these. The number actually receiving payments will depend on how many claimants accept the offers.

<a name="90721w14.htm_wqn5"><B> Mr. Trickett: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what estimate he has made of the total number of recipients of compensation for former miners suffering from respiratory diseases; how many cases have been <i>(a)</i> settled and <i>(b)</i> paid; what is the average number of cases settled each week; and what steps he is taking to speed up the processing of claims.  [92099]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90721w14.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 The Department have received some 77,000 claims from former miners, and their dependants, for compensation for respiratory diseases. We anticipate receiving in excess of 100,000 in total. The Department is unable to estimate how many of these claimants will receive compensation until they have all passed through the procedures contained in the handling arrangements which are still to be finally agreed with those representing the claimants. Pending the signing of the handling arrangement, full and final settlements have so far been made to the seven lead cases decided by the court. In addition the Department has made offers of interim payments and bereavement awards to 13,700 claimants, totalling some &#163;31 million.
<P>

<a name="90721w14.htm_para0">A contract for a national programme of spirometry testing for all respiratory disease claimants has been awarded and testing centres are being established in coalmining areas. This will enable us to make further interim payments and, in some cases, full and final offers to those who may not wish to pursue their claim further. We are also tendering for the delivery of the national medical assessment process and we hope to make the first full and final settlement offers later this year.

[92064]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90721w14.htm_spnew6"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 We have made some 500 interim payments in the form of bereavement awards, totalling nearly &#163;4.3 million over the last six months. A further 1,600 claims, accompanied by valid death certificates supporting the claims, have been received but require validation of the deceased's work history. The procedure for carrying out this validation has been agreed only very recently with the plaintiff solicitors. We are now processing these outstanding claims as a matter of urgency.

[91537]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90721w14.htm_spnew8"><B> Mr. Vaz: </B> 
 The Lord Chancellor assumed responsibility for judicial appointments in Northern Ireland in 1973. Successive Lord Chancellors, including the present Lord Chancellor, have adopted a policy of continuous improvement to the appointments processes, of appointment purely on merit and of ensuring equality of opportunity.
<P>

<a name="90721w14.htm_para2">The Lord Chancellor has recently extended his practice of advertising vacancies for judicial office to include the post of High Court Judge and such advertisements include a statement on the Lord Chancellor's equal opportunities policy.
<P>

<a name="90721w14.htm_para3">Posts are advertised (in professional journals) and there are job descriptions and detailed objective selection criteria as appropriate.

 The current complement of full-time judicial office-holders in Northern Ireland is 53. The perceived community origin of appointees is not a factor in judicial appointments and so is not recorded as part of the judicial appointments process. Details of gender and age of these postholders are as outlined.

 Judicial appointments in Northern Ireland from 1991 to July 1999 are as set out. Information prior to 1991 could be obtained only at disproportionate cost. The perceived community origin of appointees is not a factor in judicial appointments and so is not recorded as part of the judicial appointments process.

<a name="90721w15.htm_spnew15"><B> Mr. Kilfoyle: </B> 
 This Government achieved much through the Amsterdam Intergovernmental Conference (IGC) in terms of rasing the importance of the better European regulation agenda. In particular, the Protocol on subsidiarity and proportionality requires the Commission to take due account of the potential burdens from proposed legislation. These successes, along with the consensus among member states for a short, focused IGC, mean this Government do not intend to push for wide areas of the Treaties to be opened up for renegotiation. However, the Government do believe that the principles of better regulation should influence the EU's decisions making process and will be pushing for this as part of their wider objectives for reform of the Commission and other institutions.
