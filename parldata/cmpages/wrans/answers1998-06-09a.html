<P>
<a name="80609w01.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Clappison: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what is his most recent estimate of the period he intends to set as a time limit between arrest and first appearance in court for a person under 18 years under section 22A(1) of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985 as amended by section 41 of the Crime and Disorder Bill.  [44348]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80609w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 A decision on the level at which the statutory time limits should be set will be taken after piloting and once we have assessed the impact of new measures contained in the Crime and Disorder Bill [<i>Lords</i>] on time taken through the criminal justice system. Our plans for introducing a statutory time limit between arrest and first appearance in court, and for introducing statutory time limits for other stages in proceedings for a person under 18 years, are set out in chapter 10 of the White Paper 'No More Excuses--A New Approach To Tackling Youth Crime in England and Wales' (CM3809: November 1997). We intend first to pilot certain of the procedural changes introduced by the Crime and Disorder Bill, in particular provisions in section 46 (powers of magistrates' courts exercisable by single justice) and section 47 (early administrative hearings). Sites for these 'Narey' pilot areas were announced in the reply I gave to my hon. Friend the Member for Portsmouth, North (Mr. Rapson) on 3 June 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>219</i>. The six areas are: Tyneside; Croydon; Blackburn and Burnley; Northamptonshire; North Staffordshire; and North Wales. Two of these areas--Blackburn and Northamptonshire--will also operate the final warning scheme and youth offending teams, since these arrangements will have an effect on speed through the system and procedures in young offender cases. We aim to begin the pilots in October this year to run for six months. These will be followed by pilots of statutory time limits which we aim to begin in autumn 1999 and run for 12 months. A decision on the level at which time limits should be set, including the time limit

from arrest and the date of first appearance in court, will be made for pilot purposes in the light of the initial 'Narey' pilots and for national rollout in the light of the statutory time limit pilots.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80609w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 Information on the remand of juveniles in police custody in police stations is not collected centrally.
<P>

<a name="80609w01.html_para2">Section 38(6) of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 requires arrested juveniles under the age of 17 who are detained by the police to be moved to local authority accommodation unless:

<a name="80609w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend announced the Government's response to the Home Affairs Committee report into police disciplinary and complaints procedures in England and Wales on 23 March 1998, <i>Official Report,</i> columns 21-37. New arrangements will be brought into effect on 1 April 1999 which will make significant changes to the current arrangements for dealing with misconduct by police officers, as well as providing, for the first time, formal provisions for tackling poor performance by individual officers. As far as complaints by members of the public are concerned, a number of Committee recommendations which have been accepted will require primary legislation. These will be made when suitable opportunities arise, whilst other measures will be taken forward in consultation with interested parties. New discipline arrangements applying to senior officers will be introduced as soon as possible after 1 April 1999 and will mirror, as far as possible, those which will apply to the rest of the police service.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what were the running costs in the past two years, and what are the forecast running costs over the next four years, of <i>(a)</i> Cardiff Prison and <i>(b)</i> Parc Prison, Bridgend.  [44009]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80609w01.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 The running costs of Cardiff prison were &#163;10.97m in 1996/97 and &#163;11.079m in 1997/98. In 1998/99 the figure is forecast to be &#163;11.09m. The budget for the following three years will not be set until the outcome of the Comprehensive Spending Review is known.

<a name="80609w01.html_para3">Parc prison opened on 15 November 1997. From then until 30 April 1998, payments of nearly &#163;7m plus value added tax were made to the managing contractor. This figure relates to the provision of the whole custodial service, including prison capital and financing costs, and cannot be compared with the running costs of an existing directly managed prison.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what is the estimated cost of conversion of the former holiday camp at Middleton Sands, Morecambe, to a temporary prison, separately identifying costs of improvements to the access road and environmental improvements to the site.  [43658]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80609w01.html_spnew9"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 As at December 1997, the estimated costs for converting the camp to a prison for a three-year period varied between &#163;18.7 million to &#163;25.7 million, the variation depending on the number of prisoners to be held and the level of facilities to be provided.
<P>

<a name="80609w01.html_para4">The estimated costs for works to the access road, &#163;150,000, and for permanent environmental improvements, &#163;815,000, are included in the overall costs.
<P>

<a name="80609w01.html_para5">Figures are subject to inflation and additional costs due to deterioration of the existing buildings since the Prison Service's feasibility study was carried out in December 1997.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

<i>(a)</i> Fines imposed includes fines, costs, compensation awards and contributions to Legal Aid. Also included are fines etc. imposed at other courts which have been transferred to this court for enforcement. Fines etc. imposed locally but transferred out to other courts for enforcement have been excluded<P>

<i>(b)</i> Amount collected includes payments against amounts imposed in previous years as well as the current year, and amounts remitted by the courts, but exclude amounts written off<P>

<i>(c)</i> Amounts written off may have been imposed in previous years as well as the current year<P>

<i>(d) Criteria for write off</i><P>

The defendant's/defaulter's whereabouts are unknown and cannot be traced<P>

The defendant/defaulter is known to have emigrated or gone abroad and there is very little real prospect of return or recovery of the sum<P>

The defendant/defaulter has died. However if a fine was involved and the fine itself was particularly high, the justices clerk may wish to consider whether the estate has benefited from the crime. Only if it is clear that it has, should consideration be given to lodging a claim against the estate and any subsequent request to write off should show this has been done and the outcome of the action<P>

The defendant has been sent to a mental health institution for a period of 12 months or more<P>

The court has despatched a notice to a defendant who was not present in court informing him in error of a lesser fine, contribution to costs order that the court imposed--in such cases the balance would be considered for write off<P>

The sum outstanding is less than &#163;5 and is considered to be not worth pursuing<P>

As a result of subsequent proceedings the defendant is sentenced to imprisonment for a period of 12 months more<P>

The sum was imposed or awarded against a limited company which has subsequently been wound up or, where there are no goods on which to levy distress, the company has ceased trading and it is not considered financially worthwhile for the court to initiate<P>

A serviceman has been sentenced to a period of military corrective training<P>

The defendant has moved permanently to Scotland<P>

Other, where circumstances for write off are not covered by any of the above criteria, and grounds for write off are provided in a separate note<P>

<P>
<a name="80609w03.html_spnew3"><B> Dr. Reid: </B> 
 The role of the Combined Arms Tactical Trainer (CATT) simulation system is primarily to assist in the training of an armoured Battle Group (BG). It will allow a BG to practice both its tactical and command procedures without having to deploy onto a training area. CATT will realistically simulate a warfighting environment with its inherent friction. All training will be closely monitored, thus allowing mistakes to be immediately rectified and thereby more fully preparing the BG for the culmination of its training at BATUS in Canada and in Poland. Additionally, like all simulation systems, CATT should reduce the costs of BG deployments as a result of reduced track mileage and equipment support, whilst alleviating environmental pressure on training areas. Due to the flexibility of the system, as well as current main equipments being simulated, there is scope for equipments such as helicopters and future equipments such as the Multi-Roled Armoured Vehicle to be incorporated into the system. Ultimately, with the ability to network with CATT UK, there will also be the opportunity for an armoured brigade HQ to train two BGs simultaneously, thus practising another level of command.

 The 33 Territorial Army infantry battalions are set out in the following list, together with their identifiable costs for the year 1997-98. The figures given are manpower costs only, and include the costs of TA, Regular and Civilian staff employed at the units; other costs incurred are not separated from wider Army financial provision and cannot therefore be directly attributed to particular TA units.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer how lender of last resort operations will be co-ordinated during Stage Three of Economic and Monetary Union; and which individuals or bodies will be responsible for this.  [44454]<P>

<P>
<a name="80609w05.html_spnew1"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 The Treaty of Maastricht does not cover lender of last resort responsibilities. Under the Treaty, Member States and their national authorities therefore remain solely responsible for such matters.

 There are no settled criteria for the award of city status to towns in Scotland. Such an award has not been made since Dundee was awarded city status in 1889. Any further award would be a matter for Her Majesty The Queen acting under the Royal Prerogative on the advice of the Government of the day. There are no plans to recommend such an award in Scotland at present.

 The Scottish Legal Aid Board will shortly be publishing its full accounts on an accruals basis in its Annual Report and the hon. and learned Member will be sent a copy. In cash terms, the provisional expenditure on criminal legal aid in 1997-98 was &#163;82.054 million. The Board also spent &#163;7.583 million on advice and assistance in criminal matters and &#163;2.438 million on Advice by Way of Representation (ABWOR), most of which was spent on criminal cases. The estimated cost, in cash terms, of administering criminal legal aid in 1997-98 was &#163;2.340 million and that of the criminal elements of advice and assistance and ABWOR was &#163;0.841 million.

 The 18th Seaward Petroleum Licensing Round has opened with the publication of the formal offer notice in the Official Journal of the European Communities.
<P>

<a name="80609w06.html_para13">The notice invites applications for unlicensed acreage in the northern, central, and southern North Sea and in the northern half of the Irish Sea, Liverpool Bay, and Morecambe Bay. These are established oil and gas provinces where licences were last offered in 1994.

<a name="80609w06.html_para14">Interest is expected, in particular, from companies keen to use new data acquisition and processing techniques to locate structures similar to recent finds in other sectors of the North Sea or elsewhere in the world, or to identify new resources close to producing fields which may extend the life of their existing offshore infrastructure.
<P>

<a name="80609w06.html_para15">The offer includes blocks relinquished by previous licencees in response to the fallow blocks initiative, which has encouraged companies to hand back acreage for which they have no current exploration or development plans, and so to make it available for others to explore and exploit where possible.
<P>

<a name="80609w06.html_para16">A number of unlicensed blocks in the broad areas covered by the round have been excluded from this round, either for environmental protection reasons on the advice of the Joint Nature Conservation Committee, or to protect the interests of other sea users.
<P>

<a name="80609w06.html_para17">Drilling and development activity under licences awarded in this round will be subject to the requirements of regulations to implement the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive (85/337/EEC) as it applies to the offshore oil and gas industry which came into effect on 30 April 1998. The regulations apply to all relevant projects, irrespective of the date of the licence under which they are carried out, and will give the public access to project Environmental Statements on which they can comment to the Government.
<P>

<a name="80609w06.html_para18">The closing dates for the receipt of applications will be 10 and 11 September. I hope the industry will take full advantage of the licensing opportunities available to them.

<a name="80609w07.html_spnew6"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 We point out to UK investors seeking to investigate commercial opportunities in Russia that there are now a large number of successful UK investments. However, companies wishing to invest continue to face many obstacles, primarily resulting from the lack of transparency in the legal and fiscal framework for doing business and, therefore, good preparation is essential. As far as the remainder of the old USSR is concerned, the investment situation is very variable. As a general rule, at the present time, we would not encourage UK companies to seek out investment opportunities in Belarus, Moldova or Ukraine. The countries of Central Asia and Transcaucasia (with the exception of Tadjikistan) do present investment opportunities in a limited range of sectors but, again, the overall lack of transparency means good preparation is essential. The situation in the three Baltic States is different as the investment framework is now much more amenable to doing business.

 The Commissioner's White Paper recognises that net employment figures in the renewable energy sector are difficult to predict and calculate.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(i) Strategic planning--The Mayor will be required to draw up a Spatial Development Strategy in place of the current guidance issued by the Secretary of State.

In the case of Leeds suburban services, the Franchising Director works with the West Yorkshire Passenger Transport Executive (PTE), which is also a signatory to the franchise contract, to achieve that. I understand that Railtrack is undertaking a project to increase a capacity on the western approaches to Leeds station and that Railtrack and the PTE regularly review available station capacity for peak services at Leeds.

 It has not been established that any loss of trade will occur from the proximity of the GM maize trial to Riverford Farm and in view of this it is inappropriate to consider compensation. I hope the matter will be resolved satisfactorily.

 I have today announced the introduction of new non-statutory procedures for authorising marine dredging. They are intended to address concerns raised previously by the Crown Estate, environmental organisations and the dredging industry about the present arrangements and are intended as an interim arrangement until such time as statutory procedures can be introduced. The interim procedures, copies of which have been placed in the House Library, will apply in England and Wales and have been developed following extensive consultation with Government Departments, the Crown Estate, the

<P>

<a name="80609w13.html_para7">I also announced that the Government intend to introduce statutory procedures for authorising the extraction of minerals by marine dredging by March 1999. These will implement the requirements of EEC Directive 85/337/EEC (as amended by EEC Directive 11/97/EEC) on Environmental Impact Assessment insofar as it applies to the extraction of minerals by marine dredging. There will be appropriate consultation on the provisions.

<P>
<a name="80609w14.html_wqn0"><B> Mrs. Fiona Jones: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what action is being taken to combat exploitative activities by agricultural gangmasters.  [45123]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80609w14.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The Government have been very concerned about the activities of certain agricultural gangmasters who exploit workers, defraud the Government and undermine the businesses of those gangmasters who work fairly within the law providing an essential service to the agricultural industry and ultimately the consumer. We therefore set up an interdepartmental working party to investigate the issue. Its report has now been placed in the Library of the House.
<P>

<a name="80609w14.html_para0">In light of the findings and recommendations of the interdepartmental working party and discussions with the industry we are putting in place a set of measures to tackle the abuses by a significant minority of gangmasters of workers' rights and of non-compliance and fraud against taxation, National Insurance, benefit and immigration systems.
<P>

<a name="80609w14.html_para1">The Government are launching "Operation Gangmaster". This cross-departmental initiative will bring together the work of up to 8 different enforcement agencies. The core of this pilot operation will be joint visits concentrating initially on illegal practices in Lincolnshire and East Anglia. Such visits have already occurred this season and one is in train today. This will be supported by general co-operation between enforcement officers alerting other departments to possible illegal activities. Departments will also co-operate in in-depth investigations into illegal gangmaster activities.




<P>
<P><I>9 Jun 1998 : Column: 528</I><P>

<P>

<a name="80609w14.html_para2">In addition, enforcement officers in all relevant Government departments throughout the country are being briefed on the legislative framework applicable to gangmasters; this will greatly assist strong enforcement and further cement co-operation between departments.
<P>

<a name="80609w14.html_para3">Additional support to Operation Gangmaster will be provided through the Government's Business Anti-Fraud Hot Line. Here the drive to identify fraudulent employers will be helpful in identifying those gangmasters who knowingly employ benefit claimants. Other measures being taken by the Government, including implementing the Working Time Directive and the National Minimum Wage, will contribute to improving the position of casual workers.
<P>

<a name="80609w14.html_para4">Importantly, for the first time, gangmasters, farmers and workers will be informed of their rights and obligations through leaflets which are being issued widely today. These provide a comprehensive picture of all the relevant aspects of law relevant to gangmasters and the people they employ, covering responsibilities of several different government departments. No one should be in doubt as to their rights or obligations under the law, or be able to claim ignorance of the law, if caught abusing their workers.
<P>

<a name="80609w14.html_para5">I am delighted also that the agricultural and horticultural industries are taking their responsibilities seriously too. The Code of Practice being launched by the National Farmers' Union and the Fresh Produce Consortium today is an important step. It will be of great assistance to all farmers, growers and pack house operators in understanding the relevant law and best practice to be adopted. I very much welcome that the retail sector have given their support to this code as an initial stage towards controlling gangmasters.




<P>
<P><I>9 Jun 1998 : Column: 529</I><P>

<P>

<a name="80609w14.html_para6">For the longer term, the Government are continuing to examine the scope for registration of agricultural gangmasters and ways to assist the unemployed to take up seasonable agricultural employment more easily, reducing the temptation to work while on benefit and laying individuals open to exploitation by gangmasters.
<P>

<a name="80609w14.html_para7">This comprehensive approach combining the strength of the several enforcement agencies, providing full information on rights and obligations to workers and employers and the role the industry themselves are playing to tackle the problem of abuse by gangmasters, is breaking new ground.

 Based on the data currently readily available, all or part of the land in at least 400 Sites of Special Scientific Interest is subject to a Countryside Stewardship agreement. However, this figure does not include some early Countryside Stewardship agreements or agreements established in 1997 in Devon and Cornwall, for which information cannot readily be aggregated at present.

<P>
<P>

 The Krebs report concluded that the development of a vaccine for cattle was the best long-term prospect for the control of bovine TB, but saw a badger vaccine as an alternative option if cattle vaccine requirements cannot be met. Following the publication of the report, we have reviewed our research requirements for bovine TB, and in April published a document inviting proposals. These include work to develop a cattle vaccine and to take forward work on a badger vaccine which started in 1994. If suitable proposals are forthcoming, contracts will be awarded for work to start in April 1999.

 The Government support the beekeeping sector through the bee health programme which is delivered in England and Wales by the National Bee Unit, part of the Central Science Laboratory.

 The Government broadly welcome the Commission's proposals for reforming the dairy sector as a step in the right direction. However, we are pressing for a clear date for the removal of milk quotas. Whilst welcoming, in principle, an increase in milk quotas in line with the price cuts, we do not accept the proposed discriminatory allocation of additional quota in favour of producers in mountain areas.

 Part of the Commission's proposals would involve a 1 per cent. quota increase for each Member State with priority to be given to young farmers and 1 per cent. for producers in mountain areas. The UK would not benefit from the latter allocation but the former would in principle apply to the Peak District just as to any other part of the UK.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80609w15.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 Flock counts are needed for a minimum 10 per cent. of claims under the Sheep Annual Premium (SAP) scheme and the Hill Livestock Compensatory Allowances (HLCA) scheme. At present, these counts must all be carried out during the scheme retention period, which for SAP and HLCA has been combined and fixed at 4 February to 15 May in consultation with the industry. The scope for changing these arrangements is currently limited. In particular, EU rules do not permit an autumn retention period for SAP.
<P>

<a name="80609w15.html_para0">They do allow for a proportion of flock inspections to be undertaken outside the retention period, if the general standard of on-farm record keeping is satisfactory. Unfortunately this is not yet the case in the UK. It is recognised that a spring retention period is not ideal from the welfare point of view but in practice it has not led to major difficulties. In carrying out their duties, the field staff are sensitive to potential welfare concerns and every effort is made to schedule inspections to minimise the disruption that may be caused to normal flock management.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80609w15.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 In the 12 months ending 31 May, 608,666 calves were slaughtered under the Calf Processing Aid Scheme. It is by no means evident that, in the absence of a scheme, all these calves would have been reared for beef. If the Scheme were terminated, we would expect UK beef production to increase some 18 months to 2 years after termination and the absolute upper limit of that increase would be of the order of 200 thousand tonnes per annum. The Government are confident that the ban on the export of British beef will have been lifted for animals born after the end of the current slaughter programme, before they are ready for slaughter as finished animals. The ban on the export of live calves is however likely to remain in place for the foreseeable future because of concerns about maternal transmission.

 The main agency through which we support bio-medical and clinical research is the Medical Research Council (MRC). The MRC is an independent body which receives its grant-in-aid from the Office of Science and Technology, which is part of the Department of Trade and Industry. The MRC funds a good deal of research into epilepsy, which amounted to some &#163;600,000 in 1996/97. However, the MRC does not currently support any research specifically and exclusively into mitigating the effects of epilepsy.
<P>

<a name="80609w16.html_para2">The Department's policy research programme (PRP) and the central National Health Service research and development programmes are not currently supporting any research into epilepsy, due to pressure of other priorities. However, records are not held centrally of all research carried out in the NHS.
<P>

<a name="80609w16.html_para3">The Department is currently supporting several epilepsy organisations through its section 64 scheme of grants. Recently, it also contributed &#163;10,000 to the costs of the annual conference of the British Epilepsy Organisation. We have met recently with one of the epilepsy organisations and officials from the Department are in regular contact with the main epilepsy organisations and the Joint Epilepsy Council, an umbrella organisation for epilepsy organisations.

 The information requested is not held centrally. However, analysis of population needs, and the prevalence and incidence of different types of disability, are important aspects of the commissioning functions of local authorities and health authorities. In "Signposts for Success in Commissioning and Providing Health Services for People with Learning Disabilities", published by the Department in January this year and distributed to health and local authorities, commissioners are advised to have arrangements in place to use both local and national information to build up a picture of the health needs of people with learning disabilities and people with autism in their locality. We also encourage health authorities to work together closely with local authorities in profiling both the volume, and needs, of people with learning disabilities and people with autism.

Since then, 132 young people have joined New Deal. <i>(e)</i> and <i>(f)</i> After only a month

<P><I>9 Jun 1998 : Column: 544</I><P>
of the Gateway period, the individual difficulties and problems faced by young people in this unit of delivery are still being addressed by referral to Gateway providers and the other three options. It is vital to the success of New Deal that participants are 'job-ready' before referral to jobs. <i>(g)</i> In 1997, around 3,650 young people aged 18-24 were recorded as having left claimant unemployment for a job in the Guildford unit of delivery area. In addition, there will have been others, whose destination is recorded as unknown, some of whom would have left the register to take up a job. In the year to April 1998, the latest date for which figures are available, around 3,300 18-24 year olds left claimant unemployment for a job. <i>(h)</i> In the Guildford unit of delivery, 78 employers have signed Employer Agreements (i) In 1997, around 13,700 unemployed people of all ages left claimant unemployment for a job. The equivalent figure for the year to April 1998 is 12,300. As with answer <i>(g)</i> these figures will not include those whose destination is recorded as unknown.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80609w19.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The purpose of the Benefit Integrity Project is to collect up to date information from claimants receiving the higher rate of the mobility component, with either the highest or middle rate of the care component, to ensure they are receiving their correct entitlement. On 9 February, an additional safeguard was introduced to ensure that there is always independent evidence to support a decision to reduce or remove benefit. From that date, the new safeguard has been applied to all initial Project decisions and to cases where a review has been requested.
<P>

<a name="80609w19.html_para6">The safeguard was introduced because of concerns that some disabled people may not have understood fully what was required of them and, as a result, had not provided a complete picture of the help they need with personal care and mobility.
<P>

<a name="80609w19.html_para7">Representations have been received from the All Party Disablement Group and others that all decisions made without the benefit of the new procedures introduced on 9 February should be reviewed. We have already made it clear to the House that we are currently considering how to examine those cases where the claimant has not asked for a review of a decision, made before 9 February, to reduce or remove benefit and no independent additional evidence was submitted. We are considering what action should be taken on the 2,400 or so such cases.

 <i>[holding answer 5 June 1998]:</i> The Working Benefits campaign is part of the Government's welfare to work initiative. It is designed to help families beat the poverty trap by letting them know which benefits they can access when they get into work. It targets chiefly lone parents on Income Support, and couples with children who are either out of work, or on a low income. A lot of help exists in the form of in-work benefits, such as Family Credit, Council Tax Benefit and Housing Benefit--these make work affordable. The Working Benefits campaign should alert those in greatest need to the help available to facilitate the move from benefit into work. Lone parents moving off Income Support and into work not only means that they--and their children--can enjoy a better standard of living than they ever could 



<P>
<P><I>9 Jun 1998 : Column: 547</I><P>
on benefit, but can also help to reduce Social Security expenditure on lone parents--currently &#163;10.5 billion a year.
<P>

<a name="80609w19.html_para8">Total cost of the advertising campaign is &#163;2.15 million, which includes TV and radio production and airtime; design and production of print material; telephone response handling and fulfilment; direct mail to 580,000 lone parents; campaign website; campaign development research; and pre and post campaign effectiveness research.

 It is estimated that in 1995-96, a quarter of pensioner households in Scotland were in the bottom quintile of the income distribution of households in Scotland before housing costs (BHC) and a fifth were in the bottom quintile after housing costs (AHC).
<P>

<a name="80609w21.html_para0">It is also estimated that just over a third of households in the bottom quintile of the Scottish income distribution BHC were pensioner households. On the AHC measure, this reduces to just over a quarter. By comparison, pensioner households make up 28 per cent. of all households in Scotland.

<P>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I cannot provide precisely all the information that you have requested, but have provided as much as possible from the most recent information available.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Department of Social Security Analytical Services Division publish quarterly a summary of statistics relating to child support; the last report was published on 14 May 1998 and showed that nationally, 41% of non-resident parents were fully compliant, 29% were partially compliant and 30% were nil compliant. The full report is available in the House of Commons library. Analytical Services Division have provided details on a regional basis for Great Britain in relation to nil compliant cases and this information is shown in the table attached.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Where the Agency has taken-on cases, the length of time taken to complete a maintenance assessment is measured, and cases which exceed 52 weeks are considered to be a backlog; this backlog currently stands at approximately 110,000 down from 225,000 at 31 March 1997.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Agency has developed and implemented a strategy for meeting its undertaking to clear this backlog. All Business Units have put in place operational plans which will guide them towards the achievement of our objective of clearing the backlog by 31 March 1999.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The amount of child support maintenance debt outstanding at the 31 May 1998, was &#163;731,620,185.51. The Agency undertakes a Debt Analysis exercise at the end of each financial year. The analysis is performed at Agency level and cannot be broken down into regions within the United Kingdom. The Debt Analysis exercise for 1996/97 indicated that the percentage of full maintenance assessment debt regarded as probably uncollectable was 38%. Similar analysis is being carried out for 1997/98 and the results will be published in the Agency's 1997/98 Annual Report and Accounts in July 1998, in a format which will satisfy the Committee of Public Accounts recommendation that the Agency " . . . examine the scope for eliminating a significant amount of this debt, since it is unlikely ever to be collected . . . ".</FONT></UL>




<P>
<P><I>9 Jun 1998 : Column: 554</I><P>

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Agency measures the accuracy of maintenance assessments against targets set by the Secretary of State. For 1997/98, the target was for the cash value of all maintenance assessments checked in the year to be correct in at least 85% of cases. The Agency met this target scoring an accuracy rate of 86%.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In 1998-99, the Agency is measuring the accuracy more stringently be examining the last full assessment rather than just the last work carried out, which could have been a simplified review not requiring a full assessment. The revised methodology is similar to that used by the National Audit Office. The checks will be more reliable, measuring accuracy of assessments in earlier years as well as more recent changes to assessments. However, this may result in a larger number of inaccurate assessments being identified in the short term and as a result the accuracy target is lower for 1998-99, and requires the cash value of all assessments checked in the year to be correct in at least 75% of cases. The Agency will be looking to improve on the accuracy target in 1999-2000 and beyond.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The report of the Comptroller and Auditor General to the House of Commons which was published as part of the Agency's Annual Report for 1996/97 noted that when examining non-resident parents' maintenance balances, National Audit Office staff had identified errors in 85% of the cases examined. I am not able to update this assessment which was based on a sample of cases going back to the start of the Agency, but it is a matter of public record that during its first two years the Agency frequently made errors when assessing maintenance. We recognise the legacy of this problem and aim to tackle this by getting cases right first time and will review older cases as the opportunity arises, for example when a periodic review is being carried out. We estimate that by the end of 1998/99 we will have had the chance in our normal course of work and through periodic reviews to look at many of those individual accounts which stem from the start of the Agency.</FONT></UL>

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security what sums were paid to residents in Worcester as winter fuel payments in 1997-98.  [43677]<P>

 Winter Fuel payments are one of a number of initiatives the Government have taken to help vulnerable people, especially the elderly, keep warm in the winter. A total of &#163;400 million has been committed for two years (97/98 and 98/99), to help pensioners with fuel bills to pay. This is the first time any Government

have provided additional help with heating costs to all pensioners living in the United Kingdom who receive a Retirement Pension or one of a number of other qualifying benefits.
<P>

<a name="80609w22.html_para0">The making of this year's payments has been an enormous and unprecedented exercise. In order to establish all eligible pensioners, correctly identify pensioner households, and determine the amount each should receive, it was necessary to correlate data in around 15 million computer records, involving 15 qualifying benefits, across nine computer systems. Overall, almost ten million pensioners, in over seven million households, have received a payment.
<P>

<a name="80609w22.html_para1">The administration of winter fuel payments is a matter for Peter Mathison, Chief Executive of the Benefits Agency. He will write to the hon. Gentleman and my hon. Friend.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Secretary of State for Social Security has asked me to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question asking how many complaints the Benefits Agency (BA) has received regarding over and underpayments of Winter Fuel Payments since the scheme came into operation.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The making of Winter Fuel Payments to almost ten million eligible pensioners in over seven million households, before the end of March 1998, has been a challenging task for the BA. This was achieved whilst maintaining normal benefit business.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Individual representations from customers are dealt with by each of the BA's 109 Districts. Information is not available relating to complaints about either over or underpayments of Winter Fuel Payments.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We are aware of 649 eligible pensioners who received two &#163;50 payments. This includes 211 who erroneously received two payments due to being in receipt of both Income Support and income-based Jobseeker's Allowance for at least one day in the qualifying week. In accordance with legislation, only one payment should have been made. Also, due to a computer operator error, 40,801 invalid girocheques were sent out with an incorrect date of issue. The error was quickly identified and all the invalid payments

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>were replaced within 72 hours. The letter which accompanied the replacement payment apologised for the error and advised the recipient to destroy the invalid girocheque or if they had encashed it, to return the replacement to the nearest Benefits Agency office. It appears that in 438 instances both the invalid and replacement girocheque were cashed.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In addition we are aware that 9,357 &#163;50 payments have been made to customers who were not entitled to them. All other payments have been made in accordance with legislation which states that the amount payable will be based on official records and therefore are not regarded as overpayments.</FONT></UL>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The making of winter fuel payments to almost 10 million pensioners, in over seven million households, before the end of March 1998 has been a challenging task for the Benefits Agency (BA). This has been achieved whilst maintaining normal benefit business.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Around one and a half million of the poorest pensioners, those receiving Income Support (IS) or income-based Jobseeker's (JSA), received their payment of &#163;50 during January. Other eligible pensioners were entitled to a payment of &#163;20 where they lived alone or were the only eligible pensioner in a household, otherwise, they were entitled to &#163;10 if they were in receipt of a qualifying benefit (including each person in a pensioner couple).</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Not all of the information requested is available as the BA collates IS and JSA statistics by BA District Office. These Districts do not correspond to constituency boundaries. Such information as is available relates to the number of pensioners in the Worcester BA District who received a &#163;50 IS payment.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Following a scan of the computer systems in January, 5,156 &#163;50 payments totalling &#163;257,800 were issued. It is likely that a small number of additional payments will also have been made locally because details for the eligible pensioner were not held on the computer system at the time the scans were completed.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The information relating to other pensioners who received payments of &#163;20 or &#163;10 could only be provided at disproportionate cost.</FONT></UL>
