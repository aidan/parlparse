 All trapped badgers will be vaccinated. It is not necessary to trap and vaccinate every individual in a population or to prevent the entry of unvaccinated ones to control a disease. This is because as the proportion of immunised individuals increases, the risk to all individuals, whether vaccinated or not, decreases. The stable social structure of undisturbed badger populations, where there is little mixing of individuals between social groups, lends itself to the generation of this &#145;herd immunity&#146; through vaccination.</p>

 No recent formal representations have been received on the subject of bank lending to farmers. At the end of March 2009, net lending to agriculture, forestry and hunting in the UK stood at just below &#163;11 billion. This was more than &#163;900 million higher than at the same point in 2008 and some &#163;280 million above the level recorded at the end of 2008. There is strong evidence that the banking sector is continuing to lend to farm businesses with sound business cases but DEFRA will continue to monitor the situation.</p>

 Recycling is strongly promoted by a range of Government measures in recognition of its environmental benefits. This includes the introduction of three National Indicators within the local government performance framework to encourage local authorities to reduce waste, recycle more and send less household waste to landfill. This is in line with DEFRA's belief that local authorities are best placed to make decisions on the waste management strategy for their communities. 85 per cent. of authorities have negotiated at least one waste-related national indicator target with the Government Office in their region.</p>

These trees were felled during the 2008-9 winter by Castle Point borough council with the assent and support of Natural England. The work was done as part of a higher level stewardship agreement to restore the special interest features of the SSSI&#151;namely its rare heathland habitats&#151;to favourable condition. Some tree removal is essential as part of this restoration work because many oaks became established on the heathland in the second half of the last century when the site was less actively managed. There are now over 100 trees on the northern half of the SSSI which are rapidly shading out the remaining patches of heathland vegetation. If these are all left to mature a large part of the SSSI will soon be dense woodland and the heathland will be lost.</p>

 Political impartiality is a requirement for the majority of House of Commons employees.

<i> [holding answer 16 July 2009]:</i> The Department for Transport&#146;s (central Department) staff handbook contains employees&#146; contractual entitlements to maternity leave. These entitlements are unaffected by the Department&#146;s new probationary policy, which applies only to the central Department and not its agencies. In practical terms, new employees are unlikely to be taking maternity leave during their probationary period. If, however, the situation did arise, the employee would be entitled to take maternity leave in accordance with the maternity leave provisions in the staff handbook. In such a case, the employee&#146;s probationary period would be frozen and recommenced upon the employee&#146;s return from maternity leave.</p>

 Following Second Reading of the Equality Bill, interested organisations raised concerns that, as drafted, the Bill reduced the existing protection against discrimination for pregnant women and new mothers. This drew our attention to an unintended consequence of the drafting which would have potentially allowed discrimination against pregnant women or new mothers if this could be shown to be reasonable.

on 9 June, we tabled amendments to the Bill which represent a return to the level of protection given against pregnancy and maternity discrimination under the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 (as amended). These amendments were briefly debated on 16 June and agreed, and now stand part of the Bill.</p>

So a woman who is breastfeeding her baby in a restaurant or on a bus cannot lawfully be asked to leave, or get off, for that reason. At present we have no plans to bring forward proposals to provide a legal right for women to breastfeed in public places.</p>

The Jobcentre Plus Project developed a Jobcentre Plus Environmental Guide (JPEG) in association with the project architects which referenced all relevant external legislation including the Disability Discrimination Act (DDA). DDA requires all providers of public services to ensure that services to customers can be accessed by all, whether that is in regard to the physical office environments or by other means. The JPEG was reviewed throughout the rollout programme to ensure compliance with the Act. This was reflected both in the standards and specifications deployed in the physical refurbishment of our offices and in the design of specific components.</p>

We are supplementing these measures by operating extended opening hours in some locations where the need for this is identified locally, including some offices opening to the public on Saturday. In the light of the increase in customer demand we have embarked on a programme to convert or extend our existing buildings where necessary, deploying existing components including similar seating to that already installed as part of the 2002-2006 roll out of Jobcentre Plus offices.</p>

1. Interpretation of these data need to take account of changes in recent years to Jobcentre Plus procedures for taking and handling vacancies. These figures are not fully comparable over time and may not indicate developments in the labour market. A more detailed explanation is available on the nomis website.<br>
2. Notified vacancies include any speculative placings recorded by Jobcentre Plus. Datasets from May 2006 may reflect substantially reduced levels of speculative placings as part of the notified series. Consequently, care should be taken in interpreting time-series data.<br>
3. The stocks of unfilled vacancies reflect more accurately job opportunities available via Jobcentre Plus. In the case of unfilled vacancies, use of the figures on live vacancies is recommended (that is, excluding suspended vacancies), and this is the default option. Live vacancies may still include some vacancies which have already been filled or are otherwise no longer open to recruits, due to natural time lags in procedures for following up vacancies with employers.<br>
4. Data are unrounded.<br>
5. Comprehensive estimates of all job vacancies (not just those notified to Jobcentre Plus) have been available from the monthly ONS Vacancy Survey since April 2001, based on a sample of some 6,000 enterprises. However, the ONS survey is currently designed to provide national estimates only.<br>

 We do not record the number of applications for jobseeker's allowance (JSA) rejected due to fraudulent documents being used. However, we can provide reassurance that rigorous checks of all documentation are undertaken when an application to JSA is made. If there is a suspicion about the validity of the documentation produced, the case is referred to our Fraud Investigation Service. The claim will not be put into payment until the questions around the documentation are resolved.</p>

 The Department's population-level modelling calculates payback rather than internal rate of return, and there is no simple correspondence between the two measures&#151;for each individual it depends on their patterns of saving and decumulation through time.

 The MOD has 15 Departments of Community Mental Health (DCMHs) in the UK (with additional satellite centres in Germany, Cyprus and Gibraltar), which have since 2004 provided out-patient mental healthcare for members of the armed forces. Responsibility for their individual management is shared between the single service commands, and it is not possible to separate out costs from overall unit medical budgets. Each service funds its respective DCMHs differently, with funding provision coming from a number of areas.

Typhoon requires only a one-person crew rather than a two-person crew like the Tornado F3, which is being phased out.  <br>

Additionally, as the 2004 Defence White Paper &#147;Delivering Security in a Changing World&#148; made clear, &#147;the effectiveness of modern precision weapons and sensors, which can be used in all weathers, day and night, mean that highly accurate air delivered offensive effects can be achieved with fewer fast jets than before... Similarly the air threat to deployed forces has greatly reduced and the capability of our air superiority aircraft and other air defence assets is continuing to improve. So we need fewer aircraft and fewer ground-based air defence systems to meet the threat.&#148;</p>

 There are two variants of the Future Lynx aircraft which is now known as the Lynx Wildcat. The first aircraft is due to enter service in January 2012, leading to an initial operating capability in 2014 for the Army&#146;s Battlefield Reconnaissance Helicopter (BRH) and in 2015 for the Royal Navy&#146;s Surface Combatant Maritime Rotorcraft (SCMR). A contract has been agreed with AgustaWestland for the procurement of 62 Lynx Wildcat aircraft. The total cost of the demonstration and manufacture of the project is forecast to be some &#163;1.7 billion.</p>

 There are no plans to extend eligibility to transfer from the Gurkha pension scheme (GPS) to the armed force pension scheme (AFPS) to those Gurkhas who retired before 1 July 1997. Their pension arrangements have been found to be fair and lawful in two Judicial Reviews and a High Court appeal.</p>

A further 8,800 who were discharged after 1 April 1975 would be qualified for a preserved pension under the AFPS from the age of 60.</p>

 It is envisaged that all 28 Merlin Mk3/3a helicopters will be upgraded at a cost in the region of &#163;42 million. This equates to an average of &#163;1.5 million per aircraft. These figures are lower than previously reported and stated in the written answer my predecessor, Mr. Hutton, gave on 2 March 2009, <i> Official Report,</i> column 1364W, to the hon. Member for Congleton. This is due to improved maturity in our cost estimates following work undertaken in the intervening period.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department (1) how many staff of each organisation authorised to use the national DNA database have been <i> (a)</i> investigated, <i> (b)</i> disciplined and <i> (c)</i> dismissed for unauthorised or improper use of that database in each of the last five years; [276825]</p>

 Direct access to information on the National DNA Database (NDNAD) is restricted to a limited number of designated personnel under the control of the National Policing Improvement Agency (NPIA), either directly, or under a contract awarded to the Forensic Science Service (FSS) for operation and maintenance of the NDNAD and development of its IT systems. Throughout the lifetime of the contract, the FSS are required to demonstrate compliance with specified security requirements. Police and law enforcement personnel do not have access to the information on the NDNAD, but receive reports from the NDNAD Delivery Unit of matches between DNA taken from crime scenes and that taken from individuals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_569"><a name="90720w0044.htm_para4"><a name="09072117000359">In relation to those NPIA and FSS staff, there has been one instance of unauthorised use of the database during the last five years. This involved a contractor working for the FSS who was found to have used an administrator account on the IT system rather than his own. Following an investigation by the NPIA, no evidence of any improper access to database records was found. However, as use of the administrator account was in contravention of security procedures, the individual was removed from further work on the database. No incidents of unauthorised or improper use of match reports by police and law enforcement personnel have been reported to the NDNAD in the last five years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_570"><a name="90720w0044.htm_para5"><a name="09072117000360">Since the NDNAD was set up in 1995, two instances of loss of data have been reported. These took place in February 2009 when the FSS faxed DNA reports intended for two police forces to incorrect fax numbers. In both instances, the faxes were either retrieved by the police or destroyed within 36 hours of the event. A thorough investigation was undertaken by the NPIA and reported to the Home Office. No evidence was found of any malicious intent by any individual.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_571"><a name="90720w0044.htm_para6"><a name="09072117000361">As a result of the investigation into this incident, an existing project to replace use of fax was accelerated. As from 17 April 2009, fax has no longer been used to transmit any DNA reports to forces. They are now sent in line with Cabinet Office guidance over a secure network either by email or as a web service on a secure network.</p>

<i> [holding answer 2 July 2009]:</i> Requests for the release of data or samples relating to the DNA profiles held on the National DNA Database (NDNAD) must be approved by the NDNAD Strategy Board. Requests are also considered by the NDNAD Ethics Group, which makes recommendations to the Board on whether the request should be approved. The Police and Criminal Evidence Act (PACE) lays down that DNA samples and the profiles derived from them can only be used for the purposes of prevention and detection of crime, the investigation of an offence, the conduct of a prosecution or, since April 2005, for the purposes of identifying a deceased person.

 It is very difficult to provide precise figures for the proportion of UK legislation that stems from the European Union and the consequent cost. All proposals for EU legislation are, however, deposited with Parliament with an assessment of any legislative changes that would be required to implement them in the UK and an explanation of the HMG policy in the area concerned, including in the case of proposals on migration and asylum, by choosing not to opt in to them where appropriate.</p>

<i> [holding answer 3 July 2009]:</i> The only major consultancy services engaged by the Forensic Science Service (FSS) have been obtained from Deloitte (who assisted in 2008 with preliminary thinking on business transformation). Deloitte has also been the FSS pension advisers for some time. FSS have used a number of specialist providers in a smaller way to support the design of the business transformation programme. The transformation team itself has also been staffed by a number of agency and interim specialists to work alongside and train in-house resources (for example Lean Sigma training). Some components of the transformation (e.g. IT enabling projects) will involve the engagement of a number of our existing external service support providers (e.g. Cap Gemini), but these companies are not involved in the provision of broader consultancy services.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what <i> (a)</i> legal status and <i> (b)</i> residency rights Gurkhas who do not qualify to settle in the UK but who are not subject to immediate deportation have. [273542]</p>

 On 21 May 2009 the Home Secretary announced a revised policy for former members of the Brigade of Gurkhas who had been discharged prior to 1 July 1997. Under the terms of this policy any former Gurkha with more than four years&#146; service who had been discharged from the Brigade of Gurkhas before 1 July 1997 would be eligible for settlement in the UK.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_600"><a name="90720w0049.htm_para11"><a name="09072117002712">All Gurkhas who meet the criteria and who wish to settle in the United Kingdom will be eligible to do so unless there are particular reasons for excluding an individual from settlement, for example criminality. We therefore cannot foresee circumstances in which ex Gurkhas in the UK do not meet the criteria but are not subject to immediate administrative removal or deportation. If this unlikely situation did arise the legal status and residency rights of the individual would be considered on a case by case basis.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what potentially analogous categories of immigrant his Department considered when formulating its policy on the rights of residence of Gurkhas; and what elements of the Government&#146;s policy on such rights of residence would apply to each such category.

 When formulating the policy on the settlement rights of former Gurkhas it was important to find a package which met the needs of the Gurkhas, which was affordable and was consistent with our broader immigration policies. This included consideration of the settlement rules for Commonwealth soldiers, the policies on other immigration categories that provide a route to settlement, the time limits on applications, dependants and the UK Government&#146;s wider responsibilities under the Human Rights Act.</p>

 Figures for all forces for front-line policing and for paperwork at a national level are given in the following tables. Figures for paperwork for individual forces should be sought from those forces, as it is not possible for the Home Office to release them without incurring disproportionate cost. The Home Office does not collect data on time spent on stop and search routinely, but we estimate that hand written completion of stop and search forms on the street takes on average three to seven minutes. The time spent on completing the form depends on the circumstances of the individual stop.</p>

 The frontline policing measure and other measures of time spent on patrol and paperwork have been discontinued as part of the Government's commitment to reduce the burden on police forces imposed by statistical and other data.

Since February 2009, we have been working with the Modernising Pharmacy Careers Programme Board to develop a new model for undergraduate and pre-registration training and proposals for improving pharmacist postgraduate training, including where this supports better patient access to more specialist services. The Board, led by the Chief Pharmaceutical Officer, brings together wide-ranging pharmacy expertise and experience from schools of pharmacy, professional regulation, hospital and community pharmacy, research and the United Kingdom pharmaceutical industry.</p>

1. The structure of national health service trusts in the Wakefield area has changed over the period the data is requested for. In April 2002, the Mid-Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust was formed from the partial-merger of the Pinderfields and Pontefract Hospitals NHS Trust and the Dewsbury Health Care NHS Trust. Data is shown for the Mid-Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust, from 2002 onwards.<br>
2. Work force statistics are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data. Processing methods and procedures are continually being updated to improve data quality. Where this happens, any impact on figures already published will be assessed but unless this is significant at national level they will not be changed. Where there is impact only at detailed or local level this will be footnoted in relevant analyses.<br>

The data in the table shows only medical and dental staff specifically working within the PHM and CHS specialty group. The public health medicine area is a large, somewhat complex area and it is not possible to separately identify staff in this area using the available census data breakdowns. Data has therefore been provided for those staff we can identify as working in this area. Figures exclude all non-medical staff, such as nursing and allied health professionals.<br>
</td></tr><tr valign="top"><td class="tabletext" colspan="2"><i> Data quality:</i><br>
Workforce statistics are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts in England. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data. Processing methods and procedures are continually being updated to improve data quality. Where this happens any impact on figures already published will be assessed but unless this is significant at national level they will not be changed. Where there is impact only at detailed or local level this will be footnoted in relevant analyses.<br>

 The national framework agreements for these contracts and the rates of pay included in them are confidential and commercially sensitive.

<p><a name="stpa_726"><a name="90720w0061.htm_para2"><a name="09072167001939">It would be extremely difficult to estimate the proportion of pay that agencies and employees receive and present it in a meaningful form. This is because every supplier tenders a unique pay and charge rate for each type of temporary worker supplied. For doctors alone there are 140 different grades and specialties each with an individual pay and charge rate. On top of that there are 19 different discount options and both a long and a short-term booking version from each of the 53 agencies giving nearly 300,000 prices on this contract alone.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_727"><a name="90720w0061.htm_para3"><a name="09072167001944">However, the National Centre for Involvement maintains a contact list of host organisations on an informal basis which is available as a .pdf document. The latest version has been placed in the Library.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_728"><a name="90720w0061.htm_para4"><a name="09072167001945">The Department provides funds to local authorities to support LINk activities as part of the annual area-based grant. The grant is not ring-fenced. The allocations to each local authority for 2008-09 to 2010-11 are given in the following table.</p>

 The Department and its agencies hold a large number of databases ranging in size. These range from corporate databases to small local databases with just a few users held by units within the Department and its agencies, in addition to a large number of spreadsheets containing data, of which, the larger and more sophisticated could be described as fulfilling a database function. Some of these databases and systems can be expected to hold information on members of the public gathered in support of a wide range of departmental initiatives and activities. It is not possible due to disproportionate costs to identify which of the many databases contain personal data on members of the public and the date each one became operational.</p>

Charity law on campaigning and political activity is set out in our published guidance &#147;Speaking Out&#151;Guidance on Campaigning and Political Activity by Charities (CC9)&#148; which is available on our website at www.charitycommission.gov.uk. All charities must be established for exclusively charitable purposes and, as a general principle, charities may undertake campaigning and political activity, subject to the law and the terms of their governing document, in as much as it is a positive way of furthering or supporting their purposes. However, in doing so, charities must be mindful of their independence and must not engage in any form of party political activity.</p>

The Assessment Unit determines the appropriate way to deal with complaints based on issues of risk and proportionality, and whether the issue raised falls within our regulatory remit. The following table shows how many of the cases we assessed in each of the last three financial years included issues that we categorised as &#147;political activities&#148; (issues of &#147;political lobbying&#148; would be categorised in this way):</p>

These are cases where risk to the charity is limited and where it is likely that issues can be resolved through providing supervision, regulatory advice and guidance to trustees, and without the need to intervene by using our statutory powers.

If you would like a copy of any of the reports which contain issues relating to political activity we are happy to provide these to you.</p>

However, there has been one occasion in the last three years when we have used our statutory powers to ensure compliance in this area. We used section 19A of the Charities Act 1993 (introduced by section 20 of the Charities Act 2006) to direct the charity to carry out a governance review.</p>

<i> Guide to Quality</i>:<br>
The Coefficient of Variation (CV) indicates the quality of an estimate, the smaller the CV value the higher the quality. The true value is likely to lie within +/- twice the CV - for example, for an estimate of 200 with a CV of 5% we would expect the population total to be within the range 180-220.<br>

* 0 &#8804; CV&lt;5 Estimates are considered precise<br>
** 5 &#8804; CV &lt;10 Estimates are considered reasonably precise<br>
*** 10 &#8804; CV &lt;20 Estimates are considered acceptable<br>
**** CV ≥ 20 Estimates are considered too unreliable for practical purposes<br>
It should be noted that the above estimates exclude people in most types of communal establishment (e.g. hotels, boarding houses, hostels mobile home sites etc.)<br>

This encompasses a wide spectrum of prison and Department of Health work around such issues as mental health, substance misuse and resettlement. Any prisoner identified as at risk of suicide or self-harm is cared for using the assessment, care in custody and teamwork (ACCT) procedures. Most self harm is not directly life threatening, but nevertheless can be extremely distressing for those who have to deal with it. A prisoner focussed care planning system for those at risk has helped prisons manage self harm. There are no easy answers to managing self harming behaviour but we remain committed to finding ways to manage it.</p>

1. MDT results are recorded anonymously. It is possible therefore that some positive samples relate to the same prisoner.<br>
2. The sum of the number of positive samples for each drug is greater than the total number of positive samples. This is due to some samples testing positive for more than one drug.<br>
3. These figures have been drawn from administrative data systems. Although care is taken when processing and analysing the returns, the detail collected is subject to the inaccuracies inherent in any large scale recording system. The data are not subject to audit.<br>

<p><a name="stpa_846"><a name="90720w0088.htm_para0"><a name="09072228000123">The National Apprenticeship Service has developed a 16-18 Apprenticeships Action Plan and is taking forward a range of actions to increase the number of young people starting an apprenticeship. These include: an &#163;11 million investment to provide 3,000 additional places with large businesses that have a track record in offering high-quality apprenticeships, with 1,800 places for 16 to 18 year-olds; a &#163;7 million investment in Group Training Associations which can help attract new and hard to reach employers and new individuals to become apprentices; a focus on increasing the number of apprenticeship places available in the public sector by 21,000 this year with a specific focus on health, education, central and local government; and the publication of OGC guidance to enable Central and Local Government to utilise the &#163;175 billion spent each year on procurement contracts to increase apprenticeship numbers and investment in training.</p>

 In the Manufacturing: New Opportunities, New Challenges strategy, the Government committed to extend and expand high quality Apprenticeships by approximately 1,500 new places, by inviting bids from larger manufacturers to train additional apprentices, including for their supply chains.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_847"><a name="90720w0088.htm_para1"><a name="09072228000126">On 1 December 2008 the Apprenticeship Expansion Programme Prospectus was launched, inviting Expressions of Interest from employers or groups of employers who are already delivering high-quality Apprenticeship programmes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_848"><a name="90720w0088.htm_para2"><a name="09072228000127">On 13 May the majority of the successful bids were announced.

 Our records show that in 2006-07, &#163;115,000 was spent on funding level four apprenticeship places. This rose to &#163;202,000 in 2007-08, as more learners started apprenticeships and we continued to fund the programmes of those who had started in the previous year. In previous academic years, level four apprenticeships were not available.</p>

have seen tremendous growth in the adult (25 plus) Apprenticeship programme from just 300 starts in 2006/07, to over 27,000 in 2007/08 in England. We are delighted that this trend has continued and demand from employers for adult apprenticeships remains very high. This demonstrates that apprenticeships provide a high-quality, all-age offer for businesses and that employers recognise the benefits of continuing to train in the current economic climate. The Government&#146;s Skills Investment Strategy 2010-11 (due in autumn 2009) will set out national projections for apprenticeship starts for 2009/10 and 2010/11 academic years.</p>

As part of our unprecedented investment in Apprenticeships we have seen tremendous growth in the adult (25+) Apprenticeship programme from just 300 starts in 2006-07, to over 27,000 in 2007/08 in England. We are delighted that this trend has continued and demand from employers for adult Apprenticeships remains very high. This demonstrates that Apprenticeships provide a high-quality, all-age offer for businesses and that employers recognise the benefits of continuing to train in the current economic climate.</p>

<i> [holding answer 13 July 2009]:</i> The Secretary of State has designated six organisations as competent authorities. Those organisations in turn can approve individual advisers to act as intermediaries, that is to confirm that the entry criteria appear to be met and to assist with applications for debt relief orders. On receipt of the completed application and payment of the fee, the official receiver can make the order.</p>

This amount, therefore, formed part of larger payments to HEIs and is not readily distinguishable from them in each month of spend. The &#163;200 million brought forward to 2009-10 has been committed to specific projects, delivering throughout the year. That money will support 144 different projects, in 107 HEIs, and including additional capital leveraged by the initial investment, will deliver more than &#163;370 million of capital activity. Payments will be made to higher education institutions on a quarterly basis, and the first instalment of &#163;25 million was paid by HEFCE in May 2009. Examples of the projects accepted include: &#163;6.4 million for a new arts building at Sussex; &#163;3 million for a new building for the Centre for Immunology and Infection at York; &#163;2.7 million for new mechanical engineering facilities at Imperial; and &#163;2.6 million for chemical engineering and life sciences facilities at Sheffield. Over two-thirds of these projects are already under way.</p>

In 2008-09, more than 100 further education building projects were completed, as a result of nearly &#163;550 million of investment, including the &#163;110 million accelerated from future budgets. This money was spent to bring forward building work, benefiting learners and regenerating communities. Recent National Audit Office and Public Accounts Committee reports have acknowledged the success of the further education capital programme, and its value for money.</p>

 Trade unions are making a key contribution to our efforts to raise skill levels in the workplace. Unions and their union learning representatives (ULRs) are uniquely placed to engage with those hard to reach workers with few skills or low confidence in their own ability who employers find it so difficult to reach. To help them do this, we introduced the Union Learning Fund (ULF) in 1998 and will be providing &#163;21.5 million to support this budget in 2009-10.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_942"><a name="90720w0097.htm_para6"><a name="09072228001370">With the help of ULF, unions and their ULRs have now helped over 800,000 people into learning through a wide range of innovative partnership projects with employers to tackle both organisational and individual skill needs. In 2006, with the Government&#146;s support, the TUC established &#145;unionlearn&#146; to provide additional support and training for ULRs and to maximise the trade union contribution to our efforts to improve work force skills at all levels.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_943"><a name="90720w0097.htm_para7"><a name="09072228001371">Over 22,000 union learning reps have now been trained and are playing a vital role in helping to combat the economic downturn by providing workers at risk of or facing redundancy with advice and guidance about the wide range of support available to help them improve their skills and employment prospects.</p>

<sup>(2)</sup> Coefficients of Variation have been calculated for the latest period as an indication of the quality of the estimates. See Guide to Quality below.<br>
<i> Guide to Quality:</i><br>
The Coefficient of Variation (CV) indicates the quality of an estimate, the smaller the CV value the higher the quality. The true value is likely to lie within +/- twice the CV&#151;for example, for an estimate of 200 with a CV of 5 per cent. we would expect the population total to be within the range 180-220<br>
