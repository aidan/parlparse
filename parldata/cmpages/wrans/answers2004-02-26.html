We are also taking forward a range of actions, as part of the Government's Manufacturing Strategy, to promote innovation in manufacturing to help our companies compete effectively in the global marketplace on the basis of high-skills and high-value products. These actions include the highly successful Manufacturing Advisory Service we have established in every region; the extension of the R&D tax credit; and our work with the RDAs to help manufacturers exploit the UK's strong science, engineering and technology base. We will publish a progress report on the implementation of the Manufacturing Strategy in May 2004.

<a name="40226w03.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 Ofgem's principal objective under the Electricity Act 1989 (as amended) is to protect the interests of consumers and, in performing that duty, it has regard to, among others, individuals in rural areas. Ofgem also has duties to promote efficiency and economy on the part of the distribution network operator (DNO), and the operators themselves have duties under the Act to maintain an efficient and economical system. Ofgem are required to balance these duties and so improvement in rural stability as a consequence of network investment is balanced against the additional costs involved.

<a name="40226w03.html_para4">I understand that Ofgem are currently in the process of reviewing the distribution price controls with new controls due to be introduced in April 2005. As part of this review, Ofgem will set the limit on the amount of revenue each distribution company can earn per year. As part of the review, Ofgem is assessing the efficient levels of operating and capital costs required for DNOs to meet their statutory obligations as well as to meet pre-determined targets, for example with respect to the number and duration of interruptions.
<P>

<a name="40226w03.html_para5">While Ofgem considers DNO forecasts of costs in assessing the required levels of revenue, it does not endorse or reject investment proposals on an individual basis. Instead, Ofgem provides a package of overall revenue allowances and network performance targets, relating in part to the number of customer interruptions and the duration of interruptions. Dependent upon performance against these targets, DNOs are either financially rewarded or penalised.

<a name="40226w03.html_para6">Ofgem are currently undertaking customer research to assess customers' willingness to pay for any improvements in standards, the findings of which are due to be published in May 2004.

 Legal responsibility for energy security is shared by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry and Ofgem. My right hon. Friend is responsible for setting the overall regulatory framework for the supply of electricity. A key part of that framework is set out in section 3 A of the Electricity Act 1989 as amended by the Utilities Act 2000 and includes the objectives "to protect the interests of consumers". To this end the Secretary of State has made a statutory instrument (The Electricity Safety, Quality and Continuity Regulations 2002) requiring electricity distribution companies to prevent interruption of supply as far as is reasonably practical. These regulations are enforced by DTI Engineering Inspectors.

<a name="40226w03.html_para8">Electricity for domestic consumers is provided through their contracts with electricity supply companies which must meet standard licence conditions including the need "to secure that all reasonable demands in Great Britain for electricity are met".

 The two main new wide-field survey facilities (ESO VISTA in Chile and the WFCAM instrument facility in Hawaii) are currently under construction and plans for their observing programmes are under discussion between PPARC (Particle Physic and Astronomy Research Council) and its partners. In order to undertake routine examination in near real time of the data stream from these facilities, a dedicated software suite would be required.
<P>

<a name="40226w04.html_para9">There are no resources available to provide such a capability. Nevertheless, observing programme managers will exchange information on targets of opportunity, such as Near Earth Objects, on a best efforts basis.

<P>
<a name="40226w05.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 The decommissioning, upkeep and removal of turbines and transmission facilities from wind farms and the restoration of the land are matters for the developer and the relevant planning authorities with appropriate arrangements for these activities being agreed at the planning stage.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if she will make a statement on Government financial support to firms looking to establish wind farms.  [155479]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40226w05.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 The Government's main instrument for supporting the establishment of wind farms is the Renewables Obligation. The Obligation is a market based support mechanism that requires licensed electricity suppliers to provide a specified proportion of their electricity from renewable sources. This provides an assured market for renewable electricity and that it attracts a premium.
<P>

<a name="40226w05.html_para3">To date, the Government have committed &#163;117&nbsp;million in grant support to early offshore wind farm development. No direct grant support is provided for onshore wind farm development except for some small household or community installations under the Clear Skies scheme.

[153917]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40226w05.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Sutcliffe: </B> 
 Employers are likely to respond in a variety of ways if legislation were passed to prevent employees from working longer than 48 hours on average. This makes any estimate of the total number of hours worked per year that could be lost difficult.
<P>

<a name="40226w05.html_para4">However, what can be estimated is the total number of hours per year that employees usually work over an average of 48 hours per week. For all employees it is estimated at around 990&nbsp;million hours per year above 48 hours were worked as of spring 2003. This is equivalent to around 2&#188; per cent. of total hours usually worked by all employees. For male employees it is around 820&nbsp;million hours per year and for female employees around 170&nbsp;million hours per year.

<a name="40226w05.html_para5">Wylfa power station was shut down in mid April 2000 when a routine inspection of 64 welds in the boiler system revealed flaws in a number of welds. The welds hold 'superheater headers' (64 pipes that carry steam, which is not radioactive, from the station's boilers to its turbines to make electricity) in position. The integrity of the pipes themselves was never in question. A major project to fit restraints to steam pipes at Wylfa was completed at the start of July 2001.

 We have already reduced the monthly intake of asylum applications by half since October 2002. Current policy initiatives, such as juxtaposed controls in France and the deployment of detection technology at continental ports, are designed to prevent those who seek to circumvent our controls at specific ports of entry from doing so. The Government are confident that this and further measures will continue to reduce misuse of the asylum system and the numbers of unfounded asylum claims. The measures we introduced in the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 and the subsequent robust measures to ensure the integrity of our borders are testament to that.

 Services for unaccompanied asylum seeking children aged between 16 and 18-years-old are the responsibility of local authority social services departments. Their needs are assessed and support services provided accordingly in ways that are the equivalent of any other child in need. In all but a very few cases the local authority will make all necessary financial provision for them. In the few cases, for example, where leave to remain has been granted and their individual social services pathway plan permits, they may access benefits as part of an overall range of provision.

 The Nicaraguan workshop took place on 3&nbsp;March 2003. It brought together, for the first time in Nicaragua, Government officials, the private sector, labour organisations, representatives of international certification programmes and retailers. Its aim was to identify possible ways to strengthen the implementation and monitoring of corporate codes of conduct in Nicaragua and thereby improve both the conditions of workers in export industries and the ability of these industries to be competitive internationally.
<P>

<a name="40226w07.html_para11">The workshop made a number of recommendations for action to be taken by the Government, private sector and civil society in Nicaragua: the need to clarify the roles of those involved in monitoring corporate codes of conduct, to improve cooperation between national government officials and international certification programmes, to rationalise monitoring to avoid duplication and conflicting recommendations to factories, and to increase the knowledge of workers of corporate codes of conduct and national labour legislation.
<P>

<a name="40226w07.html_para12">One impact of the workshop was that the women workers association (the Maria Elena Cuadra Movement of Women Workers and Unemployed) integrated the recommendations into its training, advisory and policy work to improve the conditions of workers in the garment industry of the tax free zones.

<a name="40226w07.html_para13">The OECD produces annual estimates of the transfers to agricultural producers which result from market price support in the EU. The estimates are calculated as the difference between the EU domestic price and the equivalent world price multiplied by the level of EU production. The OECD estimates EU market price support for the major commodities in 2002 at around Euro 61 billion.

We will decouple fully in 2005 and move over an eight year transition period towards a flat rate Single Farm Payment to farmers. England will be split into two regions&#151;land in the severely disadvantaged areas (SDAs) of the less favoured areas (LFAs) and all other eligible land. Different rates will apply in these regions. This represents a decisive irreversible and forward-looking shift consistent with the direction that we have already set in the Sustainable Farming and Food Strategy (SFFS) and in the June 2003 CAP reform negotiations.

<a name="40226w08.html_wqn4"><B> Albert Owen: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what percentage of the increase in price noted in her Department's milk price survey raw milk producers will receive; and what steps she has taken to ensure that raw milk producers receive a fair share of this increase.  [154890]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40226w08.html_spnew4"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 The milk price survey run by the Department records the price paid by the purchasers of raw milk to raw milk producers. Therefore, by definition, all of the increase in price recorded by this survey is received by raw milk producers.
<P>

<a name="40226w08.html_para2">The Office for National Statistics also produce data on the retail price of milk. Transmission of changes between retail and farmgate prices is more complex. This issue was looked at in depth by London Economics for KPMG its report on "Prices and Profitability in the GB Dairy Chain", which was commissioned by the Milk Development Council. London Economics examined the UK milk market for the period from January 1995 to December 2001. On the basis of a rigorous statistical analysis, it concluded that adjustments to retail prices for liquid milk were fully passed back to the farmgate price, although there was a lag of five months before the retail price change was fully reflected in the farmgate price. There were no differences in the impact of retail price increases and decreases on farmgate prices, both were fully transmitted. In contrast a 1 pence increase in the farmgate price resulted in only a 0.6 pence increase in the retail price of liquid milk whereas a 1 pence decrease in farmgate price reduced the retail price by 0.7 pence.
<P>

<a name="40226w08.html_para3">London Economic also looked at the market in cheddar cheese. They found some evidence of a widening gap over the seven year period to 2002 between the retail price and farm gate price on a milk equivalent basis.

<a name="40226w08.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Pickthall: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will make a statement on the Government's policy towards <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;turf farming and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;the restoration of land used when turf farming has ceased in a particular area.  [154815]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40226w08.html_spnew7"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 The Government encourage diversification of agricultural businesses but recognises that this must be done in a sustainable manner. Turf farming involves the cutting and inevitable removal of some topsoil. The use of modern machinery, which removes only a very thin layer of root matter and soil, is encouraged.
<P>

<a name="40226w08.html_para5">There is no specific policy directly addressing this issue but the guidance provided in the Codes of Good Agricultural Practice for the Protection of Soil should be adhered to. The formation of fertile, rich topsoil with high organic matter content is a very slow natural process. Removal of topsoil reduces the productivity of the land by reducing the water and nutrients available to plants and making soil more likely to suffer structural damage. Shallow compact soils are also less able to absorb rainfall and the risk of water erosion and associated diffuse pollution may be increased. Therefore the loss of topsoil should be kept to a minimum in any turf farming operation.
<P>

<a name="40226w08.html_para6">Due consideration needs to be given on the likely risk of compacting the soil and leaving it in a bare condition that could encourage erosion and runoff of water and associated soil materials to water courses, roads etc. To 



<P>
<P><I>26 Feb 2004 : Column 528W</I><P>
minimise this risk, land formally subject to turf farming should be re-vegetated as soon as practicable. The soil should not be mined of available water and nutrients such that it cannot support the previous agricultural land use once restoration activities are complete.
<P>

<a name="40226w08.html_para7">It should be noted that removing large amounts of surface soil could be regarded as a development as defined by section 55 of the Town and Country Planning Act (1990). As such the business will need planning permission. If businesses do not receive planning permission it is an offence under the Agriculture Land (Removal of Surface Soil) Act 1953 to remove for sale, more than five cubic yards of surface soil from agricultural land in any three-month period unless the removal is reasonably necessary for cutting turf or peat. Advice is available from the local planning authority (usually district council or unitary authority) about commercial turf cutting from agricultural land when planning permission is required. The Local Planning Authorities are required to consult with Defra before granting permission for a planning application which is not in accordance with the development plan and would involve (1) the loss of 20 ha or more of grades 1, 2 or 3a agricultural land or (2) a loss which is less than 20 ha but is likely to lead to further losses amounting cumulatively to 20 ha or more.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will change the policy of Her Majesty's Customs and Excise that genuine mistakes made in good faith are not reasonable excuses for surcharge purposes.  [156047]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40226w09.html_spnew4"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 The VAT system aims to encourage payment of the right tax at the right time. As well as safeguarding revenues, this provides equity for all taxpaying businesses. A business may be penalised if it does not pay the right tax at the right time: the misdeclaration penalty penalises significant or repeated errors in the amount of tax paid and the default surcharge penalises late payment.
<P>

<a name="40226w09.html_para0">The VAT penalty system has safeguards to ensure that businesses are not treated over-harshly. For the smallest businesses, several warnings are issued before a late payment penalty is issued&#151;so that a business would not be penalised until its fifth default. Both misdeclaration penalties and default penalties can be withdrawn if there is a reasonable excuse for an error or delay. In this context, reasonable excuses can include compassionate circumstances or unforeseen events. However, this would not include mistakes of the type to which the hon. Gentleman refers since the penalties are, in part, designed to encourage accuracy.

<P>
<UL><P></UL>
<P>
<P>

 The ISA regulations state that a transfer of an ISA between account providers must take place within the time stipulated by the investor. However, providers are given a reasonable business period (not exceeding 30 days) to allow for the practical implications of making the transfer.

 The information requested could be provided only at disproportionate cost; HM Treasury does not hold data specifically on the costs of management consultants.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40226w10.html_spnew4"><B> Ruth Kelly: </B> 
 A stress audit was carried out in 2000 at a cost of &#163;20,000. The audit drew attention to several problems and a staff group was set up to assess its recommendations and to take forward an action plan. To measure progress against the 2000 stress audit, a follow up well being survey was carried out in 2003 at a cost of &#163;15,000. Generally the results of the survey were positive: levels of stress had decreased since the 2000 stress audit. However there remained scope for improvement and a new staff group has been set up to focus on what more should be done.

<a name="40226w10.html_sbhd5"><H3 align=center>Access to Legal Advice</H3>


<P>
<P>
<a name="40226w10.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Jim Cunningham: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Department for Constitutional Affairs what steps his Department is taking to ensure that the same levels of legal advice and support are available to people throughout England.  [155034]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40226w10.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Lammy: </B> 
 Our aim in providing legal advice and support is to provide common levels of provision across the country, taking into account local needs. This is done through the Legal Services Commission, which is responsible to the Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs for maintaining and developing the Community Legal Service (CLS). The key aim of the CLS is to provide greater and more easily accessible civil legal advice services to people within England and Wales. Regional Legal Services Committees and CLS Partnerships are responsible for co-ordinating the delivery of local legal and advice services in their area and, through an analysis of priority legal needs at a local level, can ensure that resources are targeted more effectively to those most in need.
<P>

<a name="40226w10.html_para0">In addition, the Commission has put in place a number of initiatives to improve access to advice that go beyond the traditional model of legal aid provided by solicitors from their offices, including the 'Just Ask!' website and telephone advice services. A national telephone advice service will be available from summer 2004 following a successful pilot.

<P>
<P>

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Department for Constitutional Affairs if he will list each magistrates court that has closed in the last two years, broken down by <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;parliamentary constituency and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;date of closure.  [155954]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40226w10.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Leslie: </B> 
 The responsibility for the number and location of magistrates courts in England and Wales falls to individual Magistrates' Courts Committees (MCCs) to determine, in consultation with their local paying authority. A paying authority that is aggrieved by a determination of an MCC has the right to appeal under section 56(3) of the Justice of the Peace Act 1997 to the Secretary of State for Department for Constitutional Affairs (DCA) within one month of receipt of the written notice of determination.
<P>

<a name="40226w10.html_para1">However, MCCs are not required by statute to inform the Department of proposed courthouse closures that are not subject to an appeal. The following table shows the closures of magistrates courts in England and Wales in 2002 and 2003 compiled from the information that is available to my Department:

<P>
<a name="40226w10.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Lammy: </B> 
 None, although I am informed that the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) has received representations on this issue. Officials at the DTI are working with solicitors on an indemnity form to ensure grants of probate will not be required on low-value offers. However, all the parties involved are aware of their legal obligations to guarantee that compensation is granted to the right individual.

<P>
<a name="40226w10.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Leslie: </B> 
 Judicial training is the responsibility of the Judicial Studies Board (JSB), an independent body chaired by Lord Justice Keene. The JSB provides written guidance to district judges on the conduct of small claims cases in its Civil Bench Book and on the particular needs of litigants in person in its Equal Treatment Bench Book. Both publications are publicly available via the JSB's website. They are supplemented by a video on the needs of litigants in person. The video is used as a an aid to syndicate discussion on the Civil Continuation Seminar. All district judges attend a Civil Continuation Seminar at three-yearly intervals.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Department for Constitutional Affairs what guidance is given to the management of the small claims track about the availability of free legal advice to litigants in the court building.  [155385]<P>

<P>
<a name="40226w10.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Leslie: </B> 
 In 2001 all civil and family courts in England and Wales gained a Quality Mark under the Community Legal Service (CLS) scheme. This confirms that those courts are committed to improving public access to quality information and legal services, by promoting the services of the CLS.
<P>

<a name="40226w10.html_para3">This involves as a minimum, active signposting and referring people to the CLS directory, but many courts go much further by including reference to the CLS helpline and the 'Just Ask!' Website in leaflets, posters 



<P>
<P><I>26 Feb 2004 : Column 536W</I><P>
and court correspondence. The allocation questionnaire (a form prescribed by rule) that seeks case management information from the parties currently does not specifically refer to the CLS. In addition a small claims leaflet is sent with the hearing notice, but again there is no reference to free legal advice or where it can be obtained.
<P>

<a name="40226w10.html_para4">The Court Service is working in partnership with the Legal Services Commission and work is already under way to improve public awareness as to where they can obtain free legal advice. That work includes a full review of computer-produced documentation and forms and two pilot schemes. One pilot is providing from court premises up to 30 minutes FREEFONE access to solicitors and advice agencies and the other is establishing an improved and more pro-active level of information service under the CLS scheme.

 An extensive property search was commissioned to identify suitable locations for the new Supreme Court in central London.

 A number of options are being considered.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40226w11.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 All applications for funding in the first wave of Building Schools for the Future (BSF) were appraised against the criteria we set out in our invitation to all authorities to apply for prioritisation. These criteria were need, as shown by low school standards and relative social deprivation indicated by high levels of take-up for free schools meals, the strength of the authority's educational vision and its capacity to deliver a large procurement project to support that vision. All proposals were rigorously appraised against these criteria and there was stringent moderation to ensure fairness. We prioritised projects which best met these criteria. Unfortunately, total demand was several times the total of over &#163;2 billion we have available for BSF in 2005&#150;06. All unsuccessful wave 1 authorities are automatically eligible, without further application, for prioritisation in subsequent waves of BSF, along with all authorities which expressed interest in later inclusion. Prioritisation of wave 2 and beyond will be on need as shown by low school standards and take-up of free school meals. We aim to announce prioritisation of authorities in further waves of BSF funding later this year.

In 2004, Aimhigher will merge with "Partnerships for Progression", a programme funded jointly by the Higher Education Funding Council for England and the Learning and Skills Council. This will create a new, national outreach programme which will operate most intensively in deprived areas. The new programme will cover all seaside towns in England.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40226w12.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 In 2003&#150;04, the Department made available an additional budget support grant of &#163;28&nbsp;million to ensure all authorities received at least a minimum increase of 3.2&nbsp;per cent. per pupil, after taking account of the effect of the Standards Fund and teachers' pension changes.
<P>

<a name="40226w12.html_para7">Portsmouth's share of this was &#163;891,000. This grant has been added to the 2003&#150;04 baseline and Portsmouth's 5&nbsp;per cent. per pupil Schools Formula Spending Share increase is on top of this enlarged baseline. Therefore, the SFSS for 2004&#150;05 incorporates the &#163;891,000 and the Government expect authorities to passport the full increase in SFSS into the Schools Budget. Portsmouth's Revenue Support Grant for 2004&#150;05 also incorporates this funding as the increase in Revenue Support Grant of 4.2&nbsp;per cent. was also on top of a baseline that included the &#163;891,000 grant.

 "Removing Barriers to Achievement" sets out our long-term plans for working in partnership with local authorities, early years settings, schools and the health and voluntary sectors to improve provision for children with special educational needs.
<P>

<a name="40226w13.html_para0">The Strategy contains a programme of sustained action and review over a number of years. The Government have invested significant sums in education with a real terms increase of over 25&nbsp;per cent. since 1997. Total estimated gross expenditure on pupils with SEN for 2003&#150;04, including estimated spending on centrally funded SEN activities is almost &#163;3.5 billion&#151;as reported by local education authorities in February 2004 as part of their Section 52 Budget Statements. The SEN Strategy focuses on getting the best value for money and using those substantial resources as efficiently and effectively as possible. At national level, improving provision for children with special educational needs will be integral to our existing and developing national strategies and programmes. Similarly, the work set out in the Strategy which is designed to build our evidence base, develop and test out different approaches and spread best practice will also be funded from within existing resources.

 All specialist schools are required to raise a proportion of the &#163;50,000 unconditional sponsorship from corporate or charitable sponsors. It would be disproportionately costly to provide information on all corporate sponsors currently sponsoring individual specialist schools. In addition, some sponsors prefer to remain anonymous. However, the Specialist Schools Trust, who are charged with raising sponsorship for specialist schools, will be able to provide a list of some of the main corporate sponsors of specialist schools. I will write to you with this information once permission has been obtained from the relevant sponsors.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport whether the bus industry has achieved the target of 99.5&nbsp;per cent. reliability agreed between his Department and the Confederation of Passenger Transport; and if he will make a statement.  [156169]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40226w14.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 Reliability is defined as the percentage of scheduled bus mileage actually run, excluding lost mileage outside operators' control. The baseline for the reliability target is 98.2&nbsp;per cent. in England in the year to March 2001. Reliability rose to 98.5&nbsp;per cent. in the year to March 2003. However, it was estimated to have fallen back to 98.2&nbsp;per cent. (seasonally adjusted) in the period July-September 2003, the most recent quarter for which data are available. We are considering the reasons for this with the Confederation of Passenger Transport.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40226w14.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 We have to date received no applications for bus quality contracts schemes, though I recently announced the Government's intention to consult on the proposal to reduce the 21-month minimum period that must elapse between the making of a quality contracts scheme and its coming into force. No statutory bus quality partnerships have yet been registered, although informal partnerships are placed in over 130 areas across the country. Plans by West Midlands Passenger Transport Authority and Birmingham City Council for the introduction of the first statutory quality partnership, on the Route 67 bus corridor in Birmingham, are very well advanced.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport how many people are employed by the Vehicles Inspectorate to undertake bus quality checks; and how many person hours were devoted to bus quality checks in the last year for which figures are available.  [156173]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40226w14.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (VOSA), formerly the Vehicle Inspectorate, employs 15 Bus Compliance Officers, two of whom are funded directly by the Welsh Assembly. The Bus Compliance Officers carry out monitoring of local bus services outside London, which involves checking that vehicles comply with their registered timetables and routes. The Officers also investigate complaints about possible instances of non-compliance. In 2002&#150;03 18,725 man hours were devoted to these activities.
<P>

<a name="40226w14.html_para3">VOSA also employs some 300 Vehicle Examiners who carry out roadworthiness checks on passenger service vehicles (buses, coaches and mini buses licensed to carry more than eight passengers) as part of their duties. During 2002&#150;03 &#163;24,786 vehicles were examined in spot and fleet roadworthiness checks. Approximately 32,500 man hours were devoted to this work.

 Passengers In Excess of Capacity (PIXC) is a mechanism applied exclusively in London and the South East and on Edinburgh commuter services across the Forth Bridge.

 The Strategic Rail Authority is charged with securing value for money in rolling stock procurement. As part of that responsibility, it is considering how best to deal with the large number of rolling stock leases which fall due for renewal shortly.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40226w15.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 The Government requires Train Operating Companies (TOCs) to set themselves reliability targets in their Passengers' Charters. Reliability performance is a measure of trains run/cancelled and does not include punctuality. TOCs publish details of their reliability performance at train stations every four weeks. If reliability falls below the trigger point set out in the Passengers' Charter, season ticket holders can claim a discount on renewal of their ticket. Within this framework, operational plans for avoiding cancellations are a matter for TOCs.
<P>

<a name="40226w15.html_para0">The Strategic Rail Authority (SRA) measures train performance by the Public Performance Measure (PPM) which combines reliability and punctuality.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what assessment he has made of the impact that his Department's proposals for business rate relief will have on businesses with a rateable value of more than &#163;8,000.  [156713]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40226w16.html_spnew5"><B> Phil Hope: </B> 
 In the White Paper "Strong Local Leadership&#151;Quality Public Services", December 2001, it stated that if relief were granted to all properties with a rateable value of under &#163;8,000, then the funding of such relief would require an addition of 2.5&nbsp;per cent. to the bills of other properties. However, as also stated in the White Paper, the relief will only be available where a property with a rateable value of under &#163;8,000 is the only rateable property occupied by the business concerned. This will ensure that relief goes to small businesses, rather than small properties which may be owned in large number by a large business. This rule also means that the addition of 2.5&nbsp;per cent. to the bills of other ratepayers may be too high an estimate. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is therefore undertaking research to determine the number of businesses that will be eligible for the relief and the addition required to the bills of other ratepayers to fund the relief. The results of this research will be available by July 2004.

 Information about the number of houses in multiple occupation (HMOs) by ward in seaside towns is not held centrally and could be provided only at disproportionate cost.
<P>

<a name="40226w16.html_para5">The Housing Bill, introduced on 8&nbsp;December 2003 is aimed at raising the standards of management and physical conditions in HMOs by requiring rented properties that represent the greatest risks to their occupants to be licensed by the local authority. Licensing will ensure that suitable managers suitably manage such properties. By identifying where they are and who their landlords are, the physical conditions in such properties can be more easily targeted under Part 1 of the Bill. Local authorities will be required to license larger HMOs of three storeys or more that are occupied by five persons. They will also have discretionary powers to license categories of smaller HMOs where there are particular problems that need to be addressed and when, following a local consultation, it is decided that alternative measures would not be entirely effective.

<a name="40226w16.html_wqn8"><B> Dr. Evan Harris: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what the reasons were for the delay between the Government Office for the South-East informing the Vale of White Horse district council that its decision to permit the development in the case of the planning application (SUN/2963/11 or GOSE/103/3/VALE/29) for residential development on the Foxcombe Road site of the old Warnborough College on Boars Hill, near Oxford, was in breach of direction from the Secretary of State and his direction that the planning permission be referred to him.  [156051]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40226w16.html_spnew8"><B> Keith Hill: </B> 
 The 'decision' of the Vale of White Horse district council to 'grant' planning permission in December 1999, despite an Article 14 holding direction being in place, related to a previous application (SUN/2963/9), which was called in February 2000 but was subsequently withdrawn after the court action concerning the validity of the 'permission' was resolved in October 2000. Application SUN/2963/11 was referred to the Government Office of the South East on 13&nbsp;December 2000 and called in on 19&nbsp;February 2001.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40226w16.html_wqn9"><B> Dr. Evan Harris: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what steps he has taken to amend his procedures following his submission to judgments in the High Court in April 2002 and September 2003 in the case of the planning application (SUN/2963/11 or GOSE/103/3/VALE/29) for residential development on the Foxcombe Road site of the old Warnborough College on Boars Hill, near Oxford.  [156052]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40226w16.html_spnew9"><B> Keith Hill: </B> 
 This particular case is unusual in its protracted nature. It is not considered necessary to amend the procedures and it is considered unlikely that this case would set a precedent for others. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister will of course keep this under review.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what estimate his Department has made of the cost to public funds of the consultant contract.  [154145]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40226w17.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The estimated costs of the new consultant contract, as agreed between the Department, the British Medical Association and NHS Confederation, are around &#163;135&nbsp;million in 2003&#150;04, rising to around &#163;250&nbsp;million in 2005&#150;06.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40226w17.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 Following the agreement reached last year with the British Medical Association and the NHS Confederation, national health service trusts and other employing organisations were asked to use the new NHS consultants' contract for all new appointments advertised after 31&nbsp;October 2003 and to give all existing consultants the opportunity to indicate by 31&nbsp;October 2003 whether they wished to give a commitment to the new contract. For existing consultants, the timetable assumed that, once a commitment had been given, trusts and consultants should seek to agree new job plans typically within three months, but the timetable recognised that trusts might need slightly longer than this to complete the process for all their consultants. We expect that the great majority of consultants who have given a commitment to the new contract will have agreed job plans by 31&nbsp;March 2004. Where, exceptionally, there are any consultants whose job plans have taken longer to complete than other consultants, NHS trusts and other employing organisations have been asked to agree arrangements with their strategic health authority to complete the process as early as possible in the new financial year.

 We are aware that the British Medical Association and some individuals have expressed concerns about the time needed for trusts to complete the process of agreeing new job plans with their consultants. The timetable agreed with the British Medical Association explicitly recognised that trusts may need longer than three months to agree job plans. We have nonetheless asked trusts to ensure that they complete the great majority of new job plans by 31&nbsp;March, while continuing to ensure that job planning delivers the intended benefits of the new consultants' contract for national health service patient care.

 For 2003&#150;04, additional funding worth 0.3&nbsp;per cent. of allocations (around &#163;135&nbsp;million) has been allocated to primary care trusts to meet the estimated costs of the new consultant contract, with a further 0.1&nbsp;per cent. in 2004&#150;05 and a further 0.1&nbsp;per cent. in 2005&#150;06.

 A number of national health service organisations have sought further information from the Department about the basis for the funding allocated to primary care trusts for 2003&#150;04 onwards to meet the estimated costs of the new contract. The Department and the NHS Modernisation Agency have provided further guidance to the NHS on this subject.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40226w17.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The new consultants' contract is based on a standard weekly commitment of 10 programmed activities for full-time consultants. The inclusion of additional programmed activities in consultants' job plans is ultimately a matter for agreement locally between national health service employing organisations and consultants, subject to ensuring that such agreements do not contravene the requirements of the Working Time Directive. The Department, the British Medical Association and NHS Confederation have agreed, however, that it should be one of the principal objectives of the contract to prioritise the use of consultants' time more effectively and better manage consultant workload.

 The national service framework (NSF) for mental health provides rationale and evidence base for a national standard for mental health services relating to carers of people with mental health problems.
<P>

<a name="40226w18.html_para2">In accordance with this NSF standard, all individuals who provide regular and substantial care for a person on the care programme approach should have an assessment of their caring, physical and mental health needs repeated on at least an annual basis. People who provide regular and substantial care for a person on the care programme approach are also entitled to have their own written care plan, which is given to them and implemented in discussion with them.

<a name="40226w18.html_para5">Progress on the development of robust local delivery plans for all the targets set out in the NHS Plan is assessed by the Department in partnership with strategic health authorities.

<a name="40226w18.html_para7">The United Kingdom National Screening Committee (NSC) is currently reviewing the prevention of GBS infection in new-born babies. As part of this review, the NSC organised a workshop in November 2003. The workshop discussed both the current tests available and potential tests for diagnosing GBS colonisation in pregnant women which are the subject of research now under way. This includes the enriched culture medium test. Further work on the use of different tests will be undertaken.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40226w20.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The first calculation of provisional 2002 national health service trust performance ratings to be based on a full data set took place on 9&nbsp;July 2002. Calculations were then checked and, where necessary, refined on a regular basis through to the publication on 24&nbsp;July 2002, in order to correct any data errors and ensure the results represented an accurate reflection of NHS performance.
<P>

<a name="40226w20.html_para0">The specific change to the criteria used to calculate provisional performance ratings between 15 and 16&nbsp;July 2002 was the removal of two performance indicators, covering access to catering facilities and information management and technology, which had been proposed as part of the rating system. The indicators were 



<P>
<P><I>26 Feb 2004 : Column 570W</I><P>
removed following a significant number of concerns raised by NHS trusts over the quality of their construction and the data that would have to be used.
<P>

<a name="40226w20.html_para1">The star ratings system uses the relative position of trusts against a wide range of performance indicators to help distinguish between three, two and one star ratings. So, in principle, a trust's position could be improved or worsened by changes to the indicator scores of other trusts. No trust's provisional rating dropped on 15 to 16&nbsp;July because other indicator data did not change significantly at that time. However, by the time the ratings were published on 24&nbsp;July 2002, the removal of these two indicators had contributed to a lower rating for some trusts, aided by the relative position of other trusts having improved as data on other indicators changed. If these indicators had remained part of the 2002 performance ratings, 11 acute NHS trusts would have received a different rating at the time of publication: seven trusts would have had a lower rating; four trusts would have had a higher rating.
<P>

<a name="40226w20.html_para2">Overall, as a consequence of the removal of the two indicators and a number of other data corrections and refinements, there were 23 acute and specialist NHS trusts that had an increased performance rating between the 12&nbsp;July 2002 calculation of provisional ratings and their final rating for that year. The 23 trusts which increased from their provisional rating were:

<a name="40226w20.html_para3">The then Secretary of State, my right hon. Friend the Member for Darlington (Mr. Milburn), raised queries about the provisional rating of nine acute NHS trusts, in the run-up to publication, to satisfy himself that ratings to be awarded were based on robust evidence and represented an accurate reflection of NHS performance. The nine acute trusts whose provisional rating the then Secretary of State queried are listed. Those marked with an asterisk are trusts which had been three-star in the 2001 performance ratings.

 Indicative timetables and budgets are set for all schemes as part of their project management arrangements. During procurement, timetables are revised as necessary to reflect changed circumstances.

<P>

 Information on the number of complaints made against either general practitioner co-operatives or private companies providing out of hours care, is not held centrally. Primary care trusts (PCTs) are responsible for ensuring that out of hours services provided meet nationally set quality standards, which include compliance with the national health service complaints procedure.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40226w21.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The Department will be responsible for setting overall direction for the health and social care system, enabling choice in service provision, setting standards, securing resources, making the big investment decisions and holding the whole system to account through independent regulation and inspection. This will mean that the capacity needed for the whole system to operate effectively is available. Patients, service users and providers of care will all know what is expected anywhere in the country. Where standards are not being met, the Government will intervene where necessary.
<P>

<a name="40226w21.html_para4">The change programme will focus the Department on a more strategic role, devolving responsibility to the front line. It will change the way the Department does its business so that it can provide more effective leadership and a better service to Ministers and the public. This will result in a reduction in the size of the core Department by 1,400&#151;from over 3,600 posts to 2,200&#151;by October 2004.
<P>

<a name="40226w21.html_para5">Staff have been consulted through major events and workshops in London and Leeds to help design the Department, monthly written and face-to-face briefings and monthly workshops on human resource questions. Government Departments, agencies and other partners have been consulted through special events in June and October 2004 to help design the changes, a series of one-to-one meetings on particular issues and progress updates from the Permanent Secretary, Sir Nigel Crisp, in June and October 2004.
<P>

<a name="40226w21.html_para6">The restructuring will provide a slimmer, more focused centre&#151;reducing burden and duplication in the system. New policy development processes will ensure we make the best use of resources by focusing on priorities and involving service users in policy development. New working methods will improve our accountability to Parliament and the public. The change programme will be evaluated to check its delivery.
<P>

<a name="40226w21.html_para7">The change programme supports the drive for better public services. It ensures that the 'centre of gravity' moves closer to the frontline. More freedom for frontline staff will lead to better services for patients and users.

<P>
<a name="40226w21.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The Office for National Statistics (ONS) routinely publishes data classifying health authorities (HAs) into categories, including urban and rural. In the future, this will be by primary care trust. The latest published data refer to 2001. In that year, in England, the rural HAs had 59.7 unrestricted principals and equivalent (UPEs) per 100,000 registered patients, while the national average was 54.3 UPEs per 100,000 registered patients. There is, therefore, no evidence of under-doctoring in rural areas overall, although there will be some areas with recruitment difficulties.
