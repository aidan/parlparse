Examples of this include the support provided to families when the service spouse is deployed on operations. In such circumstances, units organise families&#146; briefing sessions, coffee mornings, cr√®ches and community social events. Assistance is also provided to enable families to keep in touch with their loved ones through the provision of publicly funded internet and email terminals at local community and education centres.</p>

In the UK, they may come into contact with families for a whole host of reasons. The issues dealt with span the full spectrum of service and private life issues that may affect individuals or families from time to time.</p>

 The planned reduction in the maximum number of operationally available warheads to fewer than 160, announced in December last year represents a 20 per cent. decrease from the previously declared maximum number. I intend that this reduction will take place this year. This reduction is pertinent to the UK&#146;s obligations under the nuclear non proliferation treaty and means that, since coming to power in 1997, the Government will have reduced the overall explosive power of the UK&#146;s nuclear arsenal by around 75 per cent.</p>

<i>  [holding answer 6 March 2007]:</i> Responsibility for London Underground passed to Transport for London and ultimately the Mayor on 15 July 2003. Performance and operation of the PPP Contracts is a matter for London Underground (LU). Delivery of the sub-surface line upgrades rests with LU&#146;s PPP contractors and they will determine the amounts to be spent on the different elements of the upgrade in order to meet the outcomes described in the PPP contracts. As I stated in my letter of 8 February, about &#163;266 million is being invested in new rolling stock (trains) and &#163;433 million will be invested in new signalling, between 2005 and 2010, significant further investment will occur after 2010. It is not possible to disaggregate other investments such as the on-going station refurbishment programme or track replacement costs from the payments made by London Underground to its PPP contractors.</p>

 There are now very few political prisoners in Zimbabwe, in the sense of those serving prison sentences for holding or advocating dissenting political views. However, arrests and detentions on political grounds are commonplace, for example for participating in demonstrations or attending public meetings. In 2006 human rights organisations registered more than 2,500 of these cases, but without a single conviction. We are concerned that the recent ban on political rallies may well lead to an increase in such incidents. We oppose the ban as well as the arrest and detention of any persons in Zimbabwe on political grounds.</p>

The level of administration subsidy paid by the Department for Work and Pensions to local authorities in 2006-07 is &#163;555 million. The cost of administering pension credit claims in 2006 is not available. The cost of administering pension credit claims during the year to March 2005 has been estimated as &#163;237 million. This figure is an approximate assessment only. The Pension Service continues to develop its unit cost information and a modern resource management system which will support improved costing analysis is being developed. The timescales of when this will be rolled out across the Department are not currently known.</p>

 Since April 2006 every probation area in England and Wales has delivered an accredited Domestic Violence Programme and demand for them is high. Normally offenders are expected to start a domestic violence programme within four weeks of the start of the order. In some areas offenders are waiting longer than this. Every offender waiting to start a programme is under the supervision of an offender manager who is responsible for monitoring and managing the risk posed by the offender and instituting public protection measures if necessary. There is a national target of 1,200 for the number of offenders in the community who successfully complete a domestic violence programme. This target will be exceeded by the end of the financial year&#151;by the end of December there had already been 1,199 completions.</p>

<i> [holding answer 8 February 2007]: </i>Under part III of the Public Order Act 1986 it is a criminal offence to use threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour with intent or likelihood to stir up racial hatred.

This legislation was intended to close the loophole whereby racial groups (which the courts have deemed to include Jews and Sikhs) are afforded protection against incited hatred while religious groups (Christians and Muslims for example) are not. The Act contains specific protection for freedom of speech. The Government are working towards identifying a date for implementation of the Act in the next few months.</p>

 Section 58 of the Violent Crime Act 2006, which received Royal Assent in November 2006, provides for a police power to enter and search a registered sex offender&#146;s home for the purposes of assessing the risk they pose to our communities.

In order to help address it, following consultation with a wide range of stakeholders, the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency published in February 2006 a voluntary standard for vehicle registration plates which were resistant to theft. These plates are more difficult to detach from vehicles and cannot be fitted to other vehicles once detached. Products meeting the standard are currently available from about 300 retail outlets.</p>

Statutory guidance will make it clear that local authorities will need to ensure that there is sufficient provision available to meet the needs of families at risk of social exclusion, including lone parent families. The greater availability of child care should make it easier for lone parents to return to work.</p>

We estimate the cost to local authorities of provision for pupils that have been permanently excluded is &#163;3.5 million in 2007-08 (for September 2007 to March 2008), which local authorities will need to meet from within the 5 per cent. increase in the Dedicated Schools Grant (DSG) per pupil that all authorities have received for 2007-08.

These figures relate to allocated funding for the year whereas the expenditure figures in the tables in the response reflect actual in year expenditure. Provision needs to be set aside from allocated funding for future Annual Compensation Payments even though such costs are not incurred in year. This ongoing provision accounts for the difference between the figures in the tables and the figures quoted in the evidence session held on 15 January.</p>

For the most recently available period (October to December 2006) published data show that of all patients treated 39.7 per cent. were referred urgently for suspected cancer by their GP, and 60.3 per cent. were referred from another source, or routinely referred (this will include referrals from NHS screening services).</p>

For breast screening, during the year 2004-05 (the most recently available) statistics show that 71,363 women were referred for an assessment by a local breast screening service. Of these patients 71,363 were subsequently diagnosed with cancer.</p>

about whether or not they wish to proceed. Information provided to women must be honest, comprehensive and understandable. That is why the NHS Cancer Plan stated that all eligible women will receive a national information leaflet on cervical screening, which is now sent out with each invitation for screening and can be viewed at www.cancerscreening.nhs.uk</p>

The packs include advice on raising the awareness of screening, including posters and supplement local activity to promote the availability of cervical screening. We encourage all women to make an informed choice on whether to accept their invitations to be screened.</p>

NHS cancer screening programmes are currently undertaking a piece of work exploring the reasons why these women do not attend. Preliminary results indicate that some women think screening will hurt or that the experience will be embarrassing. Another key factor may be that the programme is a victim of its own success, cervical cancer is now a relatively rare disease in this country thanks to the screening programme, and the public perception of risk may have diminished.</p>

 Strategic health authorities (SHAs) agree financial recovery plans for the individual organisations within their patch. Financial recovery plans are not agreed for the SHA itself. However, SHAs have a net target to break-even across their patch each year. Their latest performance against that target was published on 20 February in our national health service finance report for quarter three of 2006-07. Copies of this report are available in the Library.</p>

 Returning the national health service to overall financial balance has been a key priority in 2006-07. Strategic health authorities (SHAs) have taken responsibility for developing and implementing financial and operational strategies to both manage and improve the financial position within their overall area. As part of this strategy, SHAs have top sliced resource allocations made to their primary care trusts (PCTs), thereby creating SHA reserves.</p>

In 2000-01 these trusts merged (with part of Chorley being allocated to another trust), keeping the name Preston Acute Hospitals NHS Trust. In the financial year 2002-03, this became Lancashire Teaching Hospitals.<br>
