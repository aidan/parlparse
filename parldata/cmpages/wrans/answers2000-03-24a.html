<a name="00324w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Duncan: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department (1) what <i>(a)</i> committees and <i>(b)</i> working groups his Department has set up to consider the revision of the Rome Convention; and if he will list the members of each such group and meetings scheduled;  [116059]

<a name="00324w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Lock: </B> 
 Negotiations within the European Union for the revision of the 1980 Rome Convention on the Law Applicable to Contractual Obligations have not yet started. Officials in my Department have not consulted outside individuals or bodies about any aspect of any such revision exercise. When the negotiations start, officials in my Department will ensure that there is full public consultation on all aspects of the review during the course of these negotiations. Officials in my Department and the Department of Trade and Industry have had a number of general discussions about the 1980 Rome Convention and electronic commerce. When the plans for the review are known the Departments will work closely together on all the policy issues raised in the review, including those affecting electronic commerce.

 Phase 1 of the Knowledge Network Project commenced in December 1999 and is currently at an early stage of piloting, scoping and evaluation of a range of possible technical options and associated improvements in working methods, before the work of building and placing information on the Knowledge Network begins in earnest, in line with normal and established Cabinet Office practice.
<P>

<a name="00324w01.html_para0">From the beginning of the Project, it has been envisaged that as much information as possible which is eventually held on the Knowledge Network will be made publicly available over the internet. That remains the case. It has never intended to be used, and will not be used, for party political purposes.
<P>

<a name="00324w01.html_para1">The results and findings of Phase 1 of the Knowledge Network Project, including the Phase 1 work programme of the Knowledge Network team, will be submitted to me by July 2000 and will subsequently be made available on the internet.

To ask the President of the Council if she will ask the authorities of the Members' Pension Scheme to increase the pensions of those former hon. Members who receive the lowest levels of pensions under the Members' Pension Scheme.  [116095]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00324w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mrs. Beckett: </B> 
 The Senior Salaries Review Body periodically reviews arrangements for Parliamentary pensions. Recent reviews have made recommendations for scheme improvements but have advised that these changes should be restricted to serving Members. This is because it is a long-standing policy of successive administrations not to make retrospective improvements to public service pension schemes, although the Members' Fund exists to

<P>
<P>
<a name="00324w01.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Gardiner: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what progress has been made on the independent review by Academy of Medical Sciences of the open-air trials in the UK using zinc cadmium sulphide carried out by the former Chemical Defence Establishment between 1953 and 1964.  [116659]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00324w01.html_spnew5"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 I am pleased to announce that Professor Lachmann and his team have now completed their review and reported. The study compared the population's possible exposure to cadmium from the open-air releases during the trails conducted between 1953 and 1964, to the cadmium exposure which people would otherwise have encountered from the environment. The material used for the trials was zinc cadmium sulphide, which is not itself an agent of biological or chemical warfare. It was used as a tracer to simulate the dispersion in the open air of biological warfare agents.
<P>

<a name="00324w01.html_para2">The Ministry of Defence welcomes the main conclusion of the report that there was no danger to public health arising from the use of zinc cadmium sulphide for the trials. The report also concludes that there was no evidence to show that the land based trials produced any higher level of cadmium concentrations in the soil than would normally be observed in the UK. Nor was there any evidence to show that cadmium released into the atmosphere during the airborne trials would have caused any ill effects. No increased incidence of diseases associated with cadmium toxicity was found in the areas where the trials took place.
<P>

<a name="00324w01.html_para3">The report by Professor Lachmann and his team is being published and I will arrange for copies to be placed in the Libraries of both Houses.

<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I am replying to your question to the Secretary of State for Defence on what plans he has to develop a UK-manufactured radio system to replace the AN/PRC-138 125W HF radios previously acquired by the Ministry of Defence. This matter falls within my area of responsibility as Chief of Defence Procurement and Chief Executive of the Defence Procurement Agency.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The AN/PRC-138 HF radio equipment with 125W power amplifiers was acquired to meet an Urgent Operational Requirement (UOR) for a secure data messaging capability in support of operations in the Balkans. This capability will be superseded when the BOWMAN HF data radio is introduced into service. There are no plans to develop another system in the interim.</FONT></UL>

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence (1) how many blankets have been declared surplus to requirements by each of the armed forces in each of the last 10 years;  [115805]
<P>
<UL>(2) how many surplus blankets have been <i>(a)</i> sold, <i>(b)</i> destroyed and <i>(c)</i> donated to aid agencies and charitable organisations in each of the last 10 years; and if he will make a statement.  [115806]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00324w01.html_spnew7"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 Comprehensive records for the last 10 years on the gifting, destruction or sales of surplus blankets are not available. Information that is available shows that since 1995, surplus blankets have been collected from Service depots by a Disposal Sales Agency (DSA) appointed contractor for marketing and sale. The contractor estimates that some 160,000 blankets were declared to them during this period but is unable accurately to break this estimate down by year or by Service. Almost all the blankets collected by the DSA appointed contractor over the five years have been sold. Prior to 1995, surplus blankets were delivered to auction site by Service transport and then lotted by auctioneers prior to sale. Records for the number of blankets sold by public auction between 1990 and 1995 are no longer available.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what is his policy on the commitment of military support to other EU member states proposed by the President of the European Commission on 10 February; and what representations he has made on the issue to the Commission.  [115560]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00324w02.html_spnew0"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 Collective defence of those EU member states who are also members of NATO is provided by NATO in accordance with Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty. This will not change. There is no such provision for countries that are not NATO members.

 In late 1998, we carried out a survey of meat inspection charges in other member states via our Agricultural Attaches in those countries. The Meat and Livestock Commission subsequently carried out a separate inquiry (the Pratt Report) into meat inspection charges and other enforcement costs. Both have been published and copies are available in the Library of the House.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what estimate he has made of the average length of time it will take a primary school headteacher to assess an application for threshold status from a teacher.  [116040]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00324w03.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 The Department has carried out a number of pilot studies with a variety of schools. These studies showed that the length of time required by a headteacher to assess an application varied depending on a variety of factors. These factors included the nature of the appraisal system in a school, the input provided by other members of staff and the extent to which headteachers used the Department's support materials.
<P>

<a name="00324w03.html_para0">Standards Fund Grant 35 will provide &#163;20 million (at a 60 per cent. grant rate) to assist with the implementation of the new threshold assessment and performance management arrangements. Headteachers can use the Standards Fund grant to cover the costs associated with approved training or support activities. The grant has

<P><I>24 Mar 2000 : Column: 696W</I><P>
now been supplemented with a further &#163;20 million (at a 100 per cent. grant rate).

<P>
<P>
<a name="00324w03.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 Earlier road safety targets were not established in such a way that local authorities were required to meet specific targets, so it is not possible to measure local authority performance in this way. The Road Safety Strategy, "Tomorrow's Roads--Safer for Everyone", includes new national casualty reduction targets to be met by 2010, which local authorities must reflect in their local casualty reduction targets. However, authorities have different road traffic casualty records which reflect their local circumstances and how well they have addressed these problems in the past. Those with a poor record should be setting themselves stringent targets, because they must make major improvements, while those with an already good record may not be able to achieve similar levels of casualty reduction. Whatever the local circumstances, local targets should be demanding and reflect the aims of the national targets. We will be monitoring performance and the publication of road safety Best Value Performance Indicators will give local people the ability to compare the performance of their authority with other authorities and to measure how it improves over time.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will list the driving test centres which have remained open because the Driving Standards Agency has determined the costs of closure to its customers as too high; and if he will place details of the cost analysis in the Library.  [115778]<P>
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will list the criteria which the Driving Standards Agency applies to the closure of its practical driving test centres, indicating when those criteria were <i>(a)</i> proposed and <i>(b)</i> implemented; and what were the factors which influenced the Driving Standards Agency to use such criteria.  [115776]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00324w03.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 Practical driving test centres must meet the operational needs of the Driving Standards Agency, including the viability of test routes, and provide a safe environment for staff and customers, all in a cost efficient manner. The criteria that apply to the location of test centres have evolved over time in the light of experience gained from earlier estate rationalisation cases, responses to the Agency's customer surveys, and following advice from independent property advisers.
<P>

<a name="00324w03.html_para1">When reviewing the Agency's property requirement, and considering possible test centre closures, the Agency needs to be assured that: average waiting time targets will continue to be met; if a test centre is to close, there are neighbouring centres with sufficient excess capacity to meet the anticipated demand, within a reasonable travel time; and candidates should not have to travel too far to take their test.

<a name="00324w03.html_para2">In denser populated areas of the country the vast majority of candidates will have a centre within a seven-mile radius. In the least densely populated areas of the country the vast majority of candidates will have a centre within a 30-mile radius. And in other areas the practical test centre should be located such that the vast majority of its candidates will have a centre within a 20-mile radius.

<P>
<a name="00324w03.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 The Driving Standards Agency normally consult interested parties about a proposal to close a driving test centre, including a cost benefit analysis. It is not, however, practicable to analyse the costs to individual customers of a proposed closure.

 No separate assessment has been made of the impact on cigarette consumption from withdrawal of Gratis points. We have estimated that the ban on advertising, promotion and sponsorship of tobacco will result in a 2.5 per cent. reduction in consumption. This would mean that about 3,000 lives a year could be saved in the long term.

 The London Regional Office of the National Health Service Executive was established on 1 January 1999 and this covers most of the health authorities of the old North Thames Region. Under the auspices of the London Regional Specialised Commissioning Group, a consortium of London health authorities has recently been established to commission neo-natal intensive care services for the residents of London.

<a name="00324w06.html_para1">Information provided by trusts is being cross-checked with information provided by health authorities to ensure that appropriate levels of service are funded to meet the needs of the London population.

 We are currently considering with the professional bodies the capacity and workforce of the breast screening programme, in view of the growing numbers of women eligible for breast screening as those born in the post-war years reach the age of 50. Our first priority is to maintain the quality of the screening programme, and while alternative staffing arrangements are under consideration no change will be introduced until we can be confident that the quality of screening will continue at its current high standard.

<P>
<a name="00324w06.html_spnew5"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 We are determined to reduce cancer waiting times for diagnosis and treatment. In April 1999, we introduced a two-week waiting time standard for patients referred urgently by their general practitioners with suspected breast cancer. Since then, over 56,000 women have benefited by seeing a specialist within two weeks. We will introduce this high standard of care for all other urgent cases of suspected cancer by the end of this year.
<P>

<a name="00324w06.html_para2">We are also introducing "On the spot" style booking systems for cancer treatment through the Cancer Services Collaborative. This &#163;6 million initiative will significantly improve patient care by streamlining and re-designing care from referral through diagnosis and treatment thus reducing delays at every stage.

<P>

 The Government have given careful consideration to all the recommendations of the Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food and have accepted those that call for Government action. For the other recommendations, the regulations that are already in place or the activities that are under way have been outlined in the Government's response.

<a name="00324w07.html_para0">The response to the report highlights the importance the Government attach to the issue of antimicrobial resistance. Additionally, it indicates the considerable amount of work that is already under way in this field to prevent, reduce or delay the development of antimicrobial resistance in food-producing animals. This includes a number of research and development projects in this area, funding for which will amount to &#163;3.7 million over the next three years. The results from these projects will direct future policy decisions and thus further minimise the risk to public health.

<P>
<a name="00324w07.html_spnew1"><B> Yvette Cooper </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 23 March 2000]:</i> Gene testing is only appropriate for the small minority of women who have a strong family history of breast cancer. Less than 5 per cent. of cases of breast cancer are linked to known genes. Counselling by National Health Service regional genetics centres, in liaison with other specialities, will enable women and their clinicians to determine whether genetic testing is required. In 1998-99, 15 regional genetic centres undertook a total of just under 1,200 tests for the predisposition to breast cancer.
<P>

<a name="00324w07.html_para2">Genetic test results are an important part of the clinical record and, as such, are covered by normal restrictions on the storage and release of confidential medical records. The Advisory Committee on Genetic Testing has issued guidance on the requirements for genetic testing for breast cancer and other disorders which appear later in life.

 Various forms of chelation therapy are licensed for use in this country for the treatment of a number of different diseases, eg Wilson's disease (a form of liver disease) and some forms of metal poisoning.
<P>

<a name="00324w07.html_para3">There are some proponents of the use of a particular intravenous form of this drug, called Ethylene diamine tetra acetic chelation therapy, for the treatment of cardiovascular disease. There is no objective evidence from large research trials that this therapy helps in general in the treatment of cardiovascular disease. At present chelating drugs licensed under the Medicines Act are licensed for various indications but none are licensed for use in treating heart and arterial disease, apart from in clinical trials. In the absence of good evidence of clinical effectiveness it would not be appropriate for the Department to recommend the use of chelation therapy for the treatment of coronary heart disease within the National Health Service.

<a name="00324w08.html_para9">Business surveys conducted in the West Midlands region in the latter part of 1999 all point to an improved outlook for manufacturing industry. The most recent editions of the West Midlands Regional Group of Chambers' Quarterly Economic Survey, the West Midlands Business Survey, the CBI's Regional Trends Survey and the Engineering Employers Federation West Midlands Business Trends Survey all reported improvements in manufacturing sales and orders, along with a strengthening in confidence among the region's manufacturing sector when compared to their findings in surveys conducted in late 1998 and early 1999. These results are broadly in line with the findings of national business surveys and reflects the renewed growth in UK manufacturing output during the second half of 1999.

 The most recent official figures show that 62 per cent. of businesses in the UK are connected to the internet <sup>1</sup>  and 10 per cent. of households have access to the internet <sup>2</sup> .
<P>

<a name="00324w09.html_para0">Achieving universal access to the internet is a priority for Government, and the Prime Minister has announced a target for achieving it by 2005. Meeting this target is vital if we are to create a successful, inclusive knowledge- based economy.

 The Euratom Treaty does not give the European Commission any responsibility for carrying out safety inspections of nuclear installations. However, Article 35 of the Treaty gives the Commission a right of access to facilities necessary for continuous monitoring of the level of radioactivity in the air, water and soil.

of such facilities were made to Caithness (Dounreay) in May 1993 and March 1999 and to Cumbria (Sellafield) in December 1993. Copies of the reports of the two visits made in 1993 have already been placed in the Library of the House. The report on the 1999 visit to Caithness (Dounreay) has still to be finalised by the Commission.

<a name="00324w09.html_spnew4"><B> Mrs. Liddell </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 23 March 2000]:</i> The Office of Gas and Electricity Markets (OFGEM) establishes distribution price controls based on levels of service, which incorporate the frequency and duration of interruptions, including those due to all but the most severe storms. In addition, OFGEM has asked companies to prepare storm strategies and has stressed the importance of maintenance of supplies under all conditions in future. It is for the management of companies to determine the most appropriate strategies in response to these incentives and concerns.

 <i>[holding answer 23 March 2000]:</i> Safety is of paramount importance in the electricity distribution industry and an issue which transcends price controls. Companies have statutory obligations, enforced by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE), as well as the Electricity Supply Regulations 1988, which is the responsibility of the Engineering Inspectorate in my Department. The Office of Gas and Electricity Markets, in proposing price controls, takes account of these obligations and companies, in accepting the price controls, accept their obligations to operate safe networks with the revenues provided.
