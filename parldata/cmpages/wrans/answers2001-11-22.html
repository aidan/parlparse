<a name="11122w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Gray: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how many medically downgraded personnel are serving at RAF Lyneham; if they may be deployed in the Falklands; and how that policy of deployment differs from that of the <i>(a)</i> Army and <i>(b)</i> Royal Navy.  [15232]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11122w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 There are 818 medically downgraded personnel serving at RAF Lyneham. Of these, 238 are fit for detachment to the Falkland Islands. The policy for deployment of service personnel to the Falkland Islands is centrally set by the Surgeon General's Department. It is designed to prevent risk to individuals with pre-existing medical conditions. Royal Naval personnel who are graded fit for service worldwide but subject to a specific medical condition may be deployed to the Falkland Islands if their condition permits. Army personnel must be employable on full combatant duties. RAF personnel must be fit for the full ground duties of their branch or trade, including all general service duties.

<a name="11122w01.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Gray: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence for what reasons HMS Cromer has been decommissioned; and what plans there are to dispose of her.  [16548]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11122w01.html_spnew9"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The decision to decommission HMS Cromer on 23 November 2001 was taken as a result of the policy-led Strategic Defence Review. The Review recognised the reduced requirement for mine clearance in home waters and concluded that a balanced force of 22 Sandown and Hunt class minehunters would be sufficient to meet envisaged levels of threat, operational tasking and commitments rather than the 23 previously planned. Plans for her disposal, including alternative Ministry of Defence use or sale, are currently under consideration.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how many air-to-air refuelling probes have been purchased for the C130J; and how many aeroplanes will be operational by 1 January 2002.  [15141]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11122w01.html_spnew13"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 Nineteen air-to-air refuelling probes have been purchased for the C130J fleet. Full operational air-to-air refuelling capability is planned for late 2002. This will be achieved incrementally in accordance with an agreed Flight Clearance programme

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what assessment he has made of the Defensive Aids Suite capabilities on the C130K Hercules aircraft; how it compares with the US equivalent; and what plans he has to install it on the C130J.  [15223]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11122w01.html_spnew14"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The capability of the C130K Defensive Aids Suite was assessed as part of the installation development and acceptance programme, based on system requirements arising from detailed threat and countermeasure evaluation. The C130K Defensive Aids Suite will not be fitted to the C130J as Lockheed Martin is currently working to finalise an installation concept for a higher performance defensive system.

 The operational advantages of secure communications systems are well recognised and the capability is already fitted to some aircraft and others are due to be fitted. As with any defence equipment capability, decisions have to be made about priorities. A secure communications capability is not currently planned to be fitted to the Hercules C130J aircraft as we have higher operational priorities

1. The figures in the table include transfers between the services, re-entrants and transfers from medical specialties to dentistry.<P>

2. It is not possible to identify the exact intake dates of army medical and dental officers. The Army intake figures included in the table have been calculated by taking the difference in strengths at the beginning and the end of the year plus the outflow.<P>

3. The intake figures comprise former medical and dental cadets and, in the RAF, former bursars plus direct entrant qualified doctors and dentists. <P>

<a name="11122w02.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Swayne: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will make a statement on the changes he is making to the advertising account for the Territorial Army.  [17079R]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11122w02.html_spnew1"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 Following a restructuring of the external marketing operations of the Army Training and Recruiting Agency's recruiting division, the decision has been taken to seek a re-tender for the national advertising contract for both the Territorial and the Regular Armies. The requirement will be re-tendered over the next few weeks and it is hoped to identify the successful tenderer in mid-December.
<P>
<P>
<a name="11122w02.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Swayne: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence, pursuant to his answer of 7 November 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 250W, on the Territorial Army, if he will make a statement about the reasons for which those members of the Territorial Army unfit for role have been so categorised.  [14377]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11122w02.html_spnew2"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The Ministry of Defence does not specifically categorise members of the Territorial Army (TA) as unfit for role.
<P>

<a name="11122w02.html_para1">As I explained in my answer to the hon. Member on 7 November 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 250W, members of the TA are considered fit for role when they have completed two phases of training which will vary in length depending on an individual's role and trade. Given that the fit for role numbers are based on 100 per cent. of deployable establishments, the majority of those who have not yet achieved fit for role status are undergoing their required training.
<P>

<a name="11122w02.html_para2">The Strategic Defence Review concluded that, in the light of the likely warning time for any large deployment, just over half the TA strength should be fit for role at any 



<P>
<P><I>22 Nov 2001 : Column: 376W</I><P>
one time and as I explained in my answer on 26 October 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 403&#150;04W, to the hon. Member for Hereford (Mr. Keetch) the TA is very close to meeting that requirement.
<P>

<a name="11122w02.html_para3">Unlike the Regular Army, the TA holds its untrained soldier strength against its deployable establishment and in order to replace the TA wastage of 25&#150;30 per cent. per year, equivalent numbers of personnel must be recruited and trained to the required standard.

<a name="11122w02.html_sbhd2"><H4><center>Military Exercises</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="11122w02.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Gray: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how many exercises involving tactical air transport have been <i>(a)</i> cancelled and <i>(b)</i> reduced over the last five years; and if he will make a statement.  [15229]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11122w02.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Since 1 April 2000 when records on the cancellation of exercises involving the tactical air transport element began, 10 exercises have been cancelled. Records were not maintained before this date. The cancellation of these exercises has had no impact on our ability to conduct operations. Records of exercise reduction are not maintained.
<P>
<P>
<a name="11122w02.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Swayne: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will list the military exercises that have been cancelled in the last 24 months together with the reason for cancellation.  [14470]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11122w02.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The table covers those exercises from the Ministry of Defence's Defence Exercise Programme (which lists some 350 exercises each year), the exercise programmes of the Front Line Commands, the Permanent Joint HQ and the Defence Logistic Organisation HQ which have been cancelled in the last 24 months. It does not include unit-organised exercises, details of which are not held centrally and which could be provided only at disproportionate cost.

 The Commonwealth War Graves Commission is responsible for the care and maintenance of the graves of all British and Commonwealth war dead who fell in the two World Wars and the memorials to those who have no known grave. Neither the Ministry of Defence nor the Commission have received proposals about major construction projects on the Somme which could require the exhumation and relocation of war graves.

<P>
<a name="11122w03.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 From 1 November 2000 to 31 October 2001, 3,827 hours were allocated for tactical air transport training. Of these, 2,910, or 76 per cent. were achieved. This type of training is very dependent on weather conditions. Restrictions imposed by foot and mouth disease and additional operational tasking also contributed to the shortfall in training hours. Despite, this, crews have met their Basic Training Requirements.

 This is an operational matter for London Underground, who have provided the table. They point out that escalators out of service include those subject to planned replacement or refurbishment programmes, and that the table represents a snapshot in time, reflecting the situation on 15 November 2001. The escalator situation can change rapidly.

 The European Commission set out guidelines on emergency aid measures in its Communication on the repercussions of the terrorist attacks in the United States on the air transport industry, which was endorsed by the EU Transport Council on 16 October. The Government are considering whether to provide compensation to UK airlines for the four days closure of US airspace, and will notify the Commission if any such aid is forthcoming. In relation to insurance premiums, we have informed the Commission of the arrangements made to provide temporary third party war risk insurance cover for UK airlines and ground service providers. We introduced our scheme on 24 September, for 30 days in the first instance. On 22 October HM Treasury announced that the scheme would continue for a further 30 days until midnight on 24 November. A further announcement will be made

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what steps she has taken since 11 September to guard against a terrorist attack on the Hartlepool AGR nuclear power station; and if she will make a statement.  [16186]<P>

<P>
<a name="11122w07.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 Robust security arrangements were already in place at Hartlepool power station before the events of 11 September. The UK's civil nuclear sites apply stringent security measures regulated by the Office for Civil Nuclear Security (OCNS), the security regulator. The security regulator works closely with the Health and Safety Executive, the safety regulator, which provides advice on the safety implications of events, including external hazards such as plane crashes, at nuclear installations.
<P>

<a name="11122w07.html_para0">Security and safety precautions at nuclear sites are kept under regular review. Both regulators are reviewing all relevant precautions in the light of the recent terrorist attacks in the USA. It is not Government policy to disclose details of security measures taken at civil nuclear sites.

 Under the claims handling agreement, signed by the Department and the solicitors acting for the claimants, interest on general damages is payable by the Department from the date of the receipt of the letter of claim. On special damages, interest is payable from either the date the loss occurred, or in some cases the date of receipt of the letter of claim. Loss of earnings are calculated at the appropriate court rate, and other heads of special damages are calculated at a reduced rate, reflecting the fact that these are assessed at present day values. Since interest runs to the date an offer is accepted and forms part of the offer, a separate figure is not recorded by the claims handlers.

<a name="11122w07.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 The Department has been supporting fuel cells research and development for many years, through the DTI Sustainable Energy Programme and the Engineering and Physical Science Research Council. Since 1992 the DTI has supported 147 fuel cell projects with a total DTI spend of &#163;11.8 million. The current DTI Programme is spending about &#163;2 million per annum, with the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) spending about the same on basic research related to fuel cells.
<P>

<a name="11122w07.html_para4">The DTI is currently supporting the first UK demonstration of a 200 kW fuel cell combined heat and power unit at Woking borough council.

It is due to report to my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister by the end of the year.

<a name="11122w07.html_para5">Fuel cells may also be used to replace or supplement the internal combustion engine in vehicles.

They will also simplify the support the Department provides for business and make that support easier to identify and to access. The Department's strategic priorities&#151;reflected in its new structure&#151;will be to promote innovation, spur enterprise and build competitive frameworks, including support for workplace standards and partnership.
<P>

<a name="11122w07.html_para11">The changes will also include the creation of a new strategy board and other boards involving Ministers, senior officials and non-executive directors; significantly greater involvement of business-people and others in the Department's strategy development and greater interchange between the Department and the private and social enterprise sectors. We will maintain an emphasis on better regulation, particularly for small businesses; deliver more consistent, streamlined advice for consumers; and have clearer roles for the Department's work in the English regions.

 It is the responsibility of the management of the Department or agency whose accounts have been qualified to take the necessary corrective action. The NAO will provide appropriate advice and assistance to support the body in this regard. The nature of the support and the resources directed will depend on the underlying reason for qualification in each case. For example, the Comptroller and Auditor General qualified his audit opinion on the Child Support Agency's Client Funds Account for 2000&#150;01 for the seventh consecutive

The examination will check a sample of maintenance assessments to estimate the effect of any errors on outstanding maintenance balances.

<a name="11122w09.html_para1">The National Audit Office will also monitor the agency's progress towards its target of implementing the new assessment system from April 2002. This system of child support was introduced by legislation in 2000 and is aimed at simplifying the rules for maintenance assessments. This is closely linked with modernisation of the Agency's operational processes and the introduction of a new computer system. This is intended to promote increased accuracy in maintenance awards and improved payment compliance. In evaluating progress the National Audit Office will assess the evidence from its own audit work, and a range of other sources including reviews by the internal audit service of the Department for Work and Pensions. The Comptroller and Auditor General will report his findings with the 2001&#150;02 account.

 The suggestion that Turkey might "annex" north Cyprus, in the event of Cyprus joining the EU before a settlement, is not new. While it is difficult to predict what Turkey might do if a divided island were to join the EU, we believe that the "annexation" of northern Cyprus would severely compromise Turkey's relations with the EU, and contravene her obligations under the Treaty of Guarantee. However, our aim continues to be a settlement before Cyprus joins the EU, though we stand by the Helsinki Council Conclusions that it is not a precondition for enlargement. To that end we urge all concerned to engage constructively in the current UN process.

 <i>[holding answer 15 October 2001]:</i> Relevant information held by the Scottish Executive is in the table. Elements of this programme expenditure relate to services of benefit to remote mainland areas. It is not practical to disaggregate the recorded expenditure in order to provide figures for support to services linking the islands and the mainland. Footnotes have been provided to give guidance on the figures supplied for each programme.

 In November 2000, the Scotland Office published a survey, commissioned from independent consultants, of the cost of motoring in Scotland as compared with other parts of Europe. The survey looked at the total cost of motoring in 15 European countries. It 



<P>
<P><I>22 Nov 2001 : Column: 411W</I><P>
concluded that the overall cost of motoring in rural Scotland is similar to the UK's average, and significantly less than some of our European neighbours. Fuel costs have declined since then.

<a name="11122w11.html_para2">The Chancellor, in his Budget of 2001, announced a package of measures to encourage cleaner transport, including reductions to the main road fuels. The Budget also included the abolition of VED on agricultural vehicles. The package will benefit up to 20,000 agricultural businesses in Scotland and, taken together, represents the equivalent of a 4p per litre cut in fuel duty to motorists and a 7p per litre duty cut to hauliers.
<P>

<sup>(16)</sup> At financial close in July 1997 the figures for the PSC and PFI were 922,600 and 943,900 respectively, producing a projected saving of &#163;21,300,000. An error in the PSC was uncovered by the NAO during the course of the work for their report on this scheme in 1999. As a result the projected saving was revised downwards to &#163;5.1 million.<P>

<i>Notes:</i><P>

The table does not allow direct comparisons between the difference schemes. Investment appraisal conventions allow different approaches to counting costs. For example, provided the conventions are consistently applied in each appraisal, costs common to both alternatives can be either included or excluded and differences in costs can be scored rather than actual costs.<P>

<a name="11122w12.html_para3">The table includes the expected savings on the schemes at Carlisle, Dartford and Gravesham and South Buckinghamshire. Greenwich, North Durham, Calderdale, South Manchester and Norfolk and Norwich all became operational in 2001. No further major schemes are scheduled to open in 2001.
<P>

<a name="11122w12.html_para4">The 23 major schemes in the table contribute to the target of over 100 new PFI hospital schemes by 2010 in the NHS plan. The target comprises a minimum of 64 major hospital schemes (capital value over &#163;20 million) and a minimum of 36 medium-sized hospital schemes (capital value &#163;10-&#163;20 million), of which 17 have already reached financial close. Information on the projected savings of medium-sized hospital schemes is not held centrally.
<P>

<a name="11122w12.html_para5">Value for money in PFI is assessed on a case by case basis upon presentation of the full business case (FBC). None of the other 60 major and medium-sized hospital schemes comprising the NHS plan target have yet to reach this stage so it is not possible to anticipate the savings to public funds for these schemes.
<P>

<a name="11122w12.html_para6">The total projected savings in net present value terms to the national health service and the taxpayer for these first 23 major PFI schemes to reach financial close is &#163;223,000,000.

<a name="11122w12.html_wqn2"><B> Andrew George: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health (1) what guidance he has issued to those hospital trusts making strategic outhouse case bids for PFIs; and what scoring criteria will be used to measure <i>(a)</i> value for money, <i>(b)</i> existing social need, <i>(c)</i> existing medical service shortfalls, <i>(d)</i> innovation and <i>(e)</i> other factors;  [15863]
<P>
<UL>(2) which initial PFI offers to acute trusts made in the last three years were <i>(a)</i> in response to a comprehensive and costed strategic outline case or plan and <i>(b)</i> following a general plan;  [15849]
<P>
(3) which acute trusts have indicated an intention to complete a strategic outline cost for a PFI investment in the current year;  [15848]
<P>
(4) how many PFI offers have been agreed between his Department and acute trusts in each of the last three years.  [15850]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11122w12.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The most recent guidance for the preparation of strategic outline cases (SOCs) was issued to the national health service last year. The purpose 



<P>
<P><I>22 Nov 2001 : Column: 416W</I><P>
of the SOC is to provide Ministers (advised by the Capital Prioritisation Advisory Group (CPAG)) with the necessary information to assess the national priority of major capital investment schemes with a capital value of &#163;20 million or over.
<P>

<a name="11122w12.html_para7">The guidance states that Ministers have made it clear that the main criterion by which schemes are prioritised is health service need, but that other factors such as deliverability and affordability are also important.
<P>

<a name="11122w12.html_para8">Under the private finance initiative procurement process, initial offers by bidders are made in response to the invitation to negotiate which an NHS trust sends to bidders selected from those who responded to the Official Journal of the European Community notice. All major schemes which are prioritised on the basis of the SOC then have to prepare an outline business case (OBC) which identifies and develops a fully costed preferred option for the proposed scheme. It is at this OBC stage that the final decision is taken on whether to test for private finance; the assessment will take into account a number of value for money factors. If approved to proceed under the PFI route, the NHS trust will first place a contract notice in OJEC which potential bidders will respond to.
<P>

<a name="11122w12.html_para9">The decision to develop an SOC must be supported and agreed to by all the key local stakeholders, principally the Department of Health regional office, health authorities and primary care trusts. Local authorities and regional offices of Government/Department for Transport, Local Government and the Regions will also need to be aware if major construction works are envisaged. Only following such agreement will the Department of Health be formally notified and a decision taken on the best way of taking it forward. No such notifications have been received to date in the current year.
<P>

<a name="11122w12.html_para10">SOCs for major capital projects are normally accepted in specific rounds by CPAG, which advises Ministers on each scheme's viability. Ministers can consider cases outside of specific prioritisation rounds where there is an urgent need. The eventual treatment of such cases will depend on the progress and priority of those schemes already approved to commence their procurements, and the number of schemes waiting to go to tender, so as to ensure optimal value for money.

The future role of health visitors will be a matter for the Nursing and Midwifery Council.

 The report of the review of security at the high security hospitals (the Tilt report) was published on 22 May 2000. All the recommendations in the report were accepted by the Government and the implementation process is on-going. Central funding for 2000&#150;01 and 2001&#150;02 is set out in the table:

<a name="11122w13.html_para2">&#163;1 million of current expenditure funding was provided in 2000&#150;01 to meet some of the costs of implementation arising in that year. The &#163;5 million for current expenditure for 2001&#150;02 has been provided specifically in response to the recommendation that additional funding should be made available to facilitate the movement out of the hospitals of patients no longer needing high security care. Other current expenditure for 2001&#150;02 arising from Tilt report recommendations has been met by the health authority commissioners of the services out of the overall expenditure allocations available to them.The capital expenditure relates to improvements to the physical security of the high security hospitals, particularly the upgrading of perimeter security that Sir Richard Tilt saw as being necessary in the interests of maintaining public safety.

<a name="11122w14.html_spnew6"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 NHS Direct nurse advisers use formalised computer based clinical assessment systems to enable them to offer appropriate support and advice to callers who may be contemplating suicide. In addition they receive specific training to assist them in undertaking a risk assessment which includes the assessment of potential deliberate self-harm. Links have been made and protocols are in place to enable nurse advisers to refer callers to local specialist mental health crisis services and to appropriate mental health helplines.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health how many student nurses received <i>(a)</i> hardship loans and <i>(b)</i> NHS hardship grants in each of the last three years, and how many have been made in the current year.  [17219]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11122w14.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The hardship loans that student nurses in receipt of the means tested national health service bursary are eligible to apply for, are funded by the Department for Education and Skills (DfES) through the allocations made to higher education institutions by the Higher Education Funding Council for England. NHS education and training commissioners (work force development confederations) are required to allocate funds for the purpose of providing NHS hardship grants for students experiencing financial difficulties and who have exhausted all other sources of support.
<P>

<a name="11122w14.html_para4">The Department does not routinely monitor take-up of either form of hardship support. However, evidence from the DfES 1998&#150;99 student income and expenditure survey indicated around 2 per cent. of NHS students claiming access/hardship support. These data are supported by information the Department gathered during 1999, which reported a total of 105 payments of NHS hardship grants (that is to say payments to fewer than 1 per cent. of eligible students).

 On 3 October my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for the Department for Education and Skills announced plans for a fundamental review of DfES student support arrangements. The new arrangements will be introduced from autumn 2003 at the earliest. The Department will be working with DfES to ensure that the needs of health professional students are taken fully into account in the design of the new arrangements, and will consider carefully what implications the changes have for the support which the national health service provides directly through the NHS bursary scheme.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11122w14.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 We have made it clear that patients must be treated according to their clinical need and priority. In July 1997 an Executive Letter (EL (97) 42) was issued to the national health service about access to secondary care services. It stated that
<P>
<BR>

<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="11122w14.html_para5">Since then, additional forms of guidance from the Department on waiting list management and clinical priority have been given to the NHS. "Getting Patients Treated&#151;The Waiting List Action Team Handbook" was issued to all NHS trust chief executives in August 1999 and advises on the order in which patients should be treated.
<P>

<a name="11122w14.html_para6">Recently, the NHS was instructed to use guidance drawn up by the NHS Modernisation Agency called the "Primary Targeting Lists Approach" to assist them in treating patients within the shorter maximum waiting times targets for 2001&#150;02. The guidance states that patients with greatest clinical priority must be treated first and gives NHS organisations the practical advice to treat patients in the right order within the maximum waiting times targets.

<sup>(20)</sup> From 1998 all farmers managing holdings for limited companies were asked to classify themselves as salaried managers.<P>

<P>

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. In 1998 fundamental changes were introduced to the labour questions in England and Wales. It appears that this change may have led to the recording of additional labour not previously included in the census returns. The change in questions has also led to a redistribution of labour between the various categories, most notably for salaried managers. Caution is therefore advised when comparing the 1997 and 1998 results.<P>

2. Figures exclude school children but include trainees employed under an official youth training scheme and paid at Agricultural Wages Board rates or above.<P>

3. Includes minor holdings.<P>

However, it also reflects a long term downward trend which results from underlying trends in demand&#151;because as standards of living rise, consumers spend a smaller share of their family budget on food&#151;and also from underlying trends in technology&#151;which mean that prices for agricultural commodities have tended to rise less quickly than general inflation. These trends can be expected to continue, to some degree, in the future.

The following table lists the amounts of compensation that became available from 1999 to 2001. Payments are shown against the year in which the compensation became available although payments are made in up to three annual instalments.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11122w17.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 16 November 2001]:</i> The current epidemic has been caused by a specific strain of the foot and mouth virus (PanAsian Strain O) which has occurred in a number of countries around the world. The precise means of the introduction of the virus into Great Britain is unknown and the subject of continuing investigations, but is more likely to have been introduced in illegally imported meat or meat products.

 <i>[holding answer 16 November 2001]:</i> Prior to the current outbreak of foot and mouth disease, MAFF had contingency plans for dealing with outbreaks of serious animal disease which included detailed operational instructions for use by the state veterinary service. The general contingency plan for foot and mouth was updated and submitted to the European Commission in July 2000. MAFF regularly held local emergency exercises in co-operation with the police, supervised by the divisional veterinary manager. Animal health offices were required to regularly update their local contingency plans.

 <i>[holding answer 16 November 2001]:</i> The co-ordination of foot and mouth policy is the responsibility of the DEFRA ministerial team.

 On 9 August 2001 the Prime Minister announced two independent inquiries and a policy commission into the foot and mouth disease (FMD) outbreak.
<P>

<a name="11122w17.html_para2">The "Lessons Learned" inquiry is to make recommendations for the way in which the Government should handle any future major animal disease outbreak in the light of the lessons identified from the handling of the 2001 FMD outbreak in Great Britain. The Royal Society has been asked to review scientific questions relating to the transmission, prevention and control of epidemic outbreaks of infectious diseases in livestock in Great Britain. The Policy Commission on the Future of Farming and Food will advise on how to create a sustainable, competitive and diverse farming and food sector.

 A consultation paper was issued in December 2000 on the introduction of an independent appeals procedure for farmers wishing to contest decisions to reduce or withhold payments under IACS (Integrated Administration and Control System) subsidy schemes in England. We announced on 15 May that we would work with industry to introduce new arrangements as soon as we can. Since then, DEFRA officials including the Rural Payments Agency (RPA) have been working on the details of the procedure prior to further consultation with the industry. The RPA is also working on parallel procedures for non-IACS schemes. In addition to this new procedure a senior DEFRA official acts as the Department's Impartial Complaints Adjudicator to investigate complaints about standards of service provided by the Department.

 Management of the Irish Sea focuses on setting TACs in line with scientific advice, enhanced technical conservation measures and, in 2000 and 2001, a prohibition on demersal fishing so as to allow the maximum number of cod to spawn.
<P>

<a name="11122w17.html_para4">The European Commission is currently preparing a proposal to the Council of Ministers for a Regulation establishing the long-term framework for recovery plans. An element of this proposal is expected to involve a significant reduction in fishing effort.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs in her discussions with the Environment Agency on coastal protection, what definition she has used for the phrase, Coastal Squeeze.  [15812]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11122w17.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 In the context of coastal defence, the term "coastal squeeze" is taken to refer to the process whereby, in the face of rising sea levels, an area of intertidal habitat, such as saltmarsh, mudflat or saline lagoon is prevented from migrating landwards owing to the presence of a hard boundary such as a sea defence.

 Operational management of flood and coastal erosion risk in England is a matter for local operating authorities&#151;the Environment Agency (EA), local authorities and internal drainage boards. I understand the Norfolk and Suffolk Flood Defence Committee of the EA is currently planning to undertake some 17 work projects or studies with a view to alleviating flood risk in areas that include environmental sites of European importance (Special Protection Areas (SPAs), Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) and Ramsar sites) in Suffolk which are at risk of flooding.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, pursuant to the answer of 15 November 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 976&#150;77, if she will make a statement on the operation of the pig industry restructuring support scheme, indicating <i>(a)</i> the total taken up, <i>(b)</i> the purposes for which the fund was used, <i>(c)</i> the amount left from the scheme unused and <i>(d)</i> what plans she has to use the unused sum.  [17152]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11122w18.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Pig Industry Restructuring Scheme (PIRS) is a Government funded scheme, introduced as part of the Action Plan for Farming, designed to offer short-term assistance to pig producers. Its aim is to help pig producers reduce breeding capacity, reduce costs, overcome any competitive disadvantage and restore long term viability; PIRS consists of two elements&#151;outgoers and ongoers.
<P>

<a name="11122w18.html_para0">Partly as a response to the outbreak of FMD, there were two outgoers schemes, both of which are now closed for applications. Under these schemes, a total of 937 bids were accepted, covering 150,000 sow places, at a cost of &#163;16 million. In terms of the number of sow places removed from the herd and of the value for money, outgoers was extremely successful.
<P>

<a name="11122w18.html_para1">For ongoers, there were a total of 712 applications in the UK and &#163;21.8 million has been offered to the successful applicants&#151;at an average of &#163;31,000 per applicant. 99 per cent. of all applications were successful; a good indication that the scheme was both straightforward and flexible.

<a name="11122w18.html_para2">On finance; all but &#163;3 million of the &#163;66 million allocated to PIRS was used to fund pig specific operations and schemes, even though PIRS itself was under subscribed. The unspent &#163;3 million was re-allocated to a business recovery scheme from which pig producers could benefit.

<a name="11122w18.html_para6">The Government's active surveillance programme has recently been stepped up so that testing of over 350,000 cattle per year will be carried out. These include all fallen stock over 24 months of age, all casualty animals over 24 months of age, all casualty animals over 24 months of age, all cattle born between 1 August 1996 and 31 July 1997 which are slaughtered under the over-thirty-months scheme and a sample of 50,000 other animals over the age of 30 months.Passive surveillance will continue as before though numbers of cattle showing clinical signs suspicious of BSE are in decline.
<P>

<a name="11122w18.html_para7">The current level of testing in France and Germany, as in the UK, is determined by EU legislation. Unlike the UK, the EU member states are now required to test all cattle over 30 months of age intended for human consumption&#151;only meat from those with negative results is allowed to enter the food chain. The Food Standards Agency considers, however, that the UK's over-thirty-month-rule provides stronger protection.

 The estimate of support for Osama bin Laden by organised groups and individuals in the United Kingdom is an operational matter for the security service and the police, who attach a high priority to monitoring and countering any possible activities in the country by foreign extremists.

<a name="11122w19.html_spnew5"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 The police and security forces closely monitor the activities of those who seek to promote the views of proscribed organisations. As head of al-Qaeda, an organisation proscribed under the Terrorism Act 2000, the views of Osama bin Laden, or those who advocate support for this organisation, fall into this category. The Metropolitan police are investigating a number of possible breaches of the provisions of the Terrorist Act 2000 as well as allegedly racially-inflammatory comments made after the terrorist attacks in the United States. Osama bin Laden's views have in any case, of course, long been in the public domain, and particularly since the events of 11 September.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if it is his intention that belief in <i>(a)</i> the teachings of Osama bin Laden, <i>(b)</i> Muslim fundamentalism and <i>(c)</i> the Reverend Moon are religious beliefs for the purposes of Part 5 of the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Bill.  [16664]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11122w20.html_spnew3"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 It is not necessary in the context of this legislation to define religion or religious beliefs. This is a matter which can be left to the courts to interpret in the wider context of the criminal behaviour being considered. We have therefore not sought to compile a list of 'acceptable' religious beliefs to the exclusion of others. It is a matter of deciding, where a criminal offence has been committed against a person or group, whether the perpetrator's hatred of that person or group was a principal or aggravating factor.
<P>
<P>
<a name="11122w20.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Chope: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what is the scope of the expression "particular circumstances" in clause 109 7(b) of the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Bill.  [16418]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11122w20.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Blunkett: </B> 
 Sub-clause (7) of clause 109 of the Anti-terrorism, Security and Crime Bill sets out the circumstances in which the Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) enabling power conferred by clause 109 can be used to create a criminal offence with a penalty of more than two years' imprisonment. The expression "particular circumstances" in sub-clause (7)(b) covers the situation where the European Union Justice and Home Affairs obligation makes a distinction between 'aggravated' and 'non-aggravated' versions of an offence and, for example, provides for a minimum/maximum sentence for the 'aggravated' version of the offence but does not specify a penalty level for the basic offence. Sub-clause (7)(b) will enable implementing regulations in this situation to apply the minimum/maximum sentence provided for the 'aggravated' offence to all versions of the offence. The courts will then be able to take the particular circumstances of each case into account when sentencing. This mechanism ensures we can transpose European Union obligations in a way which takes full account of sentencing structures in the United Kingdom.
<P>
<P>
<a name="11122w20.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Chope: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will prepare a register of the religious beliefs to which part 5 of the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Bill applies.  [16417]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11122w20.html_spnew5"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 The Government will not be preparing such a register, as the Bill does not seek to define religion or religious belief. In this part of the Bill "religious hatred" means "hatred against a group of persons defined by reference to religious belief or lack of religious belief". This is an inclusive definition, and therefore does not require a list of "acceptable" religious beliefs to be drawn up. The Government do not want to make value judgments about the nature of a particular religion. The Bill reflects the fact that what is to be considered is whether a criminal offence has been committed against a person because of, or aggravated by, the perpetrator's hatred for their religion or belief.

Our objective is to ensure that prisoners who are so severely mentally disordered that they require in-patient treatment in hospital are diagnosed, assessed and transferred as quickly as possible. Some 750 prisoners a year are transferred from prison to hospital by direction of the Home Secretary under sections 47 and 48 of the Mental Health Act 1983. It is the usual practice for such transfers to take place with an escort of either prison or hospital staff.

 The Government are committed to giving speedy and efficient support for people with disabilities and those who are unable to work. It also wants to help people to work wherever possible. The creation of Jobcentre Plus to bring together help with benefits and employment and the national extension of the New Deal for Disabled People are some of the improvements the Government are making to achieve that.

 Neither my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State nor I have received recent official representations on this matter. We have both met with the Association of Colleges recently and my right hon. Friend spoke at the Association's Conference earlier this week. My hon. Friend the Minister for Lifelong Learning met with the Association for College Management earlier this month and is due to meet with the National Association of Teachers in Further and Higher Education in December.
<P>

<a name="11122w22.html_para7">The Department does not collect information on vacancies centrally, as further education colleges are independent corporations. However, I understand from a recent survey by the Association of Colleges that there are 3,000 teaching vacancies in general further education colleges.
<P>

<a name="11122w22.html_para8">Work is under way to ensure that the further education sector benefits from similar recruitment initiatives to those already proposed for schools, such as "Golden Hellos" and the write off of student loans.

 Detailed guidance for Citizenship for 11&#150;14 year olds has been circulated to all secondary schools; a new website including an on-line training package for teachers was launched in October; nine regional training events for teachers took place this spring. The first cohort of Citizenship PGCE students started their courses in September; and OFSTED inspection guidance for secondary schools will be published next year.

 The statistics published by the Department on 20 November show that 50.0 per cent. of 15-year-olds gained at least five top grades this year. We have, therefore, met the Government's target&#151;for 50 per cent. of 15-year-olds to achieve five GCSE grades A*-C by 2002&#151;a year early. This is a result of pupils working hard, and of the first class support they receive from teachers. There are many new policies to tackle underachievement in schools and these are feeding through now into more candidates achieving better GCSEs.

As part of the Excellence Challenge programme, funding has already been set aside for up to 25,000 Opportunity Bursaries worth &#163;2,000 each for students from less well-off backgrounds over the next three years. In 2001&#150;02 we have also improved grant provision for lone parents and students with dependants with a new child care grant of 85 per cent. of the actual costs during term time and the short vacations and a travel, books and equipment grant. This is in addition to increasing significantly disabled students allowances and hardship grants during the last four years.

We are currently consulting on how best this can be delivered. We have established over 370 school sports co-ordinators to assist families of primary and secondary schools to deliver after-school competitive sports.

 The Government recognise the importance of enhancing links between further and higher education institutions and business. We are investing &#163;100 million over the next three years to create a national network of Centres of Vocational Excellence in Further Education. Centres will enable colleges to develop their links with employer networks and to focus specialist vocational provision on meeting the skills needs of employers at local, regional, national and sectoral level. In doing so they will secure active employer/college engagement to underpin, develop and strengthen innovative and flexible approaches to meeting current and future skills. We are also making available &#163;25 million towards establishing New Technology Institutes (NTls) in each region from autumn 2002. NTls, involving colleges, universities and the private sector, will increase the supply of people with skills in information and communications technology and provide support to local businesses on new technology and innovative business practices. A core feature of the new Foundation Degree, which is being introduced from this autumn, is that employers are actively involved in the design and subsequent review of programmes along with higher and further education institutions, national training organisations and other professional bodies. The Higher Education Innovation Fund provides funding to help higher education institutions make organisational and structural arrangements to enhance their interaction with business. Almost &#163;80 million has been allocated to a wide range of institutions for the most recent round of projects, which will take place over the next three years.

 The Advanced Skills Teacher (AST) route is designed to recognise and reward excellent teachers who wish to remain in the classroom rather than go into management. ASTs have an important role in helping to raise standards. They typically spend 80 per cent. of their time teaching in the usual way and 20 per cent. helping teachers in neighbouring schools. This can involve a wide range of activities such as coaching individual teachers or advising them on their professional development, giving demonstration lessons or holding workshops on particular aspects of teaching such as classroom management. Some have led specific projects within their own school or LEA, for example on provision for the gifted and talented children or techniques to overcome low achievement by boys. Many ASTs have produced or updated schemes of work and developed new teaching materials to help less experienced colleagues.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what mechanisms and procedures are in place to ensure there is effective co-ordination between her Department and the National Assembly for Wales.  [14472]<P>

<P>
<a name="11122w24.html_spnew7"><B> Estelle Morris: </B> 
 The Department for Education and Skills is working with the Assembly to finalise a concordat, which we hope to publish shortly. This records how we already co-operate and builds on the principles set out in the Memorandum of Understanding between the 



<P>
<P><I>22 Nov 2001 : Column: 458W</I><P>
UK Government and the Devolved Administrations. The concordat gives assurance to both parties that working relationships will continue to be conducted in an agreed and helpful manner.
<P>

<a name="11122w24.html_para3">A recent example of effective co-ordination was the publication by the National Assembly for Wales of its paving document for Wales, "The Learning Country", alongside the White Paper "Schools: Achieving Success" published by Department for Education and Skills this autumn.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills how much her Department has spent in real terms on advertising campaigns to promote training and education policy in each of the last 15 years.  [16098]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11122w24.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 19 November 2001]:</i> The Department's spend on advertising, for each of the last 15 years, is set out in the tables. Within the totals for the Employment Department and Department for Education and Employment there was advertising to promote employment and employability policies, as well as training and education policy. It is not possible to disaggregate this without disproportionate cost.
<P>

<a name="11122w24.html_para4">Prior to 1991&#150;92 the Employment Department agencies (Manpower Services Commission, Training Commission and Training Agency) spent their own publicity budgets. From 1991&#150;92 these were held centrally by the Employment Department. However, because of the way the information is held in our records the figures for the former Employment Department from 1992&#150;93 to 1995&#150;96 do not include expenditure by agencies. The Department for Education and Department for Education and Employment figures also do not include expenditure by agencies and NDPBs.
<P>

<a name="11122w24.html_para5">Real term expenditure is calculated using 1999&#150;2000 base year prices.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills for what reason the addendum to key skills guidance issued in September by the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority to ease the assessment burdens associated with key skills was changed.  [16195]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11122w25.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 Following publication of the final draft of the addendum on the QCA website, the generally favourable feedback also suggested that there was a potential contradiction in one short paragraph. This dealt with the collection of evidence for the Application of Number key skills qualification, at one level only (level 2). The QCA therefore removed that paragraph and is discussing with awarding bodies the best way to ensure that this causes minimum disruption.

 I have asked the Teacher Training Agency to consult on a revised set of requirements for initial teacher training, which include the need for trainees to demonstrate the ability to work in an inclusive way, respond to the needs of all children whatever their background, and challenge stereotypes.

 The Government have recognised that out-of-school hours provision has a key role to play in developing young people and raising their attainment. A number of initiatives are now in place. Since autumn 2000, a number of assessments have been made of this provision.
<P>

<a name="11122w26.html_para0">In June 2001 we published the report of the "Study Support National Evaluation and Development Programme"&#151;which showed that participation in voluntary out of school hours learning has a positive effect on the academic attainment, attitudes and school attendance of secondary school pupils.

Middlesbrough Evening Gazette and East Cleveland Education Action Zone will work in partnership with schools to give 35 gifted and talented children in years six and nine the opportunity to experience the world of work and the opportunity to produce a real newspaper. Middlesbrough LEA are also a partner LEA with the University of the First Age National Project.

In October 2001, following the "Transforming Youth Work" consultation on the future of the Youth Service, we announced a new vision for the Service. Full guidance on the role of the Youth Service and its relationship with the Connexions Service is to be published by the end of the year, with a draft specification for a new look youth service to be issued in the new year, and in January we will help new Connexions partnerships by publishing case studies of successful Youth Service links with Connexions.

 All pupils are required to study the National Curriculum from 5 to 16, which together with other elements of the broader school curriculum, prepares pupils of both genders for the opportunities, responsibilities and experiences of adult life. Teachers and other staff in schools offer information and advice on future options as part of their role under the Education Act 1996 to prepare pupils for adult life. The primary role of giving advice and guidance to young people considering learning options from 14 to 19 and beyond, including their implications for employment, falls to Connexions and careers services.
<P>

<a name="11122w26.html_para5">The Connexions service works with young people between 13 and 19 in and out of schools and subsumes the role of the Careers service. Both the Connexions and Careers services provide support to young people by working to overcome any barriers to full achievement and provide comprehensive and impartial information, advice and guidance on learning and career options from age 14. Their staff are required to maintain a full and up-to-date appreciation of how to provide services in ways which challenge stereotyping and promote equality of opportunity, and which engender this awareness in their clients.

 The materials from these projects are an important contribution to our work to support Government Departments in implementing the principles in "Learning to Listen: Core Principles for the Involvement of Children and Young People". As "Learning to Listen" makes clear, Government Departments have made a commitment to provide more opportunities for all children and young people to get involved in the design and delivery of policies and services relevant to them. Making sure disabled and other children in need are effectively involved in this work is a key priority. The Ask Us and Two Way Street materials are being included in the resource index which will accompany the "Learning to Listen" guidance (which will shortly be available over the internet at www.cypu.gov.uk).

 The special grant for threshold pay is already putting over &#163;400 million per annum into the salaries of nearly 200,000 teachers. A new special grant will provide &#163;250 million more for performance pay progression over the next two financial years. Special grants are for fixed periods. But the Government have always accepted that a new pay structure providing additional rewards for effective teachers means a substantial and permanent increase in the cost of teachers' pay. So our financial planning will continue to take account of that.

 The public service agreement target is to reduce in real terms the unit cost of asylum appeal by an average of 3 per cent. per annum. This year's target figure, which excludes accommodation and overheads, is &#163;1,025.

<P>

 Staff training is regularly evaluated in all parts of LCD&#151;including the Court Service.

The individual and manager consider whether the training met the training objectives for that individual, which vary from case to case.
<P>

<a name="11122w28.html_para0">In 2000&#150;01, evaluation showed that training contributed to an improvement in performance in 92 per cent. of trainees in LCD and 99 per cent. of trainees in the Court Service.

 This PSA target reflects the Government's Youth Justice Pledge. In 1996, dealing with a persistent young offender took an average of 142 days but figures published by my Department show that by June 2001 this had been cut to 70 days. This breakthrough was achieved through effective joint working by all the criminal justice agencies. We have now met or exceeded our target in three consecutive months: in July 2000 the figure was 71 days and in August this year the figure was 66 days.

The Witness Satisfaction Survey 2000, which was the first national survey of witnesses, showed that 75 per cent. of witnesses were very or fairly satisfied with the treatment they received. A similar survey next year will show whether the proportion of satisfied witnesses has increased. The first juror satisfaction survey, conducted in January 2000, showed that 95 per cent. of jurors were satisfied or very satisfied with their treatment by the courts. A differently constituted survey, carried out in February 2001, showed that 82 per cent. of jurors were satisfied or very satisfied. The original survey will be re-run in early 2002 to allow an accurate assessment of performance against the PSA target.

 The Lord Chancellor's Department's Departmental Report (the Government's Expenditure Plans 2000&#150;01 to 2001&#150;02) Cm 4606, presented to Parliament in April 2000 referred to an Output Performance Analysis Measure of increasing the number and proportion of young offenders fast tracked. That was in support of the Public Service Agreement target of halving the arrest to sentence time for PYOs from 142 to 71 days. That target reflected the Government's Youth Justice Pledge. Figures published by my Department show that we have now met or exceeded the target of 71 days in three consecutive months: June 2001 (70 days), July 2001 (71 days) and August 2001 (66 days).

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department if he will make a statement on the <i>(a)</i> baseline for and <i>(b)</i> redress for the failure to achieve the Public Service Agreement target in 1999&#150;2000 of reducing the unit cost of an item of originating process in the civil courts.  [14945]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11122w28.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Wills: </B> 
 The target in 1999&#150;2000 was &#163;118 per item of county court originating process, and the figure achieved was &#163;137 (16 per cent. greater than target). By way of context, the unit cost measure of performance was withdrawn as a Court Service PSA target after 1999&#150;2000 because of its limitations as a measure of efficiency, mainly because the organisation's costs are fixed and the main driver of the unit cost figure is the relatively volatile level of demand for the service.
<P>

<a name="11122w28.html_para5">The reason for the under achievement is that in 1999&#150;2000 the Court Service successfully implemented a radically different way of delivering civil justice. An assessment was made of the likely full impact on its costs and the behaviour of court users. In the event the costs of the Court Service were 6 per cent. higher than anticipated but the main cause of the increased unit cost was a 10 per cent. reduction in the level of activity. This was mainly due to court users and their advisers adjusting their activities to meet the new procedures. Given the limited value of the unit cost measure, and the unique circumstances, it was accepted in the Department's review of the Court Service's performance during 1999&#150;2000 that there had been a technical rather than substantive failure in this area.

 The Department is on track to achieve stability in the cost of legally aided criminal defence services through a number of measures which will aim to control cost:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) From 2 October 2000, firms were required to have a criminal category franchise in order to undertake Legal Services Commission funded criminal defence work in areas funded by the Commission ie magistrates' court work, advice and assistance and duty solicitor (criminal) work;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(b) all magistrates' court work, advice and assistance and duty solicitor (criminal) work has been contracted since the CDS was introduced on 2 April 2001;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(c) from 2 April 2001 only franchised firms have been able to undertake work for the CDS in the Crown court;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(d) from April 2001 the Commission has had the authority to require Very High Cost Criminal Cases (VHCCCs) meeting the relevant criteria ie cases predicted to last more than 25 days if they proceeded to trial, or to have total defence costs of more than &#163;150,000, to proceed by way of an Individual Case Contract (ICC) only. The intention was that by April 2002, all new very high cost cases would proceed by way of an ICC with the Commission. The LSC set up a Criminal Higher Cost Cases (CHCC) unit, with the aim of taking on some VHCCCs this year and all VHCCCs from 1 April next year. To date, 57 VHCCCs have been signed. The Commission has decided, having consulted the Department, that not all cases should be brought within the scheme from that date. The new contract arrangements aim to deliver significant benefits in ensuring that these cases are managed effectively and that the cost of them is controlled. However, implementing the regime for all cases from April would bring forward a significant amount of expenditure and it is necessary to manage this over a longer period of time by phasing the full introduction of the new arrangements. Phasing the introduction in this way will also give the Commission and the profession more time to further develop the new approach and apply the lessons already learned;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(e) the Crown court graduated fee scheme was extended on 29 October 2001 to cover trials up to 25 days;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(f) since 29 October 2001, both prosecution and defence advocates have been paid within the same fee structure for all Crown court trials lasting up to 25 days. Rates for an extended and unified scheme for cracked trials and guilty pleas will be introduced when the results of additional modelling and research are available;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(g) the new regulations which came into force on 1 September 2001, control more tightly the circumstances where Queen's Counsel or more than one advocate might be allowed for the defence in Crown court cases.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11122w28.html_spnew15"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 Good progress is being made towards achieving the Public Service Agreement target. We are reducing over-capacity by a combination of measures. These include using surplus capacity for coroners courts, asylum and other tribunal work; reducing the number of buildings in the same city/town by facilitating joint usage of courtrooms across the estate (Crown, county and magistrates); and disposing of those courts surplus to requirements.

 As of 31 December 2000 actual achievement was &#163;74 against a published target of &#163;71. The main reason why the target was not achieved was because solicitors were spending, on average, more time advising their clients than in previous years.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department if she will make a statement on progress towards meeting the Public Service Agreement target for the use of <i>(a)</i> BACS to achieve value for money in the payment of invoices and <i>(b)</i> electronic commerce.  [14990]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11122w28.html_spnew18"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 In October 2001 the Department achieved 57 per cent. of expenditure payments by BACS. This performance excludes any payments which have been made locally by the Courts. The use of BACS continues to be monitored by the Department on a monthly basis.

<a name="11122w28.html_spnew19"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 The Department is making good progress against its PSA targets on correspondence. For the first six months of the target period (April to October 2001) the Department exceeded its target of replying to 80 per cent. of public correspondence within 15 working days, achieving a figure of 85 per cent. For ministerial correspondence over the same period, 77 per cent. of responses were made within the 20 working day target, with on-going efforts being made to meet the 85 per cent. PSA target by the end of the period.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department if she will make a statement on the series of targets which have replaced the Public Service Agreement target of <i>(a)</i> three per cent. annual efficiency gains and <i>(b)</i> a reduction in support costs as a proportion of running costs.  [14993]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11122w28.html_spnew20"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 The full range of the Department's current Public Service Agreement targets and Service Delivery Agreement targets is published on the Department's website. A large number of the targets are relevant to the improvement of Departmental efficiency. In particular, Service Delivery Agreement targets 46&#150;53 demonstrate our commitment to improving value for money.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11122w28.html_spnew21"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 From 1 April 2001, all legal help and representation in publicly funded civil and family work has been placed under contract with quality assured providers. On 1 November 2001, there were 4,972 contracts with solicitors' firms and 381 contracts with not-for-profit organisations. As of 31 December 2000, the average cost per civil bill adjusted for changes in case mix decreased from a published target of &#163;2,151 to an actual achievement of &#163;2,069.

 As of 31 December 2000 actual achievement was &#163;150 against a published target of &#163;142. Achievement of the target was mainly affected by the Narey reforms to speed up disposal of cases in the magistrates courts. These reforms have resulted in an increase in cases dealt with under the Court Duty Solicitor Scheme instead of a full legal aid order.
<P>

<a name="11122w28.html_para8">The average cost of "Narey" representation was higher than the historical average for duty solicitor work.

<P>
<a name="11122w29.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 The pilot scheme based at Leeds combined court was managed in a way that was cost neutral for the Court Service. The evaluation of the scheme, undertaken by Leeds Metropolitan university, found that most parties that responded to the survey thought that the mediation had saved them money on the total potential costs of resolving the dispute. However, take-up of the scheme was low, with only 15 mediation appointments taking place between 1 July 2000 and 31 August 2001.

<a name="11122w29.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 The total cost of the 42 Area Criminal Justice Strategy Committees in the financial year 2000&#150;01 was approximately &#163;366,000.

<a name="11122w29.html_spnew9"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 The Lord Chancellor announced in another place on 19 November 1998 <sup>1</sup>  that charging for civil court fees should not prevent access to justice; that protection should be provided for litigants of modest means; but litigants should not expect the taxpayer to pay for court services if they could afford to do so themselves. My Department is currently working on a major programme to establish the right balance between those principals in order to achieve its objective of full cost recovery in the civil courts.

 During the period 2000&#150;01 the booklets were supplied on a demand-led basis, when requested by local courts and advice agencies and some individuals. Although no detailed record of the numbers supplied in this period was kept, the information that is held shows that the total number for the year would have been in excess of 10,000. The booklets were produced using my Department's internal printing services. We estimate the cost of producing 10,000 copies of the booklet was &#163;2,650.00.
