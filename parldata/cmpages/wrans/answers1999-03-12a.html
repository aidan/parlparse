To ask the Minister of State, Lord Chancellor's Department in each of the past four years, how many <i>(a)</i> QCs, <i>(b)</i> barristers and <i>(c)</i> solicitors were informally approached to see if they would accept, if offered, judicial appointment, in each case to (i) the High Court bench and (ii) the circuit bench; in each case, how many indicated they would, if offered an appointment at that time, decline it; and if he will make a statement.

<P>
<a name="90312w01.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The table indicates the number, according to available Departmental records, of QCs in the last four years who <i>(a)</i> have been informally asked whether, if an offer were ever made, they would accept appointment to the High Court Bench; and <i>(b)</i> indicated that they would decline an offer of immediate appointment:

In 1996, one barrister was informally approached who indicated that he would accept appointment, if offered, and subsequently did so.
<P>

<a name="90312w01.htm_para1">During the past four years, no solicitor has been approached, nor has any QC, barrister or solicitor been informally approached about appointment to the Circuit Bench.

<P>

<a name="90312w01.htm_para2">House Officials are currently negotiating prices for a range of suitable computer hardware and software, with a view to making equipment available to Members and Departments of the House at advantageous prices. The new arrangements are expected to be available in the first quarter of the new financial year.

[75815]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90312w01.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Kirkwood: </B> 
 The performance standards laid down in the current contract between the House and the Stationery Office (TSO) for the provision of printing services are monitored daily by the Vote Office, and senior House Officers meet regularly with the senior management of TSO to review performance and resolve problems. The contract will expire on 31 December 1999 unless the House exercises its option to extend the term for a limited period. With the approval of the Commission, the printing services covered by the contract have been put out to open tender in accordance with EU procedures, and expressions of interest are currently being evaluated. The relevant notice, which describes the award criteria, was published in the supplement to the Official Journal of the European Communities on 31 July 1998.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what plans he has to <i>(a)</i> encourage greater openness in the public sector and <i>(b)</i> prepare for legislation on freedom of information.  [77107]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90312w01.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 The Government's programme of constitutional reform seeks to involve people more closely in the decisions which affect their lives. Freedom of Information is a fundamental part of that process and should significantly transform the relationship between citizens and the state.
<P>

<a name="90312w01.htm_para3">The Government hope to publish a draft bill on Freedom of Information in May. It will allow for a period of public consultation, as well as appropriate pre-legislative scrutiny by the Public Administration Committee of the House of Commons.
<P>

<a name="90312w01.htm_para4">Legislation while necessary is, in itself, not sufficient. There is a substantial programme of work needed to create a culture of openness in all public services and lay the foundations for the implementation of a future Freedom of Information Act.
<P>

<a name="90312w01.htm_para5">I have, therefore, established the Advisory Group on Openness in the Public Sector to advise me on the steps needed to be taken ahead of legislation. The group, which 



<P>
<P><I>12 Mar 1999 : Column: 379</I><P>
has already had an informal meeting to discuss its programme of work, is being chaired by Lord Williams and the membership is drawn from a variety of backgrounds. Some bring a specialist knowledge of an area of public service to the Group's work, while others have a particular interest in Freedom of Information. Details of the membership of the Group are being placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="90312w01.htm_para6">The Group's terms of reference are:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"To advise the Home Secretary on proposals for promoting cultural change in the public sector to foster a culture of greater openness.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>To assist in the development of training and education programme for public servants to promote cultural change and facilitate the introduction of Freedom of Information.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>To undertake other tasks related to the implementation of Freedom of Information as directed by the Home Secretary".</FONT></UL>
<P>

<a name="90312w01.htm_para7">Copies of papers considered by the Group and the minutes of its meetings will be available through my Department's web site on the Internet. I expect the Group to submit a report to me before the end of the year making recommendations on how I might facilitate an increase in openness in the public sector as a whole.
<P>

<a name="90312w01.htm_para8">In the meantime, the Government are taking action now to extend openness and accountability. On 10 February, Her Majesty in Council approved an Order extending the jurisdiction of the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration to an additional 111 executive non departmental public bodies and 47 advisory non departmental public bodies, with effect from 15 March. By bringing these bodies within the Ombudsman's jurisdiction, this Order has the effect of bringing them within scope of the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information.
<P>

<a name="90312w01.htm_para9">The Code of Practice commits public bodies to:
<P>

<a name="90312w01.htm_para10"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>give facts and analysis with major policy decisions;
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="90312w01.htm_para11"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>open up internal guidelines about dealings with the public; and
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="90312w01.htm_para12"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>give reasons with administrative decisions; and provide information about their service to the public (their costs targets and performance and information about complaints and redress).
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="90312w01.htm_para13">The Code also sets out how public bodies should respond to specific requests for information from members of the public. The approach to the release of information is based on the assumption that information should be released except where disclosure would not be in the public interest. In the period before a Freedom of Information Act comes into force, the Government are committed to using the flexibility and discretion available under the Code to release as much information as possible.

<a name="90312w01.htm_spnew4"><B> Kate Hoey: </B> 
 The United Kingdom Presidency consulted the European Parliament in January 1998 on the text in Council Document 5202/98 of the draft Convention on mutual assistance in criminal matters between the member states of the European Union. Two of the Parliament's proposed amendments have been incorporated into the draft. The Convention has been further developed and negotiations are continuing. The most recent consolidated

<P><I>12 Mar 1999 : Column: 380</I><P>
text is in Council Document 13144/98, which was submitted to the Select Committee on European Scrutiny last January with an Explanatory Memorandum giving details of the Government's negotiating position. Copies are in the Library. The Government attach importance to the Convention, but have concerns about the scope and detail of the provisions on interception of telecommunications.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90312w01.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 Prior to 1 April 1997, no central information is available that provides details of any further offences committed while unlawfully at large. This information could be obtained only at disproportionate cost.
<P>

<a name="90312w01.htm_para14">From 1 April 1997, prison establishments have been responsible for reporting details of absconds and returns to lawful custody, along with any known further offences to Prison Service headquarters. The accuracy of the information available cannot be guaranteed as prisons are not always aware of offences committed while a prisoner is unlawfully at large, and such offences may not come to light until some time after the prisoner's return to custody.

<P>
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make a statement on Government plans to sign up to elements of the Schengen 



<P>
<P><I>12 Mar 1999 : Column: 381</I><P>
Agreement at the forthcoming Justice and Home Affairs Council; which elements are concerned; and what representations he has received on this matter.  [75722]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90312w02.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 I have today made the following statement to the Justice and Home Affairs Council in Brussels.
<P>

<a name="90312w02.htm_para0">Other member states will be interested to know of the intentions of the United Kingdom about our participation in JHA matters after the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, in accordance with Article 4 of the Protocol integrating the Schengen <i>acquis</i> into the framework of the European Union and by the Protocol on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland.
<P>

<a name="90312w02.htm_para1">The United Kingdom is committed to active and effective co-operation in the JHA field. We demonstrated that during our Presidency last year. Our citizens have a common interest in ensuring that effective action is taken to combat international organised crime; we shall continue to play a full role in such European union level co-operation. We have been playing an active part in preparation for the incorporation of Schengen and for the establishment of the new Free Movement Chapter under Amsterdam. We are also keen to assist in the development of a useful agenda for the special European Council in Tampere later this year.
<P>

<a name="90312w02.htm_para2">We have been giving serious thought to the areas of the Schengen <i>acquis</i> and the measures to be adopted under the Title IV in which we would wish to participate once Amsterdam comes into force. The different effects of our various Protocols influences our approach in this respect.
<P>

<a name="90312w02.htm_para3">Our starting point is the Protocol on frontier controls to which all member states agreed at Amsterdam. The United Kingdom Government will maintain their former controls, in line with that political agreement.
<P>

<a name="90312w02.htm_para4">Subject to the Amsterdam Protocol, the United Kingdom wishes to approach participation in Schengen and the Free Movement Chapter positively. Indeed we are keen to engage in co-operation in all areas of present and future JHA co-operation which do not conflict with our frontiers control.
<P>

<a name="90312w02.htm_para5">We are therefore ready to participate in law enforcement and criminal judicial co-operation derived from the Schengen provisions, including the Schengen Information System. We have been in the forefront of European Union co-ordination in the fight against crime and drugs and we shall maintain that position. We are also interested in developing co-operation with European Union partners on asylum--a European Union-wide phenomenon--and in the civil judicial co-operation measures of the Free Movement Chapter.
<P>

<a name="90312w02.htm_para6">Our intention to maintain our frontier controls has implications for our participation in the direct operation of external frontier controls. For similar reasons, enhanced visa co-operation raises difficulty for us. But, within this constraint, we shall seek discussions with European Union colleagues to maximise the scope for mutual operational co-operation in combating illegal immigration, without prejudice to the maintenance of our national immigration controls. We shall also look to participation in immigration policy where it does not conflict with our frontiers-based system of control.




<P>
<P><I>12 Mar 1999 : Column: 382</I><P>

<P>

<a name="90312w02.htm_para7">We realise that much detailed discussion with our European Union partners will be necessary in order to pave the way for co-operation in these areas. We shall shortly put forward a formal request for participation.

 The estimated additional cost to the Maritime and Coastguard Agency of introducing the ICCS system while retaining the four coastguard stations due for closure is in the order of &#163;2 million. This includes additional capital and running costs associated with the system. However, there could also be additional estimate costs upwards to &#163;1 million for new building works to accommodate the new equipment at least of the stations due for closure.

<P>

<a name="90312w03.htm_para2">The Government do not in general provide revenue funding for other non-charging museums, but other current initiatives should help--notably the Designated Museums Challenge Fund, which will make &#163;15 million available over the next 3 years to the 50 non-national museums in England with collections of pre-eminent importance, and the challenge fund of &#163;0.5 million in each of the next two years which is intended to promote education and IT initiatives in registered museums.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90312w03.htm_spnew6"><B> Janet Anderson: </B> 
 The New Millennium Experience Company's (NMEC) insurance arrangements reflect the Company's best commercial judgment about the scope and nature of the project's risks and exposures, as well as meeting all relevant legal obligations.

There is an on-going review of these studies to identify any potential impact on the forecast comfortable temperatures of any detailed design changes within the Dome environment.

 <i>[holding answer 9 March 1999]:</i> The sponsorship income component of the cash budget (&#163;758 million) for the Millennium Experience project, agreed by the Government and the Millennium Commission in June 1997, is not linked specifically to individual expenditure components such as construction costs. No two sponsorship deals are exactly the same; some focus on individual zones within the Dome; others focus on particular strands of the Millennium Experience's National Programme; others combine the two. It is for the New Millennium Experience Company (NMEC), in consultation with the Millennium Commission, to decide how, in its best commercial judgment to apply sponsorship support to meet the costs.

<a name="90312w03.htm_spnew9"><B> Janet Anderson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 1 March 1999]:</i> The New Millennium Experience Company (NMEC) is constructing a new pier at the Dome site which is due for completion in July this year. The NMEC issued a tender document inviting bids for river services which identified routes from central London, from historic Greenwich and 



<P>
<P><I>12 Mar 1999 : Column: 388</I><P>
from points to the east of the Greenwich Peninsula. However, no bids were received for services from points to the east of Greenwich; only bids for the central London and historic Greenwich routes were received. Licences for those routes have now been awarded.
<P>

<a name="90312w03.htm_para4">As part of its initial park and ride strategy NMEC did consider a pier option at Barking. However, no bids were received for river services from this area and the NMEC concluded that a new, temporary car park facility at Barking was not required to meet its park and ride objectives. NMEC is planning a park and ride, temporary car park at Woolwich which will be linked to the Dome by shuttle bus as the most efficient, flexible and economic means of accessing the Dome.
<P>

<a name="90312w03.htm_para5">The response to the NMEC's tender processes so far indicate that the market does not consider a river boat service from the east of the peninsula to be viable on the basis of the likely number of users. The NMEC cannot fund or underwrite the costs of such a service but the Company would be happy to consider any fresh, financially viable proposal to accommodate at its pier a commercial river service bringing Dome visitors from points east of the Greenwich peninsula.
<P>

<a name="90312w03.htm_para6">The number of visitors such a service could bring to the Dome would depend on the frequency of the service and the size of the craft but a boat service from a car park with 1,000 spaces would provide a potential demand of up to 3,000 people on a full capacity day at the Dome.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90312w05.htm_spnew0"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 Child Benefit can be paid to anyone responsible for a child, either because the child lives with them or because they contribute towards the child's maintenance at not less than the weekly rate of Child Benefit. Where two people claim for the same child, priority rules apply as set out in Schedule 10 of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992.
<P>

<a name="90312w05.htm_para0">Briefly, a person with whom a child actually lives has priority over a person who contributes to the child's maintenance; where couples live at the same address a wife has priority over a husband, a mother has priority over a father, and a parent has priority over a non-parent. In other circumstances the two persons can jointly elect which of them shall claim, and in default of such election the Secretary of State may decide.

of cases awaiting appeal hearings and the length of time appellants have to wait. Additional resources have been dedicated to the programme. The number of appeals sessions will have progressively been increased by some 40 per cent. (from 800 to 1,300 a month) by the end of this year and additional venues will have been secured. All cases are being systematically addressed to ensure that all necessary action is being expedited. The organisations who support and represent appellants are actively engaged in discussions about how individual cases can be resolved timeously with fewer postponements or adjournments. This programme is already beginning to have effect.




<P>
<P><I>12 Mar 1999 : Column: 394</I><P>

<P>

<a name="90312w05.htm_para1">We are currently overhauling the whole decision making and appeals system. We are firmly committed to tackling the unacceptable delays in the appeals service--currently averaging 7 months across the country, with some appellants waiting over a year for the decision on their case. Regulations that will simplify and speed the appeals process will be debated shortly under affirmative procedures. Under the provisions of the Social Security Act 1998, which paves the way for modernising the delivery of Social Security, one of the major areas of change will be to reduce substantially the current waiting times for appeals.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90312w06.htm_wqn8"><B> Mr. Ben Chapman: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs if he will make a statement about the Government's arrangements for the support and promotion of exports.  [77075]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90312w06.htm_spnew8"><B> Mr. Robin Cook: </B> 
 I am delighted to do so, also on behalf of the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry.
<P>

<a name="90312w06.htm_para2">This Government attach great importance to the promotion of exports. That is why in June last year the then Secretary of State for Trade and Industry and I asked the Secretary of the Cabinet, Sir Richard Wilson, to review the current arrangements for the support and promotion of exports. I am pleased to be able to announce today the outcome of that Review. Copies of Sir Richard's report have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses, and will be widely distributed. It is also available on request to members of the public, and the executive summary can be found on the FCO and DTI websites.
<P>

<a name="90312w06.htm_para3">The report records the excellent service given by personnel working on export promotion activity throughout the United Kingdom and in FCO posts around the world, while at the same time identifying a number of areas in the current arrangements which leave scope for improvement.
<P>

<a name="90312w06.htm_para4">My right hon. Friend and I welcome the recommendations, the core of which is that all trade promotion and development activities of the DTI and FCO should be unified in a new joint operation led by a single Chief Executive. The Government will expedite the establishment of such a unified operation, equipped with resources, both personnel and finance, broadly along the lines recommended in the Review. It will be known as "British Trade International". This will be a radical change. The new operation, which will have lead responsibility within Government for trade promotion and development, will provide a coherent framework for the Government's work in this area. We are confident that it will deliver an even better service to business.
<P>

<a name="90312w06.htm_para5">The operation's first Chief Executive, who will have Permanent Secretary rank, will be Sir David Wright, currently Ambassador in Tokyo. We are confident that, with his experience of export promotion at home and abroad, he is ideally equipped for the task. He will be responsible, in consultation with DTI and FCO and others concerned, for the design of the new operation's precise configuration and the implementation of Sir Richard's other recommendations. Sir David will of course have flexibility over the details of the implementation, and he will have effective control over the operation's resources and personnel. And he will be responsible to the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry and myself, through a ministerially chaired board, for the performance of the entire operation from local to international level. This will be measured against a national export development strategy and objectives which the board will set.
<P>

<a name="90312w06.htm_para6">The new board will be chaired by DTI and FCO Ministers and will subsume the present British Overseas Trade Board. It will be drawn predominantly from the private sector. In addition to senior officials from the FCO, DTI and the Exports Credits Guarantee Department, it will also contain representatives of the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland administrations to guarantee their direct involvement in shaping the national strategy.




<P>
<P><I>12 Mar 1999 : Column: 400</I><P>

<P>

<a name="90312w06.htm_para7">The current arrangements for the delivery of export promotion services in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will continue within the context of national policy. The Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish administrations would continue to have discretion to provide supplementary programmes to meet the particular needs of businesses in those parts of the United Kingdom.
<P>

<a name="90312w06.htm_para8">Overseas delivery of the services of the new operation will continue through our diplomatic posts overseas. Heads of Mission will be responsible to the Chief Executive for the performance of their posts in support of British business abroad against the strategy and objectives of the new operation.
<P>

<a name="90312w06.htm_para9">In England, the new operation will place greater emphasis on effective delivery of export services in the regions. The regional and local network, at present in Government Regional Offices and Business Links, will be integral to the new unified operation, under the effective control of the Chief Executive. In implementing the recommendations, the Chief Executive will need to work closely with the new Small Business Service which my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry announced earlier this week on 10 March 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 367-79, and the Regional Development Agencies in each region.
<P>

<a name="90312w06.htm_para10">British Trade International will seek to provide a fast, consistent and high quality response to its customers in the business community. It will be staffed by personnel from both the FCO and DTI, and may also recruit directly, including through secondments. It will be supported by modern IT and other facilities designed to provide integrated information and communication systems.
<P>

<a name="90312w06.htm_para11">The Chief Executive and the board will review the balance between the present range of export services and the provision of help to firms to develop their export capability, and also the scope for devolution of responsibility to the regional and international networks.
<P>

<a name="90312w06.htm_para12">The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry and I are confident that the new unified operation will represent a significant advance over present arrangements, both in terms of strategic direction and of improved customer focus, producing a real improvement in service delivery to business. It will be a major change and will take time to achieve. That will be primarily the task for the new Chief Executive. Meanwhile, I can assure the House that there will be no hiatus: the present services to exporters will remain fully operational and available throughout the transition period.

<a name="90312w07.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Byers: </B> 
 None of the external members of task forces and review bodies established by my Department since 1 May 1997 were recruited by way of public advertisement. Most task forces and reviews are short-term bodies established to give thorough consideration to particular issues. External members are invited to sit on some reviews and task forces because they are able to contribute specific experience and expertise. In such cases, public advertising would be inappropriate and disproportionate. Since 1 October 1998, appointments to those task forces which qualify for classification as advisory non-departmental public bodies have come within the remit of the Commissioner for Public Appointments.

<a name="90312w08.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Battle </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 5 March 1999]:</i> The current exclusions from patentability for biological materials as set out in Article 27.3(b) of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) Agreement allow all WTO members sufficient flexibility to implement patent regimes appropriate to their individual circumstances, within internationally agreed boundaries. This provision allows national intellectual property regimes to focus clearly on technical contributions whether they be by genetic modification or traditional plant breeding techniques.

<P>
<a name="90312w08.htm_spnew9"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 The success of London Fashion Week in February illustrated that the show is now firmly established as a leading fashion event alongside Milan, Paris and New York. Over 44 designers showed collections, over 140 companies participated in the exhibition and many others remain keen to take part.
<P>

<a name="90312w08.htm_para1">There are many and varied reasons why designers decide to show in other cities either instead of, or in addition to London. These are often linked to business expansion and a wish to attach specific overseas opportunities. I expect the new design talent to participate in London Fashion Week, maintaining the Show's position as the leading international showcase for innovative, cutting edge fashion design talent.

<a name="90312w08.htm_spnew10"><B> Mr. Battle </B>

The Wellcome Trust is contributing some &#163;18 million and the Gatsby Charitable Foundation &#163;2 million towards the University Challenge Fund.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="90312w08.htm_spnew11"><B> Mr. Battle </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 11 March 1999]:</i> The Competitiveness White Paper said that clusters were a strong source of business development for all types of business, not just technology-related ones. It would not be possible to list all the clusters in the UK, but examples include TV and film post-production in Central London, broadcast technology in Surrey, Hampshire and Berkshire, chemicals in Teesside, electronics in and around Cambridge, biotechnology clusters also in and around Cambridge and in Oxfordshire, Guildford and Central Scotland.

 My Department has received a number of representations from owners and trade unions involved in the textiles industry. The most significant of these was the presentation of a joint Action Plan to improve the competitiveness of the textiles and clothing sector submitted by the British Apparel and Textile Confederation and the industry's principal trade unions. The industry has now established the Textiles and Clothing Strategy Group, made up of representatives from trade associations, trade unions, academia, manufacturing and Government, to develop a strategy for the long term sustainable development of the industry, building on the work in the Action Plan. My Department provides the secretariat for the group.

 As a general rule, compensation or other financial assistance is paid only when the NHS, or individuals working in it, has been at fault. This is not the case with infection by HIV or hepatitis C through blood products before viral screening tests and inactivation processes were available. An exception to this general rule was the special payment scheme for people infected with HIV through NHS treatment with blood or blood products. This reflected the widespread public fear of the disease at the time, when the infection was rapidly fatal and associated with sexual transmission.

 <i>[holding answer 11 March 1999]:</i> From April, primary care groups covering the whole of England will share with Health Authorities the task of commissioning health services.

 <i>[holding answer 11 March 1999]:</i> The Women's Unit is undertaking, for the first time, a detailed analysis of the distribution of women's incomes over their lifetime. This will examine issues such as the pay gap, occupational segregation and the effects of key events (such as having children) on women's incomes. The project will build on the forthcoming report "Women's Individual Incomes 1966-67" which will be published jointly by the Women's Unit and the Government Statistical Service in the near future.

<a name="90312w11.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 In 1999-2000, &#163;146 million extra funding will be invested in mental health services, of which &#163;12 million will provide support for education and training of doctors and nurses. This will include general practitioners and family doctors. It is not however practicable or desirable for the Government to prescribe the exact training that any individual doctor will receive. The medical education curriculum is a matter for the General Medical Council, medical schools, the relevant Medical Royal Colleges and the Joint Committee on Postgraduate Training for General Practitioners.

Depending upon their nature and presentation, products described as dietary supplements may be regarded in law as either foods or medicines and would be subject to the same controls as apply to other foods or medicines.

 <i>[holding answer 15 February 1999]:</i> The Scottish Office had no involvement in the decision on Dr. Pusztai's retirement. This was entirely a matter for the Rowett Research Institute. The Director of the Rowett Research Institute kept The Scottish Office in touch with the situation.

To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland if he will break down the excess winter deaths for each of the last three years by socio-economic class, indicating <i>(a)</i> all ages, <i>(b)</i> those aged 60 to 70 years and <i>(c)</i> those aged 70 years and over.  [75450]<P>

<P>
<a name="90312w12.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. McLeish: </B> 
 There is no universally accepted definition of "excess winter deaths". The information presented in the table is based on a formula that has been used in recent years by the Office for National Statistics when presenting data for England and Wales. This defines excess winter deaths as the difference between the number of deaths during the four months December to March and the average number of deaths during the preceding four months (August to November) and the following four months (April to July). As this is a crude measure of the increase in mortality associated with winter conditions the numbers of excess deaths have been rounded to the nearest ten.

<a name="90312w13.htm_wqn5"><B> Mr. Win Griffiths: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (1) if he will list the <i>(a)</i> herbicides, <i>(b)</i> fungicides and <i>(c)</i> pesticides which are banned in other EU member states but are approved for use in the United Kingdom, indicating the conditions attached to their use; [75495]
<P>
<UL>(2) he will list the <i>(a)</i> herbicides, <i>(b)</i> pesticides and <i>(c)</i> fungicides which have restrictions on their use in other (i) European Union and (ii) G7 countries and which are used in the United Kingdom without similar restrictions.  [75498]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90312w13.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. Rooker </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 10 March 1999]:</i> All 18 countries of the EU and G7 have regulatory systems that only permit pesticides (including herbicides and fungicides) to be used once they have been authorised by government. This means that a common reason why a pesticide is not authorised in one of these countries is that no application for authorisation has been made for commercial reasons. When the use of a pesticide is allowed, specific restrictions on use may be imposed by the government concerned, but these could reflect differences in climate, ecology and application methods available as well as the crop to be protected and the pest to be targeted.
<P>

<a name="90312w13.htm_para0">While the EU produces lists of active substances of agricultural pesticides authorised for use in each Member State, there are no systematic arrangements for Member States to pool information about the decisions they make or the reasons for them. Similarly, the G7 countries do not exchange information about restrictions on the use of authorised agricultural pesticides. The information requested therefore cannot be provided.
<P>

<a name="90312w13.htm_para1">In the UK, all herbicides, fungicides and other pesticides are strictly controlled. The government keep pesticides under review and do not hesitate to ban or restrict products if this is warranted. We also require companies to submit any potentially adverse information which comes to their attention, including studies generated at the request of another country's authorities.

<a name="90312w13.htm_wqn6"><B> Mr. Win Griffiths: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food if he will list <i>(a)</i> herbicides, <i>(b)</i> pesticides and <i>(c)</i> fungicides on the Red List which have been approved for use in agriculture and horticulture, indicating the conditions attached to their use.  [75415]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90312w13.htm_spnew6"><B> Mr. Rooker </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 10 March 1999]:</i> Eight of the twenty three substances on the Red List are contained in pesticides approved for use in agriculture and horticulture. Atrazine, simazine and trifluralin are approved as herbicides, and gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane (lindane), dichlorvos, fenitrothion, malathion and endosulfan are approved as insecticides. In considering the approval or review of a pesticide, an assessment is made of the risk to the aquatic environment. Only if this assessment shows that there is no unacceptable risk will approval be granted or allowed to continue.
<P>

<a name="90312w13.htm_para2">All pesticides are subject to strict statutory control. General conditions relating to use are imposed by Schedules 3 and 4 to the Control of Pesticides Regulations 1986 (as amended by the Control of Pesticides (Amendment) Regulations 1997). There are 166 products approved containing these eight pesticides and I shall write to my hon. Friend to set out the specific conditions attached to the use of these particular products.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90312w14.htm_wqn0"><B> Mr. Baker: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, pursuant to his answer of 27 January 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>302</i>, what recent legal advice he has <i>(a)</i> sought and <i>(b)</i> received in respect of whether World Trade Organisation rules permit genetically modified material used in food production to be segregated as a condition of import.  [75188]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90312w14.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Rooker </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 8 March 1999]:</i> It is made clear under the World Trade Organisation Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures, that World Trade Organisation members have the right to take measures necessary for the protection of human, animal or plant life or health, but these must be based on scientific principles and not maintained without sufficient scientific evidence. A requirement to segregate GM products at import other than on this basis would therefore be a trade-restrictive measure.

<a name="90312w14.htm_para7">In the light of this clear endorsement, the Government have decided that legislation should be laid, to increase from 1 January 2000, the minimum landing sizes of lobster, edible crab, and male spider crab landed into the UK from British registered fishing vessels.
<P>

<a name="90312w14.htm_para8">From the same day, the landing of any lobster or crawfish which has been V-notched would also be prohibited. In Northern Ireland, the current Great Britain landing size of 65mm carapace width for velvet crab will be introduced there at the same time.
<P>

<a name="90312w14.htm_para9">The landing size for whelks will be 45mm. This recognises concerns expressed in the consultation exercise that, in some parts of the country, 45mm was the largest size of whelk found and larger size was impracticable.
<P>

<a name="90312w14.htm_para10">These moves are aimed at conserving shellfish stocks and clearly illustrate our commitment to work with the industry.

<a name="90312w14.htm_para13"><i>Letter from Leigh Lewis to Mr. Jim Fitzpatrick, dated 12 March 1999:</i>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>As the Employment Service is an Executive Agency, the Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your questions concerning the Employment Service's position on Family Friendly and Childcare Policies. This is something which falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of the Agency.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I wrote to all staff in the Employment Service in January of this year restating the Employment Service Board's commitment to equality of opportunity. This week, we have also issued a document entitled "Childcare Provision and Family Friendly Policy, A Statement to Staff in DfEE and ES from the Secretary of State, the DfEE Board and the ES Chief Executive", a copy of which has been placed in the Library of the House.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Employment Service has a wide range of policies available, all of which apply nationally, to support staff with family commitments and our intention is that these should be used to the full. The majority of Employment Service staff already work flexible hours, and 21% work part time. Of these, we estimate that around 40 work formal term time hours. Significantly more take advantage of our special leave arrangements to cover school holiday periods.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>With regard to playschemes, in 1998 the Employment Service had 650 playscheme places in 22 locations. No new playschemes were opened in the last twelve months, but our intention is to encourage such schemes wherever they are viable and cost effective. We are also working closely with the Benefits Agency to establish where we can make joint provision available.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Employment Service does not have a separate national budget for childcare. Overall budgets are allocated to our Regional Directors, and to the ES Directors for Scotland and Wales, who have authority individually to assess and where appropriate fund childcare facilities in individual locations.</FONT></UL>

<P>

<a name="90312w15.htm_para0">The figures cover applications for full-time and sandwich students only, and exclude applications to part-time courses, which account for more than half of all mature undergraduate students. Early figures show that home and EU part-time numbers in England in 1998-99 are up by around 1 per cent.
<P>

<a name="90312w15.htm_para1">The number of applications is not a reliable guide to the number of students who actually accept places; figures for the UK show that the number of mature students accepted for entry to full-time courses in 1998 exceeded the number accepted in 1996.
<P>

<a name="90312w15.htm_para2">The fall in mature applications between 1997 and 1998 is attributable, at least in part, to demographic factors, the declining pool of potential mature applicants and the relative strength of the labour market. In addition, the surge in students admissions in 1997 meant that fewer prospective students were expected to apply in 1998.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>As to those persons aged 18 to 24 years who have been invited to join the New Deal but who have failed to keep any appointments, I said in my earlier reply that of the 203, 100 young people who had started New Deal by the end of November, 14,170 signed off Jobseeker's Allowance before attending their initial appointment. All of the 14,170 therefore left before attending any appointment. We do not monitor centrally the number of young people who fail to attend their initial appointment but who do attend a second or subsequent appointment. Where a young person fails to attend interviews with an Adviser but continues to claim Jobseeker's Allowance a referral of their claim to an Adjudication Officer will normally be made. Up to the end of November 1998, 2,577 such referrals had been made.</FONT></UL>

 Schools are inspected by Ofsted in accordance with the published "Framework for Inspection". Those which are judged to be failing or likely to fail to provide an acceptable standard of education are deemed to require special measures. Local Authorities adopt a wide range of strategies to improve the education of children attending schools in special measures. In two cases, schools have formally closed and a new Fresh Start school has been opened on the same site. Three schools have had Fresh Starts approved to start from this September and a further four have been submitted for approval. Taken together, these
