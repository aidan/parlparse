 The issue has been discussed bilaterally with Secretary of State Powell as well as with officials in the US Administration.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20109w01.html_spmin7"><B>The Prime Minister:</B> 
 The Appointments Commission brought new standards of transparency, professionalism and rigour into the selection of independent peers. The Commission has, as required, published criteria for appointing peers on the basis that individuals should have a record of outstanding achievement, political independence, integrity and the ability to contribute to the House.
<P>

<a name="20109w01.html_para1">The 15 new independent peers were appointed because they have skills and qualities that will benefit the legislative scrutiny and revising work of the second Chamber. They included a world authority on palliative care, an expert on youth and social exclusion, a top British businessman and a leading educationist. Their expertise is already contributing to debates in the House.
<P>

<a name="20109w01.html_para2">As my hon. Friend knows, the White Paper on Lords Reform published last year proposes a statutory Appointments Commission to appoint independent members and to continue an open and transparent process of appointing independent members to the House of Lords. In the meantime the Appointments Commission will continue its role.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20109w03.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The position remains unchanged. We understand the potential role missile defence can play as one element of a comprehensive strategy to tackle a ballistic missile threat.

<P>
<a name="20109w03.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 We continue to assess the threat posed by ballistic missiles. We also continue to assess ballistic missile defence technology, which is evolving rapidly. We do so in the context of needing to tackle the threat with a comprehensive strategy and broad range of defensive measures. We fully support the continuing NATO Theatre Missile Defence Feasibility Studies, and we have a long-standing technical dialogue with the US on the subject of ballistic missile defence. We believe that it remains premature to decide on acquiring a ballistic missile defence capability for either deployed forces or defence of the UK. But we recognise the role ballistic missile defence can play, and our options remain open.

 The UK's warship repair is provided at Devonport by Devonport Management Ltd., at Rosyth by Babcock Rosyth Defence Ltd. and at Portsmouth by Fleet Support Ltd. The Ministry of Defence is currently seeking to modernise arrangements for warship support across the UK's Naval Bases and Dockyards. Within this initiative, as well as pursuing efficiencies at the Naval Bases, the MOD is seeking to increase the proportion of the programme for surface warship repair that is opened up to competition, with the aim of helping the dockyard companies to drive out excess capacity and increase efficiency.

These include humanitarian and rescue tasks; peacekeeping tasks; and tasks of combat forces in crisis management, including peace making. The European Council at Laeken in December last year agreed that the EU is now able to conduct some crisis- management operations within this definition. The EU will be progressively more able to take on increasingly demanding operations as the assets and capabilities available to it continue to develop and improve. Decisions to launch and participate in operations will be taken by national governments, on a case by case basis, in light of the circumstances at the time.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20109w04.html_spnew10"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The Allied Command Europe Rapid Reaction Corps (ARRC) remains a key component of the UK's commitment to NATO. This commitment is reflected in current plans to provide a range of strategic communication enhancements to the ARRC from 2002 so ensuring it can meet NATO requirements as a high readiness force. In addition, the ARRC will benefit

<P>
<P>
<a name="20109w04.html_spnew11"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 No decision has been taken to reduce the budget for modernising army communication systems. On the contrary, significant plans are in place to deliver a programme of continuous improvement to army communication systems through projects Bowman, Skynet V and Falcon.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20109w04.html_spnew12"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 Subject to operational considerations, geographically separate Ptarmigan systems may be connected by local telephone networks to provide interconnectivity and communications infrastructure resilience over substantial distances. In addition, elements of the UK civil telephone network can be used to facilitate low level Ptarmigan training. The number of telephones used at any given time is not recorded centrally.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20109w04.html_spnew13"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The Ptarmigan system continues to meet the operational requirement for which it was originally procured. In response to the changing and wide ranging demands now placed upon the armed forces, a number of Ptarmigan enhancements are being procured to ensure the system remains fully effective in the modern environment. Improvements include an enhancement to the mobile communications capability and an update of the Electronic Repair Vehicle. Post design services tasks, such as generator replacement, also continue to ensure Ptarmigan remains fully effective. In the longer term, the Army's trunk communication's requirement will be met by project Falcon, due to replace Ptarmigan from 2006&#150;07.

<P>
<a name="20109w05.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The Ministry of Defence is seeking to modernise arrangements for warship support and achieve best value for money for the Defence budget. At the Clyde, as at the other Naval Bases at Devonport and Portsmouth, we have received proposals from the Dockyard Companies for potential partnering arrangements. We have also received alternative proposals from the Trades Unions for the pursuit of efficiencies at the Naval Bases. All options are currently being considered, and decisions on the way ahead will be made in the near future. We have no plans to privatise the facilities.
<P>

<a name="20109w05.html_para1">The Naval Base Commander will remain in charge of the operation of the Base and in control of all the outputs. The proposals for partnering at the Clyde would entail Babcock Rosyth Defence Ltd. taking on the management of engineering support, facilities and estates management and certain logistics functions at the Naval Base. There would be no change to the overall operation of the Base. The proposals will not affect nuclear authorisation, or safety and security at the Naval Base.

<a name="20109w05.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The main issues identified by the Aircrew Retention Review as to why aircrew leave the Services were:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) The pull of a buoyant external employment market (while current difficulties being experienced by the civil sector may result in a short-term reduction in the pull factor, long-term solutions will be needed.</FONT></UL>

<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(b) A push effect arising from a diminution in faith/belief in the influence of senior leadership (this phenomenon has also been detected by other nations' armed forces).</FONT></UL>
<P>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(c) A host of "quality of life" issues, including the level of operational tempo and some career-management issues.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(d) The push of a gratuity/pension being available should aircrew decide to leave in their late 30s.</FONT></UL>
<P>

<a name="20109w05.html_para2">Action to address some of these issues was already in hand (such as the creation of a Defence Leadership Centre); for others it will take longer to make an impact but, under the direction of the Defence Management Board, plans are being drawn up to address each of the issues raised by aircrew. In some cases the retention-negative factors are an integral part of life in the armed forces and, as an acknowledgement of this, Service pay is augmented by the "X" factor (currently 13 per cent.).

<a name="20109w06.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 We are committed to equality of opportunity in the armed forces, and all posts are open to women unless there are specific reasons to the contrary. Women are not presently permitted to serve in submarines because of medical concerns for the safety of a foetus and hence of the mother. These concerns arise from the contaminants which build up in the atmosphere of our submarines, all of which are nuclear powered and may remain submerged for up to 90 days for operational reasons. These contaminants include carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and about 30 other substances potentially harmful to a foetus. Medical studies have shown that these contaminants may occur at levels which, while they are not harmful to adults, exceed those considered safe for the foetus of a pregnant woman. There is no reliable test for detecting pregnancy in its very early stages.
<P>

<a name="20109w06.html_para0">The medical advice on this issue has recently been subjected to independent review by the Defence Scientific Advisory Council and the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists; both have supported the key conclusions of the earlier research work. Accordingly, I have agreed that women should continue to be excluded from service in submarines for the time being. However, the medical research and advice will be kept under active review, together with other relevant factors such as the experience of other Navies.

 A priority one patient is defined as somebody for whom speedy evacuation is necessary to save life or limb, to prevent serious illness or to avoid serious permanent disability. The Royal Air Force aim to return such patients to the UK within 24 hours of a request for medical evacuation. The actual time taken to return a patient to the UK will reflect a number of factors, including the stability of their condition&#151;to move a patient too soon can be as dangerous as to move them too late&#151;the distance to be travelled and the weather.

<a name="20109w06.html_para3">In this context, DFID is involved in various initiatives that contribute to the conservation of wild animals and their habitats (see Annexe 1). We fund projects and studies that address sustainable forest management and bushmeat production where this is key to tackling poverty. We currently fund three projects in West Africa with direct links to bushmeat. Part of the Mount Cameroon Project (MCP) is supporting local communities to manage forest resources sustainably; this accounts for an estimated &#163;50,000 p.a. of the projects funds.

<a name="20109w06.html_para4">In Ghana we are funding the Natural Resources Institute (NRI) to undertake research into bushmeat production, and particularly into the distribution of the value of bushmeat between producers and traders and how this affects poverty. This study will be completed in 2002, when we will consider the value of an extension into at least one other West African country in 2003&#150;04, with estimated funding of &#163;50,000 to &#163;100,000 p.a.
<P>

<a name="20109w06.html_para5">DFID also supports some 155 initiatives in developing countries to help them manage their forests sustainably, and is also working to help reduce illegal logging. These initiatives promote sustainable forest management and thereby should have an indirect positive impact on wildlife. DFID's main efforts are directed at combating illegal logging at source and addressing the other underlying causes of poor forest management, since most illegally harvested timber (up to 80 per cent. in some countries) is consumed domestically.

 We fund two bilateral projects in Cameroon related to the issue of bushmeat. Since 1995, the Mount Cameroon Project team has been working closely with the Cameroon Ministry of Environment and Forests to establish field level community management of timber and wildlife resources. The Community Forestry Development Project in Cameroon has been drawing on this experience to help communities manage their wildlife resources under the Forest Law. We also assisted with discussions with the Government of Cameroon over the preparation of an Emergency Action Plan following the 1999 Yaounde Heads of State Declaration, which included measures to ensure that an EC-funded road maintenance project did not lead to unsustainable harvesting of forest and wildlife resources.

 Through our country office in Cameroon we have been holding a series of ad hoc discussions with logging company representatives on how to promote sustainable forest management. These discussions recently culminated in a workshop to review a draft logging manual that pulls together the diverse pieces of legislation into a single coherent text, that the private sector and government can then apply.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20109w06.html_spnew7"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 Our Department's procedures require that any new infrastructure project be screened for its potential impact on the environment. If initial screening indicates that the project could have significant impacts on the environment, then further investigation such as Environmental Analysis or a detailed Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) must be undertaken. All projects funded by this Department must comply with in-country guidelines or legislation. While we check the need for an EIA and the adequacy of them where they are required, the assessment itself is often financed and carried out by others.

 The World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates that "sleeping sickness" or trypanosomiasis occurs in 36 countries in sub-Saharan Africa, with 300,000 new cases annually, but poor data and diagnosis make it difficult to estimate the full extent of the problem. Recently there have been epidemic outbreaks in central and eastern Africa, especially in countries experiencing civil war and social upheaval.
<P>

<a name="20109w07.html_para0">We are committed to improving the health of poor people in developing countries, including by improving access to essential drugs and vaccines to combat the diseases that most affect them. Part of this commitment is to make safe and effective essential drugs available at an affordable price. We look to WHO to help raise the awareness of this issue and to ensure that this is achieved through international collaborative efforts. We provide significant resources to WHO to support this work.

 In addition to those who have moved into Pakistan from Afghanistan since 11 September, Pakistan has been shouldering the burden of some 2 million refugees from Afghanistan for many years. Over the last 20 years, these refugees have been hosted in camps in Pakistan or absorbed into local communities. The majority of the camps in Pakistan pre-date the agreement of the international Sphere standards.

This has included technical personnel, material and financial support. At the request of UNHCR, we have provided three relief flights to Iran and Pakistan transporting tents, shelter material and communications equipment. We have also provided a specialist site planner to UNHCR in Pakistan to assist with the setting up of new refugee camp sites. In addition we have provided &#163;6 million to NGOs, much of which has been directed towards Afghans in neighbouring countries, including Pakistan, and &#163;11 million to support communities in Pakistan most affected by the influx of refugees.

 Our procedures require that all projects are screened for their potential impact on the environment. If initial screening indicates that an activity could have significant impacts on the environment, further investigation such as Environmental Analysis or a detailed Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) must be undertaken. While our Department checks the need for an EIA and the adequacy of them where they are required, the assessment itself is often financed and carried out by others. Where we are funding the improvement of an existing enterprise or facility, an environmental audit would be undertaken rather than an EIA. All projects funded by our Department must comply with in-country guidelines or legislation. These may require an EIA to be carried out.

 DFID's day-to-day representational interests in Sierra Leone are looked after by the British high commission in Freetown, which is headed by a senior-grade high commissioner drawn from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.

 The heads of department for International Development offices overseas have substantial delegated authority. In some cases this may exceed that of their diplomatic and military counterparts.

It would not be possible or appropriate to apply any general policy based on equivalence of authority, the nature and comparability of which vary greatly from post to post.

 The Universal Declaration of Human Rights sets out every person's entitlement to social, economic, political and civil rights.

We are working to address the root causes of disadvantage, for example through rural livelihoods programmes in areas of remaining high poverty and large ethnic minority populations, and through work in primary education aimed at disadvantaged groups.

 The Department for International Development's bilateral aid budget to Angola for this financial year (2000&#150;02) is &#163;3.7 million, of which &#163;2.5 million has been earmarked for development assistance. Support is mainly provided through international NGOs, to encourage trust, collaboration and partnerships between community organisations and local government. Such community co-operation and organisation contributes toward the strengthening of civil society, which is a prerequisite to future peace and stability in Angola.
<P>

<a name="20109w08.html_para2">Our major commitment to Angola is the Luanda Urban Poverty Programme (&#163;6.65 million over three years). It began in July 1999, and aims to improve the economic livelihoods and access to basic services for the urban poor. In addition, it will enhance the capacity of communities and national NGOs to work with local government to meet basic needs.

The CSCF is also supporting peace-building and democratisation through raising the awareness of crucial target groups (teachers, local leaders, community workers, journalists, etc.) about human rights, the rule of law and promoting citizenship.

 Day to day management of the Circle line is a matter for London Underground. This line, like other parts of the underground, has suffered historic under-investment and the service provided has encountered problems arising both from this and from staff shortages which affected the reliability of operations particularly in 2001&#150;02. I am satisfied that these problems are in the process of being rectified in the short term, in particular through London Underground's programme of work to improve reliability across the network. In the medium and long term, the problems of under-investment will be resolved by the large-scale investment that will be brought into the system through our tube modernisation plans, which will deliver increased capacity, improved reliability and higher quality.

<a name="20109w10.html_para1">We have endorsed the general approach that the public transport elements of the Preferred Plan should be in place before extra road capacity is provided. The Preferred Plan proposed that a guided bus system should extend from Cambridge through to the centre of Huntingdon, though capacity on existing roads to allow a dedicated bus corridor from St. Ives to Huntingdon would only be available following the opening of the new A14 bypass. We have encouraged Cambridgeshire county council as the local transport authority to come forward with a full appraisal of the guided bus project within six months. Its completion will depend upon an order under Transport and Works Act 1992 powers.

 The Audit Commission does not distinguish in its monitoring of matters raised with auditors either between statutory objections and other matters, nor between those raised by councillors and members of the public. The total number of matters raised with, and disposed of by, auditors in any one year is in excess of 100. The majority of all such matters tend to relate to small sums of money in local councils. The Audit Commission does monitor complex and high-value audit cases. There are currently 11 such cases. In six of these the auditors' investigations have been ongoing for more than two years. In the other five cases, the investigation has been on-going for less than two years.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions, pursuant to his oral statement of 4 December 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 168, if he will set out his reasons for introducing a minimum level of grant increase for the Greater London Authority; and what assessment he has made of the impact of that decision.  [25843]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20109w12.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Byers: </B> 
 In both 2000&#150;01 and 2001&#150;02 the Greater London authority was guaranteed a minimum level of grant increase of 0 per cent. under the Central Support Protection Grant scheme, as were other authorities without education and social services responsibilities.
<P>

<a name="20109w12.html_para5">For 2001&#150;02 we replaced the Central Support Protection Grant for authorities with education and social services responsibilities by the floor and ceiling damping mechanism which operates directly on the amount of Revenue Support Grant payable to an authority.
<P>

<a name="20109w12.html_para6">For 2002&#150;03 we have extended floor and ceiling damping to cover all local authorities who are entitled to receive Revenue Support Grant, and have also raised the minimum level of grant increase for authorities without education and social services responsibilities from 0 per cent. to 2.3 per cent.

<a name="20109w12.html_para7">Providing a minimum level of grant increase, based on a like-for-like comparison of grants in 2002&#150;03 with what they would have been in 2001&#150;02 if the transfers and responsibilities applying in 2002&#150;03 had been in place in 2001&#150;02, provides stability and so helps local authorities to plan effectively. The floor and ceiling damping mechanism is fairer and more transparent than the damping previously provided through the Central Support Protection Grant scheme.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions what progress has been made by the Social Exclusion Unit to reduce the number of rough sleepers.  [23455]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20109w12.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 The Rough Sleepers Unit was established in April 1999 following a recommendation of the Social Exclusion Unit in their 1998 report into rough sleeping. The unit was tasked by the Prime Minister to reduce the number of people sleeping rough in England to as near to zero as possible and by at least two thirds by 2002.
<P>

<a name="20109w12.html_para10">The Rough Sleepers Unit published its strategy on tackling rough sleeping, "Coming in from the Cold", in December 1999. The strategy outlined a raft of new policies and services to deliver the target, which are now all in place across England. These services include helping people sleeping rough on the streets with drug, alcohol and mental health problems; helping former rough sleepers rebuild their lives through education, training and 



<P>
<P><I>9 Jan 2002 : Column: 862W</I><P>
employment; and preventing a new generation of rough sleepers particularly those leaving care, the armed forces and prison.
<P>

<a name="20109w12.html_para11">The Prime Minister announced on 3 December 2001 that his target had been met and figures show that there are now 532 people sleeping rough in England, compared with around 1,850 in June 1998. This represents a reduction of 71 per cent.
<P>

<a name="20109w12.html_para12">The success has been due to the RSU's strategy and the hard work of key partners in central and local government and the voluntary and private sector. The RSU's second progress report, published in summer 2001, shows the significant impact the "Coming in from the Cold" strategy has made to individual lives.
<P>

<a name="20109w12.html_para13">My noble Friend the Minister for Housing and Planning announced on 3 December that a new Homelessness Directorate would be established in January to bring together and invigorate exiting work to help homeless people and to develop new work to prevent homelessness and investigate its underlying causes.

 The issue of the appropriate job dust factor for training officers was recently referred to the Dust Reference Panel (DRP), an expert body that is jointly instructed by the claimants' solicitors' co-ordinating group (CG) and the Department. The DRP's report concludes that training officers would spend the majority of their time in a surface non-dusty environment, with only occasional visits underground, and as such should be classified as 'surface non-dusty'. The Department is in discussion with the CG about the DRP's conclusions. If both parties accept the DRP's report, training officers will not be eligible for compensation under the scheme. The category of mining instructor has not yet been referred to the DRP, and no request has been received from the CG for such a referral. The Department proposes to put the category to the DRP as soon as possible, subject to the CG's agreement.

 Commission Regulation (Euratom) No. 3227 came into force in 1977. The first Euratom safeguard inspection visit to the BNFL Sellafield facility took place in 1973 but, as was announced to Parliament in 1986, on 4 June 1986, <i>Official Report,</i> columns 594&#150;95, the simultaneous processing of civil and non-civil material meant that, until then, Euratom safeguard inspectors had not had access to mixed civil/non-civil areas of the facility. However, the co-processing of civil and non-civil material was ended in 1986, since when safeguards procedures have been in place to enable Euratom safeguard inspection of all civil material at the Sellafield facility. The verification activities involved are designed to detect the possible diversion of civil nuclear material from its declared use. There are regular inspections to confirm that information provided by the facility operator pursuant to Commission Regulation (Euratom) No. 3227 is correct (i.e. that the facility, its inventories of nuclear material and changes in these inventories are as reported). Euratom safeguard inspection activities at places such as Sellafield include access to confirm the facility's design, extensive access to and evaluation of plant and process operational data, and independent verification of the nuclear material itself&#151;either by means of direct sampling and/or measurement, or by the application of "containment" and "surveillance measures" (e.g. sealing containers or stores of material, or video surveillance of plant areas) to confirm that previously measured material remains unchanged.

 The Government do not make forecasts for growth in each type of renewable energy generation. How each type will contribute to overall targets for renewable energy will be a matter for the market.

 In the UK, the DTI's civil aeronautics research programme supports long-term research in key aeronautics technologies by providing grants to industry, research organisations and universities. In March 2001, the then Secretary of State announced the continuation of this programme for five years covering the period from April 2001 to March 2006. Funding for 2001&#150;02 is expected to total &#163;20 million. Future funding of the Department's civil aeronautics research programmes will be determined alongside the funding of other DTI budgets as part of the Department's business support review and the Government's Spending Review 2002.
<P>

<a name="20109w16.html_para6">Additionally, funding for the science base provided through the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council and related to aerospace research totalled around &#163;14 million in 2000&#150;01.
<P>

<a name="20109w16.html_para7">The DTI also invests in the design and development of major civil aerospace programmes through launch investment. The most recent examples have been for Airbus UK to design and develop the wings for the Airbus A380 superjumbo programme (a Government investment of up to &#163;530 million) and for Rolls-Royce to design and develop the Trent 900 engine for the A380 and the Trent 600 engine for potential future Boeing large aircraft (a Government investment of up to &#163;250 million).
<P>

<a name="20109w16.html_para8">As part of its Applied and Corporate Research Programmes and associated technology demonstrators, the Ministry of Defence spends about &#163;120 million per annum on aerospace-related work for specific defence needs.

<P>

<a name="20109w16.html_para10">In the USA, aeronautical research activity funded through NASA totals several hundred million pounds annually though the USA does not provide Launch Investment for aerospace developments.

 <i>[holding answer 19 December 2001]:</i> Housing issues in Wales are generally a matter for the National Assembly for Wales. However, the Government and devolved Administrations are working in partnership to tackle fuel poverty throughout the UK through the UK Fuel Poverty Strategy. One of the Government's initiatives in this area is the payment of winter fuel payments, now at &#163;200 a year, helping up to 460,000 pensioner households in Wales.

However, using a proxy of households in Wales eligible for the Home Energy Efficiency Scheme (based on the Welsh House Condition Survey 1997&#150;98), the strategy estimated that of the approximately 222,000 such households in Wales, 117,000 contain at least one person over the age of 60; 40,000 are lone parents; 32,000 contain at least one person who is sick or disabled and 33,000 are other forms of households with children.

Civil servants are encouraged, in the first instance, to raise complaints made under paragraph 11 of the civil service code with their line manager. IF for any reason this is not felt to be possible, perhaps because the line manager is part of the complaint, individuals may take their complaint to a nominated official (or officials). It is not possible to provide a comprehensive figure for the number of complaints made within this Department under paragraph 11 of the code as there is no requirement for managers to report to the centre details of complaints made under the civil service code which are resolved within the management line.

<P>
<a name="20109w19.html_spnew0"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 To commemorate the 150th anniversary of J. M. W. Turner's death, Tate Britain staged an exhibition from 5 March to 15 July 2001, focusing on the contents of Turner's own gallery. To mark the anniversary Tate Britain is also currently featuring in its anniversary display area an example of Turner's views of Venice, which was also one of the first of his works to enter the national collection.
<P>

<a name="20109w19.html_para0">The Royal Academy held a major commemorative exhibition of Turner's finished watercolours from 2 December 2000 until 18 February 2001 to commemorate the anniversary. Most of the exhibits were lent by other national and international institutions with over 40 works on loan from private collections.
<P>

<a name="20109w19.html_para1">A single holding of the works from Turner's bequest to the nation was made possible with the opening of the Clore Wing at the Tate Gallery (now Tate Britain) in 1987. Although other collections in the UK continue to hold and display works by the artist, this represents the largest single national collection of Turner's work, where works may be viewed and studied in depth.

<a name="20109w19.html_spnew3"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 Pricing policy is a commercial decision for each hotel operator in light of prevailing market forces. Therefore, DCMS does not monitor prices charged by individual accommodation providers. However, my Department is concerned with price transparency and the need for guests to be able to form a judgment about how much it will cost them before purchasing a room. The Tourism (Sleeping Accommodation Price Display) Order 1977 requires hotels to display in their reception areas or entrances the highest and lowest prices for each type of room (e.g. single, double etc.) and those prices must include, where appropriate, any service charge or meals and whether VAT is included.

[25396]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20109w19.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 The Government are currently consulting on their view that the Charity Commission's decision on charitable status would appear to offer better prospects for community amateur sports clubs than a tax relief package the Government had been considering. Responses to that consultation are requested by the Treasury by 1 February 2002. I intend to meet representatives of the Charity Commission shortly to discuss the extent of applications from sport for charitable status and the fuller guidance the Commission intends to issue on this subject in due course. These discussions will include the need for greater clarity on a range of issues in the current guidance including the treatment of different levels of skill among participants at sports clubs seeking charitable status.




<P>
<P><I>9 Jan 2002 : Column: 886W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="20109w19.html_para3">It is the Government's understanding that all skill levels can be catered for by a sports club promoting healthy recreation which obtains charitable status but that such a commitment will not rule out selection of teams on merit and/or different coaching offered to different ability levels. The Commission recognises that the provision of coaching to regional, national and international standards often acts as an incentive to other less able players to improve and/or to attract new people to the club.

<P>
<a name="20109w21.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Andrew Smith: </B> 
 The Inland Revenue carries out inquiries, as opposed to investigations, into tax returns as part of its work in tackling non-compliance. At the outset of any inquiry there is no assumption as to whether a return is incorrect and/or incomplete and, therefore, no assumption about the existence or otherwise of fraud or negligence. While the majority of inquiries are undertaken on the basis of a perceived compliance risk this is not true of all inquiries and a successful inquiry is one that is carried out thoroughly and in accordance with appropriate codes of practice.

 This ruling, along with the cases of Gloszczuk, Kondova, Barkoci and Malik, was welcomed by the United Kingdom Government. A detailed assessment of its implications is being made but our view is that the United Kingdom can continue to apply its Immigration Rules in such cases (paragraphs 211&#150;223 of HC 395). Importantly, the rulings support our view that those here illegally cannot benefit from the association agreements.
<P>

<a name="20109w23.html_para0">The provisions on self-establishment in the association agreements are subject to limitations justified on the ground of public policy. A member state is entitled to rely on the public policy limitation in relation to those seeking to establish themselves in its territory under the agreements as self-employed prostitutes where that member state has adopted measures designed to combat prostitution carried out by its own nations.

<P>

<a name="20109w23.html_para2">The right of establishment under the Article 43 of the EC Treaty is effected by EC Council Directive 73/148, which deals with the abolition of restrictions on movement and residence within the EU for nationals of member states with regard to establishment and the provision of services. Article 8 of that directive allows member states to derogate from the provisions of the directive on the grounds of public policy. We would seek to rely on that provision should a national of a member state seek to enter or live in the United Kingdom as a prostitute.

 Information about average waiting times for student applications is not held centrally and could be obtained only by scrutinising individual case files, at disproportionate cost. We aim to decide 70 per cent. of new general and settlement applications within three weeks but at present it is taking up to eight weeks on average to consider new straightforward applications. The reasons for this are (i) the exceptionally high number of new applications received this year, especially in recent months; and (ii) process changes that are being introduced. We are working to reduce this to three weeks or less as soon as possible.

 There are no plans to change the existing procedures requiring overseas nationals to provide their passports when applying for extensions of stay in the United Kingdom. But everything possible will be done to reduce the time scales for dealing with such applications and to improve the arrangements for handling applicants' passports while their applications are pending.

The Scottish and Welsh Forestry Ministers and I have decided that the review will start shortly and report to us in the spring. It will consider the current administrative arrangements for delivering sustainable forestry policies in England, Scotland and Wales and the UK's international forestry commitments, including options for further devolution of these arrangements. The review will be undertaken by officials from the Forestry Commission, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, Scottish Executive, the National Assembly for Wales, the Cabinet Office and the Treasury. The Northern Ireland Department of Agriculture and Rural Development will also be involved in the review. Views will be sought from interested parties during the course of the review.

 <i>[holding answer 18 December 2001]:</i> My right hon. Friend the Minister for the Environment announced to Parliament on 28 July 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 947&#150;48W, that central Government Departments and their agencies were committed to actively seeking to buy timber and timber products from sustainable and legal sources. In January 2001 the Office of Government Commerce wrote to departmental Heads of Procurement to confirm this policy. Departments have been asked to report annually on their timber purchases and the recent Greening Government report for the financial year 2000&#150;01 includes a summary of the responses received. My Department, on behalf of an interdepartmental working group on timber procurement, has commissioned a study on the scale of central Government's timber requirements and the options available for developing the most effective implementation of this policy. An interim report is due to be published at the end of February 2002 with a final report due at the end of May 2002. My Department has consulted the Timber Trade Federation and environmental NGOs in pursuit of the Government's timber procurement policy and has been raising awareness among Departments and the wider public sector. In May 2001 a timber procurement workshop was held at the Greening Public Procurement conference organised by the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions and attended by a cross-section of the public

sector. In October 2001 my Department gave a presentation at the local government's Central Buying Consortium conference and took that opportunity to promote the purchase of sustainable and legally harvested timber. Recently my right hon. Friend the Minister for the Environment has met the Timber Trade Federation to discuss implementation of the Government's timber procurement policy and he addressed a wide cross section of stakeholders and answered questions at the WWF 95+ Group 10th anniversary celebration event. My Department has arranged to meet the Department for Transport, Local Government and Rural Affairs to discuss how local authorities may be encouraged to purchase timber from sustainable and legal sources where they are not doing so already. My Department is working closely with the Department for International Development and other Departments to develop bilateral agreements with producing countries that will help to halt the export of timber that has been felled illegally.

[25187]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20109w24.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Government's Forestry Strategy for England sets out our priorities and programmes for sustainable forestry in England. These priorities include supporting the strategic development of woodland resources. Specific actions include support for regional and local marketing initiatives, and ensuring the supply of timber from our woodland resource is available at levels indicated in long-term forecasts. In addition, through the Forestry Commission and in partnership with woodland owners and wood users we are supporting the Wood for Good campaign, the largest single timber promotion ever mounted in the UK. Other measures include purchasing research on timber use from the Building Research Establishment, the Timber Research and Development Association and other organisations. We are also working to ensure that small sized timber and woodland residues are recognised as a source of renewable energy. These measures will help to promote the viability of the hardwood and softwood industries.

 As Executive Agencies of DEFRA the arrangement between the Department and its three science laboratories&#151;Veterinary Laboratories Agency (VLA), Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (CEFAS) and Central Science Laboratory (CSL)&#151;are governed by their respective Framework Agreements. Executive agencies are subject to quinquennial reviews which evaluate their performance and organisational arrangements. All three agencies are due quinquennial reviews this year. In accordance with best practice active consideration is being given to a joint exercise to ensure realisation of the full potential of these reviews to help improve the way service and functions are delivered. I hope to be able to announce further details soon. In addition the three agencies are the subject of periodic science assessments carried out by teams of independent and respected experts in the relevant fields. A science assessment was conducted on CEFAS in 1999 and similar assessments are currently under way at VLA and CSL.
<P>

<a name="20109w25.html_para0">DEFRA has concordats with the research councils, such as BBSRC, NERC and MRC, aimed at ensuring effective working arrangements. The research councils periodically assess their research institutes for scientific quality, strategic relevance of science and knowledge transfer; BBSRC are currently carrying out such an assessment. In addition to this Horticulture Research International, a DEFRA sponsored NDPB but included in the BBSRC assessment exercise, is to undergo a quinquennial review in 2002 which was announced in December 2001.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, pursuant to the answer to the hon. Member for Tewkesbury of 27 November 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 860W, on livestock compensation, for what reason the Government treats losses incurred on cattle which went beyond 30 months because they could not be moved during the foot and mouth crisis as an indirect loss.  [25150R]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20109w25.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 As that answer explained, the Government pay compensation only on property, including animals, seized or destroyed to prevent the spread of foot and mouth disease. The Government do not compensate for other losses such as those resulting from inability to market agricultural products at an optimum time.

This information is taken from the IT system used by the State Veterinary Service in support of their TB control work and has not been checked against the quality criteria expected of 'national statistics'. Figures may therefore be unreliable (especially before 1996); they show trends rather than absolute numbers of new incidents.<P>

<P>

<P>

<BR>
</FONT>

<P>

<a name="20109w25.html_para1">Precise forecasts of the number of future incidents are not possible because of unknown variables including, in particular, the effect of the suspension of TB testing during 2001 in order to limit the spread of foot and mouth disease. We expect the total of new herd incidents in 2001 to fall within the range 95 to 150 (final figures will not be available until April). In 2002, if the rising trend of the last four years continues in the Gloucester Division, a new herd incident figure of around 400 may be possible, although it is not yet clear how measures taken in respect of foot and mouth disease may affect the incidence of bovine TB.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20109w25.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 It is not possible to predict when full TB testing of cattle will resume. This will depend on when veterinary resource can be released from FMD work.
<P>

<a name="20109w25.html_para2">Prioritisation of testing will vary according to local circumstances but in general tests will be ranked using two major criteria: likelihood of TB infection in a herd; and likely transmission of TB out of a herd. Top priority will be given to tests on herds where raw milk or raw milk products are manufactured and sold for human consumption or direct to consumers. Next in priority will be overdue tests on herds which have some association with an incident of TB. Of these, herds with high levels of movements other than direct to slaughter will be given priority.
<P>

<a name="20109w25.html_para3">The major part of routine TB testing is delivered for the Government by local veterinary practitioners who work for the State Veterinary Service (SVS) as local veterinary inspectors (LVIs). Non-routine TB testing is delivered by both SVS veterinary officers and (LVIs) depending on local circumstances. SVS administrative staff provide office support for the testing programme. The resumption of full TB testing and clearing the overdue test backlog will place significant demands on these resources for quite some time to come.

[24454]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20109w25.html_spnew10"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 Hunting with hounds is not governed by a licensing system. At present a temporary system sets out the requirements against which hunting can be allowed to take place within the requirements of disease control measures. Hunting was one of the activities that was banned in order to stop the spread of foot and mouth disease and assist its eradication. The Government's priority has been to eradicate FMD and then to enable the countryside to return to normal as quickly as it is safe to do so. For each of the activities that were banned or limited the decision on resumption and on any residual limitations on the relevant activity has been based on a Veterinary Risk Assessment. For low risk activities like walking, implementation of such decisions have been relatively straightforward. The same was found to be the case in respect of grouse shooting and falconry. In the case of hunting with hounds, the Veterinary Risk Assessment reflected a much more complex set of circumstances in which different forms of hunting, different conditions in different parts of the country and concentrations of FMD susceptible species such as deer and the presence of Form A and Form D farms all posed different risks and are factors that have to be taken into account.
<P>

<a name="20109w25.html_para5">On 15 November 2001 I published proposals for the way in which hunting might be allowed to resume, along with the Veterinary Risk Assessment on which the proposals were based. Essentially it was proposed that any hunt which wished to resume activity would have to show how they would observe the limitations which would be necessary to minimise the risk of starting another outbreak of FMD. Decisions were delegated to Divisional Veterinary Managers who would be familiar with local circumstances and would need to be satisfied that the hunt could meet the requirements of animal health controls. Hunts which met these requirements can be permitted to hunt within the defined limits.




<P>
<P><I>9 Jan 2002 : Column: 910W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="20109w25.html_para6">On 13 December 2001 I published details of the permit arrangements which included practical amendments responding to representations by both hunting and non- hunting groups. Since then our Divisional Veterinary Managers have sought to apply local knowledge and common sense to approaches from hunts. They have been widely praised for the way they have undertaken this additional task and I would like to place on the record my thanks to the DEFRA staff involved.
<P>

<a name="20109w25.html_para7">It is against this background that the circumstances of the Worcestershire Hunt, the Croome and West Warwickshire Foxhounds and the North Cotswold Hunt have to be understood.
<P>

<a name="20109w25.html_para8">All these hunts have applied for and given a permit to hunt. Limitations on hunting will continue as long as care is needed to achieve the eradication of FMD and the general requirements&#151;which require hunts not to meet or hunt within 8 km of a Form A or a Form D premise&#151;will be reviewed as and when there is any change in the Veterinary Risk Assessment. As indicated earlier, the disease control requirements are being applied with common sense in the light of local circumstances. So in the case of the Worcestershire Hunt several exceptions have been granted to this criterion which is that it may hunt closer to a particular Form A premise as the M5 acts as a natural buffer between the Farm and five of the proposed meets. Two other proposed meets have also been permitted within an 8 km restriction due to the low risk of hunting near to the relevant Form A premise.
<P>

<a name="20109w25.html_para9">Special conditions have also been applied to the Croome and West Warwickshire Hunt forbidding it from hunting on the Ragley Hall Estate. This is in recognition of the estate having a large deer population.
<P>

<a name="20109w25.html_para10">These conditions will continue to apply as long as the threat of FMD remains. The permit section at Worcester Animal Health Office is constantly reviewing the restrictions on individual Form A and Form D premises and as soon as any are lifted, the relevant Hunts are being informed. The temporary permit system for hunting will continue as long as restrictions are necessary to achieve eradication of FMD and will be removed when FMD has been officially eradicated from the whole of Great Britain.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20109w26.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 EU legislation requires testing, including animal testing, of all industrial chemicals produced in high volume (greater than 1,000 tons per manufacturer per year) and below this level, the generation of data on new chemicals according to the amount produced. Other chemicals may be required to be tested if there are justifiable concerns. Chemicals used for particular purposes, for example pesticides and biocides (including garden pesticides and household disinfectants) and pharmaceuticals, are also required to be tested before they are put on the market. We have no information about which chemicals will be coming forward for testing in future years. Animal tests are regulated by the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 which is a Home Office matter. The Government's policy is to reduce the number of animals used in tests and we are currently supporting changes to Pesticides Directive 91/44/EC to prevent the replication of testing on vertebrate animals.

A significant proportion of farm produce in the UK is now produced in accordance with the standards laid down in such schemes. Much of this will be sold to consumers through supermarkets.

<P>
<a name="20109w26.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The fall in world demand for skimmed milk powder has depressed prices. Low demand in the UK coupled with low prices could lead to an increase in public intervention. That is why the Government have supported moves by the Commission to stimulate markets both at home and abroad.
<P>

<a name="20109w26.html_para1">The producer price for milk reflects the position in the market and, therefore, has recently shown a downward trend following a very sharp recovery compared to a year earlier. The action already taken may help arrest this trend but the price will ultimately be determined by supply and demand.

 At Laeken the EU assessed that it was now able to conduct some crisis-management operations. The EU will be in a position to take on more demanding operations as the assets an capabilities at its disposal continue to develop.

 The budget of the General Secretariat of the Council of the European Union contains a provision of &#163;10.7 million to meet expenses related to the European Union Military Staff and infrastructure and meeting costs in support of the European Security and Defence Policy during the current EU financial year. There are no estimates currently available for these costs in future financial years.

 We supported United Nations Security Council Resolution 1359 that extended the mandate of the UN Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO) until 28 February 2002.
<P>

<a name="20109w27.html_para1">Resolution 1359 reiterated full support for the on-going efforts of MINURSO to implement the Settlement Plan and the agreements of the parties to hold a free, fair and impartial referendum for the self determination of the people of the Western Sahara.

 The Government support a closer relationship between the EU and Ukraine and welcome recent progress including Ukraine's attendance at the enlarged European conference meeting in October and the agreement of an EU-Ukraine Action Plan on Justice and Home Affairs. The Government recognise the potential impact on Ukraine of the forthcoming enlargement of the European Union and support the European Commission's efforts to ensure that this is taken into account, eg by supporting joint programmes with EU candidates aimed at improving border management.
<P>

<a name="20109w27.html_para3">The Government consider that EU enlargement presents opportunities for Ukraine, particularly in the fields of trade and investment. The UK has urged Ukraine to continue with its political and economic reforms, so it is able to exploit these opportunities fully.

 At the end of 2001 the EU and the Sudanese Government agreed to continue and intensify the EU-Sudan dialogue, chaired by our ambassador during the latter half of the year, for a further 12 months.

<P>

<a name="20109w27.html_para5">We are pleased with the progress achieved during the course of the dialogue last year. There was some progress on human rights and democratisation. The Council of Ministers is somewhat more broadly based. The Umma Party is back and operating as a political party within Sudan. New newspapers are permitting a freer expression of political debate. There is some moderation of police and security activity, though abuses undoubtedly occur. Work continues to confront the problem of abductions. But in all these areas there is much more to do and we shall continue to address these issues during the course of this year.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs if he will make a statement on the recent decision of the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group to readmit Fiji to the Councils of the Commonwealth and on the implications for UK policy on Fiji.  [26094]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20109w27.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. MacShane: </B> 
 The Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group discussed developments in Fiji at its meeting in London on 20 December. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State represented the United Kingdom. The Group welcomed the holding of broadly free and fair elections in Fiji in August and September 2001. In recognition of this and the fact that the Fiji Government were now addressing the current uncertainty over their own constitutionality in a responsible manner, the Group decided that the conditions were now right to readmit Fiji to the Councils of the Commonwealth. However, in view 



<P>
<P><I>9 Jan 2002 : Column: 919W</I><P>
of the remaining uncertainty over the Government's constitutionality the Group also decided that Fiji should remain on its agenda and that the Secretary General's Special Envoy, Justice Pius Langa of South Africa should remain engaged.
<P>

<a name="20109w27.html_para7">In view of this we decided on 20 December to lift the targeted package of measures that the then Minister of State, my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle) announced on 21 July 2000. We will once again consider applications for funding for small projects from the Fiji Government in the areas of good governance, human rights, conflict prevention and the environment. We have also ended our blanket ban on joint military exercises and visits to Fiji by Royal Navy ships&#151;possible co-operation in this area will be considered on a case-by-case basis. And in keeping with national and EU criteria, we will continue not to issue export licences for military or security equipment where there is a clear risk that it will be used for internal repression. We will not hesitate to re-impose these measures, and even consider extending their scope, in the event that the Government of Fiji fail to meet their constitutional obligations to all of Fiji's citizens.

 Since the withdrawal of United Nations weapons inspectors in December 1998 there have been no independent inspections of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction programmes.

As a result of enlargement, UK business will have access to a single market comprising up to 450 million consumers&#151;bigger than the US and Japan combined. This huge single market should boost trade, jobs and prosperity in all EU member states. Independent research estimates that enlargement will add around &#163;1.75 billion to UK GDP and 1.5 per cent. to the GDP of each candidate country. It is also estimated by the

 Syria allows a number of terrorist organisations to operate from within its borders. These organisations include the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine and the Popular Front for the Liberation&#151;General Command. Hizballah also operates from within Syria. The UK has proscribed an element of Hizballah, its External Security Organisation, as terrorist. Syria is however co-operating with the international fight against terrorism and has taken some steps to rein in these organisations. Iran does not host terrorist organisations in the same way.

<P>
<a name="20109w29.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The Government have followed the progress of the National Reconciliation Forum (NRF) closely. We noted with satisfaction that the main political figures attended the Forum and that several recommendations have been made to the Government of Cote d'Ivoire. We consider that the Forum has achieved

positive results and that it paves the way for further progress towards reconciliation and political stability in Cote d'Ivoire.

<a name="20109w29.html_para0">Nationality is a matter for each State to determine We note that the question of Mr. Ouattara's nationality has been referred to the Ivorian courts. Whatever their ruling, we consider it is important for democracy and stability in Cote d'Ivoire that Mr. Ouattara and the Rassemblement des Republicains should be able to play an active role in Ivorian politics.

<a name="20109w29.html_spnew1"><B> Peter Hain: </B> 
 We have expressed our support for the one-year moratorium on international adoptions from Romania announced on 13 July following a recommendation from the European Parliament. There were allegations that the existing adoption system had become very corrupt, and the Romanians needed time to rewrite the law on adoption and get the necessary framework in place to support it. They are being helped in this by the UK Department for International Development, as well as UNICEF, the EU and USAID.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20109w29.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 In recent weeks the security situation within Liberia has deteriorated. In north-western Liberia fighting has escalated between Guinean backed dissident groups and Liberian forces loyal to President Taylor. There is a risk that this increased instability could destabilise the sub-region, including neighbouring Sierra Leone, and have serious humanitarian consequences. Regional peace is dependent on the restoration of stability in Liberia, and we will continue working towards that goal.
<P>

<a name="20109w29.html_para1">In March 2001 we co-sponsored United Nations Security Council Resolution 1343 imposing sanctions on Liberia. We are encouraged that Liberia has taken some positive steps, including rescinding the expulsion of the Sierra Leonean and Guinean ambassadors, and granting an amnesty to political opponents accused of treason. But as the UN Expert Panel Report on sanction made clear in October 2001, President Taylor has not fundamentally changed his behaviour. In response to this report, the UK is actively pursuing further actions in the Security Council. The EU recently held talks with Liberia to further increase pressure on President Taylor to stop backing rebel groups and start implementing democratic principles, good governance and respect for human rights. Through various diplomatic channels, including the EU presidency representative to the Mano River Union (MRU: Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone), the UN and ECOWAS, we are encouraging the leaders of the MRU countries to establish a meaningful dialogue.

 The Government have repeatedly condemned terrorism, wherever it originates.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20109w29.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 It is not always possible to determine, with certainty, the responsibility for terrorist attacks. Many attacks are unclaimed, and some claims of responsibility are unreliable. What is important is that President Arafat has committed the Palestinian Authority to an effort to prevent violence by all Palestinian groups operating from the occupied territories. We urge the Palestinian Authority to fulfil this commitment, and Israel to help create the conditions for a return to negotiations. Only a just and lasting peace can assure security for Israelis and Palestinians alike.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. Benefits Agency investigations data are now compiled from a new data source. The figures above are provisional and may differ from those previously published.<P>





2. The data on cautions and penalties for 1998&#150;99 is derived from the database proceeding the current database and there maybe some overlap with 1999&#150;2000.<P>

3. Administrative Penalties, as an alternative to prosecution, were introduced by the Social Security Administration (Fraud) Act (1997) with effect from December 1998.<P>

4. Figures are taken from local authority management information returns. It is possible that there could be some double counting with Benefits Agency data if there were cases which involved a joint prosecution.<P>

5. Data are not available for all 409 local authorities. The total for Great Britain includes estimates for local authorities that have not responded. These estimates are based on historical and regional data. This type of estimate is standard practice in reporting totals where there have been non-respondents. The figures have been rounded to two significant figures. <P>

 As explained in my answer on 13 July 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 689&#150;90W, the increase in resources provided in Spending Review 2000 allowed the Department to expand greatly the speed and scope of our modernisation programme. The headquarters of DWP were also re-organised to focus resources more on delivery. As a result the entire programme was replanned and organised on a different basis. In the course of this work a number of existing projects merged,

<P>
<a name="20109w30.html_spnew8"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 Our reforms to bereavement benefits introduced in April 2001 concentrate the help available where and when it is needed most&#151;on immediate needs and on families with children. And for the first time these benefits are available equally to both men and women. Immediate help with costs arising on bereavement is provided by a lump sum bereavement payment of &#163;2000&#151;double the old widow's payment of &#163;1000. There is a weekly benefit for widowed parents who satisfy the qualifying conditions. The bereavement allowance is also available for 12 months, to give widows and widowers aged 45 or over without dependants time to adjust to their new circumstances.
<P>

<a name="20109w30.html_para2">Women under 55 years of age who have been widowed since 9 April 2001 can claim the new bereavement benefits in the same way as anybody else. Where they are already in receipt of incapacity benefit and claim either widowed parent's allowance or bereavement allowance they will receive the higher of the two benefits to which they are entitled.

<a name="20109w32.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 Ward environment budgets were introduced on 1 October 2000. They give the ward sisters and charge nurses that manage a ward a minimum of &#163;5,000 a year to improve patient care and improve the working lives of staff. An independent MORI telephone survey in mid December 2000 showed over 70 per cent. of ward sisters and charge nurses had been able to improve the ward environment in the two months since the budget had been launched. The majority of purchases provided greater comfort for patients as well as visual improvements to the ward environment.

<a name="20109w32.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 There are currently no plans to establish a National Service Framework for lung disease. The NSF for Older People recognises the importance of respiratory diseases to the health and well being of older people. The NSF provides for a 10-year developing framework for action across health and social care, and within this arthritis and respiratory disease in older people are the next priorities for future work. The focus of this will be older people, but the service model will have implications for and apply to all who need these services, regardless of their age.

<a name="20109w32.html_para5">There are a range of Government initiatives already in place which take a preventive approach to lung disease and have long-term objectives to improve treatment and care. These include the investment of &#163;53 million in smoking cessation services. Smoking is the major cause of lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In addition the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) has been asked to prepare clinical guidelines for the NHS for the diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer and the management and treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

 The only borrowers who were in arrears at the end of 2000&#150;01 were those who had taken out mortgage-style loans which were in place before the introduction of income contingent loans in 1998. At the end of financial year 2000&#150;01 some 13 per cent. of borrowers with student loan accounts in repayment status were in arrears with their repayments. Repayment from borrowers with income contingent loans are collected through the tax system. As these repayments are mostly collected by employers who are legally obliged so to do, the borrower cannot go into arrears.

It is for local education authorities to plan and keep under review the supply of school places and to ensure there is sufficient provision to meet demand. They must publish annually a School Organisation Plan setting out how they plan to deal with any surplus or deficit of places over a five-year rolling period.

 Figures for the number of school pupils who go on to higher education are not collated centrally on a constituency basis. The latest available figures for England, showing the number of UK domiciled entrants to undergraduate courses over the past five years, are given in the table. The increase in entrants in 1997&#150;98 related partly to changes in the funding arrangements for higher education, with students choosing to enter HE rather than wait until 1998&#150;99. There was a corresponding reduction in 1998&#150;99 before entrant numbers started to increase again in 1999&#150;2000.

 I am now able to confirm that initial payments to the majority of providers who submitted claims up to 21 November was made on 20 December.

on validating the claims made after 21 November and on the mechanism for dealing with learning booked on the ILA system up to 23 November. Once we are satisfied that eligible learning has taken place in accordance with the rules of the programme, we will then be able to make arrangements for future payment to providers.

 The Government are currently working up proposals, in partnership with local government and other education interests, for the introduction of a new funding system in 2003&#150;04. We are taking a fresh and objective look at what provision is needed, and at the additional costs some authorities undoubtedly face. We want a system that is both fair and clear.
<P>

<a name="20109w34.html_para2">The new system will consist of a basic entitlement per primary or secondary school pupil, with enhancements only for authorities where significant deprivation adds to costs, or schools need to pay more to recruit and retain staff.

<a name="20109w34.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 In 2002&#150;03 there is over &#163;1.3 billion extra in Education Standard Spending Assessments (SSAs); a further increase in Standards Fund grant of almost &#163;160 million; and an increase in the direct grant for schools of 2.75 per cent. The scale of these increases means there is less need for special grant support from Government and we have no plans to pay such a grant to Herefordshire for 2002&#150;03.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills (1) what plans she has to extend the education maintenance allowance to the whole of England;  [25525]
<P>
<UL>(2) what assessment she has made of the working of the education maintenance allowance in <i>(a)</i> Stoke-on- Trent, North and <i>(b)</i> the UK.  [25528]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20109w34.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 Decisions on the future of the education maintenance allowance (EMA) will be taken in the light of findings from the current evaluation of the pilot scheme. Stoke-on-Trent is one of the areas where EMA is being evaluated, although our researchers are publishing their reports for the pilot scheme as a whole, rather than for individual areas.
<P>

<a name="20109w34.html_para5">As to the UK position, the Scottish Executive are piloting a variant of the EMA scheme in four local authority areas. The Scottish scheme is currently in its third year and will be evaluated in 2002. There is no EMA scheme running in Wales or Northern Ireland.

 The latest "Performance Indicators in Higher Education" published by the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) last month show that the proportion of entrants to full-time first degree courses in 1998&#150;99 who did not continue beyond the first year was 10 per cent., the same proportion as in the two previous academic years. HEFCE's figures indicate that around one fifth of these students will re-enter HE after a year out. Although the UK has the second highest completion rate among OECD countries, the Government are not complacent. HEFCE have been asked to report on the measures being taken to bear down on the drop-out rate. HEFCE have produced an interim report and are expected to produce their complete report shortly.
