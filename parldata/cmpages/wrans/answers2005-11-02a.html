<p><a name="st_16"><a name="51102w02.html_spnew0"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 The spokesman of the UN, Secretary General Kofi Annan gave a briefing in New York on Monday 31 October, expressing the deep concern about the humanitarian situation in Zimbabwe. The UN continues to receive reports that tens of thousands of people are still homeless and in need of assistance, months after the eviction campaign, called &#039;Operation Drive Out Rubbish&#039; began in May 2005. DFID has already provided &#163;1 million to UN agencies to provide emergency food, blankets, medical assistance and other 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>2 Nov 2005 : Column 1039W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
non-food items to the victims. The Government of Zimbabwe have now formally rejected offers of UN assistance to provide temporary shelter for these victims, stating publicly that there is no humanitarian crisis. The Secretary-General made a strong public appeal to the Government of Zimbabwe to ensure that those who are out in the open, without shelter and without means of sustaining their livelihoods, are provided with humanitarian assistance in collaboration with the United Nations and the humanitarian community.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51102w02.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_10">In terms of the broader humanitarian situation, despite compelling evidence of a very low grain harvest earlier this year, the Government of Zimbabwe similarly denies that the country needs international assistance to address food insecurity. Independent surveys indicate that between three and five million people will face food shortages in the coming months. The UN, through the World Food Programme, has secured agreement from the Government of Zimbabwe to distribute 300,000 tonnes of food to the most poor and vulnerable households. DFID has already pledged &#163;10 million for this programme.
