<P>
<a name="10509w01.html_spnew0"><B> Dr. Reid: </B> 
 The two arms inspectors, Martti Ahtisaari and Cyril Ramaphosa, have issued two separate reports on their inspections of IRA arms dumps. On both occasions they reported the dumps held a substantial amount of military material, including explosives and weapons. They remain confident that these weapons and explosives cannot be used without their being aware of it.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what assessment he has made of the threat posed by dissident paramilitary organisations to security in <i>(a)</i> Northern Ireland and <i>(b)</i> Great Britain.  [159621]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10509w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 While we believe the main paramilitary groups are maintaining their cease fires there remains a threat from dissidents as evidenced by the recent disruption to the Northern Ireland railway network and the bomb attack on the BBC in London. The security forces are conscious of the threat posed by dissident republicans, and continue to take steps to thwart their attacks.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland if he will make a statement on the security situation in Northern Ireland.  [159626]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10509w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The Government believe on balance that the main cease fires are holding. There remains however, a threat from republican dissidents who are opposed to the Good Friday Agreement as evidenced by recent attacks on the railway network in Northern Ireland and the discovery of a Mark 15 barrack buster bomb near Omagh. The security forces are conscious of the threat posed by these groups, and continue to take steps to thwart their attacks.

15. <a name="10509w01.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Brazier: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland if he will make a statement on the requirement for police service and Army force levels in the present security situation.  [159630]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10509w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Operational security measures are a matter for the Chief Constable and he keeps security at a level appropriate to his assessment of the prevailing threat. As the level of threat changes, this will be reflected in changes to the security force profile.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10509w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The Chief Constable recently announced a number of further normalisation measures including the demolition of the six Fermanagh patrol bases, the closure and demolition of Long Kesh army base and the closure of Strand Road Holding Centre. In the longer term, the number of army bases will reduce to no more than 20. Currently the police routinely patrol without military assistance in 28 of the 29 District Command Units. However, on a number of occasions military support has been utilised for specific purposes. Further measures will very much depend on the removal of the threat from dissident republicans and continued progress towards a normal civil society.

9. <a name="10509w01.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Browne: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland if he will make a statement about progress in implementing the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 2000.  [159623]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10509w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 A number of the provisions in the Police Act have been commenced, some as recently as 30 March. Implementation is being taken forward where possible, including the provisions enabling 50:50 recruitment and those relating to the Oversight Commissioner.
<P>

<a name="10509w01.html_para0">Commencement of a number of the sections and schedules in the Act, however, is dependent on the creation of the Policing Board. The Government want to see a Board established as soon as possible so that the comprehensive programme of change envisaged by the Independent Commission on Policing for Northern Ireland can be fully progressed.

 Northern Ireland now has the fastest growing economy in the United Kingdom and this economic success is directly related to the Belfast Agreement.

 I would like to see decommissioning begin as soon as possible and I was encouraged by the report issued by the Decommissioning Commission in March in which it announced its re-engagement with the IRA. Like the Commission, I hope that it will be possible to make substantial progress by the June target date.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10509w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 The Disability Rights Commission's remit does not extend to Northern Ireland and anti-discrimination legislation there is the responsibility of the Northern Ireland Assembly. The Equality Commission for Northern Ireland deals with disability and other equality issues in Northern Ireland. The Secretary of State met with members of the Equality Commission on 24 April to discuss their work on the statutory equality duty set out in section 75 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998.

 All officers in the Royal Ulster Constabulary are drugs aware and capable of combating drugs trafficking. However, there are dedicated units in the Drugs Squad and in District Command Units, previously in Sub-Divisions.
<P>

<a name="10509w02.html_para1">While figures are not readily available for the number of officers assigned to duties outside the Drugs Squad, over the last three years it has had an approved complement of 44.

 <i>[holding answer 1 May 2001]:</i> The available information comes from the National Asylum Support Service (NASS), which began supporting destitute asylum seekers entering the United Kingdom on or after 3 April 2000. NASS records information on the location of NASS supported asylum seekers by region and cluster area but not by county. Statistics from NASS, for the end of February 2001, show that for asylum seekers located in the east of England (which includes Essex) 40 asylum seekers (including dependants) had been allocated accommodation and 810 asylum seekers (including dependants) had been allocated voucher only support.

 No ministerial discussions have taken place about the 14 day period laid down in the Asylum Support Regulations 2000 during which asylum seekers remain eligible for National Asylum Support Service (NASS) support.

announced on 28 March 2000, which meant health authorities received average increases of 8.9 per cent. for the financial year 2000-01 (the minimum increase was 8.2 per cent). Separate arrangements apply for Scotland and Wales which each receive a consequential share of funding.
<P>

<a name="10509w02.html_para5">On 30 June 2000 my right hon.

In 2000-01 a total of &#163;1.3 million was allocated to schools who have received children of asylum seekers.

<a name="10509w02.html_para6">The grant in England is distributed to local authorities through standard spending assessments which take account of factors such as the size of the population and the number of children needing school places.

<sup>(1)</sup> South Manchester and Rochdale Divisions are considering increasing their numbers of Community Police Officers by two and one respectively <P>

<P>





<P>

There is no single definition for community policing and many officers carry out some sort of community policing function. The term can cover the assignment of named officers to patrol neighbourhoods, community beat officers and community liaison officers. They are at the forefront of delivering many of our crime reduction policies on the ground, campaigning to reduce burglary and vehicle crime, and gathering intelligence at street level. All these provide visible reassurance and improve the quality of life in the area, not least through reducing the fear of crime among the most vulnerable members of society.<P>

<a name="10509w02.html_para7">All Chief Constables have agreed that from this year they will report to their constituencies the measures they are taking to increase visibility and accessibility in every ward and parish in their police authority area.
<P>

<a name="10509w02.html_para8">The precise deployment and number of officers for community policing is a matter for the chief officers to decide in accordance with the nature of the areas policed.
<P>

<a name="10509w02.html_para9">I understand from the Chief Constable of Greater Manchester police that Community Police Officers form a key part of the force's operational policing strategy. They are specifically expected to build effective working relationships with key community members through group meetings such as Police Community Consultative Groups and to provide reassurance through high profile foot patrol. Community based police officers should not under ordinary circumstances be diverted away from their normal duties.

<a name="10509w03.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Paice: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if it is his policy that the Horserace Betting Levy Board will not be abolished until alternative funding arrangements are agreed by both the racing industry and the betting industry.  [160673]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10509w03.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 Our stated intention is to abolish the statutory levy on horserace betting, on the basis that commercial agreements between horseracing and other industries, including bookmaking, are capable of producing sufficient income for racing to flourish as a national sport without the need for such a levy. We would expect to see discussions on future funding arrangements make progress, but introduction of the necessary legislation is not conditional on the conclusion of commercial agreements.
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what representations he has received regarding threats to deprive horserace tracks of payments made from Horserace Betting Levy Board money if such tracks sign media rights agreements not agreed by the British Horseracing Board.  [160675]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10509w03.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 I am told we have received no representations on this matter.

<P>
<a name="10509w03.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Colman: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department <i>(a)</i> when Tibetans were first classed as Chinese nationals for asylum purposes in the UK, <i>(b)</i> by which Government Department the decision was taken and <i>(c)</i> if Tibetans are classified as Chinese nationals by other EU member states; and if he will make a statement.  [160504]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10509w03.html_spnew3"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 The 1951 Refugee Convention requires that, unless stateless, a person's claim to refugee status be assessed in relation to the country of which they are a national. The United Kingdom does not recognise China's claims of sovereignty over Tibet, but recognises that Tibet is not independent, and Tibetans hold Chinese nationality. This has been the position argued by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office since the 1951 annexation of Tibet by China. Further, an individual may claim asylum on the basis of persecution by the Chinese authorities because of their Tibetan ethnicity, but at the time and place of their claimed persecution they are held to be Chinese nationals.
<P>

<a name="10509w03.html_para0">Therefore, the classification of Tibetan in the context of nationality is independent of the consideration of individual asylum claims. This has been the approach adopted in all available United Kingdom asylum statistics. No other European member state classes Tibetans as a separate nationality for asylum purposes.

<P>
<a name="10509w05.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Wicks </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 8 May 2001]:</i> Latest figures are that over one million people have opened individual learning accounts (ILAs) in the UK. This is a remarkable achievement and means that our manifesto commitment to open one million accounts across the UK by March 2002 has been met almost 12 months early. The one million figure includes over 200,000 opened during the pilot phase which preceded the introduction of the national framework to administer ILAs.
<P>

<a name="10509w05.html_para1">Since the launch of the national framework to administer ILAs in June 2000, almost one million people have inquired about ILA membership in England, 785,379 people have opened an account and 346,559 (44 per cent.) have already made use of their ILA to support a course of learning.
<P>

<a name="10509w05.html_para2">Of the 785,379 who have opened an account, 459,782 are women and 322,674 are men. Of the 346,559 who have already made use of their account, 203,124 are women and 142,177 are men.
<P>

<a name="10509w05.html_para3">Over half of the learning is IT related with Computer Literacy and Information Technology (CLAIT) and European Computer Driving Licence being the most popular courses. A wide variety of non-IT, non-recreational learning makes up the balance. A breakdown of the accounts opened and accounts used by occupation is given in the following table:

 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Social Security and I are establishing, later this year, Jobcentre Plus, an Agency for people of working age. This will bring together labour market and benefit services for people of working age and enable us to provide a more integrated approach for our customers.
<P>

<a name="10509w05.html_para4">As we announced on 14 March this year, as a first stage in the launch of Jobcentre Plus, we will be introducing around 50 Pathfinder offices. Additionally, we will be introducing work-focused interviews for everyone of working age making a claim to benefit in around a further 40 offices to the same time scale. A provisional list of the locations in which these offices are based is set out in the table. People of working age making a claim for benefit in these offices will be required to participate in a work-focused interview as an integral part of the benefit claims process and will be offered specialist support to help them into work. My right hon. Friend will shortly be laying regulations under the Welfare Reform and Pensions Act 1999 for this purpose.

 There are no Sure Start programmes operating in the Shrewsbury and Atcham constituency.

<a name="10509w05.html_para6">Our aim is to establish 500 programmes in areas of disadvantage by 2003-04. To date, 260 programmes have been announced. Further programmes will be announced later this year.
<P>

<a name="10509w05.html_para7">Districts are invited to submit plans for a Sure Start programme because collectively they have high levels of need and disadvantage, according to the DETR Index of Multiple Deprivation, and give a good spread between different types of area around the country.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment how much the Government spent on education in the Reading, West constituency in each of the financial years from 1995-96 to 2000-01, indicating the specific areas on which the funding has been spent.  [159614]<P>

 Most funding provided by the Department is distributed via local education authorities. Total Devolved Formula Capital allocations for schools in the Reading, West constituency amounted to &#163;708,500 in 2000-01. Allocations between the years 1997-98 and 2000-01 under the New Deal for Schools scheme are set out in the table. The Department does not hold information on other support provided to Reading, West constituency schools since 1995-96. The Secretary of State wrote to my hon. Friend on 16 February setting out the total funding for his local education authorities (Reading and West Berkshire) for the years 1998-99 to 2001-02. Due to local government reorganisation, figures are not available for earlier years.

This received extensive local and Welsh media coverage. DETR officials and experts were then available to discuss any environmental concerns arising from the proposed evaluation in Mathry.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what environmental impact assessments have been carried out on the proposed genetically modified farm scale trial sites at Mathry, Pembrokeshire, before the decision to grant a licence was made.  [157568]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10509w06.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 9 April 2001]:</i> The genetically modified (GM) maize to be grown in the Farm Scale Evaluations at Mathry has been subject to detailed risk assessments as part of the requirement for its authorisation under EU Directive 90-220, which controls releases of GM organisms. These risk assessments showed that it could safely be cultivated anywhere within the EU. Accordingly it was granted consent for commercial cultivation in 1998. This consent applies throughout the European Union. Directive 90-220 requires that the use of GM crops with commercial approval may not be prohibited or impeded except on sound scientific grounds, in particular, risks to human health or the environment. Any such action would need to be agreed by other Member States. This is in keeping with such crops having passed a robust risk assessment at EU level and being assessed as safe for use. No additional environmental impact assessment is therefore required under EU legislation. Equally there is nothing to prevent such an assessment being carried out, though none in practice has.

<a name="10509w07.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Robert Ainsworth: </B> 
 The Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, which implements Council Directive (79/409/EEC) in Great Britain, protects all wild birds. Captive-bred birds are not covered by the provisions of the Directive, although they are covered by certain provisions of the 1981 Act. It is an offence under section 1 of the Act to possess any live or dead wild bird, or derivative of such a bird. Section 1 also includes a defence if the possessor of such a bird can show that it had either been legally taken from the wild or that it was captive bred. Ultimately, only the courts can definitively interpret the legislation and decide whether this defence is met in any individual case.

 My Department is currently conducting a public consultation on a proposal to revise Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions Circular 2/92 on the safeguarding of aerodromes, technical sites and military explosives storage areas. The existing circular is concerned mainly with the role of local planning authorities in official safeguarding, but it also recommends a form of unofficial safeguarding to operators of other aerodromes and of gliding sites. No change of policy is proposed on the unofficial safeguarding of these other aerodromes or of gliding sites. But we envisage that instead of this brief reference in a departmental circular there will be a specific safeguarding publication to be issued by the Civil Aviation Authority. This will be addressed in particular to aerodromes licensed by the authority, but the advice will also be relevant to the operators of unlicensed aerodromes and of gliding sites. We will consider, in our further work on the revision of the circular, whether we should complement the Authority's advice with a recommendation to local planning authorities.

At that time we would expect to consult on a framework for regulations under section 94 of the Act relating to the establishment of local access forums with a view to laying regulations in the autumn. Before the end of the year we propose to consult on regulations relating to the issue of provisional maps of open country and appeals against them with a view to laying regulations early in 2002. We shall also be consulting on regulations relating to exclusions and restrictions under Chapter II of the Act and dedication of land for access under section 16. We would hope to lay such regulations in the first half of 2002. Consultations on the remaining regulations under Part I will follow.

However the provisions of Part II are complex and there is much work to be done in producing the required regulations. We shall wish to consult before making many of the regulations, which adds to difficulty in providing specific timings. We are committed to improving the rights of way network as soon as possible and are focusing on a number of key issues to achieve this. Guidance on rights of way improvement plans and further provisions to aid the speedy removal of obstructions will be dealt with as a priority and we would hope to have these in force before the end of this year. Other aspects of Part II will be dealt with as quickly as possible over the next two years.

 <i>[holding answer 8 May 2001]:</i> This information is not available for Greater Manchester. For the United Kingdom, the average time for a decision to be made depends on which grant programme an applicant applies to. For the Awards for All programme, for grants up to &#163;5,000, it takes an average of two months and a maximum of three months. For the main grants programme, the average is approximately three months for a decision with a maximum of five months. The longer time scale is needed for more complex projects.

<P>

<a name="10509w09.html_para3">The Government wish all viewers to enjoy the benefits of digital broadcasting. When purchasing a new television set, it is important that consumers are aware that any set which does not include a digital decoder will not be able to receive television broadcasts without the use of a separate digital decoder once analogue transmissions cease. We have set out the criteria to be achieved before analogue terrestrial transmissions are switched off, and also have said that we expect that the criteria will be met in the period 2006-10. Both satellite and cable broadcasters are expected to cease analogue transmissions by that time. Given that most sets purchased now will still be in use at that time, we are encouraging television set manufacturers to produce generally affordable integrated digital televisions. We would like to see sales of analogue-only sets diminish rapidly in favour of televisions including a digital decoder for at least one of the three main platforms (terrestrial, satellite and cable). The UK cannot prohibit the sale of analogue-only sets that meet EU standards, but we will work with the Commission and with business on ways to encourage or require that all new televisions include a digital decoder as soon as practicable.

 We have carefully considered the impact of the Everything but Arms initiative on all stakeholders. This includes Caribbean countries that are concerned about the possible impact that it might have on their preferential access to EU markets, particularly for sugar, rice and bananas. A summary of our analysis will be placed in the Libraries of both Houses. The analysis shows that none of the Caribbean's sugar industries is expected to suffer a significant deterioration in its financial performance due to EBA. For bananas, the impact will be negligible and for rice, the transition arrangements under EBA will mean that changes in market forces will be phased in gradually and the overall impact will not be very great.

 We place a high priority on improving access to potable water supplies and sanitation facilities for the world's poorest people. Sub-Saharan Africa currently has the lowest coverage, with almost half of the population not having access to safe drinking water or sanitation facilities. My Department works with Government and non-government agencies to improve the management of existing water supply schemes and to construct new, affordable schemes. This support includes water storage and distribution networks where locally appropriate. We currently have major water projects in Ghana, Nigeria, Mozambique and South Africa.
<P>

<a name="10509w09.html_para6">Our policy on improving water (and sanitation) services is set out in the recently published strategy paper "Addressing the Water Crisis". I will send the hon. Member a copy and place a copy in the House Library. This details how we will work towards the target for water supply agreed at the UN Millennium Summit last September--to halve by 2015 the proportion of people unable to reach, or afford, safe drinking water.

 <i>[holding answer 29 January 2001]:</i> Central records maintained by my Department do not identify illness where it has not resulted in medical downgrading for a significant period.

Neither the Royal Navy nor the RAF maintain additional collated records, and further information on their personnel could be obtained only by checking medical records individually. A collated Army record is, however, maintained. This shows two Army aircrew who have suffered deep vein thrombosis within the last five years, one of whom also suffered a pulmonary embolism. Neither had been engaged in military flying duties within the previous 14 days, but both had been passengers on a commercial aircraft within that period.

1. The prescription information is from the Prescription Cost Analysis (PCA) system and is based on a full analysis of all prescriptions dispensed in the community, i.e. by community 



pharmacists and appliance contractors, dispensing doctors and prescriptions submitted by prescribing doctors for items personally administered in England. Also included are prescriptions written in Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man but dispensed in England. The data do not cover drugs dispensed in hospital or private prescriptions.<P>

2. The net ingredient cost is the basic cost of a drug. This cost does not take account of discounts, dispensing costs, fees or prescription charges income. <P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what action he is taking to prevent <i>(a)</i> eczema, <i>(b)</i> hay fever and <i>(c)</i> asthma.  [160132]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10509w12.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 We recognise that asthma is the commonest chronic illness in England and policy emphasises that preventive action is of great importance. Hay fever and other allergic diseases, while not having the same symptoms as asthma, must also be avoided where possible and Government-funded research is ongoing into the benefits of allergen avoidance and immunotherapy for such conditions.
<P>

<a name="10509w12.html_para9">We fund research through the Medical Research Council. The MRC's work includes basic research into the causes of asthma and allergies, with particular effort at present on analysing the genetic factors that predispose some individuals and families to asthma and eczema. The MRC is also conducting controlled trials of methods for managing and preventing asthma. The total MRC spend on allergy and asthma in 1999-2000 was &#163;4 million.
<P>

<a name="10509w12.html_para10">Included in this total are three projects looking at the causes of hay fever (among other allergies) and exploring possible ways of curing the condition; the spend on these was &#163;200,000 in 1999-2000.

<a name="10509w12.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The Department does not centrally collect final total information on the cost of eczema to the national health service. However, information is available 



<P>
<P><I>9 May 2001 : Column: 203W</I><P>
on both the costs of NHS prescription items for drugs used in treating eczema and also costs relating to hospital based admissions for the condition.
<P>

<a name="10509w12.html_para11">The costs of NHS prescription items for drugs used in the treatment of asthma and dispensed in the community in England from 1995 to 2000 (January to September) are as follows: for 1995 the net ingredient cost was approximately &#163;6.7 million; in 1996 &#163;6.8 million; 1997 &#163;6.6 million; 1998 &#163;6.4 million; 1999 &#163;6.3 million; and for the January to September 2000 period the net ingredient cost was approximately &#163;4.5 million. Information on prescriptions dispensed in NHS hospitals is not available.
<P>

<a name="10509w12.html_para12">In respect of hospital-based admissions for eczema, aggregate (total cost) figures have been produced using average cost figures. For 1997-98 the total cost was approximately &#163;10.2 million, for 1998-99 the total cost was approximately &#163;29.4 million, and for 1999-2000 the total cost was approximately &#163;30.1 million.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10509w12.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 It is not possible to state the number of people who have been diagnosed as suffering from allergies which include eczema and hay fever. This is due to the fact that many people diagnose themselves, and buy remedies at their local pharmacy, or are diagnosed by their general practitioners or appropriate clinic such as chest clinics or dermatology units. It is however estimated that at least 15 per cent. of the population is affected by allergy.
<P>

<a name="10509w12.html_para13">However, there were 8,000 admissions to national health service hospitals for 1999-2000 where the primary diagnosis could be described as asthma and 200 cases where the primary diagnosis could be described as hay fever (allergic rhinitus due to pollen).

 Shropshire has 12 day centres for people with learning disabilities. These provide a range of opportunities including employment, leisure, therapeutic help and access to education. Some of the centres provide extra support or activities for people who have severe disabilities.
<P>

<a name="10509w13.html_para0">Most of these centres are small, but the two centres based in Shrewsbury are large centres each catering for between 70 to 90 people. As part of a three-year county-wide improvement plan, social services have increased the learning disability budget by 18 per cent. to modernise the service and to provide users in Shrewsbury with small local provision, which will be consistent with the type of provision available in the rest of the county.
<P>

<a name="10509w13.html_para1">A Joint Investment Plan for Learning Disability in Shropshire has been submitted for formal evaluation to the Department. This, together with the action plan drawn up in response to the recent Joint Review report, gives details of an overall strategy to improve and integrate health and social services provision and make it more responsive to service users needs.

 It is not possible to identify the percentage of spending on mental health services allocated to the treatment of eating disorders in the last financial year because costs are not broken down by condition. However, we have drawn attention to the importance for people with eating disorders of being able to access effective treatment in the mental health National Service Framework. In addition, we have commissioned the National Institute for Clinical Excellence to develop a guideline on the treatment of eating disorders.

taxpayers; to encourage the development of a viable and sustainable farming industry which is capable of competing without ongoing production support; and to conserve and enhance the rural environment and promote the rural economy through targeted measures.
<P>

<a name="10509w15.html_para6">In the current negotiations on services, the UK seeks further progressive liberalisation in line with the objectives of the General Agreement on Trade in Services. The UK, as the world's second largest exporter of services, has a major export interest in opening services markets around the world. We also support services liberalisation for the benefits it can bring to developing countries. These are reflected in the negotiating guidelines recently agreed by WTO Members which also recognise the right of WTO Members to regulate for national policy objectives. As the Government have made clear before, we will not be making any commitments that would call into question the public provision of health and education services in the UK.

<a name="10509w15.html_para7">The UK and EU remain committed to the launch of a new round of trade negotiations with a broad, inclusive agenda.

 It has always been the Government's policy to implement the EC Injunctions Directive (98/27/EC) in such a way as to preserve the self- regulatory system in advertising successfully established through the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA). My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry wrote to Lord Borrie, Chairman of the ASA, on

5 April to reassure him that, while remaining consistent with the requirements of the directive, the Stop Now Orders (EC Directive) Regulations 2001 contain a number of controls to achieve this.
<P>

<a name="10509w15.html_para8">First, one of the criteria which must be met by private consumer organisations seeking to be named is a readiness and willingness to co-operate with other authorities, bodies and persons having responsibility for regulation of matters covered by the regulations, including advertising. This includes the ASA. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry would be obliged to refuse to name a private body seeking a designation to include advertising if it did not show that it was willing to co-operate with the ASA. If, having been designated, a named private qualified entity failed to co-operate with the ASA and so ceased to meet the criteria then my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry would be required to strike it off the list of designated bodies.
<P>

<a name="10509w15.html_para9">In addition, both public and private qualified entities must first consult the Director General of Fair Trading before bringing any proceedings. If more than one of the Director General and any public or private UK qualified entity are contemplating bringing proceedings the Director General may, in any particular case, direct which of these entities is to bring such proceedings, or that only he may do so. Where the Director General directs that only he may bring such proceedings the regulations expressly provide that he may take into account in reaching that decision whether the infringement could be stopped by other means (for example, by the ASA) in deciding whether or not to bring court proceedings. I am confident from discussions with the OFT that the Director General will use this provision to stop both public and private UK bodies from bypassing the ASA's system of self-regulation.
<P>

<a name="10509w15.html_para10">With these safeguards in place, and with formal memoranda of understanding between the Director General and enforcement bodies, including the ASA, I am confident that the ASA's self-regulatory regime will be preserved and strengthened.

 World Trade Organisation rules do not permit us to use animal welfare considerations as a criterion for the import of meat and poultry.

 The Pan Asian type O virus strain of foot and mouth disease is endemic in most of Asia and the middle east.

There have been outbreaks due to other type O virus strains in South Africa and South America, in particular Brazil and Uruguay.

Imports of meat are allowed from Brazil but only from regions that are free of FMD. Veterinary certification attesting to that must accompany each consignment. Following notification from the European Commission of outbreaks of foot and mouth disease in South Africa and Uruguay, the Government took action to prohibit imports.

This includes guidance on the construction and siting of pyres which takes account of the possible risks to health from the emissions of air pollutants from the pyres. The Department of Health has also published a risk assessment "Foot and Mouth--Effects on health of Emissions from Pyres Used for Disposal of Animals" (available on www.doh.gov.uk).

Detailed advice on the materials to be used for the construction of pyres is set out in the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food "Air Code".

 Horses are not susceptible to foot and mouth disease.

<P>

<a name="10509w19.html_para5">Six pyres, located in Devon, Exeter and Worcestershire, were monitored. Additional pyres are currently being investigated in Cumbria and Devon.

<P>

<a name="10509w19.html_para6">The Institute of Animal Health has informed the Ministry that the virus is inactivated at temperatures above 50 degrees centigrade. There may be a small thermo-resistant element of the virus which is also destroyed at 70 degrees, but expert opinion is that this is likely to be insignificant in the possible spread of infection from pyres.

<a name="10509w19.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Webb: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what plans he has to compensate farmers who are affected by culling on farms contiguous to those with confirmed outbreaks of foot and mouth disease for the value of unused feed and other items on the farm which are rendered valueless by the cull.  [156771]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10509w19.html_spnew9"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 Feedingstuffs on infected premises and on premises contiguous to infected premises will be destroyed if they are considered to be contaminated and cannot be disinfected. Compensation is payable for the market value of animals slaughtered and, in line with the Animal Health Act 1981, for any feedingstuffs or any other materials destroyed or seized as being contaminated. Farmers will not receive compensation for items which will go unused as a result of foot and mouth disease which are not seized by the Ministry.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10509w19.html_wqn10"><B> Mr. Harvey: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food how the compensation for milk wasted as a result of foot and mouth disease is calculated; what representations he has received regarding compensation levels for milk; what considerations informed the decision to set the level of compensation at a rate below market price; what plans he has to revise the structure of compensation; and if he will make a statement.  [156698]<P>

<P>
<a name="10509w19.html_spnew10"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 3 April 2001]:</i> The Animal Health Act 1981 grants the Ministry powers to seize and dispose of anything necessary for preventing the spread of foot and mouth disease. Milk from infected premises and premises considered to be at risk of or exposed to infection is therefore seized, disinfected and disposed of.
<P>

milk is therefore paid at the price the owner of the dairy currently receives for supplies to milk buying companies. Farmers will not receive compensation for items which will go unused as a result of foot and mouth disease which are not seized by the Ministry.
<P>

<a name="10509w19.html_para8">The Ministry has not received any representations regarding compensation levels for milk and there are no plans to revise the compensation structure.

<a name="10509w19.html_wqn11"><B> Mr. Paice: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what contingency plans were drawn up by his Department prior to the current outbreak for the handling of an outbreak of foot and mouth disease; and at what point in the outbreak it was proposed that the Army should become involved.  [156876]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10509w19.html_spnew11"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 4 April 2001]:</i> The Ministry has contingency plans to deal with notifiable exotic animal diseases, including foot and mouth disease. These are regularly updated and tested by the State Veterinary Service.
<P>

<a name="10509w19.html_para9">At each stage of the current outbreak we have called on the appropriate resources. As the disease grew, so did our response. We were in touch with the Ministry of Defence on 20 February, to alert them that there had been an outbreak of foot and mouth disease in Essex, and that military assistance might be required. This led to the first active deployment of troops on the ground on 16 March following a formal request by MAFF for such MOD assistance on 14 March.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10509w19.html_wqn12"><B> Miss McIntosh: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what representations he has received calling for higher compensation under foot and mouth welfare measures for organically reared pigs than that already available for non-organically reared pigs.  [157338]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10509w19.html_spnew12"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 The Ministry has received a number of representations from keepers of pedigree animals and producers of organically reared animals, regarding payments under the Livestock Welfare Disposal Scheme.
<P>

<a name="10509w19.html_para10">The scheme is designed to provide payments to farmers to recognise the welfare needs of animals that may arise because of foot and mouth disease related restrictions. It is not a compensation scheme. The scheme helps farmers who have no means of moving livestock by disposing of animals which cannot be kept in good welfare conditions and by providing money to help them keep any remaining animals in good condition.
<P>

<a name="10509w19.html_para11">There are no plans to increase payments for pedigree or organically reared animals.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food how many animals were <i>(a)</i> awaiting slaughter and <i>(b)</i> slaughtered on each day of the foot and mouth outbreak.  [157160]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10509w19.html_spnew13"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 MAFF publishes slaughter and awaiting slaughter figures each day. These reflect the data then available. As further data become available these figures may alter. The figures in the table reflect the position as of 1 May 2001.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what evidence he has collated in the last two months of wildlife contracting foot and mouth disease; and how many cases there have been of wildlife being diagnosed as suffering from foot and mouth disease.  [157039]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10509w19.html_spnew14"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 5 April 2001]:</i> There have been no laboratory confirmed cases of foot and mouth disease in wildlife species in the UK during the current outbreak (as of 4 May 2001).
<P>
<P>
<a name="10509w19.html_wqn15"><B> Mr. Jenkin: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food when the last foot and mouth infected animals were burned at Layer-de-la-Haye, Essex; when disinfection of the infected farms will be completed; and when movement restrictions on surrounding farms will be lifted.  [157246]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10509w19.html_spnew15"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 6 April 2001]:</i> The infected animals at the two separate sites at Layer-de-la-Haye were burned on 11 March and 23 March respectively, in both cases the day after slaughter. The State Veterinary Service completed all of the cleansing and disinfection work on the two farms by 24 April 2001. However subsequent blood sampling in the 3 km area resulted in the discovery of two seropositives and this has delayed the lifting of the Infected Area. All stock on the new farms involved have been destroyed and sent for rendering and an additional 3 km patrol area has been established.
<P>

<a name="10509w19.html_para12">Inspections and blood sampling in this new area should be completed by 3 May. Provided these are clear, it is hoped restrictions in the whole Colchester area could be lifted by next week.
<P>

<a name="10509w19.html_para13">The cleansing and disinfection of the new Dangerous Contact premises is under way but this should not affect the lifting of the Infected Area.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food if he will issue guidelines to his Department's staff, dealing with foot and mouth disease in the areas affected, to ensure that neighbouring residents are informed if slaughtered carcases are to be burned near their homes.  [157373]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10509w19.html_spnew16"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 6 April 2001]:</i> Methods for informing residents of burning sites in the neighbourhood are decided at a local level, and will include mail shots, consultation with relevant organisations and publicity through local press.
<P>

<a name="10509w19.html_para14">Safeguarding public health is the Government's over- riding priority in handling the foot and mouth outbreak. The Department of Health has published detailed guidance on the disposal of carcases together with advice about the public health aspects of disposal, including burning.
<P>

<a name="10509w19.html_para15">All fires are being constructed following special guidance from the Government to minimise public health risks. As with any fire, however, smoke contains pollutants that will stay in the air for a short time. Local residents are therefore advised to avoid sustained exposure within the vicinity of pyres.

<a name="10509w19.html_wqn17"><B> Mr. Simon Thomas: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food if he will publish his Department's assessment of the discovery on 31 January by French veterinarians of foot and mouth disease in sheep exported from Wales.  [157483]

<a name="10509w19.html_spnew17"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 9 April 2001]:</i> The circumstances were as follows. A consignment of 402 sheep was exported to France from premises in Wales on 1 February under an export health certificate that had been issued on 31 January. In early March, the French authorities blood tested 31 of the animals before slaughtering them. The French authorities have now informed us that the seven samples that initially showed positive results have now been re-tested with negative results. They have concluded that the initial serological positive reactions must be considered as false positives.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10509w19.html_wqn18"><B> Mr. Pickles: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what plans he has to make a statement on the easing of livestock movement in the Brentwood area of Essex; and what conditions must be met before such a statement can be made.  [157956]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10509w19.html_spnew18"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 The infected area status around Brentwood was lifted on 24 April 2001. This means that the Brentwood area becomes an 'at risk area' and farmers can now apply for licences to move their livestock to other similar areas in the country under the livestock movement schemes.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10509w19.html_wqn19"><B> Mr. Hoyle: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food when the D notices will be lifted in the Chorley constituency.  [157521]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10509w19.html_spnew19"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 9 April 2001]:</i> Form D notices are services on individual premises when an Inspector has reasonable grounds for suspecting an animal situated on the premises has been exposed to foot and mouth disease and where the premises are in a Protection Zone. These are withdrawn as soon as this is appropriate. The Protection Zone in the Chorley constituency is currently being reviewed and will be lifted as soon as possible in line with veterinary guidance.

 <i>[holding answer 10 April 2001]:</i> Emissions of pollutants from burning railway sleepers were considered as part of the Department of Health-led risk assessment on the health effects of air emissions from pyres. This Risk Assessment is available on the Department of Health's website. Railway sleepers form an important source of fuel for pyres. The sleepers may be treated with creosote and this will add to the range of pollutants emitted on burning. The emission of pollutants from sleepers was assessed by the Environment Agency and factored into the risk assessment. No separate assessment of the emissions from burning sleepers has been undertaken: the focus has been on the pyres as a whole.

<P>
<a name="10509w19.html_spnew23"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 The incubation period varies according to the infecting dose, the strain of virus and the susceptibility of the infected animal, both individual and species. It can be between two and 14 days, but certain strains of FMD virus serotype O circulating in Asia, including that in the UK, can have very short incubation periods in pigs, as short as 18 hours.

<P>
<a name="10509w19.html_spnew25"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 The Institute of Animal Health at Pirbright has recently produced a report, in collaboration with MAFF and the Meteorological Office, on the spread of the foot and mouth disease virus from the burning of animal carcases on open pyres. This report is to be published in the "Veterinary Record" shortly.
<P>

<a name="10509w19.html_para21">Six pyres, located in Devon, Exeter and Worcestershire, were monitored. Additional pyres are currently being investigated in Cumbria and Devon. The report concludes that early results indicated that breakdowns due to virus dispersion from pyres are unlikely to occur in general and the pyres analysed to date have shown no evidence that breakdowns due to this cause have occurred.
<P>

<a name="10509w19.html_para22">The Pirbright Institute of Animal Health has informed the Ministry that the virus is inactivated at temperatures above 50 degrees centigrade. There may be a small thermo-resistant element of the virus which is also destroyed at 70 degrees, but expert opinion is that this is likely to be insignificant in the possible spread of infection from pyres.

<P>
<P><I>9 May 2001 : Column: 237W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="10509w19.html_para23">The legislation does not provide for a formal legal appeals procedure against slaughter although, of course, challenge by way of judicial review is always available to anyone. To date only one judicial review has been brought but it was discontinued by the applicant. MAFF policy is that if a farmer objects to having his stock slaughtered under the contiguous slaughter policy, a veterinary reassessment is performed. This takes into consideration all the representation made by the farmer and reviews the situation on the ground. A final decision is then taken by the local Divisional Veterinary Manager.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10509w19.html_spnew29"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 Milk is not routinely tested to confirm a diagnosis of foot and mouth disease (FMD). Tissue and blood samples for the diagnosis of FMD are tested in Great Britain only at the Institute for Animal Health laboratory in Pirbright. This is the world and EU community reference laboratory for FMD. The laboratory has the experience in this area, the trained personnel and uses internationally recognised, validated laboratory tests for FMD. It is licensed for this purpose by the Ministry, and operates under the very highest conditions of containment to ensure that there is no escape of infection from the laboratory premises.

permitted below 500 feet for a radius of one nautical mile around certain infected premises. These restrictions apply to those infected premises where the risk of airborne transmission is considered to be high. For example, restrictions are imposed on infected premises with a significant number of pigs, due to the high levels of virus they excrete. The restrictions will be lifted as soon as slaughter is completed. There are also restrictions that apply to mass burial and cremation sites, with flying not permitted below 1,000 feet for a radius of two nautical miles around the site.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10509w19.html_spnew34"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 23 April 2001]:</i> Horses are not susceptible to foot and mouth disease but may be involved in spreading infection in the same way as vehicles and people, by carrying material from an infected animal. For this reason, horses on infected farms cannot move off the farm until the restrictions are lifted. Guidelines have been issued for horse-riding, and some activities are prohibited in an infected area. These include hunting and point to point meetings.
<P>

<a name="10509w19.html_para24">The State Veterinary Service has carried out assessments of the risks of spreading foot and mouth disease by holding horse race meetings. Instructions and guidelines for horse racing have been issued by the Jockey Club and British Horseracing Board, in conjunction with MAFF. The Jockey Club and British Horseracing Board ensure that the conditions are enforced by individual racecourse. Detailed information, including the veterinary risk assessments, is also accessible on the MAFF website http://www.maff.gov.uk/.
<P>

<a name="10509w19.html_para25">Current veterinary advice is that no race meeting should be held within 3km of a confirmed or suspected case of foot and mouth disease. Horses are not permitted to enter a racecourse if they are from premises situated less than 1km of a premises on which foot and mouth disease has been confirmed in the previous 30 days.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10509w19.html_spnew36"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 26 April 2001]:</i> There are no plans to carry out any culls to produce fire breaks against the spread of foot and mouth disease in the Priestweston/Marton Hill area of Shropshire.

 <i>[holding answers 26 April 2001]:</i> On investigation for foot and mouth disease, veterinary inspectors can follow two courses of action. Being either satisfied on clinical grounds or suspicious that foot and mouth disease is present, the stock will be slaughtered and samples sent for testing. Stock on contiguous premises is also culled when disease has been confirmed on the premises under investigation. Slaughter on suspicion cases are confirmed as outbreaks if the laboratory results are positive. If a veterinary inspector is satisfied that the disease is not present, restrictions on the premises are lifted.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what instructions have been given to those slaughtering animals during contiguous culls about the report they should make and the steps they should take when they discover clinical symptoms of foot and mouth disease in the stock they are slaughtering; and if he will make a statement.

<P>
<a name="10509w19.html_spnew54"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 1 May 2001]:</i> Normal suspect disease procedures apply when clinical symptoms of foot and mouth disease are discovered in stock being slaughtered during contiguous culling. The slaughtered animals are reported as confirmed on clinical grounds. The newly confirmed premises in turn becomes the centre for a circle of contiguous culling. The same also applies if samples taken from contiguously culled animals test positive for signs of the disease.

 <i>[holding answer 1 May 2001]:</i> The statement by my right hon. Friend the Minister on 26 April 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 456-73, updated the House on a number of actions taken following an initial assessment of the origins and spread of the disease. The consultation on the proposed ban on pig swill closed on 10 April. 150 responses were received, almost all of which favoured a ban. A number of detailed issues were raised which are being considered urgently and an announcement on this is expected shortly. A large number of comments has been received on a proposed 20 day standstill period, after movements on farm, for sheep, goats and cattle. Because of the considerable interest in this issue, it has been decided to extend the consultation period for a further month from the initial deadline of 11 May. The cross- departmental examination of the controls on commercial and personal imports of meat and meat products is under way and a further announcement will be made in due course.

<P>
<a name="10509w19.html_spnew58"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 1 May 2001]:</i> Our current veterinary risk assessment concludes that infected deer could transmit foot and mouth disease to susceptible livestock during the clinical stages of the disease. However the risk of wild deer playing any significant part in the spread of the disease is assessed as very low and feral deer are unlikely to represent a longer term risk. We therefore have no plans at this stage to control wild deer populations.

 <i>[holding answer 8 May 2001]:</i> The Department does not hold stocks of foot and mouth vaccine. However, contingency plans exist to draw sufficient doses from the International Vaccine Bank (IVB) and the EU Vaccine Bank (EUVB) to vaccinate some 750,000 cattle. This is available at short notice but, as the EUVB holds sufficient doses of appropriate vaccine for 2.5 million cattle, additional supplies are available from this source if required.

 All cloven-hoofed animals, including deer, are susceptible to foot and mouth disease. Wild deer tend to show mild or inapparent disease, resembling the disease in sheep, although some species, (eg roe deer and muntjak deer in the UK) may be severely affected. The age of the animal greatly affects the severity of the disease.

<P><I>9 May 2001 : Column: 246W</I><P>

<a name="10509w19.html_para29">Deer can be carriers of the foot and mouth virus, and could transmit foot and mouth disease to susceptible livestock during the clinical stages of the disease. However, the Ministry's current veterinary risk assessment indicates that the risk of wild deer playing any significant part in the spread of foot and mouth disease is very low. There are therefore no plans at this stage to control wild deer populations, although as more information becomes available about the epidemiology of the disease in areas where there are wild deer, the risk assessment will be updated.
