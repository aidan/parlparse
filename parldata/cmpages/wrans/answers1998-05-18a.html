<a name="80518w01.html_spnew0"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 Contractual arrangements are a matter for the parties concerned and it is their responsibility to take account of compliance with any regulatory requirements in their project planning. In cases where a waste management licence is required for the remediation of contaminated land, the effect of section 36(9) of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 is to provide the Environment Agency with a basic period of four months in which to carry out statutory consultations and to determine an application. The Environment Agency is committed to providing an efficient and effective service and its Customer Charter includes the following commitment:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"We will make decisions on applications for waste licences within four months of receiving a full filled-in application, with all supporting information. For example, we may need proof of planning permission and financial guarantees. We will decide on any modifications to licences within two months of receipt and will deal with licences you send back to us within three months of receiving them. Complicated cases may take longer and we will agree upon a period when we will get back to you."</FONT></UL>

<P>
<P>
<a name="80518w01.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Brake: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (1) if the United Kingdom's obligations to allow 40 tonne lorries onto the roads after 1 January 1999 apply to lorries other than those involved in carrying international traffic;  [41900]
<P>
<UL>(2) what plans he has to allow 44 tonne lorries onto United Kingdom roads;  [41899]
<P>
(3) if he will ensure that drivers of 40 tonne lorries will be required to demonstrate to enforcement officers that they are engaged in an international journey by producing appropriate documentation.  [41901]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80518w01.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The obligation to allow 40 tonne, 5 axle lorries on UK roads from 1 January 1999 applies only to international movements. We are considering whether or not 40 tonne vehicles should also be allowed for domestic movements and will announce the outcome in the White Paper on Integrated Transport. Enforcement issues will be taken into account in reaching our decision. 44 tonne, 6 axle vehicles have been allowed in the UK since 1994 for certain road/rail movements. We are considering whether or not to allow any wider use of these vehicles and will announce the outcome in the White Paper on Integrated Transport.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what proposals he has to encourage the development of sustainable refrigeration technologies.  [41904]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80518w01.html_spnew8"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 The DETR, through its Energy Efficiency Best Practice Programme, encourages the development of sustainable refrigeration technologies by the dissemination of independent, authoritative information such as Guides and Case Study material, on energy efficiency best practice. Also, through the future element of the Programme, it is able to offer financial assistance to those companies who are interested in researching and developing the energy efficiency technologies and techniques of the future.
<P>

<a name="80518w01.html_para6">There are other programmes under which proposals of this type could be considered, for example LINK, SMART, and research funding through the relevant Research Councils. Consideration is also given to such technologies under the Partners in Technology scheme.




<P>

<P>

<a name="80518w01.html_para7">The Government also encourage the refrigeration industry to sign up to the declaration of intent which it has agreed with the industry. This discourages the use of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) for any application where a risk of high emissions exists, by promoting the use of safe, reasonably practical, environmentally acceptable and energy efficient alternatives where available.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what plans he has to implement the recommendations of the 4th report of the British Government Panel on Sustainable Development published in February in respect of the use of hydrofluorocarbons.  [41903]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80518w01.html_spnew9"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 The Government welcome the Fourth Annual Report of the Government Panel on Sustainable Development.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80518w01.html_wqn10"><B> Mr. Cawsey: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will list for each local authority <i>(a)</i> the amount collected as national non-domestic business rates, <i>(b)</i> the amount paid back to the local authority via Government grant and <i>(c)</i> the net gain or loss in the current financial year.  [41906]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80518w01.html_spnew10"><B> Ms Armstrong: </B> 
 I have today placed in the Library of the House a table showing <i>(a)</i> the amounts calculated by English billing authorities as their provisional contribution to the non-domestic rates pool for 1998-99, and <i>(b)</i> the amounts of redistributed non-domestic rates payable to each receiving authority in England for 1998-99.
<P>

<a name="80518w01.html_para8">The two amounts cannot be compared directly because (i) contributions to the non-domestic rates pool are made by billing authorities (eg London boroughs and district councils), whereas redistributed non-domestic rates are paid to all receiving authorities (including preceptors such as county councils and police authorities); (ii) the total redistributed from the pool includes amounts other than those received from billing authorities--ie payments in lieu of rates from Crown properties, payments from properties on the Central List, and Exchequer contributions to compensate the pool for income forgone as a result of transitional schemes.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80518w02.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 Guidance to local authorities on implementing the provisions of the Road Traffic Reduction Act 1997 was issued in draft on 15 January for public consultation.

<P>

<a name="80518w02.html_para0">Local authorities will need to take account of this guidance in deciding how they intend to meet their duties under the Act. However, they have been asked to report on the broad approach they envisage taking, and the role they see for traffic reduction targets in their area, as part of their bids for Transport Policies and Programme funding, to be submitted by 31 July 1998.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will review standard spending assessment formulae with a view to including incentives for local authorities to use vehicles which use liquid petroleum gas.  [41950]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80518w02.html_spnew1"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 Proposals for changing standard spending assessment (SSA) formulae should be brought to the SSA Sub-Group of the Settlement Working Group, where possible changes to formulae are discussed by central and local government representatives. It should be noted, however, that SSAs are a measure of what an authority would need to spend in order to provide a similar level of service as other authorities, taking account of its demographic, social, economic and geographical characteristics. SSAs are not intended to provide incentives for local authorities to behave in any particular way. We seek to achieve this by using measures which do not depend upon the policies of local authorities.
<P>

<a name="80518w02.html_para1">A number of local authorities have benefited from grants from the Energy Saving Trust towards the purchase of vehicles which use liquefied petroleum gas and other alternative fuels.

<a name="80518w02.html_para2">Under the new Local Air Quality Management (LAQM) system, which came into effect at the end of December 1997, district and unitary local authorities are currently reviewing the quality of the air within their area assessing it against statutory objectives for seven key pollutants. These objectives are based on those in the UK National Air Quality Strategy.
<P>

<a name="80518w02.html_para3">Localities must be designated Air Quality Management Areas where the review and assessment show that national measures will not ensure the objectives are achieved by the end of 2005. The relevant local authority must then prepare an action plan in pursuit of the objective(s).
<P>

 <i>[holding answer 13 May 1998]:</i> The objectives contained in the National Air Quality Strategy for achievement for 2005, including the one for PM10 would be taken into account in the appraisal of a proposed road scheme against the Government's five criteria of integration, accessibility, environment, economy and safety.
<P>

<a name="80518w02.html_para5">Where an exceedence of a National Air Quality Strategy objective is forecast, whether or not as a consequence of the scheme proceeding, the local authority would be required to declare an air quality management area covering the area of anticipated exceedance. An action plan would then have to be prepared by the local authority, in consultation with the highways authorities, the Environment Agency and other stakeholders. The action plan would identify a range of measures, to be applied either locally or further afield, aimed at securing the achievement of the objectives throughout the air quality management area. Such measures might include enhanced traffic management, the application of more stringent emission limits to industrial processes or increased domestic smoke control.

 My right hon. Friend the Minister for the Environment announced the 1997 bathing water quality results in December and said that the results in the North West were especially poor and that this was particularly disappointing given that major bathing water improvement schemes had been completed in the area. In February this year, the Environment Agency and North West Water announced plans for further work in the Fylde coast area which they regard as necessary to improve compliance with the Directive standards. My Department has received a detailed report from the Environment Agency on these measures and the progress made.

 The Environment Agency have recently completed a two month public consultation into applications for variations to the discharge authorisations for the Sellafield site and are now considering the responses received. The Government have reiterated to the Environment Agency that they wish to see progressive reductions in discharges and discharge limits at Sellafield. There have been requests for Ministers to 'call-in' these applications and decide the matter for themselves and these requests are being considered.

 <i>[holding answer 14 May 1998]:</i> The Directive provides for licences to be issued to or renewed for those whose diabetes is treated by insulin for driving passenger-carrying and goods vehicles (minibuses, medium-sized lorries, buses, coaches and large goods vehicles) "only in very exceptional cases", and subject to further conditions. The Secretary of State's Honorary Advisory Panel on Diabetes and Driving has hitherto advised that, in their opinion, there are no

exceptional cases. That is because treatment by insulin can lead to hypoglycaemic attacks which may occur suddenly and unpredictably, and which can lead to loss of consciousness without warning. A number of collapses at the wheel have been found to be associated with insulin treatment. UK legislation has therefore reflected the Panel's advice. However, in the light of evidence from the British Diabetic Association and other which claims that modern treatment and control methods minimise the risks, the Advisory Panel have, at the request of Ministers, been re-examining the issues in respect of the driving of minibuses and medium-sized lorries. The outcome of that re-examination will be made public shortly.

 London Transport presented their evaluation of options for the future of London Underground to the Deputy Prime Minister in September 



<P>
<P><I>18 May 1998 : Column: 226</I><P>
1997. In the following months, there were numerous meetings, with different Departments, at Ministerial and official level, with LT and their advisers at which all the issues were debated. We fully considered London Transport's proposals in reaching our decisions on a Public/Private Partnership.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what assessment he has made of who will be liable in the case of a serious infrastructure failure on London Underground after concessions for managing the infrastructure of London Underground have been awarded to private companies; and if he will make a statement.  [42365]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80518w03.html_spnew9"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 Under our proposals, the private sector will be responsible for financing, maintaining and modernising the Underground's infrastructure. The contractor, or contractors, will be subject to a tough performance regime with penalties for failure or poor performance. We will be working with London Transport and expert advisers to establish the details of the division of specific risks and liabilities between the public sector operating company and infrastructure contractor(s).

[42364]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80518w03.html_spnew10"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The Government's financial advisers looked at a range of assumptions about passenger revenues. Their analysis showed that the option announced by the Deputy Prime Minister on 20 March 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 1539-56, is robust against a fall in revenues, and that substantial fare increases would therefore not be necessary to pay infrastructure contractors or meet the operating costs of the London Underground operating company. Once the GLA is established, London Underground fares will be a matter for the Mayor.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what controls there will be on the charges contractors can make to London Underground for use of track, signals and stations under his proposals; what estimate he has made of the likely impact on fares; and if he will make a statement.  [42394]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80518w03.html_spnew11"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The infrastructure contractor, or contractors, will be responsible for financing, maintaining and modernising the Underground's infrastructure, and will be paid by London Underground according to their contract. We will be working with London Transport and expert advisers to establish the details of the contractual payment mechanism, which will be based on paying the contractor according to performance.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80518w03.html_spnew12"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The Government's financial advisers made assessments of the transitional and ongoing costs of keeping London Underground in the public sector, and of awarding a contract, or contracts to finance, maintain and modernise the Underground's infrastructure. These assessments, along with other important factors such as safety, were fully considered by the Government in reaching our decision on a Public/Private partnership for London Underground. The financial comparisons showed that the Government's preferred option is likely to represent better value for money than retaining London Underground in its current form. No assessment was made of privatising the Underground, which was ruled out in the Manifesto.

 The franchise agreement requires LTS Rail to comply with the terms of the Ticketing and Settlement Agreement (TSA), which is overseen by the Rail Regulator. The TSA sets out the ticket office opening hours which each operator has agreed to as a signatory to the agreement. These hours may be varied only with the approval of the Rail Regulator (any short-term issues affecting station opening, such as staff shortage, are for the operator to manage in the light of its other business commitments). The table shows the ticket office opening hours set out in the TSA for stations managed by LTS Rail.

 The situation described would be an operational matter for the police. Police officers could deal with it by a verbal warning and moving those distributing the material from the roadway. Alternatively, if they thought it appropriate, they could charge the offenders under a number of different statutes ranging from those concerned with obstruction of the highway to possible public order offences. The offences charged would depend on the precise circumstances of the incident.

 Under section 26(1)(d) of the Immigration Act 1971, a foreign national is guilty of a criminal offence if, without lawful authority, he alters any certificate of entitlement, entry clearance, work permit or other document made under or for the purpose of the Act; or if he has in his possession any passport, certificate of entitlement, entry clearance, work permit or other document which is known (or he has reasonable cause to believe) to be false. However, it is also possible that other legislation, which although not referring exclusively to passports, may be used to deal with foreign nationals arrested for this type of crime.

<a name="80518w07.html_para0">Detailed information on persons charged by offence is not collected centrally.

<a name="80518w07.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 The arrangements are set out in paragraphs 26 and 27 of the booklet on the original Scheme. Under the terms of Option C, claimants must submit valid documentary evidence of the value of the items claimed as at 16 October 1996. Where that evidence supports the amount claimed, then the claim will be paid. If the evidence is unsatisfactory, then the Firearms Compensation Section will request further evidence from the claimant. If that evidence is satisfactory, then the claim will be met. Where no additional evidence is submitted or the additional evidence remains unsatisfactory, the claim will be paid at the listed value or, where appropriate, the police force involved will be asked to obtain a further valuation from an independent source, selected at the discretion of the chief officer. Where this is obtained, the valuation will normally be used to calculate the payment to the claimant.

<a name="80518w07.html_para4">This final independent valuation stage provides a last resort arrangement to ensure that no claim should be incapable of being resolved satisfactorily.

 The claim with the police reference number HER 13040 was received in the Firearms Compensation Section on 15 October 1997, and the Option A and B elements are now being processed. The Option C elements, which will require individual consideration of the evidence of value provided, will be dealt with at a later date.
<P>

<a name="80518w07.html_para5">There is no provision in the compensation scheme for the payment of interest if claims are not dealt with in a particular time.

<a name="80518w08.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 Everthorpe has 96 prisoners in units reserved for those who are committed not to use drugs. These units were introduced three years ago. Places in them are available only to prisoners whose general behaviour also qualifies them for the enhanced regime, and the standard of behaviour in the units is good. On average, two prisoners per month are removed from the drug-free units, either for failing a drugs test or for failing to maintain the standard of behaviour required of prisoners on the enhanced regime.
<P>

<a name="80518w08.html_para0">An alcohol counsellor has recently been re-engaged after a nine month gap, so it is too soon to comment on the effects of her work. However, there are no indications that alcohol is a particular problem at Everthorpe.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what estimate he has made of the current numbers and percentages of the prison population using <i>(a)</i> cannabis, <i>(b)</i> ecstasy and <i>(c)</i> heroin.  [41639]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80518w08.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 Our best estimate of the numbers of prisoners using illegal drugs is drawn from the results of random mandatory drug testing (MDT). While it is recognised that, for a number of reasons, MDT results cannot be a complete measure of prevalence of drug misuse in prisons, the results do provide for the first time a reliable and statistically valid way of measuring patterns and trends of drug misuse across establishments and over time.
<P>

<a name="80518w08.html_para1">Laboratory screening does not differentiate ecstasy from the amphetamine group as a whole, or heroin from other opiates, so it is not possible to provide figures specifically for ecstasy or heroin.
<P>

<a name="80518w08.html_para2">There were 45,613 random tests in total during the first three quarters of 1997-98. Of these, 7,754 (17 per cent.) were positive for cannabis; 91 (0.2 per cent.) for amphetamines; and 1,870 (4.1 per cent.) for opiates. Final figures are not yet available for the fourth quarter.
<P>
<P>
<a name="80518w08.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Flynn: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what percentage of prisons he forecasts will be free of the use of illegal drugs by 2002.  [42060]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80518w08.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 Our best estimate of the numbers of prisoners using illegal drugs is drawn from the results of random mandatory drug testing (MDT). A number of prisons do return entirely negative results of drug testing. But, because random testing involves the testing of only a proportion of a prison's population each month and, for a number of reasons, MDT results cannot be a complete measure of prevalence of drug misuse in prisons, it would not be safe to claim that a prison is free of drug misuse.
<P>

<a name="80518w08.html_para3">We are committed to the aim of enabling all prisoners to have access to voluntary testing units in order to demonstrate that they are drug free.
<P>

<a name="80518w08.html_para4">Over 4,000 places can now be provided in voluntary testing units and the Prison Service is working to expand this number to achieve our aim.
<P>

<a name="80518w08.html_para5">It would be unrealistic to put a figure on the future number of drug free prisons, since there are too many unpredictable variables. However, we aim through 



<P>

<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="80518w08.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Banks </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 12 May 1998]:</i> None directly. However, the Government recognise the importance of sport and we want to ensure access to a wide range of facilities, including equestrian, for the many not the few. The English and UK Sports Councils continue to work with local authorities and governing bodies on the best way of meeting this aim.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80518w08.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Banks: </B> 
 Swimming teaching will be eligible for funding under the New Opportunities Fund, particularly under the out of school hours activities initiative which will include sporting activities which aim to assist the social development of children and young people. The 



<P>
<P><I>18 May 1998 : Column: 245</I><P>
healthy living centres initiative could also raise awareness of the importance of healthy physical activity such as swimming since centres will be designed to provide information, advice and support to help people improve their health and wellbeing. Future initiatives supported by the New Opportunities Fund could also potentially provide funding for swimming. Swimming is, of course, already eligible for Lottery funding from the four national Sports Councils.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80518w08.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Banks: </B> 
 The Government are determined to ensure that Lottery money is allocated more fairly and equitably in the light of need across the whole of the United Kingdom and between different groups in society. The National Lottery Bill requires the Heritage Lottery Fund and the other Lottery distributors to demonstrate in their strategic plans how they will achieve this. The Bill also gives distributors new powers to encourage specific applications which do not come forward spontaneously. In addition, proposed new Policy Directions, drafts of which are in the Libraries of the House, emphasise the need to ensure that all parts of the country have equal access to Lottery funds. These measures should help areas that have benefited less in the past.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80518w08.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Banks: </B> 
 The Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) uses seven main criteria to assess applications. These are as follows:
<P>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Importance of the project to the heritage</FONT></UL>

 The main focus of our development co-operation with Pakistan is improving basic social services, such as elementary education and reproductive health. We are also helping to create better basic infrastructure and livelihoods for poor communities, in both rural and urban areas; and we are supporting various initiatives by Pakistan to enhance the quality of its governance. Final disbursement figures for the 1997-98 UK Financial Year are not yet available, but are expected to maintain the present pattern of spending on our bilateral programme of around &#163;25 million annually.

 We provided around &#163;6 million of bilateral development assistance in 1997-98 to Sri Lanka, and expect to maintain this level of expenditure in the current year. The programme focuses on two major issues: raising the quality of primary education and helping those affected by civil conflict.

 At present, no alternative defence uses for the site at HMS Osprey have been identified. The Army Training and Recruiting Agency is looking at the site in the context of a study into options for rationalisation of the Adjutant General's Corps Training Group, which currently occupies a number of sites in the South. The results of the study will be published at the end of June. The awards of the facilities management contract at the Royal Armoured Corps Centre at Bovington and Lulworth has not resulted in the release of any specific facilities.

 Funding from the Defence research budget in respect of project grants and programme grants is specified not by individual names but by research packages and technology groups. New researchers may apply for funding under the Joint Grants Scheme, under which the relevant Research Council and MOD may each make up to a 50% contribution to research proposals with potential Defence application. Information on grants provided is not available in the form requested, as applicants are not required to give information about their sex. Studentships in engineering, both pre-university and for sponsorship until University finals, are funded from a central MOD budget and not from the Defence research budget. Historic figures are not kept but, of those currently sponsored by MOD to read engineering, 6.8% are women. A system of Research fellowships is being introduced in the current financial year. The process is at an early stage and information on the percentage of applications from women is not yet available.

A number of representations were received from the trades unions, local councils, individual employees and hon. Members. Having considered these representations very carefully, I am satisfied that no issues have arisen which would call into question the study's recommendations. I intend, therefore, to proceed to implement disaggregation with the objective of ceasing operations at the Long Marston Depot by December 1999.

 The most effective way of ensuring that defence exports are not used for internal repression including the repression of internal dissent is to carry out a thorough assessment of this risk when considering whether to authorise an export. This includes consideration of the human rights record of the recipient country and of the specific end-user, including its use of similar equipment, and the likelihood of diversion from the stated end-use or end-user. The export licensing criteria specify that exports will not be authorised if there is a clearly identifiable risk that the goods concerned might be used for internal repression.

These reports cover a wide range of effects: the most frequently reported include skin and subcutaneous tissue reactions, musculoskeletal disorders and gastrointestinal disorders.

 The matters referred to are, in the first instance, the responsibility of the management of Ashworth Hospital Authority. The North West Regional Office of the National Health Service Executive (NWRO) monitors Ashworth Hospital Authority's performance of its responsibilities, and the High Security Psychiatric Services Commissioning Board (HSPSCB), which is also part of the NHS Executive, has a service agreement with Ashworth Hospital Authority relating to the type and level of services which the hospital is expected to provide.

The authority has arrangements in place for an ongoing audit of the manner in which the security procedures manual is being implemented across the hospital. Both the NWRO and the HSPSCB include, as part of their monitoring role, a review of the security arrangements in place at the hospital and the audit findings. Further changes to the security arrangements will be introduced if necessary.

 In my statement on 3 February 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, column 843, I accepted the recommendations in Sir Leslie Turnberg's report on London's Health Services including the proposal that a single National Health Service Executive Regional Office for London should be a longer-term aim in order to ensure effective planning across London. I have now decided that it would be right to move more quickly on this front and I intend to establish such an Office from 1 April 1999.

 We recognise the service need for improved hospital facilities at Sheppey. Thames Gateway National Health Service Trust, West Kent Health Authority and South Thames NHS Executive Regional Office are currently working hard to ensure a successful private finance initiative (PFI) scheme. Like all PFI schemes, to be approved the final agreed PFI solution must demonstrate it is affordable to the NHS and best value for money.

<P>
<a name="80518w14.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Milburn: </B> 
 In the outline business case for this scheme the trust examined the option of developing on their current site, but this was discounted as it would have involved using a cemetery (now disused) which is on the site. Local consultation indicated that there would be considerable opposition to building across the cemetery and this could delay any start on site by a significant period. Additionally, there would have been high costs involved with the removal of remains to an alternative site. These were the reasons for purchasing the new greenfield site.
<P>

<a name="80518w14.html_para12">A greenfield site was identified as the preferred option in the outline business case long before the trust started testing for the private finance initiative scheme.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80518w15.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Milburn: </B> 
 The two new wards (for rehabilitation and general practitioner services) were constructed at the same time as the rest of the new community hospital at Sittingbourne. However, the costs of providing the full range of services at the new hospital had to be revised upwards. Since April 1997 West Kent Health Authority has funded outpatients, minor injuries and psychiatric day services at Sittingbourne hospital. West Kent Health Authority and Thames Gateway National Health Service Trust are aiming to open the two wards for rehabilitation and GP services by the end of this financial year.

<a name="80518w15.html_wqn4"><B> Mrs. Gorman: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food how many reports his Department has received of adverse effects from using organophosphate pesticides in each of the last three years.  [41382]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80518w15.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 In the three years to March 1998, the Pesticides Safety Directorate has considered three cases of alleged adverse effects relating to use of organophosphate pesticides. In the case of Phorate, data indicating that residues in carrots could erode safety margins led to the suspension of approval for use of Phorate products on carrots and parsnips. Of the other two cases, one related to a small increase in the amount of impurity present in a product after storage, and the other to alleged crop damage. Neither of these resulted in regulatory action.
<P>

<a name="80518w15.html_para4">In addition, in the three years to March 1997, a total of 36 incidents of alleged ill health (involving 78 people) have been assessed by the Pesticides Incidents Appraisal Panel of the Health and Safety Executive where at least one of the active ingredients used was classed as an organophosphate. For 16 of these (involving 46 people), the ill health was assessed as confirmed or likely to be linked to pesticide exposure. The panel assesses cases that have been brought to its attention following investigation by the Health and Safety Executive or a Local Authority.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what controls his Department exercises to regulate the export of animals for intended use in experiments.  [42077]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80518w16.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Rooker </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 14 May 1998]:</i> Anyone exporting animals, including those exported for experimentation purposes, must comply with all statutory animal health and welfare rules applicable to the species and, in the case of exports to third countries, the animal health requirements of the importing country. We are shortly to begin discussions with the Home Office about possible criteria for further controls enabling us to take into account the treatment of the animals in the country of destination before we issue official non-statutory health certification.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, pursuant to his letter, 113574, of 23 April, what information has been obtained about anti-smuggling devices that can detect the heart-beat of an animal concealed inside a vehicle.  [41120]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80518w16.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The use of a device to detect the heartbeat of a person or animal that is concealed in a vehicle is being investigated by the Home Office in conjunction with the Prison and Immigration Services. I will write again to my hon. Friend when my Department has further information.

<a name="80518w16.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 Generally, the place of origin of any food must be given if omitting it could mislead the purchaser about the true place of origin of that food. The Department has issued guidance on these rules which makes clear that, where such indications are used to describe processed foods, this must not mislead the consumer about the origin of the individual ingredients of the product.
<P>

<a name="80518w16.html_para0">More specifically, EC rules require certain fresh fruits and vegetables to be marked with the country of origin at all points of sale. In October last year, we launched the Beef Labelling Scheme, which provides for the accurate labelling of beef. With effect from 1 July, any beef labelled with country of origin information must have been derived from animals born, reared and slaughtered in that country. It is envisaged that national origin labelling of beef will become compulsory by the year 2000.

<P>
<a name="80518w16.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Rooker </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 14 May 1998]:</i> A number of options for placing additional work at the Central Science Laboratory's York site have been considered, including work currently done elsewhere in MAFF. No other MAFF work, with the exception of the work currently carried out at CSL's Norwich site, has been identified which could be transferred to York economically and without creating problems for other parts of the Department. As regards non-MAFF work, a Commercial Director has been appointed to the CSL Board to develop and establish new business.

<P>
<a name="80518w16.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Rooker </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 14 May 1998]:</i> In the event of a decision to close the Norwich laboratory, non-mobile staff would normally be given the opportunity to relocate to York. Every effort would be made to assist those non-mobile staff unable to relocate to identify and secure suitable employment elsewhere in the public sector, for example in other Government departments and local authorities, or in the private sector.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, pursuant to his answer of 30 April 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>247</i>, on what date his Department decided not to proceed with the tendering exercise to identify consultants to advise on how best to achieve a secure financial future for the Central Science Laboratory; and by whom the decision was made.  [42110]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80518w16.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Rooker </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 14 May 1998]:</i> The Prior Options review of the Central Science Laboratory (CSL) concluded that there was no obvious solution to securing a sound financial future for the Agency. The key was to introduce additional revenue. A number of actions were put in hand, including a tendering exercise to identify consultants to advise on the issue and the creation of a new post at Board level to develop new business. When officials reviewed progress in May 1997, they concluded that, since the principal requirement was to increase the utilisation of the Sand Hutton site, the most appropriate course was to proceed with the appointment of a Commercial Director but not with the appointment of external consultants.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Funding for the New Deal essentially follows the client with entitlement to funding for staffing, staff expenses and programme costs being based on the actual numbers entering the different stages of the programme. However, assumptions have been made as to the likely uptake of New Deal places and the resulting entitlement to funds. The Portsmouth District is covered by two delivery units for New Deal. For the Isle of Wight unit an allocation of &#163;123,200 has been identified for 1998/9 and for the remainder, known as Portsmouth/South East Hampshire, an allocation of &#163;315,700 has been identified for the year. These figures include small amounts for expenditure, outside of salary costs, to cover directly related expenses, such as staff travel costs.</FONT></UL>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>For its other activities, the Portsmouth District of the Employment Service has been allocated &#163;3.27m for 1998/9 salary costs, based on an allocation of 203.1 staff units.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what assessment he has made of the impact of segregated special education on community care policies.  [41923]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80518w17.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 We do not have information which implies a link between type of educational provision and subsequent need for community care. We are considering how best to collect information about the experiences, once they have left school, of young people with special educational needs, with the aim of helping schools and colleges prepare young people for adult life more effectively.

 Up to 31 March 1998, a total of 4,637 lone parents had agreed to participate in the New Deal for Lone Parents in the eight prototype areas; and during this period 72 advisers were available to work with them. The ratio of advisers to lone parents in the nationwide programme will of course depend on the rate at which lone parents participate in the service. However, the Government are drawing up resourcing plans for the New Deal for Lone Parents using assumptions based on the participation rate to date. Therefore, the ratio of advisers to lone parents in the nationwide service will be at least as good as it has been up until April 1998.

 Winter Fuel payments are one of a number of initiatives the Government have taken to help vulnerable people, especially the elderly, keep warm in the winter. A total of &#163;400 million has been committed for two years (1997/98 and 1998/99), to help pensioners with fuel bills to pay. This is the first time any Government have provided automatic help to over 7 million pensioner households with fuel bills to pay, living in the United Kingdom, who receive a Retirement Pension or one of a number of other qualifying benefits.

<a name="80518w19.html_para0">The making of this year's payments has been an enormous and unprecedented exercise. In order to establish all eligible pensioners, correctly identify pensioner households, and determine the amount each should receive, it was necessary to correlate data in around 15 million computer records, involving 15 qualifying benefits, across nine computer systems. Overall, almost ten million pensioners, in over seven million households, have received a payment.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Around one and a half million of the poorest pensioners, those receiving Income Support or income-based Jobseeker's Allowance, received their payment of &#163;50 during January.

This includes 211 who erroneously received two payments due to being in receipt of both Income Support and income-based Jobseeker's Allowance for at least one day in the qualifying week. In accordance with legislation, only one payment should have been made. Also, due to a computer operator error, 40,801 invalid girocheques were sent out with an incorrect date of issue. The error was quickly identified and all the invalid payments were replaced within 72 hours. The letter which accompanied the replacement payment apologised for the error and advised the recipient to destroy the invalid girocheque or if they had encashed it, to return the replacement to the nearest Benefits Agency office. It appears that in 438 instances both the invalid and replacement girocheque were cashed.</FONT></UL>

 <i>[holding answer 14 May 1998]:</i> The available information, which shows tax and NICs payments at multiples of median male full-time earnings, is given in the table. Changes already announced, which will take effect in 1999, will offer significant help to families, reducing the burden of tax and NICs for a family with two children on median earnings. A one earner couple with 2 children with half median male earnings (&#163;187.25 per week) will gain around &#163;20 a week from the introduction of the Working Families Tax Credit. No family with children with earnings less than &#163;220 per week will pay income tax. Child benefit for the eldest child will be increased by &#163;2.50, the largest real increase since 1978. And all employees earning more than the Lower Earnings Limit will gain &#163;1.28 a week from the abolition of the NICs entry fee.

 Estimates of the expected receipts from the windfall tax are given in Table B9 and estimates of the associated spending are given in Table B11 of the March 1998 Financial Statement and Budget Report (FSBR). Table 1.2 can be recalculated to include the windfall tax and associated spending by adding the windfall tax receipts net of associated spending to the figures presented.
