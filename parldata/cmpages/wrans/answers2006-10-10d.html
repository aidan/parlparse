 Local authorities receive funding for all pre-16 provision, through the Dedicated Schools Grant (DSG). This is a ring-fenced DfES grant provided to local authorities to fund educational provision in all types of setting, including private, voluntary and independent settings offering free early education. Funding for under fives is not identified separately within DSG. The DSG guaranteed unit of funding (for each full-time equivalent pupil aged 3 to 15) should not be seen as the level of funding for each pupil but as a mechanism for distributing the total quantum of DSG to local authorities. The total DSG funding provided to Kent county council in 2006-07 is &#163;718 million (a 6.9 per cent. increase per pupil).</p>

The Lord&#146;s Resistance Army (LRA) and the Government of Uganda are both participating in the Juba-based talks process, which remains fragile. But the signing of a cessation of hostilities agreement on 26 August was an encouraging development. This gave some grounds for hope that permanent peace is possible. But it is too early to say that the conflict is over and there may well be some setbacks as the process develops. Both sides will need to show a strong commitment to the mediation process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_480"><a name="61010w0008.htm_para0"><a name="06101336007093">As of 1 October 2006, reimbursement prices for all affected products were reduced by 12 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_481"><a name="61010w0008.htm_para1"><a name="06101336007094">The decision in regard to the staged approach is a direct consequence of the consultation process and demonstrates clearly that the Department had regard to the responses received and was willing to adjust its proposals accordingly. The final decision aims to recognise the existing services that are provided by suppliers to the benefit of patient care, while at the same time moving to secure better value for money for the national health service overall.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_482"><a name="61010w0008.htm_para2"><a name="06101336007095">In arriving at 15 per cent., three sources of information were used: secondary care purchase data, additional secondary care tender data, and information concerning the industry's cost and revenue structures.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_483"><a name="61010w0008.htm_para3"><a name="06101336007096">In addition, it was in fact clear from both consultation papers on the arrangements for the provision of chemical reagents to primary care in October 2005 and May 2006:</p>
<a name="61010w0008.htm_brev0"><a name="06101336011586"><ul><p class="tabletext">that the 15 per cent. figure was an average derived from a comparison between prices in the primary and secondary care markets;</p>
</ul><a name="61010w0008.htm_brev1"><a name="06101336011587"><ul><p class="tabletext">that the rationale underlying the comparison was that prices in primary care should more closely reflect the market-tested prices available in secondary care; and</p>
</ul><a name="61010w0008.htm_brev2"><a name="06101336011588"><ul><p class="tabletext">that the price differential between the markets went as high as 35 per cent. and that the reduction proposed was therefore reasonable in the context of the overall range of pricing that the data suggested was reflective of the more competitive environment.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_484"><a name="61010w0008.htm_para4"><a name="06101336007097">The data underlying these calculations were given to the Department in confidence, and related to commercially confidential transactions within the NHS. In a market for items manufactured by only seven companies, four of whom collectively account for 97 per cent. of sales, it would not be feasible to publish data in any meaningful form without&#151;whether on its face value or by obvious implication that would be evident to companies in that market&#151;revealing to each manufacturer something about its competitors' pricing. </p>

 Data on waiting times for radiotherapy are not collected centrally. The national health service cancer plan set out maximum waiting time targets for cancer treatment which may include radiotherapy where this is given as a first definitive treatment. Since December 2005 there has been a maximum two month (62 day) wait from urgent referral by a GP to start of treatment, and a maximum one-month (31 day) wait from diagnosis to first treatment for all cancers. Over 99 per cent., of patients currently receive their first treatment within 31 days of diagnosis, and 94.5 per cent., of patients receive their first treatment within 62 days of an urgent GP referral.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_497"><a name="61010w0008.htm_para17"><a name="06101336007145">To tackle radiotherapy waiting times we are increasing the numbers of therapy radiographers in post and in training, making better use of existing staff, making unprecedented investment in new radiotherapy equipment, and streamlining the patient journey. Professor Mike Richards, the National Cancer Director, is also currently working with Royal Colleges, professional bodies, cancer networks and trusts through the national radiotherapy advisory group (NRAG) who are looking into radiotherapy provision and will be reporting in the autumn on recommendations for the future.</p>

These campaigns target irresponsible retailers who sell alcohol to drunks and children, as well as individuals who drink irresponsibly and cause alcohol-related crime and disorder.

 As the document shows, the houses were originally private residences and then used as offices in the nineteenth century. It refers to their dilapidation, frailty and severe structural problems prior to the reconstruction completed in 1991. They are statutorily listed at grade II* and grade II. Use as offices would require planning permission for change of use and listed building consent for alterations which, I understand, is unlikely to be granted.</p>

 The Government of Afghanistan&#146;s National Drugs Control Strategy makes clear that in dealing with the drugs issue in Afghanistan, effective sequencing between the various strands of activity is paramount. Alternative livelihoods work alone will not affect opium yields. On the other strands, for example, law enforcement is also needed. As we know from experience elsewhere, sustainable drug elimination takes a considerable time. This is particularly the case in Afghanistan where the challenges are very significant.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_522"><a name="61010w0011.htm_para9"><a name="06101336007399">The approach set out in the Government of Afghanistan&#146;s Strategy represents the best means of tackling the problem. The strategy has four key priorities&#151;targeting the trafficker, strengthening livelihoods, reducing demand and developing effective institutions. To affect opium yields progress needs to be made on all. There is no simple answer to how long the Afghan counter-narcotics battle will take, although President Karzai said at the London Conference in January 2006 that it would need at least 10 years of consistent effort.</p>

 The Government of Afghanistan&#146;s National Drug Control Strategy makes clear that in dealing with the drugs issue in Afghanistan, effective sequencing between the various strands of activity within the strategy is paramount. It recognises that eradication is an important component of the counter narcotics effort, as it raises risk in the eyes of those involved. However, the strategy says that eradication should only be applied where there is access to legal economic alternatives. Without this sequencing, eradication runs the risk of further impoverishing those involved, and to leave them with little choice but to replant poppy again the next planting season.</p>

These have suggested so far that there is relatively little demand from their customers to use their services in the early hours of the morning during the week. In contrast, they have received feedback from customers who have asked for their services to be available for at least some of the time on Sunday. At present this is not possible because of the significant amounts of time used on Sundays to install and test improvements to products and services. Companies House are presently considering a range of options which could be introduced when the mainframe is replaced.</p>

 The Government take the view that the inclusion of regulations in the Shareholder Rights Directive which deal with the passing of instructions between intermediaries in the voting chain must be consistent with better regulation principles. It must take account of the circumstances of intermediaries at different levels in the chain and make clear to which member state&#146;s law each intermediary or relationship is subject. It should also not duplicate obligations which already exist in contracts between intermediaries and their clients, or other intermediaries. Finally it should allow investors a choice between contracts with and without voting rights.</p>

 VAT zero-rating applies to live animals of a kind generally used as, or used to produce, food for human consumption. The scope of the relief is therefore defined by the type of animal concerned and whether it can be considered to be food according to the ordinary and every day meaning of the word.

The NDA's current plan for decommissioning Wylfa (as set out in its approved Strategy) is that it will operate until 2010; between 2010 and 2012 the fuel will be removed. That will be followed by a period of preparation for care and maintenance, which will include all of the facilities outside the reactor core being decommissioned; this is planned to be completed by 2025. The core and its contents will be finally cleared by 2125. Further details of all NDA activities, such as the Strategy and plans for Wylfa and decommissioning costs, can be found on the NDA website at: www.nda.gov.uk.</p>

 Compared with the current housing benefit rules, we estimate that the majority of new claimants will gain under the local housing allowance. This will make a positive contribution to tackling child poverty and to the welfare of those without children.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_624"><a name="61010w0018.htm_para6"><a name="06101336007858">The local housing allowance provides a more transparent housing benefit scheme and through direct payment to claimants, encourages greater financial inclusion.

 Any shortfall between the local housing allowance and contractual rent at the time of national roll-out of the local housing allowance will depend on the trends in local rent levels and the accommodation choices made by tenants. The trends in local rent levels up to the point of national roll-out cannot be predicted precisely and local housing allowance rates will vary across local private rent sector markets and different sizes of property. However, we estimate that the majority of new claimants at roll-out will gain under the proposed national local housing allowance compared with what they would have been entitled to under the current housing benefit rules. Additionally, as the rates will be set at the median market rent and published, claimants will have access to 50 per cent. of the rental market and will know their maximum entitlement in advance reducing the risk of unexpected shortfalls.</p>
