 Significant numbers of the Common House Moth (Tineola bisselliella) were first reported in the House in early 2008 and preventative treatment has been undertaken since then. In order to minimise the use of pesticides and the consequent risk of exposure to potential toxicants, a process involving moth pheromone has been employed. Although activity in T block remains an issue, monitoring of moth activity shows that moth numbers within the House of Commons estate are generally declining. Alternative methods of eradication, including heat treatment of items and individual spraying of offices to kill larvae, are being considered.</p>

AFCS consists of a tax-free lump sum payment and is based on a tariff of injuries to take account of the pain and suffering associated with an injury, in recognition of service personnel's sacrifice on the nation's behalf. For the more seriously injured, it also provides a guaranteed income payment. This provides a substantial tax-free income (index linked) following termination of service for the rest of their lives to compensate for their potential loss of earnings and pension.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what guidance his Department provides to supermarkets on how to use out of date food which is still safe to eat. [315692]</p>

 The Government do not currently provide specific guidance to supermarkets on what to do with 'out of date' food which is still safe to eat. This would include food past its "best before" date, which indicates the period in which food is of optimum quality, but after which is still perfectly edible. It would also include food past its "display until" date, as these are used for stock control, and although retailers may remove food from sale once the "display until" date has passed, it has no bearing on food safety or quality. "Use by", however, is mandatory for food that will, after that date, become unsafe to eat and should be thrown away.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_72"><a name="100208w0007.htm_para1"><a name="10020826000248">Where it is of sufficient quality, consuming food that has passed its "best before" or "display until" (but not past its "use by") date is, environmentally, a much better option than treating it using even the most advanced technologies. Organisations such as FareShare collect such good quality surplus food and redistribute it to vulnerable people in the community. Many supermarkets already support FareShare, and the Secretary of State has recently written to supermarket CEOs to ask them to think about how this support can be increased further still.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_73"><a name="100208w0007.htm_para2"><a name="10020826000249">The Government are also collaborating with WRAP (the Waste and Resources Action Programme), the Food Standards Agency (FSA) and the food industry to improve the clarity and consistency of food date marks and storage and usage guidance. The aim of this project is to improve date labelling practice and consumer understanding, thus reducing food waste while increasing understanding of food safety.</p>

Separate figures for small and medium-sized enterprises are not collected and to provide this information would incur disproportionate cost.</p>

For DWP this vacant space represents less than 0.3 m per cent. of the overall annual cost of DWP office accommodation.</p>

 Directgov has the potential to enable Government to make substantial savings in shifting from traditional to digital channels. For those savings to be realised, it is vital that the public are aware of and trust Directgov as the Government's official website. The aim of the campaign is to increase awareness so that Directgov is the first site people think of for Government information, and one which they both trust and recommend to others. Early results have shown the campaign has been a success with a record number of 614,000 visits on the first day of the campaign which was then followed by another 663,000 the next Monday. During the period of the campaign to date, year on year visits to the Directgov homepage have risen by 104 per cent.</p>

</ul><a name="100208w0009.htm_brev2"><a name="10020828000937"><ul><p class="tabletext">The vast majority of these took place as a result of the decision to merge the former Benefits Agency and Employment service in 2002. Jobcentre Plus inherited around 1,500 offices from the two former agencies. At the point of merger, the two organisations had offices which, in many instances, were geographically close to each other and provided opportunities to rationalise the estate. We have modernised our Jobcentre network to improve customer service, rationalising our estate to provide excellent high street coverage and a single, integrated customer facing office, at the same time reducing cost to the tax payer. We remain the largest office network in Government with 741 modern Jobcentres supported by 31 modern, industry standard contact centres and 79 main benefit processing centres.</p>
</ul><a name="100208w0009.htm_brev3"><a name="10020828000938"><ul><p class="tabletext">The great majority of our services (in common with most large, modern organisations) are now also delivered through the telephone and internet. For example, to give customers more convenient access, we have around half a million vacancies on-line at any time (our website receives close to one million job searches every working day), and new claims to benefit are predominantly taken by telephone with some taken on-line. This has brought our customer facing services together in a more coherent and integrated network.</p>
</ul><a name="100208w0009.htm_brev4"><a name="10020828000939"><ul><p class="tabletext">Our approach to closure of a customer-facing Jobcentre takes into account a range of issues, including the impact on customer service and whether the work and staff can be relocated. When we are considering changes in our service delivery planning of this nature, we consult with our customers, partner organisations, Trade Unions, staff, and local Members of Parliament.</p>
</ul><a name="100208w0009.htm_brev5"><a name="10020828000940"><ul><p class="tabletext">In the light of the current economic conditions and welfare reform changes planned for the next two to three years a decision was taken late in 2008 to suspend the planned closure of 25 Jobcentres. Three small offices in London, where closure had been previously announced, subsequently closed in March and April 2009. However, there will be no new Jobcentre closures while the current economic conditions persist.</p>

A targeted regional campaign is being rolled out, which is designed to engage with the local pensioner population, using channels of communication and working with organisations they are familiar with. The Pension Disability and Carers Service carries out around 13,000 visits weekly to vulnerable customers. In addition a small pilot is planned for 2010 designed to investigate the viability of making better use of the data currently held by DWP to improve pension credit take-up.</p>

For winter 2008-09, over 12.3 million people in around 9 million households received winter fuel payments at a cost of around Â£2.7 billion.</p>

<i> [holding answer 2 February 2010]:</i> Disability living allowance and employment and support allowance are distinct benefits each with their own eligibility criteria which require separate claims.</p>

The Department deals with disability living allowance claims such as these within eight working days and aims to make a decision on employment and support allowance claims within five working days.</p>

Dementia is defined with the following ICD-10 Codes recorded in primary diagnosis: F00* Dementia in Alzheimer's disease F01 Vascular dementia F02* Dementia in other diseases classified elsewhere F03 Unspecified dementia Dagger codes that are relevant for "F00* Dementia in Alzheimer's disease" and "F02* Dementia in other diseases classified elsewhere" have not been included in this analyses and counts for Dementia in the table are relevant to ICD-10 codes in the range of F00 to F03 where they were recorded as primary diagnosis. Alzheimer's is defined with the following ICD-10 Codes recorded in primary diagnosis: G30 Alzheimer's disease.  3. <i> Hospital provider:</i> A provider code is a unique code that identifies an organisation acting as a health care provider (national health service trust or primary care trust (PCT)). Hospital providers can also include treatment centres (TC). Normally, if data are tabulated by health care provider, the figure for an NHS trust gives the activity of all the sites as one aggregated figure. However, in the case of those with embedded treatment centres, these data are quoted separately. In these cases, '-X' is appended to the code for the rest of the trust, to remind users that the figures are for all sites of the trust excluding the treatment centres. The quality of TC returns are such that data may not be complete. Some NHS trusts have not registered their TC as a separate site, and it is therefore not possible to identify their activity separately. Data from some independent sector providers, where the onus for arrangement of data flows is on the commissioner, may be missing. Care must be taken when using these data as the counts may be lower than true figures.  4. <i> Length of stay (LOS) (duration of episode)/length of stay (duration of spell):</i> The difference in days between the admission date and the episode end date (duration of episode) or discharge date (duration of spell), where both dates are given. LOS is based on hospital stays and applies only to ordinary admissions, not day cases (unless otherwise stated). Information relating to LOS, including discharge method/destination, diagnoses and any operative procedures, is based only on the final episode of the spell.  5. <i> In-patients:</i> In-patients are patients who are admitted to hospital and occupy a bed, including both admissions where an overnight stay is planned and day cases.  6. <i> Activity included:</i> Activity in English NHS hospitals and English NHS commissioned activity in the independent sector.  7. <i> Data quality:</i> HES are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and PCTs in England and from some independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.  <i> Source:</i>  Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), The Information Centre for health and social care.<br>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health what estimate he has made of the financial cost to acute NHS trusts which do not meet the 2010 National CQUIN goal to reduce avoidable death, disability and chronic ill health from venous thromboembolism (VTE) by providing a VTE risk assessment for 90 per cent. or more of adult inpatients on admission to hospital.

 The goal on carrying out venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk assessment for at least 90 per cent. of admitted patients is one of two nationally mandated goals within acute hospital commissioning for quality and innovation (CQUIN) schemes for 2010-11. These two national goals must be linked to around 0.3 per cent. of a trust's income. If a trust achieves both goals it will earn this money non-recurrently on top of the actual outturn value of its contracts. The weighting of the financial value between the two national CQUIN goals is agreed locally, but if they were equally weighted at 0.15 per cent. this could typically equate to a payment of between Â£200,000 and Â£1 million linked to VTE risk assessment, depending on the size of trust. Failure to achieve the goal will mean that the trust cannot earn this CQUIN payment from its commissioners. The CQUIN framework applies to providers on NHS Standard Contracts funded by the national health service in England.</p>

 Information is not available in the form requested. The NHS Information Centre has just begun publishing quarterly figures on national health service sickness absence drawn from the NHS electronic staff record. Between April and June 2009, the average sickness absence rate for the NHS in England was 4.05 per cent. However, there is a seasonable element to sickness absence. The Boorman Review of NHS Health and Well-being (November 2009), reported an estimated annual rate of 4.5 per cent.</p>

This study, which will conclude shortly, examines the ways in which nurses are enabled and supported to contribute to the promotion and safeguarding of children and young people's health and wellbeing within school settings. It will seek to identify strategic arrangements most likely to maximise the potential of nurses' contribution, and to inform local decisions on the optimal composition of the school health team.</p>

<i> [holding answer 4 February 2010]:</i> The Government have a strong package of measures to help reduce fuel poverty amongst vulnerable households which includes pensioners. This is centred on tackling the three root causes of fuel poverty:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_225"><a name="100208w0017.htm_para6"><a name="10020840000136">We have also introduced legislation to implement mandated social price support schemes once the current voluntary agreement with suppliers comes to an end in 2011. These schemes will provide more of the most vulnerable consumers with help towards their energy costs. We have said that we are minded to focus the majority of the additional resources on older pensioner households on the lowest incomes as these households tend to have a high incidence of fuel poverty - over 50 per cent. of fuel poor households have a person over 60 living in them; their circumstances are relatively stable; and they are at the greatest risk of excess winter deaths.</p>

 The joint Foreign and Commonwealth Office and Home Office Forced Marriage Unit (FMU) was set up in 2005 and initially provided ad hoc funding to initiatives run by the third sector. To give this support more structure, the FMU piloted a domestic programme fund of Â£65,000 in 2008-09. This was aimed specifically at funding third sector projects which help deliver the Unit's published Action Plan. For 2009-10 the initiative was continued and the fund increased to Â£84,000. Funding allocations for the FMU in 2010-11 have not yet been set. It is important to remember that Government funding for third sector activity to help tackle forced marriage is not only available via the FMU, for example funding can also be sought from Government Offices.</p>

Bids were assessed against a common set of criteria including value for money, likely impact, support to the objectives laid out in the FMU Action Plan, and a clear and measurable reporting process to ensure transparency and accountability. The fund is designed to fund small projects rather than core funding to organisations. Organisations that had previously received funding were only eligible to bid for further funding  <br>

 Cap and share applies to the teachers, NHS, civil service and local government pension schemes. With the exception of the local government scheme these operate on a pay-as-you-go basis: these schemes have no fund, so no surplus or deficit. Future cash flow projections for the pay-as-you-go public service pension schemes are presented in chart 6.E of the Long Term Public Finance Report 2009, which was published alongside the pre-Budget report 2009. These projections include allowance for the potential savings as a result of cap and share due to increasing life expectancies.

 For so called "Controlled Work" (which includes legal help and general advice and assistance), legal aid providers are paid a standard monthly payment in the first instance, which is not split by category of law. Once a case has been completed, the provider submits a claim to the LSC. Before the introduction of the Unified Contract in April 2007, solicitors were paid hourly rates and not-for-profit providers were paid in advance for hours agreed in their contract and the monthly data related to the number of cases started and finished as opposed to their cost. Since the introduction of a standard fixed fee payment regime in October 2007 it has been possible to provide figures for the cost of claims for all providers for 2008-09 to date.</p>

Additionally every local authority within England and Wales was contacted for geographical information on persons sleeping rough and contact was made with organisations such as the National Homeless Alliance and Shelter from which volunteers were sought to help conduct the enumeration. The count of rough sleepers was held on census night between 22:00 hours and 06:00 hours the following morning. For each location containing one or more rough sleepers, the enumerators completed a communal establishment questionnaire, which had a specific category for rough sleepers and which provided an address to link the individuals to.
