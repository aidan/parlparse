<p><a name="40629w01.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and I represented the United Kingdom at a meeting of the Agriculture and Fisheries Council in Luxembourg on 21 June. The Scottish Minister for Environment and Rural Affairs was also present.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40629w01.html_para0">
The Council held a public debate following the Commission&#039;s presentation of an Action Plan for Organic Food and Farming. We joined other Ministers in welcoming the Plan while stressing that expansion of the organic sector would have to be driven by consumer demand. The UK would play its part in further discussion but would want to ensure that requirements laid on the organic sector were economically realistic.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40629w01.html_para1">
The Commission updated the Council on continuing WTO negotiations under the Doha Development Agenda and on its negotiations for a trade agreement with the Mercosur countries. We endorsed the efforts of the Commission to work for progress on both fronts and, on the WTO, emphasised the value of securing progress before the summer break. I re-iterated the benefits that a Doha deal could bring to the world economy and especially to developing countries.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40629w01.html_para2">
The German Minister presented a memorandum to the Council on renewable resources, following a conference held last month in Bonn, which the Secretary of State had attended. Delegations welcomed the German paper, noting the growing importance of renewables. The Commission said it would submit a biomass plan by the end of 2005.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40629w01.html_para3">
The Council had a brief exchange of views on the Commission&#039;s report on the operation of the beef labelling regulations. There was general agreement that the regulations had done much to support consumer confidence in beef and that major changes are not needed. Further technical discussion will take place at official level.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40629w01.html_para4">
The Commission presented a paper setting out proposals for promoting more environmentally friendly fishing methods and a timetable for introducing new 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>29 Jun 2004 : Column 156W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
measures. This was the product of previous discussions between member states. The proposals had received wide support, including from the UK. We will continue to seek technical solutions and to support research directed at methods which respect the environment and contribute to a sustainable fishing industry.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40629w01.html_para5">
The Council agreed the ceilings for the maximum fishing effort of member states in waters to the west of Britain (principally ICES Areas VI and VII). This was the final element of the arrangements agreed by the Council in October 2003, which are based on an up-dated reference period of 1998&#150;2002 reflecting actual fishing effort over that period. We were pleased that the final text provided for consistency of approach and transparency in the calculations.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40629w01.html_para6">
The Commission sought initial views on proposals for the establishment of a Community Fisheries Control Agency. There was general agreement that the concept was commendable if it improved consistency of enforcement. We indicated that we would be pleased to participate in discussions about the detail and registered that we believed that the Agency should complement rather than substitute the enforcement responsibilities of member states.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40629w01.html_para7">
The Commission reported on continuing negotiations with trading partners over the rice tariff and with Russia on its requirements for certificates covering animal and animal product imports.

<p><a name="40629w01.html_spnew2"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 Defra has made no estimate of the average lactations of dairy cows during their productive lifetime. However, according to data provided to the Milk Development Council by National Milk Records (who cover approximately 50 per cent. of the national herd) on average dairy cows have three lactations, each of which lasts for an average of 312 days.

 Risks of pollution from aquaculture are being addressed on a number of fronts through initiatives such as the Marine Stewardship report &quot;Safeguarding our Seas&quot; and the Scottish Executive&#039;s long-term strategic framework for Scottish Aquaculture.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40629w01.html_para9">
The Government&#039;s efforts focus on scientific research on the carrying capacity of aquaculture waters (and the possible relocation of sites where this is exceeded and relocation is practicable), the development of cost-effective ways of reducing output of polluting effluent, and research to determine parameters for the optimal management of stocking density of farmed salmon and trout.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health what action has been taken on the implications of cannabis smoking for respiratory health since the publication of the British Lung Foundation report, A Smoking Gun.  [179327]</p>








<p><a name="40629w02.html_spnew6"><b> Miss Melanie Johnson: </b> 
 The harms caused by cannabis smoking are kept under expert review. Since the British Lung Foundation report the Department has commissioned and published an update of &quot;Dangerousness of Drugs&quot; (2003), an independent expert review of the harms caused by drugs of misuse, which addresses the risks associated with smoking. In addition, the FRANK campaign and website, &quot;talktofrank&quot;, have raised awareness of these risks, increasing knowledge among young people of the illegality of cannabis use and the fact that it is a harmful substance.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40629w02.html_para8">
The Department has also set up an expert working group made up of members of the scientific committee on tobacco and health and the advisory council on the misuse of drugs to consider the issues of cannabis and tobacco smoking, and has commissioned research into the smoke produced by these substances, on the advice of this group, with results due later this year.

 Data collected from strategic health authorities (SHAs) shows that, of those consultants who had given a formal commitment to the new contract by 31 October 2003, 19 per cent. had agreed a job plan and signed up to the new contract and a further 40 per cent. had received final job plan offers by 30 April 2004.

<p><a name="40629w03.html_spnew1"><b> Miss Melanie Johnson: </b> 
 The contraceptive implant currently available in the United Kingdom is Implanon, a progestagen-only implant that provides contraception for a period of three years. Implanon is a prescription-only medicine which may be recommended for women of any age but which is most commonly used by older women.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40629w03.html_para1">
Studies carried out by the marketing authorisation holder for Implanon were evaluated at the time of licensing and the product information states that safety and efficacy has been established in women between the ages of 18 and 40 years. The limited available data do not suggest that the safety profile of Implanon is different in women under the age of 18 years. However, no formal research has been carried out and the judgement on the balance of risks and benefits in women under 18 is the responsibility of the prescribing physician.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40629w03.html_para2">
Health care professionals are encouraged to discuss the potential side effects with everyone who seeks treatment. In addition, prescribers are expected to satisfy themselves that all women understand the risks and benefits of using Implanon and that it is in their best interests to receive the treatment.
</p>

The advice of the Government&#039;s Fuel Poverty Advisory Group was therefore welcomed as a valuable contribution to the debate.

<p><a name="40629w06.html_spnew11"><b> Mr. Caplin: </b> 
 The Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC) maintains over 1,179,000 war graves at 23,203 burial sites in 148 countries around the world. It also commemorates a further 760,193 Commonwealth war dead on memorials to the missing, for whom there is no known grave.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40629w06.html_para6">
The CWGC inspect their graves and cemeteries on a regular basis, but the inspection cycle varies from country to country. In the United Kingdom, where the care of the majority of war graves in civil cemeteries and churchyards is entrusted to local authorities and contractors, inspections are made every six months; however in churchyards and cemeteries that contain very few war graves, there is a three-year cycle. In more distant locations (e.g. South America), where inspections by CWGC staff may be less frequent, reports are obtained from third parties (e.g. consular staff).

The costs of DESO are more than offset by benefits to the Defence budget arising from defence exports.

 Our road safety strategy&#151;&quot;Tomorrow&#039;s roads&#151;safer for everyone&quot;&#151;published in March 2000, set out the framework for delivering further improvements in road safety over the decade to 2010.

A number of these measures have already been, or are being, implemented with the active involvement of many stakeholders across Britain both within and outside Government. &quot;Road Casualties Great Britain 2003: Main Results&quot; published on 24 June 2004 shows that total deaths or serious injuries in 2003 were 22 per cent. below the 1994&#150;98 baseline average; over half way towards our 40 per cent. target by 2010. Child deaths or serious injuries were down 40 per cent.; over three-quarters of the way towards our 50 per cent. target by 2010.

Immediate initial investment is being made to stabilise the collection, improve storage, and enhance public understanding of its contents.

It is not possible to itemise expenditure specifically for digitisation. The largest proportion of new material being received at the BFI Archive is UK television programming, almost all of which is now delivered in a digital format. Currently, it is not possible to calculate exactly the amount of material in the Archive that is digitised, though the BFI are planning to invest significantly in digital access technology, so that the widest possible number of people can enjoy the treasures within the film Archive.

<a name="40629w11.html_sbhd5"><h3 align=center>E-mail (Consumer Protection)</h3>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what assessment she has made of the effectiveness of current consumer protection measures in dealing with e-mail promotion and transaction of frauds; and what steps she will take to ensure that perpetrators of such e-mails receive appropriate penalties.  [179496]</p>








<p><a name="40629w11.html_spnew6"><b> Mr. Timms: </b> 
 E-mail is an extremely powerful vehicle for targeting vast numbers of consumers at very low cost. The types of scams that they carry are also becoming more sophisticated and the nature of the medium also means perpetrators can easily hide their real identities. This particular kind of fraud is therefore challenging, but we believe we are helping to put in place an effective framework of activities to meet it.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40629w11.html_para2">
First, through law and enforcement co-operation. E-mail fraud is dealt with under the same laws as other fraud and consumer protection laws such as misleading advertising and distance selling. Therefore they incur the same penalties for infringements of these laws. Our focus then is on ensuring that they can be effectively enforced. To help this process, we are building partnerships between Government, regulators and industry to develop ways&#151;including technological solutions&#151;to find the perpetrators and stop this kind of activity. As many of these types of e-mail come from abroad, a major part of this is building effective co-operation agreements with other countries. In the past two years the UK has 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>29 Jun 2004 : Column 194W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
built up a network of consumer protection co-operation agreements with other countries including the United States and our European Union partners, and we are at the forefront of driving international co-operation to tackle unsolicited emails (SPAM).
</p>


<p>
<a name="40629w11.html_para3">
Second, through information. Advice and guidance to help consumers is key. The Department of Trade and Industry, Home Office and Office of Fair Trading all provide a wide range of information on email fraud for consumers. See www.dti.gov.uk/ccp www.homeoffice. gov.uk and www.oft.gov.uk Consumers should also take note of the help and guidance given by the Internet Service Provider (ISP).
</p>


<p>
<a name="40629w11.html_para4">
We believe that this approach&#151;encompassing co-operation, enforcement, information provision and technological solutions&#151;is the right one, and we will continue to improve and build on these elements.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what her latest estimate is of the percentage of e-mails received in the UK that are unwanted junk e-mails; and by how much this figure has changed since December 2003.  [181015]</p>








<p><a name="40629w11.html_spnew7"><b> Mr. Timms: </b> 
 The Government do not estimate the amount of unwanted junk e-mails received in the UK. However, according to industry sources the proportion of UK junk e-mails received at network level for May 2004 was 58.5 per cent. of the total received compared with 33.3 per cent. for December 2003.

The council will continue to monitor the emerging international research on this issue very carefully.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what steps his Department is taking to encourage community cohesion.  [172737]</p>








<p><a name="40629w13.html_spnew4"><b> Fiona Mactaggart: </b> 
 The Home Office is working with a range of partners to build community cohesion. It is jointly supporting the Community Cohesion Pathfinder Programme&#151;with the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM)&#151;under which local authorities and the voluntary and community sector are working together in 14 areas to build cohesion. The programme is generating examples of best practice in breaking down barriers between and within communities relating to race, faith, age and gender. The lessons learnt from this programme will be evaluated and shared across all local authorities in the country.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40629w13.html_para8">
The Home Office and partners have issued guidance to local authorities on how to measure and build community cohesion, and is working with the independent Community Cohesion Panel and other Departments to mainstream cohesion into Government policy. For example, the Department for Education and Skills (DfES) will shortly issue guidance on community cohesion standards for schools; the local authority comprehensive performance assessment for 2005 will cover community cohesion; and the Positive Activities for Young People Programme, funded by several Departments, according to a funding formula which takes account of community cohesion issues among other matters.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40629w13.html_para9">
Other Government policies contribute to improving community cohesion. The Neighbourhood Renewal Fund supports cohesion by working towards increased employment, reduced crime, and better educational attainment in deprived areas of England. Civil Renewal and community cohesion complement each other&#151;involving local people in identifying and solving the problems that affect their communities empowers communities to deal with change in society; and cohesion helps to build strengthened communities in which people come together to deal with their common concerns.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40629w13.html_para10">
The ODPM Select Committee has found in its recent inquiry into social cohesion that there has been significant progress since the disturbances of 2001, and the Home Office will be giving careful consideration to the Committee&#039;s recommendations in deciding how to take the community cohesion agenda forward.

The CRP evaluation of restorative justice relates to a project commencing late in the course of the CRP and depends for its final assessment of effectiveness on a two-year reconviction rate study. This means that the final report is due towards the end of 2006, with publication in 2007. However, interim reports are planned for publication in 2004, 2005 and 2006.

 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what progress has been made in discussions with <i>(a)</i> the World Bank and <i>(b)</i> other countries on developing indicators that will allow system-wide comparison of effectiveness of international aid; what indicators are in place; and what plans he has to introduce new indicators.  [180592]</p>








<p><a name="40629w17.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Gareth Thomas: </b> 
 The ultimate indicators of whether aid is effective are the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). These were agreed by 150 countries in 2000; they represent an unprecedented commitment by these countries to work together to improve the well-being of the world&#039;s poor. If aid is effective, it will result in progress towards the MDGs. For this reason, the MDGs are explicitly included in DFID&#039;s Public Service Agreement, and we monitor progress towards the goals every year in our Departmental Report.

Sometimes DFID may want to compare the effectiveness of individual agencies&#039; aid.

<a name="40629w17.html_para1">
The DAC conducts periodic &quot;peer reviews&quot;, where the development policies and efforts of individual DAC members are critically examined by other members.

<p><a name="40629w17.html_spnew4"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 DFID&#039;s Performance Reporting Information System for Management (PRISM) records a series of Project Information Markers (PIMs) against every eligible project, which links the project&#039;s purpose to its contribution towards one or more of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).
</p>


<p>
<a name="40629w17.html_para8">
The likely success of each project is also recorded in PRISM using an annual performance rating for purpose and outcomes for all eligible projects.

<p><a name="40629w17.html_wqn5"><b> Mr. Robathan: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what the evidential basis is for the statement in the Technical Note to PSA 2003&#150;06 that there is a clear relationship between the level of risk attached to a project and the magnitude of the anticipated benefits.  [180555]</p>








<p><a name="40629w17.html_spnew5"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 By their nature, there is an expectation that a higher proportion of low-risk projects will meet some or all of their objectives than is the case with medium or high-risk projects. Evidence from DFID&#039;s PRISM system bears this out: in the 12 months to end December 2003, 75 per cent. of low-risk projects were evaluated as successful, compared with 57 per cent. of medium-risk projects and 35 per cent. of high-risk projects.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40629w17.html_para9">
However, where risks are managed sensibly, high-risk projects can have very high potential benefits, such as making an exceptional contribution to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). High-risk work contributing to the peace process in Nepal and to reducing communal tensions in Indonesia would be two examples here. High risk, high return is commonly achieved with innovative or experimental projects, and even partial success on some high-risk projects will have a high impact on poverty. Examples of successful high-risk projects include: the Africa Private Infrastructure Financing Facility, Acholi Land Conflict Resolution (Uganda) and Guyana Enterprise Privatisation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40629w17.html_para10">
Clearly, it does not automatically follow that high risk means high potential return. However, given the nature of the environments in which DFID works, it is important that we do not follow only the safe options. A certain amount of risk-taking is inevitable and essential if DFID is to deliver on our demanding Public Service Agreement targets. In Sierra Leone and Nigeria, for example, a low risk approach would have implied a very low level of engagement.

<p><a name="40629w20.html_spnew0"><b> Keith Hill: </b> 
 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister&#039;s sustainable communities plan, published in February 2003, established regional housing boards (RHBs) in each of the nine English regions. The communities plan set out that RHBs would ensure regional housing strategies are co-ordinated with economic and planning strategies, allowing sub-regional approaches to housing problems extending beyond individual local authority boundaries.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40629w20.html_para0">
Affordable housing is the south-west housing body&#039;s number one priority. It announced on 24 March this year how &#163;188.2 million will be invested over the next two years to deliver over 6,000 affordable homes.
</p>

The provision of future funding for affordable housing in England is being considered as part of spending review 2004.

 To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what advice he has given Salisbury district council as the local housing authority on how to increase the quantity of affordable housing.  [180782]</p>








<p><a name="40629w20.html_spnew2"><b> Keith Hill: </b> 
 Government Planning Policy Guidance Note 3 (PPG3) requires that local planning authorities should plan to meet the housing requirements of the whole community, including those in need of affordable and special needs housing. The provision of affordable housing is then a local authority responsibility and should be made on the basis of robust local assessments of needs. Where need is clearly demonstrated for affordable housing, this should be taken into account in formulating development plan policies and in deciding planning applications involving housing.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40629w20.html_para2">
Salisbury district council consulted earlier this year on supplementary planning guidance for affordable housing. Government office for the south-west (GOSW) responded, re-enforcing the need to follow national and local plan policies.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40629w20.html_para3">
The Government are also consulting on changes to PPG3 (Housing) in order to widen the range of housing opportunity: size, type and affordability. This will underline that the planning system must enable the provision of new homes in the right place (focusing on brownfield sites first) and at the right time to meet planned supply targets.

<p><a name="40629w20.html_spnew3"><b> Keith Hill: </b> 
 The Government office for the south-west (GOSW) is a member of the South West Housing Body (SWHB) and provides secretariat support to the steering group, working group and regional housing forum. Along with partner organisations on the SWHB, GOSW will be heavily involved in drawing up the SW Regional Housing Strategy 2004. This document will have an influence on local policies on housing provision (including affordable housing).
</p>


<p>
<a name="40629w20.html_para4">
GOSW staff also assess all local authority housing strategies against standard fit for purpose criteria. The fit for purpose criteria require local authorities to ensure that provision of affordable housing is made on the basis of robust local assessments of needs. A demonstrable lack of affordable housing to meet local needs is a material planning consideration, which should be taken into account in formulating development plan policies and in deciding planning applications involving housing. Government have issued guidance on how to undertake local housing needs and market assessments.
</p>


<p>

 The Social Exclusion Unit report &quot;Mental Health and Social Exclusion&quot; was published on 14 June 2004.

 There are two ways in which a new parish and parish council can be established. The procedures for this are set out in the Local Government and Rating Act 1997.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40629w20.html_para11">
Section 9 of the Act provides that a district council may conduct a review of parish arrangements in their area and make recommendations to the Secretary of State, my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister for the establishment of a new parish.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40629w20.html_para12">
Section 11 of the Act provides for a petition to be raised for the creation of a new parish in a previously unparished area. For a petition to be considered valid it must be signed by not less than 250 or 10 per cent. of local government electors in the area of the proposed parish, whichever is the greater.

The Secretary of State, my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister may by Order give effect to (with or without modifications), or may reject, the recommendations made to him under section 9 or a petition for a new parish submitted under section 11. New parishes are constituted on 1 April of any year with the elections to the parish council being held on the ordinary day of election after that date.

<p><a name="40629w23.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. MacShane: </b> 
 At the Sea Island summit, the G-8 agreed to work together to establish a Special Committee of the Board of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which would be tasked to provide advice on safeguards and verification. The Government believe that such a committee could play a valuable role in investigating possible ways of strengthening the capability of the IAEA to ensure that nations are compliant with their safeguards obligations. The establishment of such a committee is a decision for the IAEA board, and the UK will play an active role in negotiations on its mandate and funding. A decision on the allocation of UK resources will be made once these negotiations are complete.

1. The financial data is taken from local education authorities&#039; Section 52 Outturn Statements submitted to the DfES. Section 52 is collected at local education authority level and as such the figures are provided for all London LEAs. Data is subject to change by the LEA. Cash figures are rounded to the nearest 10.<br>





2. Expenditure per pupil includes expenditure within schools and also that incurred centrally by the LEA. Figures also include an estimated apportionment of LEA expenditure based on pupil numbers&#151;this is due to the change in the way data was collected. Categories were aligned with the Consistent Financial Reporting framework and the spending by LEAs was no longer split by school sector.<br>

3. Pupil data are drawn from the Annual Schools Census adjusted to be on a financial year basis.<br>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills how many adults he expects to <i>(a)</i> be eligible for and <i>(b)</i> undertake free learning to help them achieve a level 2 qualification.  [180709]</p>








<p><a name="40629w24.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </b> 
 We estimate that up to 9.4 million people may be potentially eligible for the new level 2 entitlement to free tuition that we announced in our Skills Strategy White Paper, &quot;21st Century Skills&quot;. This is the number of people, of working age, who are in the workforce or economically inactive and who lack a foundation of employability skills equivalent to a full level 2 NVQ or five good GCSEs.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40629w24.html_para4">
From September 2004 the level 2 entitlement will be trialled as an integral part of a coherent offer of support for unskilled and low-skilled adults in the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) north east and south east regions. We will use the regional trials to assess demand for and take up of this offer, and this will inform how we manage its introduction nationally. This prioritisation of the needs of unskilled and low skilled adults will contribute to the Department&#039;s ambition to reduce the number of adults who lack a level 2 qualification by 40 per cent. by 2010.

Notes:<br>

1. The financial data is taken from Wigan LEA&#039;s Section 52 Outturn Statement submitted to the DfES from 1999&#150;2000 onwards and the ODPM&#039;s RO1 statement previously. Expenditure was not distinguished between pre-primary and primary sectors until the inception of the Section 52 outturn statement in 1999&#150;2000. 1999&#150;2000 figures reflect the return of GM schools to local authority maintenance.<br>





2. The outturn 2002&#150;03 tables captured the data in a fundamentally different way to the previous years. Categories were aligned with the Consistent Financial Reporting framework and the spending by LEAs was no longer split by school sector. Consequently the unit costs per pupil in 2002&#150;03 are not strictly comparable with earlier years as they include an apportionment of LEA expenditure based on pupil numbers. 2002&#150;03 data is subject to change by the LEA. Figures are rounded to the nearest 10.<br>

3. Net current expenditure (NCE) includes expenditure within schools and also that incurred centrally by the LEA.<br>

4. The NCE per pupil figures for pre-primary and primary relate the net current expenditure (after recharges) in the pre-primary sector and maintained primary schools to the total number of financial year pupils who are educated in the maintained nursery and primary schools sector.<br>

5. The NCE per pupil figures for secondary relate the net current expenditure (after recharges) in maintained secondary schools to the total number of financial year pupils who are educated in the maintained secondary schools sector.<br>

6. The NCE per pupil figures for special schools relate the net current expenditure (after recharges) in maintained special schools to the total number of financial year pupils who are educated in the maintained special schools sector.<br>

7. The variations that appear under the pre-primary sector and special school sector have arisen because the LEA scored items within specific areas differently between 2000&#150;01 and 2001&#150;02. The items fall within specific areas such as premises related, supplies and services, and third party payments; and under special schools the specific areas are employees and premises related expenditure. However, the overall total expenditure for all sectors within the specific areas does not reflect similar substantial differences between the years.<br>

8. Pupil data are drawn from the Annual Schools Census adjusted to be on a financial year basis.<br>

Notes:<br>

1. The financial data are taken from LEAs&#039; section 52 outturn statement submitted to the DfES from 1999&#150;2000 onwards and the ODPM&#039;s RO1 statement previously. 2002&#150;03 data are subject to change by the LEA.<br>

2. The cost of home to school transport includes the cost of public transport, contract hire or the use of authority vehicles in transporting pupils to school under section 509 of the Education Act 1996.<br>

3. Wholly selective areas for grammar school ballots purposes are those which the Department has calculated that 25 per cent. or more of the maintained secondary school population attend maintained grammar schools.<br>

4 Figures include all expenditure by the local authority on school transport. This includes the pre-primary, primary, secondary and special school sectors. The unit cost is calculated by dividing the sum of the net expenditure in these sectors by the total number of pupils educated in LEA maintained nursery, primary, secondary and special schools.<br>

5. The statistical neighbours categorisations are based upon the classifications developed by Ofsted. The calculation of statistical neighbours is concerned with finding, for each LEA, other LEAs with the most similar values of a given set of variables that describe LEA contexts. The average for a LEA&#039;s statistical neighbours is calculated using the sum of the 10 statistically &quot;closest&#039; neighbours net expenditure divided by the total number of pupils educated in these 10 LEAs.<br>

6. Pupil data are drawn from the Annual Schools Census adjusted to be on a financial year basis. <br>

Notes:<br>

1. The financial data is taken from LEAs&#039; Section 52 Outturn Statements submitted to the DfES from 1998&#150;99 onwards and the ODPM&#039;s R01 statement before then. 2002&#150;03 data is subject to change by the LEA.<br>

2. The cost of home to school/college transport includes the cost of public transport, contract hire or the vehicles in transporting pupils/students to school/college under section 509 of the Education Act 1996.<br>

3. Figures include all expenditure by the local authority on transport. This includes the pre-primary, education out of school and continuing education sectors.<br>

4. Some substantial variations between years have occurred. We are not able to offer a detailed analysis for the reasons because LEAs do not offer a breakdown of inconsistencies across the years.<br>

5. ConfED/DfES conducted a joint survey in 2003 of LEA transport expenditure and policies. The data should enable LEAs to compare their policies and costs with other similar authorities.<br>

<p><a name="40629w30.html_wqn5"><b> Mr. Beggs: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what the reasons were for the decision to adopt a different procedure to that in England for the allocation of funds under the Research Capability Fund to Northern Ireland&#039;s universities.  [180686]</p>








<p><a name="40629w30.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Gardiner: </b> 
 Decisions in relation to university research funding are entirely a matter for the Department for Employment and Learning (DEL). There are many differences between the research funding model adopted by Northern Ireland and that implemented by the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE), due to the different needs and circumstances of Northern Ireland. In general, HEFCE does not provide recurrent research funding to university departments rated lower than four in the Research Assessment Exercise. The Research Capability Fund in England was allocated, therefore, to a limited range of departments rated 3a. In Northern Ireland, to help maintain a broad base of research activity across the two universities, all departments rated 3a already receive recurrent funding from the Department for Employment and Learning.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40629w30.html_para5">
The Research Capability Fund, as introduced by DEL has two distinct strands. One strand, in keeping with the policy aim of maintaining a broad research base, funded some university departments rated 3b. A second strand, in keeping with priority 1 of the Regional Innovation Strategy, &quot;think/create/innovate&quot;, is to be used to support, selectively, those areas relevant to the needs of the Northern Ireland economy; there is no comparable strand in England.

 The Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety commissioned research into public attitudes to smoking prohibitions/restrictions as part of the commitment to implement the Five Year Tobacco Action Plan, launched in July 2003.

 Children with learning difficulties can be educated in a variety of locations including mainstream schools, special units attached to mainstream schools or special schools.

<p>
<a name="40629w31.html_para2">
The Department of Education gives Education and Library Boards a block grant each year from which they fund a range of services. Within their Block Grant, Boards establish their own spending priorities and this includes their spending on special educational provision, which includes that for children with learning difficulties. Funding allocations do not specify expenditure for particular types of special educational need and therefore it is not possible to identify separately the funding provided for children with learning difficulties.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what preparations have been made to deal with a potential outbreak of West Nile virus in the Province.  [179658]</p>








<p><a name="40629w32.html_spnew1"><b> Angela Smith: </b> 
 There is no evidence at present of any cases of West Nile infection in people in Northern Ireland or the rest of the United Kingdom. The inter-departmental Regional Zoonoses Group chaired by the Chief Medical Officer is currently considering the issue in liaison with the UK Zoonoses Group on which Northern Ireland is represented. In late May 2004, the Chief Medical Officer in England published a contingency plan to protect the public&#039;s health in England in the event of a case of West Nile Virus illness being diagnosed. This will help inform preparations in Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. The Northern Ireland Blood Transfusion Service last year recommended that those who travelled to North America defer making donations of blood for 28 days after returning from that area. The Chief Medical Officer&#039;s (DHSSPS) &quot;Update&quot; publication has also drawn West Nile Virus to the attention of GPs to raise awareness when considering a diagnosis. Information on West Nile Virus is also included on the DHSSPS website.
