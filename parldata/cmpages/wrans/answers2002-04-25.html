 <i>[holding answer 11 January 2002]:</i> The joint Environment Agency and HSE investigation surrounding the fire of October 2000 is principally complete. However, the agency is undertaking excavations beneath concreted areas at the site to investigate allegations that hazardous waste was buried below the transfer station in the early 1990s. Excavations at the site commenced in mid March. Given the co-operation of the company, the agency expect to complete the excavations and associated investigations next month. In the light of which we will make a decision on whether or not to hold a public inquiry.

<P>
<a name="20425w01.html_wqn1"><B> Dr. Cable: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what plans the Government have to increase the UK's recycling of household waste; and what funds the Government plan to make available for this purpose.  [34657]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20425w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 "Waste Strategy 2000" announced challenging targets to increase the amount of municipal waste recycled and composted in England and Wales. These targets are:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>To recycle or compost at least 25 per cent. of household waste by 2005
<P>
<BR>
To recycle or compost at least 30 per cent. of household waste by 2010.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="20425w01.html_para0">To ensure that local authorities contribute to achieving these targets, the Government have set Statutory Performance Standards for recycling and composting for individual authorities. These can be found in the Government's "Guidance on Municipal Waste Management Strategies", published in March 2001. Copies are available in the House of Commons Library and from the DEFRA website: www.defra.gov.uk/environment/ waste/management/guidance/mwms/index.htm
<P>

<a name="20425w01.html_para1">The Government have increased funding for the Environmental Protective and Cultural Services (EPCS) block, which includes waste management, by &#163;1.1 billion over the SR2000 period. There is also a ring-fenced fund 



<P>
<P><I>25 Apr 2002 : Column 378W</I><P>
of &#163;140 million for local authority recycling and &#163;220 million for waste Private Finance Initiative projects over the same period. Councils will also benefit from the &#163;40 million to the Waste and Resources Action Programme to overcome market barriers to reuse and recycling of waste.
<P>

<a name="20425w01.html_para2">Following a recent consultation on the &#163;140 million fund, DEFRA has opted for a selective distribution. At the end of March this year we issued guidelines and formally invited applications from local authorities. These guidelines can be downloaded from the DEFRA website at www.defra.gov.uk/environment/consult/wastefund/ index.htm.

 As DEFRA was created in June 2001 annual retrospective media expenditure analysis by territory location does not exist.
<P>

<a name="20425w01.html_para3">Since the formation of DEFRA our records show a total for centralised media publicity expenditure of &#163;2,589,289. This excludes expenditure relating to foot and mouth disease.

<a name="20425w01.html_wqn3"><B> Malcolm Bruce: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what steps have been taken by the Government since the Rio Earth Summit in 1992 to <i>(a)</i> set goals on environmental protection and <i>(b)</i> improve eco-efficiency and resource productivity relating to health and the environment issues; and what these (i) goals and (ii) improvements have been.

<P>
<a name="20425w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The Government set out its targets for safeguarding people's health and protecting the environment from air pollution in the Air Quality Strategy for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland in 1997 and revised in January 2000. It includes health-based standards for eight pollutants of main concern and objectives for their achievement between 2003 and 2008 together with objectives to be met by 2000 for the protection of vegetation and ecosystems. Good progress has been made towards achieving most of the targets as a result of the measures put in place by central Government and local authorities. We are, for example, broadly on track to meet our policy objectives for carbon monoxide, benzene, 1,3 butadiene, lead and sulphur dioxide, but we will need to do more to meet our targets for nitrogen dioxide, particles and ozone. We have met the objectives for vegetation and ecosystems. The strategy is kept under continuous review and last year we consulted on proposals to tighten several of the current objectives and to add a further objective.
<P>

<a name="20425w01.html_para6">The Government have successfully negotiated and adopted various agreements, both with our partners in Europe and internationally, which will reduce emissions of harmful substances to the air. We are committed to meeting all of the mandatory limit values prescribed by EU legislation. To comply with the EC Directive on Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC) the UK Government passed the Pollution Prevention and Control (England and Wales) regulations which came into force on 1 August 2000, under the Pollution Prevention and Control Act 1999. Separate arrangements apply the IPPC Directive to Scotland, Northern Ireland and the offshore oil and gas industries.
<P>

<a name="20425w01.html_para7">IPPC applies an integrated environmental approach to the regulation of industrial activities. Emissions to aid, water (including discharge to sewer) and land, plus a range of other environmental effects (including noise, vibration and odour) must be considered together. IPPC aims to conserve energy, prevent emissions and waste production and, where not practicable, reduce them to acceptable levels. IPPC also takes the integrated approach beyond the initial task of permitting, through to the restoration of sites when industrial activities cease.
<P>

<a name="20425w01.html_para8">On resource productivity the Government commissioned a major study headed by the Cabinet Office Performance and Innovation Unit. Its recent report, "Resource Productivity: Making more with less", identifies the scope for significant environmental and business benefits. We are committed to following up the report, which includes recommendations on establishing a long-term strategy with indicative targets, policy to encourage innovation in sustainable technologies, and action to integrate sustainable development objectives with the business of Government procurement.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20425w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 We have supported pilot schemes in the London boroughs of Newham and Lewisham in which the local authority was given DVLA's powers to wheelclamp and remove unlicensed vehicles after 24 hours. The

London borough of Wandsworth joined the scheme on 23 April. We announced the extension of the scheme nationally on 10 April.
<P>

<a name="20425w01.html_para9">In October 2001 we published a consultation document on measures to remove abandoned and untaxed vehicles from the streets more quickly and, for the longer term, bring forward changes to vehicle registration and licensing procedures to ensure greater accuracy of DVLA's vehicle record.
<P>

<a name="20425w01.html_para10">Regulations to reduce the statutory notice periods after which local authorities can remove abandoned vehicles and the storage periods for unlicensed vehicles were laid before the House on 19 March and came into force on 9 April.
<P>

<a name="20425w01.html_para11">Kent police piloted a "blitz" approach (Operation Cubit) on abandoned vehicles in the Medway area in co-operation with Kent county council, Medway council, DVLA and the Kent Fire Brigade for eight weeks in early 2001 and the Home Office has commissioned a detailed evaluation of the pilot which has been academically assessed and circulated to other stakeholders for comments, including the Kent police and Kent county council. It is hoped that it will be published in the near future.

 One Private Finance Initiative project, Brooklands Avenue Cambridge, has been subject to refinancing after the contract had been signed. The financial effect was to achieve a net present value saving to the Department of around &#163;515,000 over 15 years, which represents a broadly equitable share of the potential refinancing gain.

 In the domestic sector our most up to date estimate of the change in overall energy efficiency is that it improved by 1 per cent. per annum over the period 1995&#150;2000.
<P>

<a name="20425w02.html_para3">For industry and commerce, energy consumption statistics are collected by fuel but not by end use, so indicators are available only for overall energy consumption. No direct measure exists of "energy efficiency" changes for industry as a whole. However, changes in "energy intensity" (ie energy per unit of output) are routinely published by DTI <sup>1</sup> . These are the result of both efficiency changes and structural ones (eg from changing product mix within an industry). Estimates of changes in energy efficiency can be derived from these data and have been calculated up to 1998 for industry. Over the period 1990 to 1998, we estimate an average annual improvement in energy efficiency of about 0.6 per cent. per annum was achieved in industry.

<a name="20425w02.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 Management of the crops in the Farm Scale Evaluations is undertaken by the farmer hosting each individual trial, with SCIMAC (Supply Chain Initiative on Modified Agricultural Crops) providing advice in relation to the GM crops. As herbicide use is the key factor in the research, this aspect of the crop management is covered by the following protocol:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>Protocol on herbicide use for the Farm Scale Evaluations</i></FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>1. SCIMAC (Supply Chain Initiative on Modified Agricultural Crops) will not offer advice to farmers on management of the non-GM part of experimental fields. This will be carried out by the farmer's own adviser and recorded in detail, as is required under pesticide usage regulations.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>2. SCIMAC will provide advice through an agronomist to farmers about herbicide and related management for the GM herbicide-tolerant crops. The agronomist will make a recommendation about the application rate and timing of the herbicide to provide cost-effective weed control. SCIMAC will provide draft detailed herbicide application information in addition to the label on the herbicide container, and provide the necessary amount of the herbicide to the farmers.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>3. Farmers will provide their rationale for recommended herbicide usage in the non-GM part of each study field. SCIMAC's agronomist will provide their rationale for recommended herbicide usage in the GM part of each study field. Farmers will provide a report of actual herbicide use in both the GM and non-GM parts of each study field. All this information will be submitted to the independent research consortium carrying out the FSE study, thereby allowing a comparison of the agronomist's advice with actual herbicide usage and thus substantiating whether or not cost-effective weed control has been met.</FONT></UL>
<P>

<a name="20425w02.html_para5">The independent Scientific Steering Committee overseeing the FSE programme has approved this protocol as being appropriate for cost-effective weed control. The independent team carry out the FSE research audit as to whether cost-effective weed control has been practised by analysing herbicide application records, the weed burden at each trial site and records of crop yield. My Department does not have this management data, but it is planned to make relevant details publicly available at the end of the FSE programme when the research results are published. I can confirm that glufosinate ammonium is the only herbicide being used on the GM maize in the FSE trials.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20425w03.html_wqn0"><B> John Barrett: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (1) what action the Government are taking to tackle global illegal trade in wildlife;  [51270]
<P>
<UL>(2) what assessment the Government have made of the impact illegal wildlife trade is having on endangered species; and if she will make a statement.  [51269]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20425w03.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The UK was one of the first countries to ratify the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). The convention is implemented throughout the European Community through EU regulations by means of a system of licensing, to ensure that any trade is carried out at levels which species populations can sustain. Populations of endangered species and levels of trade are under continuous review, and the degree of protection afforded to particular species (which can include a complete ban on all trade) can be changed as a result.
<P>

<a name="20425w03.html_para0">Specimens of some endangered species command high prices on the illegal market. There is a huge incentive to evade trade controls and examples of illegal imports which have been intercepted by HM Customs and Excise are well-documented. It is difficult to assess the full scale of the illegal wildlife trade and thus the impact on species conservation, but reports published by the CITES Secretariat, Interpol, and by respected scientists and other conservation experts show that these are matters which we must continue to take very seriously indeed.
<P>

<a name="20425w03.html_para1">The UK has a good record of CITES enforcement. HM Customs and Excise Wildlife and Endangered Species Officers (including the internationally respected CITES Enforcement Team at Heathrow airport) and Police Wildlife Liaison Officers are at the sharp end of wildlife law enforcement and work with great commitment and determination. This has led to a number of successful prosecutions, including one resulting in a custodial sentence of six and a half years for the illegal import of certain birds. The Partnership for Action Against Wildlife Crime&#151;a multi agency organisation comprising the main Government Departments, statutory enforcement agencies and voluntary organisations with an interest in wildlife law enforcement issues&#151;works hard to support the networks of police and customs officers at the strategic level. In addition, our major information campaign "Souvenir Alert" increases awareness of CITES controls among the general public. The campaign is aimed at tourists who may unwittingly bring back from their travels souvenirs made from endangered species. Over the past six months we have distributed a quarter of a million leaflets publicising the campaign, which has attracted considerable media and public interest.

 Agriculture in Herefordshire, as elsewhere, is made up of a large number of different types of businesses, many of them small businesses. Depending on their individual circumstances, many may benefit from the budget measures offering help to small firms. The freeze in fuel duty and vehicle excise duty levels will also benefit agricultural businesses, as may the reduction in duty on cider. Many agricultural workers and farming families will benefit from the working tax credit and the child tax credit.

There was no need for the UK Government to raise any issues of particular concern to the Scottish Executive. On the third point, it is the responsibility of the European Committee of the Scottish Parliament to scrutinise the Scottish Executive's involvement in preparations for EU Council meetings. These arrangements are a matter for the Committee and the Scottish Executive. The Department provides information to Scottish Executive officials as part of that process.

<P>
<a name="20425w03.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 24 April 2002]:</i> The UK Climate Change Programme and Third National Communication under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change were published in November 2000 and October 2001 respectively. These set out the policies by which the UK will meet its Kyoto commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 12.5 per cent. relative 1990 levels over the period 2008&#150;2012, and move towards our domestic goal of a 20 per cent. reduction in carbon dioxide relative to 1990 by 2010.




<P>
<P><I>25 Apr 2002 : Column 387W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="20425w03.html_para5">Actual emissions in 1997 were estimated to be 152.5 million tonnes of carbon (MtC), or about 7 per cent. below the level in 1990. In 2000 (the most recent year for which final data are available) carbon dioxide had fallen by a further 0.4 MtC, but provisional 2001 data show an increase of 1.9 MtC. This increase reflects higher power station emissions (plus 4.1 MtC relative to 1997), colder outside temperatures (plus 2.1 MtC) and trends elsewhere in the economy (minus 4.2 MtC). The increase in power station emissions is due to gas price fluctuations, and colder outside temperatures increased demand on space heating requirements. We do not expect longer term trends to be affected, particularly since trends elsewhere in the economy are tending to reduce emissions. Our estimated reductions set out in the UK Climate Change Programme and the Third National Communication are therefore unchanged.

 A "general orientation", now more often known as a "general approach", is an indication of the formal position the Council might take at a later stage.

 To date, only London has a directly elected mayor, first elected in May 2000 with a turnout of 34.4 per cent. The mayor has wide powers with regard to setting the strategic direction for London and in particular with regards to transport, economic development and regeneration.
<P>

<a name="20425w05.html_para0">Referendum results have supported the introduction of directly elected executive mayors in eight English local authorities and on 2 May 2002 there will be a further five mayoral referendums. Of those eight local authorities, seven are holding their first mayoral election on 2 May 2002 and one on 17 October 2002. These executive mayors will lead their councils and, to the extent each local authority's constitution provides, will be in charge of their council's services.

 <i>[holding answer 22 April 2002]:</i> The UK, as the member state, is represented by a member of the UK Government. It is not normal practice for a Minister from a devolved Administration to join the delegation, nor were there any from any other EU country on this occasion. The devolved Administrations are involved before Council meetings in developing the UK position, which will as necessary reflect matters of particular concern to one or all of the devolved Administrations.

The average Band D council tax does not therefore allow a comparison to be made of the average amounts of council tax payable by people in different areas.

The study reported in April 2001. The executive summary is on the DTLR website at www.local-transport.dtlr.gov.uk/schooltravel/cogdev/ index.htm and has been placed in the Libraries of the House.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions what consideration he has given to the proposals submitted to him by local authorities in East Lancashire to tackle the problem of run-down and abandoned housing in the region.  [50684]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20425w06.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 The East Lancashire Housing Forum submitted in December 2001 a proposed programme to tackle the problem of low demand and abandoned housing in the area. The Government is considering the proposal in the context of the spending review, along with the proposal from various northern housing bodies for a housing market renewal fund.
<P>

<a name="20425w06.html_para0">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State announced on 10 April that nine areas where the problems of low demand housing are most acute, of which East Lancashire is one, were being invited to work with Government to establish pathfinder projects to tackle low demand. Their aim will be to provide lasting solutions for communities blighted by derelict homes through investment and innovation. They will do this by developing a strategic approach for regenerating their sub-regional housing markets that will bring together key stakeholders, inform future investment, and test out new and innovative approaches to combating low demand.
<P>

<a name="20425w06.html_para1">A key element of the pathfinder projects' approach will be a unified agenda. Experience shows that it is not sufficient to tackle the housing problem alone. Local authorities must work closely together with their

<P>

<a name="20425w06.html_para2">Low demand and abandoned housing is a major problem. But it also provides a unique opportunity to restructure and rebuild our cities for the twenty-first century. We must now seize that opportunity. The Government will work with local people to deliver the change necessary and bring hope to those communities.

In the light of those recommendations we aim to decide on the way forward with the scheme over the summer.

 The guidance issued to local authorities on the Rural Bus Challenge scheme already makes clear that the term "bus" will be broadly interpreted to cover a broad range of road-based public transport. It can include for example projects involving taxi buses or shared taxis and a number of such schemes have been supported with Challenge funding.

 We are making available over &#163;4.2 billion for further education in 2002&#150;03, a 3 per cent. real terms increase. We are looking to the current spending review to deliver the resources we need to meet the Government's ambitions for further education in 2003&#150;04 and beyond.

<P>
<a name="20425w08.html_spnew8"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 Further education plays a key role in driving forward growth in participation and achievement, by providing high quality vocational and academic routes. This year we are investing over &#163;4.2 billion in further education, a 3 per cent. real terms increase on last year and this will enable the Learning and Skills Council to fund a 2.9 per cent. growth in full-time equivalent students in the sector. The Council has recently submitted a report to the Government on its plans for widening participation and we will be working jointly with the LSC to implement this.

 This Government recognise the vital importance of improving adult basic skills. Since Skills for Life, our national strategy, was launched last year, we have made significant progress. This includes piloting a number of new initiatives, including one in my hon. Friend's constituency, to determine what works best in helping adults improve their skills. Participation by adults in basic skills courses is increasing and from April to October 2001 over 91,000 adults improved their skills.

<P>
<a name="20425w09.html_spnew0"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 The Higher Education Funding Council for England has consulted on its plans to ensure sufficient supply and demand for higher education over the rest of the decade, based on a through analysis of trends over the past 20 years. The latest data from the University and Colleges Admissions Service indicate an increase in applications in 2002 compared with last year, a welcome step towards our 50 per cent. target by 2010.

<P>
<a name="20425w09.html_spnew1"><B> Margaret Hodge </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 17 April 2002]:</i> We are determined to widen access as we expand numbers. The latest UCAS figures show a 9.5 per cent. increase in the number of mature students from the UK who entered higher education in September 2001 and UCAS has reported a 4.6 per cent. increase in the number of mature applicants from the UK for September 2002.
<P>

<a name="20425w09.html_para0">We have put a number of initiatives in place, including foundation degrees which are new vocational qualifications to address the skills gap, as well as New Technology Institutes which are being set up in each English region. They are partnerships between higher education (HE), further education (FE) and business to provide specialist information and communication technology (ICT) and other high technology learning programmes. We are also developing new ways to access higher education through the "e-Universities" project, which will provide the flexibility many mature students need.
<P>

<a name="20425w09.html_para1">In addition we have provided substantial extra resources for mature students including a child care grant, travel, books and equipment grant and access bursaries for student parents. A single parent with two young children can now get over &#163;16,000 with full student loan and other grants. Our measures have contributed towards the welcome increase in mature student numbers.
<P>

<a name="20425w09.html_para2">Institutions receive a funding premium for all students aged 25 and over in recognition of the additional cost of supporting such students. We are also encouraging the important role that FE has to play in delivering HE, where FE colleges are already significant providers. They offer degree and other provision to wider groups, many of whom are mature students who may not be able to attend a university but can attend the local college.

 London allowances for teachers increased by 30 per cent. last year, and by a further 3.5 per cent. this April. The allowance for a teacher in inner London is now &#163;3,105. London teachers will also benefit from shortening of the main pay scale from 9 points to 6, which will mean more rapid progression to the threshold. Assimilation to this new scale will mean significant benefits for many teachers from 1 September this year. For example, an inner London teacher now on &#163;25,911 will receive &#163;28,818 on the new scale&#151;a basic pay increase of over 11 per cent., in addition to the 3.5 per cent. received on 1 April this year.
<P>

<a name="20425w09.html_para3">For post-threshold classroom teachers in inner London, salaries are now at &#163;30,966 before any additions for management responsibilities or recruitment and retention allowances.

Our plans for the new qualifications will depend on the findings of the consultation.

 The Department has not carried out its own assessment of sports facilities in secondary schools, but as part of the data collected from local education authorities' asset management plans, the Department has some information on the suitability of internal PE spaces. It also has some information on external sports areas and school playing fields, which is currently being appraised. Depending on the reliability of the information, we plan to publish analyses later in the year to provide a basis for benchmarking.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20425w10.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 Our target is for all children with special educational needs (SEN) to receive excellent provision which meets their needs. Maintained schools are under a duty to use their best endeavours to make the special educational provision children's learning difficulties call for, including children with autistic spectrum disorders. Teachers have a crucial role in 



<P>
<P><I>25 Apr 2002 : Column 412W</I><P>
meeting this duty. As part of the continuous improvement we seek in teaching standards, we want to see the support given by teachers to children with special educational needs (SEN), including those with autistic spectrum disorder, brought up to the standards of the best throughout the country and in all schools. Ofsted has a regular cycle of inspection of maintained schools, non-maintained special schools and independent schools which cater wholly or mainly for children with SEN, including schools which make provision for children with autistic spectrum disorders. In determining their judgments Ofsted inspectors have to consider the extent to which pupils with SEN are making progress and how well the teaching meets pupils' diverse needs.
<P>

<a name="20425w10.html_para2">As part of their initial teacher training, all student teachers must show that they understand their responsibilities under the SEN Code of Practice, and know how to seek advice. During induction teachers must demonstrate that they can plan effectively to meet the needs of pupils with SEN. &#163;91 million of supported expenditure is available under the SEN category of the Department's Standards Fund. Training is an important sub-head under this category and training in autism is specifically mentioned in guidance on the SEN category as something which local education authorities (LEAs) may wish to support. Grant support has also been made available to voluntary organisations and higher education training providers to create new training opportunities and, again, autistic spectrum disorders are mentioned in the bidding criteria.
<P>

<a name="20425w10.html_para3">The forthcoming publication of guidance from the Department's Autism Working Group will further raise teachers' awareness of the disorder. The guidance will emphasise the benefits of staff who come into contact with children with autistic spectrum disorders having an understanding of the condition. The guidance will help schools and LEAs to make best use of the increasing resources available annually for the education of school children when making provision for children with autistic spectrum disorders. Currently more than &#163;23 billion is available for the education of children in school of which over &#163;1 billion is used by LEAs to provide additional support for children with SEN and some &#163;1.9 billion is identified by LEAs as notionally allocated in schools' budgets towards meeting children's SEN. The guidance will emphasise the benefits of LEAs collecting data on the numbers of children with autistic spectrum disorders. The Department is also examining whether data on different types of SEN could be collected, probably from January 2004. At present there are 12 commonly used categories of SEN. These categories include pupils with autistic spectrum disorders and this would be one of the categories we are likely to collect.

The amount available to students through student loans has increased under the loan-based support system introduced in August 1998. So the average debt of a borrower with a new income-contingent loan entering repayment status in April 2002 has increased and is estimated to be some &#163;6,100. Repayments of income- contingent loans will be linked to graduates' income after leaving higher education so they repay only when their income exceeds the threshold of &#163;10,000 per annum. Interest on student loans is linked to inflation so that borrowers repay, in real terms, only the amount borrowed. The data are not available by social class.

By the end of 2002 there will be over 6,000 UK online centres throughout England with access points in public libraries, colleges, local community centres and elsewhere. Older people are one of the key client groups for this initiative. In addition there are over 1,600 learndirect centres, which along with FE colleges and adult and community learning centres, offer opportunities for older learners to improve their ICT skills.

 The Crown Prosecution Service does not hold this information centrally. However, what I can say is that in relation to persistent young offenders annual figures for 2001 show that the pledge, to halve the time from arrest to sentence, was met, including the last three consecutive months.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20425w12.html_spmin3"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 The principal aim of the youth justice system is to prevent offending by children and young people. The Crown Prosecution Service is responsible for most youth prosecutions in England and Wales and prosecutes all youth cases according to the aim and principles set out in the Code for Crown Prosecutors.
<P>

<a name="20425w12.html_para2">A youth will be prosecuted if a Crown Prosecutor is satisfied that there is sufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction and that the public interest requires a prosecution, irrespective of the type of offence that has been committed. Crown Prosecutors must consider the interests of a child or young person when deciding whether the public interest requires a prosecution but should not avoid prosecuting simply on the basis of the age of the offender. The seriousness and prevalence of the offence and the youth's past behaviour are recognised factors in favour of prosecution.
<P>

<a name="20425w12.html_para3">Youths who admit an offence and have not previously been convicted of an offence will usually not be prosecuted but will be reprimanded or warned by the police. This system of reprimands and final warnings was introduced by the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 and is designed to stop offending at an early stage and enables a young person to take part in a rehabilitation programme. The police have issued a matrix of "gravity factors" which is used to assess the appropriate action to be taken with reference to the seriousness of the offence under consideration and the offender's previous record.
<P>

<a name="20425w12.html_para4">"Car related crime" is a wide term that covers a range of offences of varying seriousness. Therefore, offences of car related crime will be graded at different levels of seriousness within the police guidelines, leading to different decisions concerning the appropriate way to proceed depending on the seriousness of the offence and the circumstances of the youth offender involved.

<a name="20425w12.html_spmin4"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 The key to reporting rape is the confidence that the victim has that the criminal justice system will take the allegation seriously. That involves concerted action by the criminal justice system as a whole in the investigation and prosecution of rape. One of the important issues in the appropriate referral of cases by police to the CPS is early legal advice to police preferably before charge.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20425w12.html_spmin5"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 Each case which the police send to the Crown Prosecution Service&#151;involving an allegation of incitement to racial hatred&#151;is reviewed by a Crown Prosecutor. All cases are carefully considered to make sure that they meet the tests set out in the Code for Crown Prosecutors.
<P>

<a name="20425w12.html_para5">There are two stages in the decision to prosecute. The first stage is the evidential test. The Crown Prosecutor must be satisfied that there is enough evidence to provide a "realistic prospect of conviction". He must consider objectively whether the evidence can be used and is reliable. The Crown Prosecutor must also consider what the defence case may be and how it is likely to affect the prosecution case. A "realistic prospect of conviction" means that a jury or bench of magistrates, properly directed in accordance with the law, is more likely than not to convict the defendant of the charge alleged.
<P>

<a name="20425w12.html_para6">If the case does not pass the evidential test, it must not go ahead, no matter how important or serious it may be. Ordinarily, if the case does pass the evidential test, the Crown Prosecutor must then consider the second stage test to decide if a prosecution is needed in the public interest. In cases of any seriousness, a prosecution will usually take place, unless there are public interest factors tending against prosecution which clearly outweigh those tending in favour. The Crown Prosecution Service will start or continue a prosecution only when the case has passed both tests.
<P>

<a name="20425w12.html_para7">However, offences brought under Part III of the Public Order Act require the Attorney General's consent to prosecute&#151;so whether or not the public interest requires a prosecution is a matter for the Attorney-General.

 The Government are committed to strengthening stability and security in central and eastern Europe, the Caucasus and central Asia by offering assistance with defence and security sector reform. The Outreach programme was launched by the Ministry of Defence in the early 1990s to engage the 27 countries of the former Warsaw pact, the former Soviet Union and the former Yugoslavia in defence cooperation relationships.

 The United Kingdom does not earmark specific forces for peacekeeping operations, but under the UN's standby arrangements system, designed to facilitate the rapid deployment of forces once political decisions have been made, we have declared a range of forces with information on capabilities and readiness. We announced, as part of the Strategic Defence Review, our intention to declare the full range of our rapidly deployable forces, additional strategic lift and logistics capabilities as potentially available to the UN. This new declaration was incorporated into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) which the Government signed with the UN in June 1999.
<P>

<a name="20425w13.html_para3">The MOU makes it clear that we would be prepared to consider the provision of forces up to a full brigade size to meet the specific needs of a UN operation. It is not possible to say precisely which of the forces listed in the MOU are available at any one time. The exact availability of the forces for peacekeeping depends on a range of factors, not least other continuing and known future commitments. The decision to commit United Kingdom forces to any UN operation will continue to be a national one.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will make a further statement on the mistaken taxation of Army attributable pensions.  [53048]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20425w14.html_spnew7"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 Since my statement to the House on 23 January 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 891&#150;902, the Armed Forces Personnel Administration Agency has been conducting a review to establish more clearly the exact extent of the problem with the mistaken taxation of service invaliding and attributable pensions. This work is not complete, but has revealed that some Royal Navy invaliding and attributable pensions awarded between 1973 and 1999 have also been mistakenly taxed. We will be reviewing all the case files of those who might have been affected and arranging for refunds to be made as appropriate. This will be done as quickly as possible but is expected to take some months given the need to review several thousand pension files. We will also be providing appropriate national publicity to allow those who think they might have a claim to apply for a tax refund.
<P>

<a name="20425w14.html_para3">Our research has not so far revealed any cases where Royal Air Force pensions were wrongly taxed and there is evidence that the RAF has had in place checks which would have uncovered cases where attributable pensions should have been exempt from tax. However, we will include the RAF in our continuing work to ensure that no error is left unidentified.
<P>

<a name="20425w14.html_para4">Our further work to date has confirmed that the problem was more extensive than originally understood but has also shown the complexity of the issues involved as, over time, changes have been made to the organisations responsible for administering the pensions and to the rules governing the schemes. We have therefore concluded that we should set up an internal review, completely independent of the staffs involved, to establish the precise extent of the current problems and to expose any other problems that may exist. This independent review will look across all three services, be launched as soon as possible and is likely to take a number of months to complete. The review team will be headed up by a senior civil servant and consist of staff drawn from the Defence Internal Audit. In order to provide external confidence, the NAO will be invited to validate the procedures. I will report the findings to the House.

<a name="20425w15.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Nicholas Brown: </B> 
 The Department for Work and Pensions was formed in June 2001 from the former Department of Social Security and parts of the Department for Education and Employment. We are currently undertaking a fundamental overhaul of the welfare system, transforming it from a passive organisation paying out benefits to an active system that fights poverty, creates opportunity and helps people become self-sufficient and independent. This is making a significant contribution to the Government's overall objectives of:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>eradicating child poverty in 20 years, and halving it within 10;
<P>
<BR>
promoting work as the best form of welfare for people of working age while protecting the position of those in greatest need; and
<P>
<BR>
combating poverty and promoting security and independence in retirement for today's and future pensioners.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="20425w15.html_para3">Child benefit is now worth &#163;15.75 a week for the eldest child and &#163;10.55 a week for other children: nationally about 7 million families receive child benefit, and in Bristol, East 11,455 families benefit.
<P>

<a name="20425w15.html_para4">The number of people in work is at historically high levels of over 28.2 million. Nearly three quarters of working age people are in employment and in Bristol, East the proportion in employment currently stands at 76.3 per cent. Unemployment is at levels last seen in the early 1970s. Our New Deals have helped lone parents, the young unemployed, the long-term unemployed, disabled people, the over-50s and partners of the unemployed to 



<P>
<P><I>25 Apr 2002 : Column 429W</I><P>
move from benefit into work. Nationally well over 600,000 people have been helped into work by the New Deals and in Bristol, East over 1,300 have been helped into work.
<P>

<a name="20425w15.html_para5">Older people are disproportionately affected by fuel poverty. This winter (2001&#150;02) we have made available a winter fuel payment of &#163;200 for each eligible household to help with their heaviest fuel bill. We estimate that around 16,600 older people in Bristol, East will have received a payment this winter.
<P>

<a name="20425w15.html_para6">We want all pensioners to have a decent and secure income in retirement and to share fairly in the rising prosperity of the country. Our first priority has been to help the poorest pensioners.
<P>

<a name="20425w15.html_para7">From this April we will be spending an extra &#163;6 billion a year in real terms on pensioners as a result of our policies. This includes &#163;2.5 billion more on the poorest third of pensioners.
<P>

<a name="20425w15.html_para8">3,000 pensioner families in Bristol, East are receiving the minimum income guarantee which helps our poorest pensioners. Some 15,300 pensioners in Bristol, East will benefit from this year's increases in the basic state pension of &#163;3 a week for single pensioners and &#163;4.80 for couples. Those over 75, of whom we estimate there are about 7,300 in Bristol, East, may qualify for free TV licences.
<P>

<a name="20425w15.html_para9">Other reforms include the new pension credit in 2003 designed to ensure that pensioners benefit from their savings and the introduction of the state second pension from this April. Both of these initiatives will help provide greater security for tomorrow's pensioners. We have also announced that from October 2003 benefits currently reduced after a hospital stay of 6 weeks will not be reduced until 13 weeks. This will benefit both pensioners and people of working age.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. All figures are estimates and are taken from the Family Resources Survey (FRS). 2000&#150;01 is the latest year for which data are available.<P>

2. A pensioner unit is a single person or couple living as married and any dependent children where the head of the benefit unit is over state pension age.<P>

3. The estimates are based on sample counts that have been adjusted for non-response and using multi-purpose grossing factors that control for tenure, council tax band and a number of demographic variables. Estimates are subject to sampling error and to variability in non-response.<P>





4. Questions on assets are a sensitive part of the FRS questionnaire and have relatively low level of response. Evidence suggests some under reporting of capital by respondents.<P>

5. The numbers are rounded to the nearest 0.1 million.<P>

The group's terms of reference are to consider and report to Ministers on what assistance might be given on release to ex-prisoners who successfully appeal against conviction and how that assistance might best be delivered within the available budget. No target date was set for the report but the working group is due to report to Ministers shortly. The group commissioned an independent scoping study to inform its work, which identified and canvassed views from a number of interested parties. After consideration of the scoping study the working group decided that a pilot project was appropriate. As there is no procurement exercise or competition for service delivery during the pilot phase, expressions of interest have not been invited. However, it has always been open to those who wish to contribute views to send them direct to the Home Office.

<P>
<a name="20425w18.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Bob Ainsworth: </B> 
 The information is not available in the form requested. Drug rehabilitation programmes form only part of a wider range of drug treatment interventions. During 1997&#150;2001 they were funded through a number of mainstream community care funds from which it is impossible to ascertain exact amounts.
<P>

<a name="20425w18.html_para0">Since 2001, however, they have been financed through the (ring-fenced) pooled treatment budget together with some mainstream funds. In 2000&#150;01 the Pooled Treatment budget amounted to &#163;234 million. This expanded in 2001&#150;02 to &#163;328 million.

 <i>[holding answer 17 April 2002]:</i> The European Court of Human Rights (the Court) found the United Kingdom in breach of Articles 2 and 13 of the European Convention on Human Rights in the case of Christopher Edwards who was murdered by his cell-mate, Richard Linford, in Chelmsford prison in November 1994.
<P>

<a name="20425w18.html_para1">The Court found breaches of Article 2 in respect of the circumstances of Mr. Edwards' death (the failure of various agencies to pass on information about Mr. Linford's mental health and the inadequate health screen given to Mr. Linford at the prison) and the failure to provide an effective investigation. They ruled that there had been a breach of Article 13 due to the lack of an effective remedy available to Christopher's family either through an effective investigation or the payment of compensation.
<P>

<a name="20425w18.html_para2">Mr. Edward's death was the subject of an independent investigation commissioned by the Prison Services and other agencies. The Court has not ordered a further investigation. Although it considered that there were defects, the investigation was regarded by the Court as having been thorough and useful. The Court found that the family were not eligible for compensation under United Kingdom civil law and awarded the sum of &#163;20,000 plus costs (a further &#163;20,000) by way of redress.
<P>

<a name="20425w18.html_para3">The Court recognised the changes that have taken place since Mr. Edwards's death. These include introduction of the Prison Escort Record completed before a prisoner enters a Prison Service establishment and improved health care screening. The system of investigating deaths in Prison Service custody is currently under review as part of the Service's new suicide prevention strategy.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department (1) what assessment he has made of whether there is an incentive in prisons for prisoners to switch from using drugs that remain in the body for a long period to other substances;  [51581]
<P>
<UL>(2) pursuant to his answer of 11 April 2002, <i>Official Report,</i> column 567W, what assessment he has made of the reasons for the fall in the detection of cannabis use among prisoners by the mandatory drug testing programme.  [51580]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20425w18.html_spnew7"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 Mandatory drug testing (MDT) figures show that, overall, drug misuse in prisons has declined significantly over the past five years. The statistics suggest that much of this decline has been down to reductions in the use of cannabis, with opiate use static. Deterrence, supply reduction and treatment have been the key elements of the Prison Service's drug strategy and the decline in MDT rates gives evidence of its success.
<P>

<a name="20425w18.html_para4">Available research evidence does not support the assertion that prisoners have switched from cannabis to other drugs which can only be detected for a shorter period. The Prison Service is continuing to look at this issue. The Institute of Psychiatry and the Office for National Statistics are currently reviewing the MDT programme, including the issue of switching. Their findings are expected in May 2002.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20425w18.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Bob Ainsworth </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 19 April 2002]:</i> If a decision to change classification is taken an Order in Council is needed to change the classification, under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971, of any controlled drug. Such an Order is subject to the draft affirmative resolution procedure. The draft Order has to be debated in each House, and approved, then submitted to a meeting of the Privy Council for approval and signature.

<P>

<a name="20425w18.html_para5">Between October 2000 and February 2002, 1,519 Drugs Treatment and Testing Orders (DTTOs) have been revoked by the Courts for unacceptable failure to comply. This represents 27 per cent. of the 5,609 orders made during the period.

To ask the Secretary of State for Wales what action he is taking to ensure that in future Wales is allocated a greater share of Strategic Rail Authority funding.  [35636]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20425w19.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Paul Murphy: </B> 
 Allocation of such funding is a matter for the Strategic Rail Authority. To assist the Strategic Rail Authority in delivering the 10-year transport plan targets, the Government are providing it with an extra &#163;155 million over the next two years. I will shortly be meeting Richard Bowker, Chairman of the Strategic Rail Authority, and will be discussing their Strategic Plan, and in particular the Welsh dimension.
<P>

<a name="20425w19.html_para3">Welsh travellers will benefit from investment in improved rail links outside Wales, just as those from elsewhere in the UK will benefit from investment in Wales. In these circumstances a simple population share division of investment could be disadvantageous to rail travellers in Wales and I have no intention of pressing the SRA to adopt such an approach.
<P>

<a name="20425w19.html_para4">The Assembly also has a close working relationship with the Strategic Rail Authority, well beyond the formal requirement in the Transport Act which requires that the Strategic Rail Authority consult the Assembly on its strategies relating to Wales.

 <i>[holding answer 18 April 2002]:</i> The personal injury pre-action protocol was published in January 1999 and came into force from 26 April 1999. Some minor amendments were introduced in June 2000 following suggestions from the personal injury protocol working party. The amendments were aimed at clarifying various elements, such as the scope of the protocol, rather than substantive changes.

 Legislation for the Community Investment Tax Credit is being brought forward in the Finance Bill. The scheme will come into force as soon as possible after state aids approval is obtained.
<P>

<a name="20425w21.html_para4">The scheme will offer tax relief to individual and corporate investors who make qualifying investments, through intermediaries, in enterprises in disadvantaged communities. The intermediaries must be accredited as Community Development Finance Institutions (CDFIs) under the rules of the scheme. CDFIs provide capital and technical assistance to businesses and social enterprises in disadvantaged communities that find it difficult to access mainstream commercial finance. Qualifying investments are debt or equity investments made for a minimum period of five years.
<P>

<a name="20425w21.html_para5">The amount of the tax relief is 5 per cent. of the amount invested for the tax year (or accounting period for a corporate investor) in which an investment which qualifies for the scheme is made, and for each of the following four years or periods, making a total of 25 per cent. of the amount of the investment in all. The tax relief is set against the investor's income tax or corporation tax liability as appropriate. So for example, an individual investing &#163;10,000 in an accredited CDFI for at least five years could obtain a reduction in their income tax liability of &#163;500 for the tax year in which the investment was made and for each of the four following years, making a total tax reduction of &#163;2,500 over five years.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20425w21.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The VAT default surcharge system is the only fully automated system within Customs and Excise for applying fines for late payments. During 2000&#150;01, penalties totalling &#163;87 million were paid by businesses who were late paying tax declared on VAT returns.

These figures mean that the Government are on track to meet the target of increasing the number of drug misusers in treatment by 100 per cent. by 2008. The Government are of course aware of the negative impact that refusal of planning permission locally could have on the Government's aim of increasing the number of drug misusers accessing treatment.
<P>

<a name="20425w24.html_para2">Local authorities are autonomous bodies, accountable to their electorates, and the Government do not routinely comment on, or intervene in, their day-to-day administration of the planning system. Nor would it be appropriate for a Minister to comment on the merits of an individual planning decision, because of the appellate role of the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions. It is for the local planning authority to assess each planning proposal on its individual merits, in the light of the authority's development plan and of any other considerations material to planning.

<a name="20425w24.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 There are no national plans to introduce the provision of light-weight anti-stab vests for front line ambulance personnel. The use of anti-stab vests is something local managers in ambulance trusts need to consider after undertaking a thorough assessment of the risk faced by their staff, and the need for this type of protective wear.
<P>

<a name="20425w24.html_para3">The London Ambulance NHS Trust has recently piloted the use of anti-stab vests at two ambulance stations. The evaluation of the pilots was positive, and this information is being shared with all other NHS ambulance trusts.

 Since 1997&#150;98 we have spent around &#163;5 million on research of relevance to spinal injuries. We also support a great deal of basic underpinning work on the structure and function of the nervous system; spend on this is not included in the figure above.
