 As part of a joint assistance strategy to Kenya, the Department for International Development (DFID), along with 16 other donors, has agreed to a division of labour to improve aid effectiveness. As a result, DFID is not planning to provide agricultural development assistance directly. DFID is, however, engaged in many related areas, such as food security, livestock insurance and pastoralist development. An example is the Hunger Safety Net Programme (£84 million 2007-2017), piloting innovative and secure ways of delivering cash to support 300,000 poor people by 2012. The small amounts of cash will allow people to buy food and diversify their livelihoods. Other support is planned for index-based livestock insurance, a drought management fund, 50,000 micro enterprises, and local community adaptation programmes.</p>

 The food security situation in Kenya has improved since last year's drought, following favourable rains in late 2009 and 2010. The Kenya Food Security Steering Group (KFSSG) reports that 1.2 million rural poor in the arid and semi-arid lands require assistance (down from 3.8 million in 2009). There is a risk that food security next year will deteriorate in eastern and south-eastern parts of the country due to uneven rains in March to June 2010 and predicted below-average rains in 2011 due to the impact of La Nina. Short-term food security has also improved among urban households, due in part to downward pressure on food prices, but the KFSSG still estimates that 3.5 million people in urban centres are food insecure.</p>

 The UK recently worked closely with European partners to adopt the EU's strongest ever sanctions package against Iran. While we do not encourage trade with Iran, these sanctions do not prohibit the sale of aviation fuel to Iranian airlines. The Government have written to fuel providers in the UK to clarify this fact. However, some companies in Europe have taken the commercial decision to stop providing fuel to Iranian airlines in line with their interpretation of US sanctions.</p>

 Economic mismanagement by the Iranian Government has been a major factor in domestic concern about economic issues. We are aware of sometimes significant increases in the cost of water, electricity, gas and some food products in Iran during 2010, although we have seen no uniform pattern across the country. The price of fuel has remained unchanged and it remains heavily subsidised.</p>

 Since October 2007, the average time taken by the Court of Protection to appoint a deputy with authority to access funds on behalf of a person who lacks capacity is 14 weeks against a service standard of 21 weeks.

Figures are given where the applicant/respondent's representative has been recorded or left blank. Therefore, it should be noted that parties without a recorded representative are not necessarily litigants in person.<br>
<i> Divorce:</i><br>
1. Figures include dissolutions of marriage or civil partnership and annulments of marriage or civil partnership.<br>
2. The duration is calculated from the earliest recorded petition date to the earliest recorded decree absolute date.<br>
3. Figures exclude cases where there is no record of a petition and cases where the decree absolute date is before the petition<br>
4. Time from petition to decree absolute may be affected by the time it takes the applicant to apply for the decree absolute once the decree nisi (first order) has been issued. In normal circumstances the applicant may apply for the decree absolute six weeks after the decree nisi has been issued, but (s)he may choose to wait longer than this.<br>
 5. The mean is the total of all of the durations, divided by the number of decrees absolute.<br>
<i> Public and Private Law:</i><br>
1. Private law refers to cases brought under the Children Act 1989 where two or more individuals, usually separated parents, are trying to resolve a private dispute about their child(ren). Public law refers to child welfare cases where a local authority, or other authorised person, is stepping in to protect a child from harm or neglect.<br>
2. Private law includes cases where a section 8 order (contact, residence, prohibited steps, specific issue) was made or where a parental responsibility order was made. Public law includes cases where a care order or a supervision order was made. This does not necessarily mean that these were the orders applied for.<br>
3. The durations in both case types are calculated from the earliest application date (or the date the case was transferred in to the court if that is earlier) to the date of the order event.<br>
4. A case is defined as applicant represented if at least one applicant in the case has a recorded representative. Similarly with respondents.<br>
5. The mean is the total of all of the durations, divided by the number of orders.<br>

<i> [holding answer 8 December 2010]:</i> Since 1999 DEFRA has invested over £11 million on research into badger vaccines. The first injectable badger vaccine was licensed in March 2010 and is available for use on prescription. It is being used in the Government funded badger vaccine deployment project, which began in July 2010, in an area in Gloucestershire.</p>

In total more than 3,900 applications have been received for the scheme, and Natural England are well on track to meet their target of 505,000 hectares of SDA land in uplands ELS agreements by March 2011.</p>

 There are 7,000 commons in England covering nearly 400,000 hectares. Natural England (NE) has a statutory role on virtually all commons.

There is therefore no need, nor provision, to enable a local authority to recover any costs incurred in processing such an application.

<i> [holding answer 8 December 2010]:</i> The secure disposal or re-use of new or nearly-new IT equipment is dependant upon the level of protectively marked material or personal data stored on the system. As our IT equipment is generally managed under contract by our IT service providers, they will manage the re-use or disposal according to central government security policies.

<i> [holding answer 1 December 2010]:</i> All maintained schools in England are part of the network of school sport partnerships. This includes all of the many schools that Ministers in the Department for Education have visited since May 2010. These visits will have been for a range of purposes: to see examples of good practice; to meet and talk to students and staff; and to witness schools in action at first hand. The purpose of these visits is quite categorically not to make assessments of these institutions; that is the role of Ofsted.</p>

<i>  [holding answer 1 December 2010]:</i> Since May 2010, the Secretary of State for Education has visited three schools with a specialism in sport: Harefield Academy in Hillingdon, City of London Academy in Southwark and Consett Community Sports College in Durham. The Secretary of State was very impressed with what he saw, as he is when he visits many schools in England. In particular, he was impressed with the way the schools were making maximum use of the freedoms afforded to them by their academy status to improve provision for their pupils, both within their sport specialism and across the whole curriculum.</p>

<i> [holding answer 29 November 2010]:</i> The Schools White Paper 2010, 'The Importance of Teaching', confirmed the importance the Government place on making the study of the three separate science subjects at GCSE accessible to all pupils. This includes exploring how schools delivering triple science might be recognised in the performance tables; the need to increase the number of specialist science teachers, for example, by providing financial incentives to attract the best graduates in shortage subjects such as the sciences into teaching; and improving the skills of existing science teachers. The level of support the Government will provide to enable wider participation in the three separate sciences at GCSE level is still subject to the more detailed outcome of the spending review and we will announce our plans as soon as that is finalised.</p>

 The Government do not undertake assessments as outlined in your question. However, the university of Derby has, earlier this year, published a review entitled "The University of Derby's Impact on the local Economy" which shows that the 'student pound' spent in the local area is estimated to be worth in excess of £30 million per year. The report also highlighted the university's use of local suppliers and contractors and that, both directly and indirectly, it was responsible for over 3,200 full time jobs in the area. The following link will take you to the relevant report which I hope you will find informative:</p>

 Any food obtained from cloned animals is regulated as a "novel food" under Regulation (EC) No 258/97<sup>(1)</sup>. According to this regulation, novel foods may not be marketed in the European Union without an authorisation. Applications for authorisation of novel foods are evaluated by national authorities against criteria of safety, nutritional quality and not misleading the consumer. The Food Standards Agency (FSA) is the competent authority for novel foods in the United Kingdom and advises that food obtained from the offspring of cloned animals also falls within the scope of Regulation (EC) 258/97.

 The Food Standards Agency (FSA) leads on government policy for the reduction of foodborne illness. Since its inception in 2000, the reduction of foodborne illness, including illness caused by campylobacter, has been one of the FSA's key objectives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_532"><a name="101213w0006.htm_para38"><a name="1012149001050">The FSA's policy on reducing the incidence of food poisoning caused by campylobacter is to reduce the levels of campylobacter in chicken as a priority. This is a priority because the handling, preparation and consumption of chicken may account for 20% to 30% of human cases of campylobacteriosis, while 50% to 80% may be attributed to the chicken reservoir as a whole. The FSA food chain analysis project, which looked at risk from primary production to retail, concluded that the greatest risk of campylobacter infection for people is from poultry meat, and hazards arise across the food chain that can result in the introduction of campylobacter into food.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_533"><a name="101213w0006.htm_para39"><a name="1012149001051">In order to reduce campylobacter, the FSA has developed a Campylobacter Risk Management Programme, which encompasses a range of Government/industry partnership led projects targeted at different points across the food chain and coordinated through a joint action plan. To measure progress on the effectiveness of our Campylobacter Risk Management Programme the FSA has agreed a new target with industry for the reduction in levels of campylobacter in United Kingdom produced raw chicken, to be achieved in a phased approach by April 2015. The target will be published in December 2010.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_534"><a name="101213w0006.htm_para40"><a name="1012149001052">The aim of the target is to reduce the levels of the most highly contaminated whole chickens at the end of the slaughter process. This reflects the fact that the degree of contamination on birds is most relevant to their risk to public health, with a high level of contamination posing the highest risk for human illness.</p>

 The Independent Organ Donation Taskforce recommended against presumed consent in 2008, concluding that although such a system might have the potential to deliver benefits it would also present significant difficulties, which might not bring about the desired increase in donation rates. Instead, the Taskforce recommended that efforts should concentrate on implementing the recommendations in their first report which they believe should lead to an increase of at least 50% in donation rates by 2013. Currently donation rates are around 20% higher than the baseline year of 2007-08 and around 1 million more people have signed up to the organ donation register.</p>

 Malignant melanoma is caused by long-term exposure to the ultraviolet (UV) light in sunlight. To reduce incidence and mortality rates of the disease, we are supporting SunSmart, the national skin cancer prevention campaign run by Cancer Research UK (CRUK) on behalf of the UK health departments. SunSmart raises awareness among the public and health care professions about the causes of skin cancer, how to prevent it, and the importance of early detection, presentation and treatment.
