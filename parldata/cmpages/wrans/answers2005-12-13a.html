<sup>(1)</sup> Rates are directly standardised to the European standard population. In detailed analyses of trends in incidence and mortality over time for a particular cancer, ONS use age-standardised rates. These control for differences in the size and age structure of the population and allow unbiased comparison of rates over time.<br>

<sup>(2)</sup> Figures for malignant cancer incidence are based on the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10), codes C00-C97, excluding non-melanoma skin cancer code C44. Cancer mortality figures arc based on the Ninth Revision (1CD-9) codes 140&#150;208 for the years 1999&#150;2000, and 1CD-10 codes C00-C97 for the years 2001&#150;2004.

<p><a name="qn_2"><a name="51213w01.html_wqn2"><b> John Battle: </b> 
 To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what steps the Government are taking to increase the financial support available to large families as recommended in the Treasury&#039;s 2004 child poverty review.  [36778]</p>




<p><a name="st_2"><a name="51213w01.html_spnew2"><b> Dawn Primarolo: </b> 
 Between 1998&#150;99 and 2003&#150;04, the risk of poverty for children in families with three or more children has fallen more quickly than the average risk. However, the Child Poverty Review highlighted the fact that these families remain at greater risk of poverty than other families, and that nearly half of children in poverty live in large families.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51213w01.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_1">Since the review, the Government have increased the child element of the child tax credit (CTC), which is paid in respect of each and every child in a family and so of particular benefit to large families. The child element rose by &#163;65 a year in April 2005 and will rise by a further &#163;75 a year in April 2006, to &#163;1,765. As a result of these and other Government reforms to the personal tax and benefit system since 1997, by April 2006 families with three or more children with an income of between &#163;10,000 and &#163;20,000 per year, for example, will be on average &#163;100 per week better off in real terms.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51213w01.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_2">The Government have committed to increasing the child element at least in line with earnings in 2007&#150;08. The Government have also commissioned research into poverty in large families to inform future policy, which is expected to report in 2006.

 Supermarkets and dairy farmers have an indirect commercial relationship largely through intermediary companies such as milk buyers and processors. We are encouraging dialogue between all parts of the supply chain through the Dairy Supply Chain Forum, chaired by my noble Friend, the Lord Bach, as we believe the challenges facing the sector can be solved only by collaborative action.

<sup>(20)</sup> Average prices have been calculated from separate monthly surveys of milk purchasers conducted in England and Wales by Defra, in Scotland by SEERAD and in Northern Ireland by DARD. The surveys were introduced following changes to the milk marketing arrangements in 1994&#150;95. The farm gate price is the average price received by producers, net of delivery charges.

<p>
<a name="51213w09.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_53">During the 21st century, snowfall is expected to decrease over the United Kingdom as a whole. This is a consequence of further warming of climate expected as a result of past and future emissions of greenhouse gases and aerosols into the atmosphere. However, the predicted changes vary with location, and are subject to considerable uncertainties arising from the natural variability of climate, errors in the representation of physical processes in climate models, and uncertainties in future emissions. Therefore, it is possible that some parts of the UK could experience periods of increased snowfall during the next few decades. During the second half of the century, however, snowfall is very likely to be lower than at present, in all parts of the country.

<a name="stpa_54">For Worcester, the latest climate model predictions are expressed as percentage changes relative to the climate of the past 30 years. The predictions show a wide range of possible values, due to the uncertainties previously noted. For a typical year around 2010, snowfall could range from about 15 per cent. above the recent recorded levels to about 30 per cent. below. For 2020, values range from a 10 per cent. increase to a 35 per cent. reduction. For 2030, values range from a five per cent increase to a 40 per cent. reduction. For 2050, values

 DFID commissioned consultants (LMC) estimated in June 2005 that the proposed 39 per cent. price cut for sugar would put 44,800 jobs at risk in these three countries&#151;33,000 for Jamaica, 1,200 in Guyana and 10,600 in Belize (assuming that the current sugar quotas allowing duty free access for the African, Caribbean and Pacific Countries (ACP) producers are maintained). These figures are hotly contested in the region and the national Sugar Action Plans currently being developed by the Governments of these countries seek to identify both alternative employment opportunities and training programmes for those made redundant. The full social impact of the price changes, and mitigating measures, will be set out in the completed plans. DFID is funding an analysis of the social impact in Jamaica to contribute to the Jamaica Plan.

 The UK Government will continue to work hard to support the poorest and most vulnerable producers, be it through multilateral negotiations in the World Trade Organisations (WTO) or regional trade agreements such as the Economic Partnership Agreements. In the context of the WTO negotiations, we are firmly committed to ensuring that developing countries are given appropriate flexibility to adjust to trade reforms, i.e. special and differential treatment (SDT). These include proposals for special products in developing countries, which may require protection due to their importance for rural development and food and livelihoods security. They also include proposals for a special safeguard mechanism for developing countries to temporarily protect vulnerable sectors if affected by import surges.

<a name="stpa_131">In the negotiations poor countries are not being forced to open their market through any trade negotiations, multilateral, bilateral or otherwise. The UK Government believes that developing countries should be allowed to choose the best policies for the poor and the environment. New trade rules made in the WTO have to be agreed by consensus and thus all countries have the right to veto any agreement they do not consider to be in their best interest.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51213w18.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_132">The UK Government believes that trade rules should take account of different .countries&#039; development needs. The answer, however, is not greater protectionism in the form of higher tariff barriers as these will limit the opportunities for poor countries to trade with each other, and with developed countries, and thus exclude them further from the benefits of international trade. Instead, we believe that existing and new trade rules should be made flexible enough so that they meet developing countries&#039; needs. This is the policy the Government is pursuing in the WTO.

<p>
<a name="51213w18.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_133">In services such as water, education and health, increasing access, coverage and quality is vital if countries are to reach the Millennium Development Goals. In March 2005, DFID published a policy paper entitled &#039;Partnerships for Poverty Reduction: changing aid conditionality&#039;, which shows that we are committed to helping Governments of developing countries make their own decisions about how to develop their economies and provide services to their people, based on evidence of what works best in reducing poverty. The policy makes it clear that DFID will not make aid conditional on specific policy decisions by partner Governments or attempt to impose policy choices on them, including in sensitive economic areas such as privatisation or trade liberalisation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51213w18.html_para7">
<a name="stpa_134">DFID also encourages developing countries to make their own decisions about service delivery, including whether or not to open their service sectors to foreign providers. However developing countries are not obliged to accept any request or to open up their services sectors. It all comes down to which option is the most effective in reducing poverty, a decision for Governments of developing countries to make through their own political process.

n/a = Figures are not available.<br>

<sup>(32)</sup> School based expenditure includes only expenditure incurred directly by local authority schools. This includes the pay of teachers and school-based support staff, school premises costs, books and equipment, and certain other supplies and services, less any capital items funded from recurrent spending and income from sales, fees and charges and rents and rates. This excludes the central cost of support services such as home to school transport, local authority administration and the financing of capital expenditure.<br>

<sup>(33)</sup> The expenditure data to 1998&#150;99 are drawn from the annual RO1 spending returns which local authorities submitted to the ODPM. Figures for 1999&#150;2000 to 2001&#150;02 are drawn from Section 52 (Table 3) Outturn statements which local authorities submitted to the DfES. Figures for 2002&#150;03 onwards are taken from Section 52 (Table A) Outturn statements. The change in sources is shown by the blank row. The pupil data are drawn from the DfES Annual Schools Census adjusted to be on a financial year basis.<br>





<sup>(34)</sup> From 2002&#150;03 the calculation is broadly similar to the calculation in previous years. However, 2001&#150;02 and earlier years includes all premature retirement compensation (PRC) and Crombie payments, mandatory PRC payments and other indirect employee expenses, while from 2002&#150;03 only the schools element of these categories is included. In 2001&#150;02 this accounted for approximately &#163;70 per pupil of the England total, while the schools element of these categories accounted for approximately &#163;50 per pupil of the England total in 2002&#150;03. Also, for some LAs, expenditure that had previously been attributed to the school sectors was reported within the LA part of the form from 2002&#150;03 and would therefore be excluded, though this is not quantifiable from existing sources.<br>

<sup>(35)</sup> Expenditure was not distinguished between the pre-primary and primary sectors until the inception of Section 52 for financial year 1999&#150;2000.<br>

<sup>(36)</sup> The expenditure data for 1999&#150;2000 onwards reflect the return of grant maintained schools to local authority maintenance.<br>

<sup>(37)</sup> Spending in 1997&#150;98 reflects the transfer of monies from local government to central Government for the nursery vouchers scheme. These were returned to local government from 1998&#150;99.<br>

Notes:<br>

1. Cash figures are adjusted to 2004&#150;05 prices using December 2005 Gross Domestic Product Deflators.<br>

The ACMD also recommended the development of an early warning system centred on ensuring those agencies collecting data on illicit drugs make the distinction between amphetamine and methylamphetamine when recording data. The ACMD recommended the closer monitoring of certain sub groups such as clubbers who are more likely to use methylamphetamine and agreed the subject of methylamphetamine should be a standing agenda item at the ACMD Technical Committee.

The ACMD recommended the closer monitoring of certain sub groups such as clubbers, who are more likely to use methylamphetamine, and that the subject of methylamphetamine should be a standing agenda item at the ACMD technical committee meetings.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department pursuant to the answer of 28 November 2005, <i>Official Report</i>, column 45W, on the KPMG review, for what reasons the whole KPMG report is not being published.  [35271]</p>

 The extract from the KPMG review was published in November 2005. To publish the full report would prejudice the commercial interests of the Identity Cards Scheme as it contains figures from the business case which if published would result in the Department being unable to obtain value for money from prospective suppliers during the procurement process.

We are considering options for strengthening the accountability arrangements at BCD level to ensure that local communities have a stronger voice in setting local policing priorities. A number of authorities are already piloting various models at this level. One model that seems promising is that of a local policing board.

 The Defence Scientific Advisory Council&#039;s sub-committee on the Medical Implications of Less Lethal Weapons (DOMILL) has produced three statements on the medical implications of the use of the Taser. Copies have been placed in the Library. DOMILL&#039;s view is that the risk of life-threatening or other serious injuries from Taser appears to be very low and certainly very much lower than that from conventional firearms.

 No decisions have yet been taken on any possible changes governing the deployment of Tasers by the police service.

We will of course consider consultation with any relevant stakeholders as appropriate.
