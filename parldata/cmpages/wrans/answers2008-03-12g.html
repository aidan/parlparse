 To ask the Minister for the Olympics pursuant to her answer of the 4 March 2008, <i> Official Report,</i> column 2309W, on Olympic Games 2012: Essex, how many times the Nations and Regions Group has met since it was established. [193687]</p>

 The Nations and Regions Group first met in May 2004, before London was confirmed as the location for the 2012 games. Its role then was to bring substance to our bid commitment that we would spread the benefits from the 2012 games across the UK, and also to generate support within the UK for London&#146;s bid. It met a total of four times before July 2005, when London&#146;s success was confirmed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_225"><a name="80312w0002.htm_para0"><a name="08031247000188">Since July 2005, the group has continued to meet and has developed more formal operating and governance arrangements. It has met a further 12 times and will continue to meet quarterly. The group&#146;s purpose is to deliver against the bid commitment to maximise the levels of engagement and benefit across the UK from the 2012 games, which was a key component of our bid success.</p>

 The Olympic Delivery Authority will appoint three main contractors to undertake the management of landscaping for the 2012 Olympic Park&#151;the North Park contract, the South Park contract and the Greenway contract. For off-park venues, the responsibility for landscaping will rest with the main contractor appointed to each venue. The ODA would then expect each main contractor to use subcontractors and suppliers to carry out the required works.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_226"><a name="80312w0002.htm_para1"><a name="08031247000191">Until the main contractors have been appointed, I cannot say how many companies will be involved, as this will depend on how the works are then phased and split with each contractor.</p>

A key part of this is CompeteFor, an online brokerage service matches the profiles of suppliers and buyers, enabling businesses to directly compete for contracts, including landscaping contracts. I would encourage companies in your constituency to take advantage of this opportunity.</p>

 The passenger interchange between Stratford international and regional stations is a matter for London and Continental Railways (LCR) and the developers of zone 1 of the Stratford City site, Westfield.

There are a number of reasons why there was a reduction in the level of capital investment in council owned stock in 2006-07: reduced stock numbers; a separation of monies for private sector renewal from the funding stream that previously combined this funding with that for council housing stock; and the recommendations of regional assemblies on the allocation of available resources for new build affordable housing (including low cost home ownership schemes) and investment in existing stock.</p>

 Four management plan options&#151;for nutrients, soil, crop protection products and manure&#151;were removed from the list of 62 available options under Entry Level Stewardship (ELS) following discussions with the EU Commission as part of the process of EU approval of the Rural Development Programme for England (RDPE), under which ELS is funded. This was in response to concerns that these options did not require agreement holders to do more than would be required of them under cross compliance or part of good agricultural and environmental practice and would not therefore justify additional payment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_290"><a name="80312w0008.htm_para8"><a name="08031252000725">However, ELS agreements entered into before 1 January 2007 will not be affected by the change and these management plans will continue to attract appropriate payments for the remaining life of agreements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_292"><a name="80312w0008.htm_para10"><a name="08031252000727">Of the 5,400 provisional agreements entered into from 1 January 2007, around 2,600 include management plans options and around 1,800 of these will no longer have sufficient surplus points to meet the points threshold now that management plan options are not available. Natural England, which delivers the scheme, has contacted all agreement holders and is working closely with those affected to help ensure that they are able to remain in ELS. The latest advice from Natural England suggests that most agreement holders want to remain in the scheme and will choose new options to achieve the required threshold.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_293"><a name="80312w0008.htm_para11"><a name="08031252000728">It is important to bear in mind that even with the removal of management plans, ELS remains largely unchanged and, with over 30,000 farmers already signed up covering 50 per cent. of farmland in England, the scheme should continue to deliver key environmental outcomes. And with 58 options remaining available, farmers wanting to join ELS should still be able to do so.</p>

The same powers of enforcement for non-compliance for such requirements will also be available to pilot authorities: i.e. an authority could bring a prosecution or, more likely, offer an individual the option of paying a fixed penalty notice.

From June 2004-March 2005, after which time such complaints were recorded separately, the chief executive received 4,393 direct complaints and 2,594 complaints escalated upwards from stage 2.

<sup>(7)</sup> Changes to how the Agency recorded complaints over the years means that comparisons of the numbers of complaints received are not easily made. The Agency initially operated a two tier complaints process to deal with escalated complaints. A third tier was introduced in 2003, - see notes <sup>(4)</sup> and <sup>(5)</sup>. In the year ending March 2006, 7167 stage 1 complaints required escalation to resolve and 4,673 in year ending March 2007.<br>

2. If a NRP also has debt which has migrated from CSCS to CS2, they will be counted again in this category.<br>
3. The number of NRPs has been rounded to the nearest hundred; the amount of outstanding debt has been rounded to the nearest hundred thousand.<br>
4. The Agency reports the amount of outstanding debt in its Annual Report and Accounts. The information set out in these tables is supplementary to that reported and therefore does not include the provisions applied as a result of the annual debt analysis exercise within the Agency's accounts.<br>
5. The Agency conducts an annual debt analysis exercise to estimate the collectability of the amounts outstanding at the end of each year. The Agency estimates that of the &#163;3.7 billion total debt outstanding at March 2007, &#163;1.5 billion is classed as collectable.<br>

The rising trend of child poverty has already been halted; there are 600,000 fewer children living in relative poverty than in 1998-99. A further 300,000 children will be lifted out of poverty as a result of last year&#146;s Budget and comprehensive spending review.</p>

This will commence for lone parents whose youngest child is 12 or over from October 2008, 10 or over from 2009, and seven or over from 2010. The Government also published the Children&#146;s Plan in December 2007 which sets out policies and measures to improve children&#146;s life chances and help to alleviate child poverty.</p>

The Department for Transport's spending on road and rail in the region has increased by 80 per cent. over the six years to 2007-08&#151;from &#163;165 million to &#163;298 million. &#163;457 million is provisionally allocated to fund major schemes in the north-east in the 10-year period to 2015-16 through the regional funding allocations process. And the recent local transport plan settlement allocated &#163;245 million funding over the next three years for local authorities across the north-east, providing more funding per head of population in 2008-09 than any other region except the south-west.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_363"><a name="80312w0014.htm_para6"><a name="08031267000313">The north-east also benefits from improvements to key corridors and services outside of the region.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Defence whether DNA samples of soldiers taken under the voluntary DNA sampling scheme will be stored on the National DNA database; and if he will make a statement. [190212]</p>

 DNA matching is a near-failsafe method of identifying a deceased individual but only if there is a reference sample with which to compare the bodily remains. At such times, collecting samples from personal effects or family members can prolong the identification process and be traumatic for the grieving family. The aim of our voluntary DNA sampling scheme is to minimise the pain and distress to families by taking a reference sample, which could be analysed in the event of the suspected death of the individual and DNA obtained from the sample at that stage, to enable deceased personnel to be identified quickly and with less intrusion on the family.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_367"><a name="80312w0014.htm_para10"><a name="08031267000337">Since 1999, the MOD has offered aircrew the opportunity of storing reference samples from which DNA could later be identified in order to hasten the identification process. The MOD has now decided that, from later this year, all military, MOD civilian and other entitled civilian personnel deploying to operational theatres will be offered the same opportunity to store reference samples for use in the event that their death is suspected and a body or body parts required identification. In due course, the offer of voluntary reference sampling will be extended to new recruits from all three services. Eventually, therefore, the programme will include all service personnel.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_368"><a name="80312w0014.htm_para11"><a name="08031267000338">The samples are currently taken in the form of bloodspot samples. However, in future, it is intended to take buccal (cheek) swab samples which can be collected either before operational deployment or at regular dental checks. The samples are then stored in secure cabinets in rooms with restricted access. The samples are stored in an un-processed state and therefore the DNA profiles have not been created and are not stored on any database. The Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 states that voluntary DNA samples can only be analysed and entered onto the National DNA Database with the specific written consent of the individual. The MOD has no plans to amend its policy to include this process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_369"><a name="80312w0014.htm_para12"><a name="08031267000339">Samples held by the MOD will be withdrawn from storage if requested by a Coroner, for the purpose of post-mortem identification, or at the request of the individual.

1. The RAF and Army figures are based on the length of time taken from the date an incident was either formally reported, or an official police investigation was initiated, to the actual starting date of the court martial hearing.<br>
2. The increase in the RAF figures from 2005 (56 days) is due to a different recording procedure. Previously the RAF measured the average delay between the point that the case papers were received by the court administration unit (which administers arrangements for the court martial) to the trial date and appearing at court martial. It is not possible to provide data within the same parameters for 2006 and 2007 as information was not transferred to the current working database.<br>
3. The RN figures are based on the length of time taken from when the Naval Prosecution Authority prefers charges to the first day of a trial.<br>
4. Not all applications made in 2007, where charges have been preferred, have yet reached trial (although the majority have).<br>
5. The averages shown are heavily affected by individual cases, where for example, there may be unusual delays in obtaining evidence, such as fraud or where computer analysis is involved.<br>

Earlier years' figures could not be accurately validated in this way and so will be slightly inflated. The level of inflation in earlier years' figures is estimated to be less than one per cent. of total across all non-medical staff groups for headcount figures (and negligible for full time equivalents).

 The software underpinning the Lorenzo regional care solution for the North, Midlands and East (NME) programme for information technology (IT) area&#151;previously comprising the North West/West Midlands, North East and Eastern national programme for IT regions&#151;is currently scheduled to be delivered in four stages, or &#145;releases&#146;, as follows:</p>
<a name="80312w0020.htm_brev0"><a name="08031267003496"><ul><p class="tabletext">release 1: from June 2008;</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_440"><a name="80312w0020.htm_para1"><a name="08031267001400">The software for release 1 will initially be made available to three &#145;early adopter&#146; sites. Following a period of live running within these sites, the release will be rolled out progressively across NME trusts. A similar approach is envisaged for subsequent releases. This staged approach is consistent with best practice and the recommendation from the Health Select Committee.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_441"><a name="80312w0020.htm_para2"><a name="08031267001401">Functionality for release 1, which will be deployed over legacy patient administration systems (PAS), will enable the ordering of tests and reporting of results for pathology and radiology, supported through interfaces to legacy departmental systems. This functionality will also support ordering of a range of other patient-based services such as physiotherapy, occupational therapy and nursing interventions. The release will facilitate the building of a wide range of clinical documentation that will begin to replace the paper-based records, or the multiple clinical applications, which are currently used throughout the national health service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_442"><a name="80312w0020.htm_para3"><a name="08031267001402">Release 2 will replace legacy PAS systems by supporting an additional range of key functions both within and across NHS organisations. The release will include referral management, access planning and waiting lists, complex scheduling, out-patient in-patient and day-care case load management, care planning, case note tracking and contract management functionality. Functionality will also be available for those trusts that need to record Mental Health Act administration details and undertake mental health reviews and tribunals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_443"><a name="80312w0020.htm_para4"><a name="08031267001403">This release also aims to include the ability to record prescriptions and medications issued to patients on discharge using a formulary-based catalogue which identifies interactions that could arise due to the combination of drugs being prescribed, and other checking functionality to reduce clinical errors. In addition, emergency care functionality should be supported for those organisations looking to replace their current departmental systems.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_444"><a name="80312w0020.htm_para5"><a name="08031267001404">Release 3 will build on the functionality delivered in release 2 by providing full in-patient prescribing and  <br>

medication administration functionality, and maternity and theatre management functionality intended to replace legacy systems. The release will, in addition, provide the capability to schedule multiple resources such as people, rooms and equipment, and also deliver enhanced bed management capability.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_445"><a name="80312w0020.htm_para6"><a name="08031267001405">Release 4 aims to provide functionality to support general practitioner practices, health screening, integrated care pathways, commissioning, theatre tray management and stock management. It will also provide the ability to link to remote devices to facilitate telemetry, and for working when disconnected from a network.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_446"><a name="80312w0020.htm_para7"><a name="08031267001406">At present, development plans extend to July 2010. New requirements after July 2010 will need to be specified and supported by an appropriate business case and approval.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_447"><a name="80312w0020.htm_para8"><a name="08031267001407">It is not possible to provide the details requested of the future number, location and sequencing of longer-term deployments. This is because meeting the needs and priorities of individual trusts which are maintaining normal business operations requires flexibility in the deployment planning and inevitably means that plans will always be subject to potential change. Detailed implementation planning became the responsibility of individual trusts and the chief executives of strategic health authorities from April 2007.</p>

The evidence available from these types of service models is that they can prevent out-patient appointments and reduce hospital admissions. However, their effectiveness will depend on a range of local factors, including the local design of the services in question.</p>

Any evidence that a business has engaged in unfair business practices would be relevant to a consideration of its fitness to hold such a licence.</p>

 As stated in the Government's response to the public consultation on the post office network, closures will principally affect a combination of branches in areas of over-provision and those that are least used. Post Office Ltd. will be tasked with taking a strategic overview of service provision to ensure that in areas of over-provision, people should be able to find an alternative branch nearby and the vast majority will still be within walking distance of their nearest office. With the least used, the number of people affected will, by the nature of the offices, be low.

 The Chief Prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) made an assessment in June 2007 which highlighted some improvement in the level of co-operation from Serbia, such as the establishment of a National Security Council; better access to documents requested by the Prosecutor's office; and co-ordinated action resulting in the arrests of General Tolimir and Vlastimir Dordevic in 2007.

 The UK has no plans to respond at the UN. Our policy towards Hamas has not changed. We do not have contact with Hamas. The key to making progress is to swiftly resume negotiations.

These principles remain the fundamental conditions for a viable peace process. We hope that Hamas will accept the principles and grasp the opportunity for dialogue and progress. However, a political dialogue is impossible as long as one party is dedicated to violence and the destruction of the other.</p>

 Notwithstanding the signing of a Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) in November 2006, Nepal has continued to see violence, much of which stems from intimidation, abductions and extortion, carried out by groups affiliated to the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) (CPN(M)). In recent months, widespread violence has resulted in over 170 deaths in the Terai, the southern plains bordering India. The UK has urged the Government of Nepal and all political parties to work towards improving public security.

The studies concern prisoners, offenders serving community sentences and juveniles. The prison cohort study, &#147;Surveying Prisoner Crime Reduction&#148; (SPCR) follows the progress of 4,000 newly sentenced prisoners during their sentence and when they return to the community. In addition to prisoners&#146; self-reported employment and training after release, the study will have access to benefits and tax records held by the Department for Work and Pensions, which is a financial stakeholder in the study. The first results from this study, describing the presenting problems and needs of prisoners, are scheduled for publication in April 2008.</p>

The study assesses the links between prisoners&#146; circumstances on release (in areas such as education, training, employment, accommodation and family ties), interventions attended in prisons, and reoffending one year after discharge.</p>
