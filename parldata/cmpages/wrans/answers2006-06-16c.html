 There are an estimated 67,556 individuals who have a DNA profile on the National DNA Database (NDNAD) taken by Avon and Somerset constabulary, of which 1,994 are currently under 16 years of age and 65,562 are 16 years or over (as at 30 May 2006).

<i> [holding answer 13 June 2006]: </i>Prisoners are usually transferred when their security category has been changed, to enable them to meet the requirements of their sentence plan, for compassionate reasons, as part of their preparation for release and for operational security reasons.

However, there was some evidence of increased knowledge of healthy eating, particularly in children from deprived areas.</p>

 The concept of a national water grid has been raised many times in the last 30 years and was has never been considered remotely viable. It was most recently discussed at the Secretary of State's meeting on 1 June with representatives of water companies and the water industry regulators. It was rejected by all those present on the grounds of its disproportionate and unjustifiable cost, both for the environment and for water bills, compared with the benefits such a grid could deliver. This stance was informed by a recent desk study undertaken by the Environment Agency, which will be published later this summer.</p>

We demanded that the perpetrators be brought to justice. A UK-drafted Resolution on DRC adopted at last year&#146;s United Nations General Assembly made clear that the Congolese Government must act decisively to reduce sexual violence.</p>

 Figures derived from new DWP national statistics published on 27 April indicate that in Wales at 30 November 2005, there were some 940 carers aged 60 and over receiving carer's allowance at a non-standard rate. A breakdown of this figure by gender and Welsh parliamentary constituency is in the table. This information was not available for the reply I gave to my hon. friend on 27 March 2006, <i> Official Report,</i> columns 721-22 because the data then available for the numbers of recipients of carer's allowance at 31 August 2005 were rounded to the nearest 100, and this did not permit figures for the recipients of a non-standard rate of the allowance in each constituency to be provided where they numbered fewer than 50. The new statistical data are rounded to the nearest 10 and, as shown in the table, this does permit figures for the recipients in each constituency to be provided where they number five or more. The estimated additional annual cost to public funds of paying the standard weekly rate of carer's allowance to the carers listed in the table, rather than the non-standard rate they are receiving, would be around &#163;1.25 million at current benefit rates.</p>

Even though the circumstances which give rise to entitlement to carer&#146;s allowance and state pension are different, they are both designed to provide a degree of replacement for lost or forgone income. Carer&#146;s allowance was designed to provide a measure of replacement income where the duties of caring for a severely disabled person prevent the prospect of full-time work and the earnings it would yield. State pension was designed to provide a replacement income in retirement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_171"><a name="60616w0011.htm_para1"><a name="06061639000371">Although an entitlement to both benefits will mean that carer&#146;s allowance is not payable, or not payable in full, an underlying entitlement to carer&#146;s allowance gives access to additional financial support through the carer premium in housing benefit and council tax benefit and since 2003 the additional amount for carers in state pension credit.</p>

Businesses and corporate centre directorates will be involving disabled people in developing action plans for tackling problem areas and identifying positive actions to address these. The process to develop our Schemes was formally launched on 12 April 2006 by the Permanent Secretary. We have begun the process of involving both staff and customers in developing our Schemes and are planning a training strategy to ensure our staff are aware of the new legislation.</p>

The results were used to develop a programme of public access improvements that was implemented in the following year and completed in March 2005, with the exception of a small number of Jobcentre Plus refurbishment programme sites, scheduled for completion in June 2006.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_201"><a name="60616w0012.htm_para10"><a name="06061639000456">DWP has been running two pilot exercises in the Disability and Carers&#146; Service (DCS) on a revised process for delivering reasonable adjustments. The development of the new process was partly in response to the length of time it took to assess and put reasonable adjustments into place and partly to ensure that the recommended adjustment was the most suitable for that individual. The new process opens formal communication channels between suppliers and so far, the results have been positive. There has been a notable reduction in the time it is taking to achieve a successful outcome.</p>

 Specific information regarding low income for Wales, Scotland and the English regions is available in the latest publication of &#147;Households Below Average Income 1994-95 to 2004-05&#148;.

This gives an idea of the depth of poverty and it is simple to interpret. Indeed, the incorporation of two different relative low-income thresholds into our new child poverty measure (60 and 70 per cent. of median), together with the absolute tier, further ensures that different depths of poverty will be looked at separately.</p>

These become proportionally more important the smaller the group we focus on. That is part of the reason that, from next year, we will be collating material deprivation data as well, excluding people with low measured income but high living standards.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_247"><a name="60616w0016.htm_para5"><a name="06061639001039">The Petroleum Act 1998 is a key part of the regulatory regime that allows the Government to manage the UK&#146;s oil and gas resources, with the overall aim of maximising economic recovery. The Government continue to work closely with industry in PILOT, the oil and gas taskforce that I chair, to ensure that we have the licensing, environmental and business frameworks that will attract the investment needed to deliver the North sea&#146;s full potential. The operation of the Petroleum Act 1998 naturally forms part of that wider picture, alongside a range of positive initiatives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_248"><a name="60616w0016.htm_para6"><a name="06061639001040">The Fossil Fuel Levy Act 1998 (which amended section 33 of the Electricity Act in its original form) was repealed by the Utilities Act 2000, which introduced the renewables obligation. However, provisions dealing with the Fossil Fuel Levy continue in a modified form by virtue of the Electricity from Non-Fossil Fuel Sources Savings Arrangements Orders made in 2000 and 2001. The fossil fuel levy is currently set at zero. The contractual arrangements made under the non-fossil fuel obligation also remain in place by virtue of the NFFO Savings Order. I have received no recent representations about the fossil fuel levy.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what steps his Department is taking to increase access to venture capital for manufacturing firms in the North East. [77186]</p>

 Manufacturing is still, and will continue to be, a very important part of the UK economy. The importance of manufacturing to the North East of England, and to the whole UK economy, is recognised in the Department of Trade and Industry&#146;s Manufacturing Strategy. Launched in 2002 and reviewed in 2004, the strategy sets out the actions needed to create a high value, high skill manufacturing sector capable of introducing new products and processes into our economy, creating new markets, and delivering a huge boost to our growth and prosperity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_256"><a name="60616w0017.htm_para0"><a name="06061639001117">Government will continue to work with regional agencies, the business community, trade unions and others to ensure that the region (and the UK) makes the most of the opportunities to shift from low-cost/low added-value manufacturing to a sustainable, high added value, high skill, knowledge-led economy. We will continue to develop policies to achieve the right climate for business growth.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_257"><a name="60616w0017.htm_para1"><a name="06061639001118">The UK is widely acknowledged as possessing a dynamic and efficient financial market, meeting the financing needs of the majority of businesses. Nevertheless, a small but important minority of innovative, growth-oriented small businesses continue to face difficulties in attracting the funding (particularly risk capital and equity in the &#163;500,000 to &#163;2 million region) that they need to realise their ambitions, providing a case for targeted Government intervention to assist markets where these difficulties create a significant barrier to enterprise and innovation, and hence to productivity growth. Over recent years, the Government have played an important role in ensuring that markets work effectively and that any gaps or weaknesses are addressed. The provision of publicly supported finance schemes (loan, mezzanine and equity) for small businesses has increased significantly over the last few years, increasing access to funding for manufacturing firms and others in order to invest in new technologies and improve productivity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_258"><a name="60616w0017.htm_para2"><a name="06061639001119">The Regional Venture Capital Fund (RVCF), an England-wide programme to provide risk capital in amounts up to &#163;500,000, was created to support small growing companies, with &#163;80 million of Government investment attracting a further &#163;155 million from private sector investors. Capital North East (the North East RVCF) was launched in 2002, and the fund totalled &#163;15 million.</p>

This led to the creation of Enterprise Capital Funds (ECFs), which will invest a combination of private and public money in small high-growth businesses seeking between &#163;250,000 and &#163;2 million of equity finance.

The fund is targeted at the most deprived 25 per cent. of areas of England and includes a number of North East wards. The Coalfields Enterprise Fund, launched by the Deputy Prime Minister in early 2004, is a venture capital fund specifically set up to finance growth-oriented companies and to encourage entrepreneurship in England&#146;s former coalfield areas. Investments are on a 50:50 co-investment basis between &#163;40,000 and &#163;500,000.</p>

NEEMF can match, on a pari passu basis, investments made by private investors or business angels who may not have sufficient resources to wholly fund the business or who wish to spread the risk. The investment range is from &#163;25,000 to &#163;100,000 in the first round with the capacity to aggregate up to &#163;200,000 in a second round after nine months has elapsed. The total equity raised in the initial round must not exceed &#163;250,000. Investments will usually be in the form of ordinary and/or preference shares and will be made at the same time as the private investment. The legal process is aimed at keeping time scales and costs to a minimum.</p>

The North East Co-Investment Fund (CoIF) and the North East Proof of Concept (PoC) Fund are both managed by NorthStar Equity Investors. The Proof of Concept Fund is a convertible loan fund, investing in technology and science based SMEs and in activities leading to SME formation spun-out from the research and business base in the North East of England. The Co-Investment Fund (COIF) is a &#163;23 million venture capital fund that invests alongside private investors in high-growth technology-focused SMEs.</p>

A number of working groups are currently working on the implementation of various aspects of the legislation taking account of both the guidance and regulations. A complete baseline analysis of the leaving care population was undertaken at the end of September 2005. This analysis will be repeated at the end of September 2006.</p>

This provided an opportunity for Health and Social Service Trust leaving and after care teams to share their experience of the new legislation and the implementation process to date. The Department will also host an assessment seminar on the implementation of the legislation in November/December 2006, i.e. roughly one year after the introduction of the legislation. The views of young people affected by the legislation and other stakeholders will be sought on all aspects of the legislation including the operation of the regulations and guidance.</p>

Men with prostate cancer symptoms are encouraged to seek early advice from their GP. They may ask for a Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) test. However, to enable them to make an informed decision about the PSA test, they need to know about its limitations and the potential side effects which may occur following surgery, which include incontinence and impotence.</p>

participated in frequent co-ordination meetings in Jakarta and Yogyakarta on emergency relief, and are now in regular contact with the European Commission and other member states about longer- term reconstruction needs and the case for financial contributions. The preliminary damage and loss assessment, a joint report by the Government of Indonesia and international partners, was presented to donors on June 14. It provides a basis for longer-term reconstruction and recovery assistance, and ways to deliver this are now being considered. No firm decisions have yet been taken by EU member states on financial contributions to the recovery effort, except by the Netherlands which has announced a contribution of &#8364;10 million.</p>

 Localised food insecurity is reported in several parts of Senegal, particularly the poorest Casamance region which is badly affected. Here it has been made worse by fighting in Guinea-Bissau between Senegalese separatist rebels and the Guinea- Bissau army. The World Food Programme estimates that approximately 2,100 people fled the fighting into Casamance, living with family and friends in the city of Ziguinchor. Given the region's limited resources and potentially high flows of additional refugees and displaced people, humanitarian vulnerability and food insecurity could increase if the fighting does not end soon.</p>

 The Defence Industrial Strategy identified that once Typhoon and the Joint Combat Aircraft have been introduced into service, there is no requirement for a new-design manned aircraft beyond our extant plans although future procurements of uninhabited and/or manned platforms are envisaged. The consequent long term decline in new programme work is expected to lead to a significant rationalisation of the UK defence aerospace business. That is why MOD is negotiating with BAE Systems on the terms of the business rationalisation and transformation agreement required to facilitate the effective sustainment of the industrial skills, capability and technologies&#151;wherever they may be in the supply chain&#151;that will be important to our ability to operate, support and upgrade our fast jet combat aircraft through life.

 In 1997 the Government announced a foreign policy-led strategic defence review (SDR) to reassess Britain&#146;s security interests and defence needs and consider how the roles, missions and capabilities of our armed forces should be adjusted to meet the new strategic realities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_305"><a name="60616w0022.htm_para5"><a name="0606194000046">The resulting report, in July 1998, placed a great emphasis on the deployability of our forces, including the requirement to ensure that our armed forces are properly supported in the field&#151;a key aspect of which is the provision of timely, modern and effective medical support.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_308"><a name="60616w0022.htm_para8"><a name="0606194000049">The MQR also advocated a further strengthening of the partnership between the DMS and the NHS.

The decision was taken to close them because they no longer had sufficient patient volume and case mix to develop and maintain the skills of our medical personnel to the appropriate operational and NHS standards. We created Ministry of Defence hospital units located within NHS hospitals at Birmingham, Derriford, Frimley Park, Northallerton/Middlesbrough, Peterborough and Portsmouth. They provide the most effective way of giving the UK armed forces patients access to the latest advances in medical treatment and the major recent investments in NHS facilities. The integration of service personnel throughout the NHS trust also enables DMS staff to take advantage of NHS expertise and to maintain their own clinical skills in an active, up-to-date environment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_311"><a name="60616w0022.htm_para11"><a name="0606194000052">We have also introduced regional rehabilitation units (RRUs). A total of 12 RRUs have been established within the UK, with similar facilities in Germany and Cyprus, to provide assessment and treatment of musculo-skeletal disorders. They were introduced to alleviate pressure on the Defence Medical Rehabilitation Centre at Headley Court and to provide more accessible regionally-based facilities. Patients are referred from unit medical facilities, where the simpler injuries would be diagnosed and treated. The benefit is that patients are assessed and treated in a timely fashion and receive the optimal high quality treatment and rehabilitation to maximise functional outcome and return to operational fitness when this is clinically possible. Specifically, the RRU system leads to reduced overall patient waiting times, earlier access to diagnosis and therefore quicker treatment and patient monitoring throughout the rehabilitation programme on an individual basis by physiotherapists and remedial instructors at the RRU. For example, most patients who undergo a simple knee arthroscopic procedure are currently being returned fit for task within four months, and patients who undergo an anterior cruciate ligament repair procedure are being returned fit for task in about seven months.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_312"><a name="60616w0022.htm_para12"><a name="0606194000053">Additionally, to improve our patient care, in 2005 the MOD set up a Defence Medical Rehabilitation Evaluation Co-ordination Cell to support personnel injured on operations. This improves the co-ordination of care from the point of entry into UK until the individual is returned to full fitness or is medically discharged from the service. It also improves the provision of a clinical assessment and decisions on the most appropriate care from a consultant-led multi-disciplinary team.</p>

These improvements have been backed by improved operational training, doctrine and through the lessons learnt process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_316"><a name="60616w0022.htm_para16"><a name="0606194000057">There are also three current projects which will contribute significantly to improvements in the DMS:</p>

MMHS has the threefold aim of maximising the number of armed forces personnel &#145;fit for task&#146;, contributing to deployed medical operational capability and improving morale in the DMS. The scope of the MMHS project is to cover the UK non-deployed medical capability only, but many of the changes expected from it will beneficially impact on health and health care provision across the MOD including the overseas Commands.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_318"><a name="60616w0022.htm_para18"><a name="0606194000059">Second, the director general medical operational capability project (DG Med Op Cap) has been set up to determine how to optimise the delivery of medical capability to support operations and ensure the process will deliver continual quality assurance and improvement in clinical output. The intended outcome of this project is the delivery of properly trained personnel with the right equipment and sustainability, to meet the requirements of the front line commanders-in-chief in the most effective and efficient manner.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_319"><a name="60616w0022.htm_para19"><a name="0606194000060">Third, the defence medical information capability programme (DMICP) is a major business change programme enabled by IT which will provide an integrated health care information system across the DMS, and will also link to the NHS&#146;s major new national programme for IT. DMICP will provide many benefits with the overarching benefit being more service personnel fit for task. It will provide DMS doctors and dentists with immediate access worldwide to complete, up-to-date electronic medical and dental records, supported by the latest clinical decision support software and online reference material, giving greater support to service clinicians, analysts and administrators in all aspects of their work.

 The Government believes that care homes are one of a range of options that should be available for supporting people with long-term care needs.

CSCI has strong enforcement powers and will take action to protect the welfare of residents, with the aim of raising the quality of care and level of protection for vulnerable people and ensuring that service users and their families can be confident that their welfare and interests are safeguarded.</p>

 Children's hospices play a valuable role in the provision of palliative care for disabled children and young people or those with complex health needs and their families and I am pleased that we have been able to provide additional funding to them. But they are only one aspect of children's palliative care. We want to see children and their families have a real choice as to where they receive their care so that they can live as normal a life as possible for as long as possible. Our White Paper, &#147;Our health, Our care, Our say&#148;, expects primary care trusts to ensure that the right model of service is developed by undertaking a review to audit capacity and delivery of integrated pathways against national service framework standards and then to agree service models, funding and commissioning arrangements with their strategic health authorities. The White Paper also restates the Government manifesto commitment to increase funding for end of life care which includes palliative care for children and young people. We will make an announcement about funding this manifesto commitment as soon as we can.</p>

This provides a high level of assurance that only bona fide personnel have access to the care record service. eGif level three requires a face-to-face meeting, and the provision of official documentation and authentication to systems, using a two-factor approach. NHS Connecting for Health use a smartcard and a passcode.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_365"><a name="60616w0025.htm_para12"><a name="06061911000247">When fully deployed, NHS Connecting for Health-delivered systems will utilise a number of separate mechanisms, including consent/dissent, legitimate relationships, role-based access and sealed envelopes. Consent/dissent provides for patients to formally opt-out of sharing their clinical data. Legitimate relationships restrict access to only those clinicians involved in the patients care. Role-based access identifies the staff role and only allows access to the relevant part of the record, for example, restricting the access a receptionist has to clinical details. Sealed envelopes allow a patient to restrict access further to particularly sensitive parts of their record.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_366"><a name="60616w0025.htm_para13"><a name="06061911000248">These controls have been designed to put the patient at the heart of care rather than having restrictions based on NHS organisational boundaries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_367"><a name="60616w0025.htm_para14"><a name="06061911000249">Initially, as systems begin to be rolled out, access to an individual's detailed care record will still be restricted to the originating organisation. This will gradually be extended to local health communities and eventually across larger areas as the scope of the access controls are extended and the systems capable of utilising them are deployed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_368"><a name="60616w0025.htm_para15"><a name="06061911000250">In addition the NHS care record service specifies strict audit requirements that log which individuals have accessed which records.

Therefore, the current waiting time targets are not robust indicators of access to mental health services, many of which take place outside the hospital setting.</p>

 The national service framework (NSF) for older people published in March 2001 recommended implementation of a single assessment process by the health and social care professionals involved in the care of each individual. The national programme for information technology included IT support as an additional service for a single assessment process within the contracts let to local service providers. A variety of information systems and tools are available to support this process. Successful local deployments of such systems by national programme suppliers, notably in the programme's north east and eastern clusters, have demonstrated the value of the technology and its potential to support the rapid development of integrated multi-agency working across all client groups.</p>

 Many of the components of the national programme for information technology have been delivered to time. There have been some delays to local systems but local plans for deployment of systems and services are subject to regular update and revision by the national health service as well as suppliers depending, for example, on the readiness of NHS bodies to receive them. In general, payment is not made to suppliers until systems have been satisfactorily delivered and have been demonstrated to be safe to use and fit for purpose, and, where appropriate, been the subject of consultation with representatives of end-user groups. In some areas of the programme this process is determining the pace at which development and deployment takes place.</p>

 The new national network (N3) provides connections of 0.5 up to 2 megabits per second (Mbps) of dedicated bandwidth for general practitioner (GP) sites, and of 2Mbps up to l00Mbps for national health service trusts.

Under N3 all GP practice sites are eligible for centrally funded connections, and trusts are provided with a connection per site and receive bandwidth commensurate with their size. In order to provide a standard level of service, the provision of broadband services in some rural communities was accelerated under N3 in order that GPs could benefit from consistent services, regardless of location. The NHS was the first public service organisation to achieve this ambition for equitability of services in rural areas.</p>

 Local national health service organisations have the responsibility for determining which of their staff may access the care records available within the particular deployment of new information technology systems to their organisation. Only those people involved in the care of the patient will have access to patient information, and the level of detail to which they have access will be appropriate to their role. The NHS care records service registration authority is responsible for registering and verifying the identity of NHS staff who need to use the NHS Care Records Service (NHS CRS) and related systems and services. The number having access when the service is fully deployed across the NHS will be determined by the operational and professional needs of NHS organisations and their staff. Access to these systems and services, and the patient information they contain and use, is controlled by smartcards with identification and passcode, superior to a chip and pin credit card. Registration authorities locally issue smartcards to authorised staff with an approved level of access to patient information. As at 31 May 2006, there were over 230,000 users registered to access the NHS CRS.</p>
