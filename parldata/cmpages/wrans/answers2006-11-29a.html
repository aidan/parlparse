IV of the Environment Act 1995 to review and assess the current, and
likely future, air quality in their areas. The first step of the review
and assessment process is an updating and screening assessment (USA),
which is to be undertaken by all authorities to identify those matters
that have changed since the last round was completed. LAs are expected
to undertake the reviews and assessment every three years. Where local
authorities consider that one or more of the nationally prescribed air
quality objectives for each of the seven pollutants is unlikely to be
met by the relevant deadline, they must declare an air quality
management area (AQMA), covering the area where the problem is
expected. These local authorities must then take action, along with
other agencies and organisations, to work towards meeting the air
quality
objectives.</p><p><a name="stpa_329"><a name="61129w0001.htm_para0"><a name="0611305000054">When the

air quality report in October 1999. The report concluded that further
investigation was needed in respect of nitrogen dioxide and particulate
matter (PM10). Following monitoring and modelling, Wirral concluded

to scale up access to cotrimoxazole was highlighted at the UK/UNICEF
hosted Global Partners Forum on Children and AIDS. UN agencies, notably
WHO and UNICEF have pledged to step up efforts to support countries to
scale up provision of cotrimoxazole as part of efforts to scale up

as a period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one

Statistics (HES) are compiled from data sent by over 300 NHS trusts and
primary care trusts (PCTs) in England. The Health and Social Care
Information Centre liaises closely with these organisations to
encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise
inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES
processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some
shortcomings
remain.<br><i> Sources:</i><br>1.

Finished admission
episodes<br>A finished
admission episode is the first period of in-patient care under one
consultant within one healthcare provider. Please note that admissions
do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more
than one admission within the
year.<br>2. Main
operation<br>The main
operation is the first recorded operation in the HES data set and is
usually the most resource intensive procedure performed during the
episode. It is appropriate to use main operation when looking at
admission details, eg time waited, but the figures for &#147;all
operations count of episodes&#148; give a more complete count of
episodes with an

waited statistics from Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) are not the
same as the published waiting list statistics. HES provides counts and
time waited for all patients admitted to hospital within a given period
whereas the published waiting list statistics count those waiting for
treatment on a specific date and how long they have been on the waiting
list. Also, HES calculates the time waited as the difference between
the admission and decision to admit dates. Unlike published waiting
list statistics this is not adjusted for self-deferrals or periods of
medical/social
suspension.<br><i> Sources:</i><br>1.
