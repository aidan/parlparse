<a name="20524w01.html_para0">We welcome the US's recognition that climate change is a serious problem and the fact that they are taking domestic action. The UK continues to believe that the Kyoto Protocol remains the only workable basis to take forward international action to tackle climate change. We are maintaining a constructive dialogue with US ministers and officials.

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development (1) what areas were identified under the G8 programme of action on forests where the United Kingdom needed to improve its performance to combat the trade in illegally harvested timber; [56671]
(2) what action the United Kingdom <i>(a)</i> has taken and <i>(b)</i> intends to take to follow up the G8 action programme on forests, agreed at the Birmingham G8 meeting in 1998; [56672]
(3) what work has been taken, under the G8 action programme of action on forests by the United Kingdom to develop and implement counter measures against the trade in illegally harvested timber. [56674]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20524w01.html_spnew0"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 The UK led the G8 work on illegal logging in the 1998 action plan. The G8 report on the action programme on forests will be published in the run-up to the G8 meeting in Canada. It identifies the actions that have been taken by G8 members to combat illegal logging and associated trade. The UK has taken many actions to support measures by timber producing countries to control illegal logging. These include access to better information and analysis, establishment of monitoring and verification processes and policy and institutional reforms.
<P>

<a name="20524w01.html_para5">Internationally we have signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Indonesia that commits both parties to work together to combat illegal logging and stop the trade in illegally logged timber between our countries. This important bilateral agreement for joint action by producer and consumer countries is the first of its kind. It is highly influential and is acting as a catalyst for the development of further agreements.
<P>

<a name="20524w01.html_para6">In addition to our work within the G8 action programme we are working within the EU and with international organisations to broaden the base of countries engaged in actions to control illegal logging. The EU is developing an action programme that is examining the need for new legislation to provide effective enforcement. The UK, with others, is supporting a forest law enforcement process in Africa that will learn from the successful process started in Asia last year. We need to demonstrate progress with bilateral agreements and build these into regional and multilateral arrangements.
<P>

<a name="20524w01.html_para7">Domestically the Government now requires all Departments to seek to procure only legally and sustainably harvested timber and wood products.

 The Special Conference of States Parties (The Hague, 21&#150;24 April) decided that it would reconvene no later than 10 June to appoint a new Director-General, following the formal recommendation of the Executive Council which is due to meet on 31 May.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20524w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 We do not hold this information. We will make enquiries and I will write to my hon. Friend, and place a copy of the letter in the Library of the House.
<P>
<P>
<a name="20524w01.html_wqn12"><B> Lynne Jones: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, pursuant to the answer to my hon. Friend the Member for Blaneau Gwent (Llew Smith), of 8 May, <i>Official Report,</i> column 241W, on the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, if he will make a statement on the reasons underlying his assessement that Mr. Bustani has lost confidence of a significant number of the OPCW's Executive Council. [57938]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20524w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The assessment was based on the views expressed by members of the OPCW represented on the Executive Council. It was borne out by the subsequent vote in which 17 supported the vote of no confidence, 18 abstained and only 5 opposed.
<P>
<P>
<a name="20524w01.html_wqn13"><B> Lynne Jones: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what his definition is of major shareholder in the context of member states of the OPCW; and what the implications are of the definition for the independence of the organisations. [58091]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20524w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 There is no agreed definition of a major shareholder in the context of the OPCW. The use of this term has no implications for the independence of the Organisation, where each member has one vote. This term has, however, occasionally been used to describe those members who have continually been represented on the Executive Council, and the six largest financial contributors who provide approximately 70 per cent of the OPCW budget (the US, Japan, Germany, France, the UK and Italy).

<P>
<P>
<a name="20524w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B>

<P>
<P>
<a name="20524w02.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The UK maintains formal diplomatic links with Burma. Contact with the military regime in Burma is limited by the EU Common Position which contains a visa ban on senior members of the regime visiting the EU and a ban on High Level visitors from the

[58023]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20524w02.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Our Embassy staff in Burma and visiting FCO officials meet regularly with representatives of the National League for Democracy. Our Ambassador has also met Aung San Suu Kyi since her release from house arrest.
<P>

<a name="20524w02.html_para1">The EU Common Position on Burma includes an arms embargo, a ban on non-humanitarian aid, a ban on items that may be used for torture, a ban on high level visits and a visa ban and asset freeze on senior members of the regime. In addition the European Community suspended Burma's trading privileges in 1997 in response to concerns over the use of forced labour and the Government does not encourage trade, investment or tourism with Burma.
<P>

<a name="20524w02.html_para2">Together with other EU partners, the Government takes every opportunity to encourage the military government, the democratic opposition and the ethnic minorities to press ahead with national reconciliation, with the aim of re-establishing democracy and the rule of law.

 We have been following closely the cases of three Chinese Christians imprisoned for bible transportation earlier this year. We welcome the fact that two of them have been released on health grounds.

The UK together with the EU issued a declaration welcoming the Malino peace agreement on 11 March.

<P>
<a name="20524w03.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The Government White Paper "British Shipping Charting a New Course" was published on 16 December 1998. The associated fiscal support was announced in the Finance Act 2000 and made available from 28 July 2000. Along with all the other bidders in the competition, AWSR Shipping Ltd made their final bid on 6 July 2000. The strategic sealift service proposed by AWSR Shipping Ltd. will create 184 new jobs, all of which will be filled by officers and ratings eligible to be Sponsored Reserves and recruited on the open market. AWSR Shipping Ltd. has assured the Ministry of Defence that it is committed to a level of training that meets the government's British Shipping Policy. Details of AWSR's bid are commercially sensitive and I am therefore withholding details of the costs associated with their tonnage tax position under Exemption 13 of the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information. Of the companies making up the AWSR consortium, only James Fisher & Sons plc took part in the Government's shipping working party and only this company has ships registered under tonnage tax.

 British troops in Afghanistan have been carrying out both security assistance and combat tasks; this dual role has not caused any significant problems. The United Kingdom has led, and made a substantial contribution to, the International Security Assistance Force in Kabul since its inception. Our troops have been widely praised for their work in helping the Interim Administration to maintain security and stability in Kabul as the Afghans begin the rebuilding of their shattered country. The number of British troops committed to ISAF in Kabul is now under 1,400, compared with 2,100 at its peak. We welcomed Turkey's announcement on 29 April that it would take over the leadership from the UK, and are finalising the arrangements.
<P>

<a name="20524w04.html_para2">The deployment to Afghanistan of a battlegroup of up to 1,700 troops formed around 45 Commando Royal Marines has also produced significant results. The Royal Marines have so far completed three operations. All three have contributed towards denying the terrorists the opportunity to regroup, operate, and destabilise the peace process in Afghanistan. This is vital if Afghan society is to return to normality.

The high flying rate of the C17 has, in part, been as a result of attempts to relieve the workload on other aircraft, including the Hercules C130. Increased utilisation of the C130 is attributable only to the upsurge in Operational flying and would have been exacerbated had the C17 aircraft not been available.

<P>
<a name="20524w04.html_spnew17"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 There are four C17 aircraft in operational service with the RAF, which provide an outsize strategic airlift capability and supplement the existing air transport capability. On 22 May 2002, three of the four aircraft were fully serviceable and conducting operations. One aircraft was undergoing routine pre-planned maintenance. Since the arrival of the C17 into RAF service, it has consistently performed above expectations, while its serviceability record has been comparable with that of the Hercules fleet.

Current initiatives to reduce vandalism of the rail network include:<P>

"Leave Sites Safe and Secure"&#151;a Railtrack campaign to clear lineside debris which could be used in acts of vandalism. The overall aim of the campaign is to remove or safely secure all lineside materials by October 2002.

"National Route Crime Week" 17&#150;25 June sponsored by the National Co-ordinating Group for Trespass and Vandalism (an SRA/Railway Safety body). There will be a number of activities including an open debate at the Health and Safety Commission's (HSC) Rail Industry Advisory Committee meeting on 25 June;<P>

Industry programmes for reducing vandalism, including a range of targeted engineering measures such as improved railway fencing and caging bridges at vulnerable locations. HMRI monitor these programmes and take action if necessary.<P>

<i>Letter from Kevin Davies to Mr. Paul Goodman, dated 24 May 2002:</i>
<BR>
 I have been asked by the Transport Minister, David Jamieson, to reply to your recent Parliamentary Questions about the long-term improvements to the M40/A404 Handy Cross Junction. I am replying in the absence of Tim Matthews, the Chief Executive who is currently on leave.
 The Highways Agency has undertaken considerable work since the publication of the Integrated Transport Study in January 2001. The short-term improvements identified in the study have been substantially completed and we have also completed a validation of the long-term proposals including further preliminary design work. To assist in this validation we have collected more detailed information on traffic movements through the junction together with pavement condition assessment and geotechnical investigations. The results of these investigations would not normally be published at this stage because they are working documents.
 It is too early to outline the future programme for this work, or to state how it would be processed. However, we would consider the advantages of appointing a contractor under our Early Design and Build Contract. We would want to see what innovations a contractor can bring to the scheme in terms of both design and construction techniques before publishing the draft orders. Following the appointment of a contractor a pre draft Orders exhibition would be held. This would then be followed by publication of the Environmental Statement and draft Orders.
 If you would like to discuss this further please contact the Agency's Project Sponsor, Andy Finch. He can be contacted at our Dorking office on 01306 878342.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20524w08.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Byers: </B> 
 I have today written to the Chair of each Regional Planning Body in the following terms.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>
<BR>
I am writing about two issues relating to the handling of decisions on the recommended strategies which are now being produced by the multi-modal studies. These are the assumptions to be made about the possible future introduction of road user charging and the timetable for the submission to Ministers of RPB advice on study recommendations.
<BR>
I know that a number of multi-modal studies have been looking at the possible effects of distance based user charging on the inter-urban road network. As we set out in the 10 Year Plan for Transport, no decision on the role of charging in reducing congestion on the inter-urban network has been taken. As a practical matter, the hurdles involved in developing and testing the technology necessary to implement inter-urban road charging for cars and introducing it to 26 million private cars mean that it is extremely unlikely to be possible to introduce it before the end of this decade. This will also allow time to build experience with the distance charging system and associated technology for lorries. And it will provide time to continue the improvements in transport facilities and public transport for which the 10-year plan provides.
<BR>
Given the practical considerations, we do not believe that a system of road user charging for cars could be introduced this decade; accordingly the Government has no plans to do so. However, this is a subject where further work and research is needed and we will revisit it when sufficient progress has been made in clarifying the technical and practical issues involved. In the meantime, we note the arguments put forward by the Commission for Integrated Transport, RAC and others in favour of inter-urban charging, and others against, and are listening to the debate.
<BR>
As a consequence, the study recommendations should build in flexibility as to what should be done now given that we do not believe that a system of road user charging for cars could be introduced this decade and that no decisions have been made about the longer term introduction of road user charging. My Department will be re-emphasising this to the study teams.
<BR>
On the second issue, we have always recognised that before the Government takes decisions on the recommendations from the multi-modal studies it is important to have advice from Regional Planning Bodies on the way in which the recommendations fit with, and will contribute to, the Regional Transport Strategy and Regional Planning Guidance.
<BR>
However, it is also important to recognise that the studies have taken up to two years to produce their recommendations; that they have addressed the key issues in considerable detail in close consultation with local and regional interests; and that the Regional Planning Bodies have been represented on the study steering groups. This being the case, I believe that it is essential that we make decisions on the study recommendations, and start to resolve the problems on the transport network, as quickly as possible.
<BR>
I understand that, in the case of a number of studies, the Regional Planning Bodies are planning to take as long as six months to consider the study recommendations and submit advice to the Government. Since the Planning Bodies will have developed a good understanding of the key issues during the study process, I am not convinced that it is necessary to take this length of time to produce sound advice. I should therefore be grateful if, from now on, Regional Planning Bodies could normally aim to provide advice to Government within three months of receiving each study's recommendations. I realise that in some cases this may necessitate re-timing meetings of the full RPB. Nevertheless, given the need to maintain momentum in delivering the 10 Year Plan for Transport, I must ask you to do this where it is necessary to meet the three month deadline.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry for what reason the proposed transposition of the EU e-commerce Directive into UK law, as set out in the Government's consultation document, is materially different from the form of transposition adopted by Germany. [54877]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20524w09.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Alexander: </B> 
 The aim of transposition is to reproduce faithfully the meaning of a Directive in&#151;and in accordance with the practice of&#151;national legislation. Member States may therefore adopt different wording in order to achieve the same effect and often do so. Whatever the textual differences, the Government's understanding is that the German legislation transposing the E-Commerce Directive has the same intention as the draft UK Regulations on which public consultation closed on 2 May. The Government is now considering whether the wording of the UK Regulations giving effect to that intention can be improved.

 The Department has worked closely with all branches of Government, including the Office of the e-Envoy and the Cabinet Office, in formulating its approach to, and proposals for, implementing the E-Commerce Directive and will continue to do so in finalising those proposals in the light of responses to the recent public consultation.

 Parcelforce Worldwide is losing &#163;15 million per month.

Closure of Dartford depot in August will result in business moving to a nearby facility in Charlton.

<a name="20524w11.html_spnew6"><B> Alan Johnson: </B> 
 It is for the Regional Development Agencies to determine how best to deliver their Regional Economic Strategies, in consultation with their regional partners. Under the Single Budget, operating since 1 April this year, the Agencies have much greater flexibility to target their resources on regional priorities, which may include appropriate tourism-linked measures. However, corporate planning guidance issued to the Agencies in October 2001 set out the Government's expectations of the Agencies in terms of the development and implementation from April 2002 of sustainable tourism strategies. We expect that Regional Development agencies will take account of the importance of capital investment in their regions in planning all their activities, including those related to tourism.

 <i>[holding answer 22 May 2002]:</i> The transport of MOX fuel at all stages is subject to the most stringent regulation. The Government's security advisers have assessed the potential threats posed to this shipment and are satisfied that the thorough precautions taken to prevent theft or sabotage are adequate and make the security risks associated with the shipment negligible. The precautions taken are designed to cope with all credible threats and comply with all relevant international obligations and recommendations on the physical protection of nuclear material and ensure that the security risks associated with this shipment are negligible. The shipment is accompanied by armed police officers from the United Kingdoms Atomic Energy Authority Constabulary who are trained to deal with any threats to the transportation.

We are happy to take forward those recommendations which fall to the Department of Trade and Industry. The report does, however, conclude that there is no evidence to support the view that there is a serious problem in relation to confidence in the supply of information security consultancy services.

 Many of the recommendations arising from the Review of Byelaws for the Coast published in 1998 do not require legislation and we have given them priority.

Sport England is writing to the relevant sports governing bodies encouraging them to continue to promote good practice among their members. We are also planning to produce a comprehensive guide for local authorities on their powers and responsibilities. The guide will include examples of successful mixes of voluntary and legislative action by local authorities to regulate recreational activity on the coast.

While there is a significant minority of local authorities who have not produced statements, many of them are understood to have little or no flood and coastal defence responsibilities. Nevertheless there are some local authorities who have more significant responsibilities and we will be working with the Environment Agency and Local Government Association in encouraging them to produce statements.
<P>

<a name="20524w13.html_para4">On target 2, I note that overall some two-thirds of the Environment Agency's severe flood warnings were issued in accordance with their service standards. This is encouraging especially in the face of the severe demands of the 2000 floods. The Agency nevertheless recognise that there is room for improvement and are working on a new investment strategy. It is also worth recording that since Autumn 2000 a further 322,000 properties are covered by the Agency's flood warning arrangements.
<P>

<a name="20524w13.html_para5">On target 3, programmes of emergency exercises were disrupted by the 2000 floods, foot and mouth disease and, to some extent, the events of September 11. Nevertheless 22 emergency exercises were carried out in 2001 and lessons learned from them are identified in the report. 27 local or regional exercises are planned for this year and a national exercise is planned for 2003. I am also pleased to note that good progress has been made in ensuring that local emergency plans cover flooding and that there are arrangements in hand for these to be reviewed, particularly to cover the local sources of flooding and provision of sandbags.
<P>

<a name="20524w13.html_para6">On target 9, the report shows that flood and coastal defence works have resulted in net gains in a number of habitats covered by Biodiversity Action Plans. This work is often alleged to be damaging to the environment but the report provides evidence to the contrary. While this is very encouraging, work is in hand to ensure more rigorous collection of this information for future reports.
<P>

<a name="20524w13.html_para7">I expect to publish further reports later this year. We will also be working with the operating authorities in reviewing the operation of high level targets with a view to refining and extending the initiative.

 In his capacity as the Departmental Accounting Officer, the Permanent Secretary for DEFRA has secured the assurance of the BBSRC, IAH's sponsoring organisation, that the sum of &#163;100,000 has been invested to examine and improve quality control procedures for the specialist work that IAH carries out on behalf of DEFRA. This investment equates to the value of the work which IAH undertook into the TSE experiments. There were unique features surrounding this particular experiment and we recognise the outstanding contribution that IAH has made in this field of research. I believe that this outcome satisfactorily resolves the issues for both the Department and the Institute.

<P>
<a name="20524w13.html_wqn2"><B> Mrs. May: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what advice she has received from the Government Office for the South East on the use of her powers to create an order for a footpath under the flood arch on the A404 at Bisham, Berkshire, as a diversion of footpath Bisham. [58825]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20524w13.html_spnew2"><B> Alun Michael </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 23 May 2002]:</i> The question refers to a footpath (Bisham 9) which crosses the A404 near Maidenhead, a busy dual carriageway which links the M4 and M40. Although the path is well used and traffic speeds are typically 60&#150;70 mph, no crossing facilities are provided. Accidents have occurred and the situation is recognised as being dangerous. It was suggested by the Ramblers Association that a culvert under the road a short distance away could be used by walkers. The Highways agency has no objection to this, but it would require the diversion of the path to the culvert crossing point. The Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead, as highway authority, made a diversion order under S119 of the Highways Act, but when the landowner objected they withdrew the order, rather than sending to the Secretary of State for confirmation. Instead, they proposed a new route taking the path some half a kilometre along the road to another culvert, which is already to be used as a crossing for another path. The Ramblers say that the alternative path is circuitous, inconvenient and inferior to their proposed route in many ways. It would also leave the present dangerous crossing point open. From the information that we gathered from the parties concerned, there appears to be some justification in these criticisms, I have asked lawyers for advice on these issues in order to come to a conclusion on the way forward as quickly as possible.

Planning applications affecting playing fields can often involve a change of use that benefits sport rather than resulting in the outright sale of playing fields or their development. It should also be noted that where planning permission is granted this does not necessarily mean that the proposed development or change of use went ahead. Comprehensive data is not collected centrally on whether planning applications are actually implemented.<P>

<P>
<a name="20524w15.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Nicholas Brown: </B> 
 We have introduced a range of initiatives, including the New Deals, to help people move from dependence on benefits to independence through work. Our new Jobcentre Plus service brings together benefits and employment to provide an integrated work-focused service to ensure that all people of working age claiming benefits are aware of the help and support available to enable them to move into work. There are also 63 Action Teams for Jobs in some of the most deprived areas of the UK. Action Teams provide tailored support to enable people on all working age benefits to move back to work.
<P>

<a name="20524w15.html_para0">In 1997 the number of workless households in Great Britain stood at 3,174,000. The most recent information for 2001 shows this figure has fallen to 2,952,500, a decrease of 221,500 (7.0 per cent).

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions which wards of the City of Newcastle upon Tyne are covered by the services of Employment Action teams; what criteria were used to determine the coverage of the teams; who set those criteria; and whether they are under review. [51486]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20524w15.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Nicholas Brown: </B> 
 The wards being targeted by the Newcastle upon Tyne Action Team for Jobs are Monkchester, West City, Walker, Byker, Elswick, Benwell, Scotswood, Woolsington, Fawdon, and Kenton. They were selected because their working age employment rate was 58.5 per cent or below. The selection criteria were set by labour market economists in the former Department for Education and Employment and agreed by the Treasury. The wards targeted by the Action Team will be reviewed if there is significant depopulation in any of them.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions how much on average of the resources allocated to New Deal training is spent on <i>(a)</i> training and <i>(b)</i> administration. [53742]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20524w15.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Nicholas Brown: </B> 
 The full contract price is payable to New Deal providers. It is not possible to identify separately how much of their funding providers allocate to administration and how much to training. In some circumstances the provider may subcontract some of the training provision. Where this is the case, the provider may retain a management or administration fee. We do not specify the amount that should be retained for this purpose, but we would not expect it to exceed 10 per cent of the contract price. Where an administration fee is retained, it is normally around 6 per cent of the contract price. The appropriateness of the level of administration is assessed as part of the contract tendering process.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20524w15.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Nicholas Brown: </B> 
 We keep the level of New Deal administration under constant review. Significant reductions have already been made, for example, in the number of forms needing completion. We are looking at ways to reduce administrative burdens even further. For instance, we are considering how we can use information technology more effectively as a means of exchanging information between providers and Jobcentre Plus.

 Providers are already subject to contractual and quality audits, which cover their administrative arrangements.

<i>Notes for tables:</i><P>

1. All figures are estimates and are taken from the Households Below Average Income (HBAI) series, which is derived from the Family Resources Survey (FRS). The FRS does not include Northern Ireland, and the latest year for which data is available is 2000&#150;01.<P>

2. The estimates are sample counts, which have been adjusted for non-response using multipurpose grossing factors. Estimates are subject to both sampling error and to variability in non-response. The income measure used is weekly net (disposable) equivalised household income (that is to say income that is adjusted to reflect the composition of the household).<P>

3. The estimates are presented on both a Before Housing Costs (BHC) and an After Housing Costs (AHC) basis in line with HBAI conventions. Figures are provided excluding the self-employed, as research suggests that, for self-employed people, income as reported in surveys is often a poor indicator of living standards. HBAI convention is to present results excluding the self-employed, presenting results including the self-employed where the two differ significantly.<P>

 Individual members can already transfer their funds to alternative providers if they wish to do so.

 The primary school performance tables are wholly inclusive and as such report on the achievements of all pupils at the end of Key Stage 2&#151;including those absent on the day of the tests. For some schools this can have an effect on the percentage of pupils achieving Level 4 or above. The qualitative average point score, however, disregards pupils absent on the day of the tests, which redresses the balance of information presented in the tables.

 <i>[holding answer 14 May 2002]:</i> The latest published information covering 2000 is contained in the annual report "Analysis of Sickness Absence in the Civil Service" published by the Cabinet Office. That report shows an average number of working days sickness absence per staff year of 9.9 days for non-industrial civil servants. The Treasury figure was 3.9 days per staff year. Around 14 per cent of sick absence in 2000 in the Treasury was for mental health conditions (including stress) and around 4 per cent was for stress. Information on costs could only be provided at a disproportionate cost. The Treasury has a legal obligation to provide a safe working environment for all employees and is committed to minimising the number of working days lost generally due to work related injuries and illness.

 The Government announced more detailed plans for the Child Trust Fund and Saving Gateway in <i>Delivering Saving and Assets,</i> published in November 2001. This document also raised some questions about the Child Trust Fund for further consultation and announced the Government's intention to pilot the Saving Gateway.
<P>

<a name="20524w18.html_para0">As set out in <i>Delivering Saving and Assets,</i> eligibility for the Saving Gateway is intended to be through a "passport" to an existing working-age benefit, tax credit or measure of income used in a tax credit. The number of people who could benefit from the national Saving Gateway will depend on the exact eligibility criteria chosen. As stated in <i>Delivering Saving and Assets,</i> the Government believes that it is important for low-income savers in the Saving Gateway to be able to withdraw their own savings without restriction, to ensure that they have access to their financial assets in order to meet unexpected needs. For this and other reasons, the Government believes that the Saving Gateway should be a cash-based account, as stated in <i>Delivering Saving and Assets.</i> When a Saving Gateway account matures, it is intended that savers will be able to access the Government's "matched contribution" without restriction. Although methods for making deposits into the Saving Gateway remain to be decided, easy accessibility will be very important. In line with the results from previous consultation, the Government stated in <i>Delivering Saving and Assets</i> that the optimum model for delivering the Saving Gateway would be for a single provider, ideally with a branch network. Such a provider might be either a single financial services or a consortium of providers operating in some form of partnership. Decisions on the respective roles of the private sector, including mutual societies, and arrangements to encourage innovation have not been taken.
<P>

<a name="20524w18.html_para1">Pilots for the Saving Gateway are being established. They will be used to test aspects of the delivery of the Saving Gateway. The pilots require the involvement of a financial service provider with branches to operate the accounts. The Government raised this issue with the British Bankers Association and Building Societies Association, and requested these organisations to ask their members to indicate whether they would be interested in participating. After discussions with a small number of potential partners, the Government accepted an offer from Halifax to provide the required branches, branch staff and account management systems for the pilots. Eligibility for savers to participate in the Saving Gateway pilots in the areas selected will be based on criteria reflecting the intention for the national Saving Gateway to be available through a "passport" to an existing working-age benefit, tax credit or measure of income used in a tax credit.
<P>

<a name="20524w18.html_para2">In <i>Delivering Saving and Assets,</i> the Government states that it sees a key role for private sector financial service providers, including mutual societies, in delivering the Child Trust Fund, including aspects relating to financial education. The document presents two options for the involvement of financial services providers: open market competition and a licensed provider approach. Consultation on these two different models is now closed and the Government will be reporting back on the results of this consultation, including an analysis of these options, 



<P>
<P><I>24 May 2002 : Column 665W</I><P>
in due course. <i>Delivering Saving and Assets</i> indicated that the Government does not intend that the use of assets from a maturing Child Trust Fund at maturity will be restricted. The Government has not taken any decisions about arrangements, if any, for children born before the launch of the Child Trust Fund. Most children in the UK are not liable for income or capital gains tax because they do not earn incomes, from saving or other sources, to take them above the relevant thresholds. Parents can currently save on behalf of their children in a variety of tax-advantaged ways.

 <i>(a)</i> Ahead of assuming its full powers on 1 December 2001, the Financial Ombudsman Service consolidated and revised the different procedures that the eight predecessor schemes had in place for handling complaints against themselves. The Financial Ombudsman Service Board appointed an Independent Assessor on 1 December 2001 and, in the period since his appointment up to 31 March 2002, he received 50 complaints. Of these, 12 were upheld (in whole or in part), 14 were rejected, 8 were determined to be outside the Independent Assessor's terms of reference and 16 awaited a decision. Earlier figures for complaints against the eight predecessor schemes are incomplete. <i>(b)</i> Of the 50 complaints received by the Independent Assessor, none came from the Blackpool South constituency (postcodes FY4, FY3 and FY1).

<a name="20524w20.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Leslie: </B> 
 Task forces, ad hoc advisory groups and reviews are by their nature created to provide advice on a particular subject or subject area.

Many of them give their time and efforts freely, though precise details are not held centrally.

<P>
<a name="20524w20.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Leslie: </B> 
 The post of the Commissioner for Public Appointments was established by the previous administration in 1995, in response to a recommendation made by the Committee on Standards in Public Life in its 



<P>
<P><I>24 May 2002 : Column 670W</I><P>
First Report (Cm 2580). The Commissioner is appointed by the Queen under the Public Appointments Order in Council 1995, as amended by the Public Appointments Order in Council 1998, and is independent of both the Government and the Civil Service.
<P>

<a name="20524w20.html_para0">The present Commissioner is Dame Rennie Fritchie, who was appointed for an original three-year term in 1999, and who has since been re-appointed to serve a further three-year term from March 2002 to February 2005.

<a name="20524w20.html_para1">Dame Rennie was previously Chair of Gloucester Health Authority from 1988&#150;1992; South-Western Regional Health Authority from 1992&#150;1994; South and Western Region NHS Executive (formerly South and Western Regional Health Authority) from 1994&#150;1997. There is no requirement on holders of this office to record their political affiliation, if any. I am advised by the Commissioner's Office that the postal district of Dame Rennie's place of residence is GL1.
<P>

<a name="20524w20.html_para2">In April 2001, the Government established an independent NHS Appointments Commission. At present there are around 4,000 chairs and non-executives on NHS boards whose appointments are now the responsibility of the Commission.

Details of previous public appointments that they have held are contained in the press releases announcing their appointments, copies of which are in the libraries of the House. There is no requirement on the Chair or the Regional Commissioners to record their political affiliation, if any.

 Regional observatories are independent entities formed by partnerships of regional organisations, including academic institutions, regional assemblies, regional development agencies, and Government Offices for the Regions. They aim to share the production, analysis and dissemination of intelligence and research related to regional policy. No Government department has responsibility for overseeing them.

Disability Facilities

<P>
<a name="20524w21.html_wqn9"><B> Lynne Jones: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health what impact he expects the budget announcement on health and social services spending to have on waiting time for disability facilities grants. [53315]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20524w21.html_spnew6"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 The extra cash will help to bring on line the extra capacity that the National Health Service needs to make care better and faster for patients. We would not expect a direct impact on disabled facilities grants because these are mandatory grants provided by housing departments with part funding by the Department for Transport, Local Government, and the Regions.
<P>
<P>
<a name="20524w21.html_wqn10"><B> Lynne Jones: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health, pursuant to the answer of 2 May 2002, <i>Official Report,</i> column 994W, on disability facilities, if the provision of walk-in showers is included in the national project; and if he will make a statement. [58351]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20524w21.html_spnew7"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 The provision of walk-in showers requires building work of a permanent and substantial nature, and these are usually arranged by councils' housing departments. Such major adaptations are often 



<P>
<P><I>24 May 2002 : Column 680W</I><P>
facilitated through disabled facilities grants. They are usually beyond the scope of equipment services, and so housing departments are outside the remit of the project to integrate community equipment services. When statutory services decide what to provide, the guiding principle should be to meet individually assessed needs.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health, pursuant to his answer of 11 March, <i>Official Report,</i> column 806W, on information for health strategy, what assessment he has made of the report by Professor Protti on the Information for Health Strategy; and if he will place a copy of the report in the Library. [53195]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20524w21.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The report from Professor Protti is still under consideration. It is informing the preparation of the delivery plan for information and information technology that the Department is preparing as part of taking forward "Delivering the NHS Plan", published in April 2002. Professor Protti's report will be put in the public domain after our delivery plan for information and IT has been announced later in the year.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what assessment he has made of the connection between the level of deprivation in an area and the quality of its primary care facilities. [53368]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20524w22.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 Reducing health inequalities is a key Government priority. It is widely recognised that primary care facilities in relatively deprived localities are generally poorer than elsewhere. We are addressing this by targeting resources and management capacity through the National Health Service resource allocation formula, additional specific funding for general practitioners' premises and the NHS local investment finance trust initiative.

1. The figures shown in the table are not a true reflection of beds in the Newcastle and North Tyneside Health Authority area as in its area it may contain hospitals that come under a different NHS Trust whose main site may fall into a different health authority.<P>

2. The mental health services provided by Newcastle City Health and Northumberland Mental Health Trust merged on the 1 April 2001, to form Newcastle, North Tyneside and Northumberland Mental Health NHS Trust.<P>

3. North Tyneside Health Care NHS Trust does not appear for 2000&#150;01 as it merged in 1998 with Northumberland Community Health and Cheviot and Wansbeck to form Northumbria Healthcare NHS Trust. The main site for the newly formed NHS Trust falls into another Health Authority.<P>

 Since 1997 the Department of Health and Medical Research Council (MRC) invested approximately &#163;370,000 on research projects relevant to myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS/ME).
<P>

<a name="20524w22.html_para0">In addition to specific projects, the Department provides support for research commissioned by charities and the research councils that takes place in the National Health Service. Management of much of the research supported by NHS research & development funding is devolved and expenditure at project level is not held centrally by the Department. The total investment is considerably greater than the spend on directly commissioned projects.
<P>

<a name="20524w22.html_para1">There are currently no plans to commission a national epidemiology study. The Department has asked the MRC to develop a broad strategy for advancing biomedical and health services research on CFS/ME.
<P>

<a name="20524w22.html_para2">It is the role of primary care trusts, to decide what services to provide for their populations including those with CFS/ME. They are best placed to understand local health needs and commission services to meet them.

Section 2 of the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act 1970 places local authorities under a duty to arrange services for individual disabled people where they are satisfied that they are necessary to meet the person's needs. The services concerned include practical assistance in the home; recreational facilities; assistance in travelling to services; assistance in arranging adaptations to the home, or the provision of additional facilities designed to secure greater safety, comfort or convenience; facilitating the taking of holidays; the provision of meals and the provision of a telephone and any special equipment necessary to enable the disabled person to use it.
<P>

<a name="20524w22.html_para3">Entitlement to benefit is not dependent on a claimant having any particular diagnosis but the resulting care and mobility needs in the case of Disability Living Allowance or its effects on the person's ability to perform prescribed work-related function in the Personal Capability Assessment for incapacity benefits. Where a clinical diagnosis of CFS/ME has been made full account will be taken of its disabling effects.

 Standard six of the national service framework for older people requires that "the National Health Service working in partnership with councils, takes action to prevent falls and reduce resultant fractures or other injuries in their populations of older people.

It sets milestones for ensuring the delivery of this standard by:

<P>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>
<BR>
April 2003 local health care providers (health, social services and the independent sector) should have audited their procedures and put in place risk management procedures to reduce the risk of older people falling.
<BR>
April 2004 the Health Improvement Plan, and other relevant local plans developed with local authority and independent sector partners, should include the development of an integrated falls service.
<BR>
April 2005 all local health and social care systems should have established this service.

 <i>[holding answer 21 May 2002]:</i> Both physical activity and eating habits play a role in overweight and obesity. We have put in place major cross Government programmes of work to improve access to opportunities to participate in a wide range of physical and sporting activities. This includes &#163;581 million from the New Opportunities Fund for a physical education and sports programme. We recently announced the launch of a new &#163;2.5 million programme on access to physical activity, which is being developed with Sport England and the Countryside Agency. The work forms part of a partnership between the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Health.
<P>

<a name="20524w24.html_para0">This programme will support local strategies on promoting physical activity and reducing overweight and obesity which are already being developed as part of the national service framework for coronary heart disease.
<P>

<a name="20524w24.html_para1">The National Audit Office report "Tackling Obesity in England", published last year, looked into the prevalence and costs of obesity, and the causes of the problem. The report highlighted that changes in eating patterns and increasingly sedentary lifestyles are the main reasons for the rising trend in obesity.

 The main Government agency for research into the causes of and treatments for disease is the Medical Research Council (MRC), which receives its funding via the Department of Trade and Industry.

 When a patient dies in a National Health Service (NHS) hospital, the hospital is responsible for the care of the body until that responsibility can be transferred, either to the executors or administrators or other persons with the duty of disposing of the body, or to the coroner. The NHS does not charge the public for this care.
<P>

<a name="20524w25.html_para3">We do not hold separate information on the level of investment in NHS mortuaries, which are funded through the general allocation to the NHS. Public mortuaries are run and financed by local authorities. Such mortuaries, therefore, are not operated by the NHS.

 On 9 May 2002, the Police Negotiating Board (PNB) agreed a package of reforms to police pay and conditions of service. The PNB is the statutory negotiating body for police pay and conditions throughout the United Kingdom.
<P>

<a name="20524w26.html_para1">As part of a package of reforms, the Police Advisory Board in England and Wales will, during 2002, come to an arrangement through amendments to Police Efficiency Regulations where the aim is to secure improvement in attendance, with sanctions (including the possibility of dismissal) where that fails. The arrangement will include an appropriate appeals mechanism.
<P>

<a name="20524w26.html_para2">It is for Scottish Ministers to make changes to regulations governing conditions of service in Scottish police forces. Scotland has its own Police Advisory Board.
<P>

<a name="20524w26.html_para3">The changes to regulations form part of a range of measures to improve and modernise police pay and conditions of service. The package agreed on 9 May 2002 will provide a modernised pay structure rewarding those at the sharp end and reducing reliance on overtime. In so doing, it both underpins the rest of the police reform programme and demonstrates the Government's commitment to invest in the police service to achieve the reforms needed and to give it the support and flexibility it requires to deliver a first-class service to the public.

<a name="20524w26.html_para4">The possibility of a ring-fenced allowance for officers involved in diplomatic protection, surveillance, undercover and kidnap work was an idea considered during the negotiations in the PNB when it was proposed to reduce premium rates of pay. Officers in those four areas would have been hardest hit from reductions in premium rates of pay, and, because the nature of their work requires them to stay on duty for long periods at a time, a ring-fenced allowance would have been one means

<P>

<a name="20524w26.html_para5">The Agreement included a scheme to manage down overtime in the service. There will be a service-wide target of a 15 per cent reduction in the overtime bill over the three years from 2003&#150;04. There will be local targets, taking account of force strength and effective management action already taken to manage down the overtime bill.

(1) There was a boundary change on 1 April 2000 in which some parts of the Metropolitan police area were transferred to Essex, Hertfordshire and Surrey, so that the police force areas followed county boundaries thereafter.

 Section 122 of the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 sets out the Parliamentary requirement for a Committee to undertake a review of the Act. The Committee will report to me when they have completed their work. The Act requires them to deliver this by 14 December 2003.
<P>

<a name="20524w27.html_para3">There are no powers for the Committee to compel individuals or organisations to provide information. But the Government would expect and encourage those individuals and organisations who are approached to co-operate fully with any request made to them by the Committee. All questions of procedure and staffing are

<a name="20524w28.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Wray: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what plans he has to introduce a vehicle homicide charge, with sentence, for those who cause death by dangerous driving whilst having no insurance, MOT or driving licence and are consistently driving offenders; and if he will make a statement.[56270]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20524w28.html_spnew0"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 The current offence of gross negligence manslaughter, which carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment, is appropriate where the driving in question falls so far below the required standard that it amounts to criminal negligence and applies irrespective of the drivers insurance, MOT or licence status. The law of manslaughter is currently under review. Our current proposals for reforming the law are detailed in the consultation paper "Reforming the law on Involuntary Manslaughter: the Government's Proposals" (a copy of which is available in the Library). The proposals do not include the introduction of a specific vehicular manslaughter offence.
<P>

<a name="20524w28.html_para0">If the offender's driving falls far below the required standard but not so far as to support gross negligence manslaughter, the appropriate charge could be causing death by dangerous driving. The maximum penalty 



<P>
<P><I>24 May 2002 : Column 704W</I><P>
available for this offence is currently 10 years' imprisonment. This penalty is under consideration as part of the Government's Review Of Road Traffic Penalties.
<P>

<a name="20524w28.html_para1">As part of the sentencing framework reform, building on the recommendations of the report "Making Punishments Work" published in July 2001, we are looking at ensuring that those who commit offences of violence that carry a maximum penalty of life imprisonment, such as motor manslaughter, will receive that sentence if the court takes the view that they present significant risks of further serious harm to the public.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what the incidence of racially motivated crimes <i>(a)</i> per 1,000 population and <i>(b)</i> in total were in each police authority area in Wales and England in each year since 1997. [56272]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20524w28.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The information requested is given in the attached table. Information on the number of racist incidents for all police force areas is published annually in the Home Office publication under Section 95 of the Criminal Justice Act 1991, Statistics on Race and the Criminal Justice system. Comparisons between the number of racist incidents and resident population may be misleading since this does not adequately describe those people likely to be at risk of being the victim of a racist incident in an area.

 As the Air wave service is rolled out across the United Kingdom, its features will be enhanced by a series of software upgrades. In mid 2003, a software upgrade will provide the potential for full national compatibility.

<a name="20524w28.html_para2">In Lancashire Constabulary and Greater Manchester Police, an interim arrangement has been put in place. Where appropriate, their radios are being programmed to enable officers to communicate with either force control room.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20524w28.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 Government, police and football authorities have worked closely together to make our football stadia among the safest and most secure in the world and to marginalise hooliganism. It has never been claimed that the phenomenon has been eradicated and it is evident that certain clubs continue to attract a disproportionate number of potential troublemakers. Tough legislation is in place for dealing with miscreants and, prior to next season, Government will be hosting discussions with key policing and football agencies to identify what further action is required.

We are seeking to build around four centres of 750 people each to a total capacity of 3,000, although one of the centres may be smaller during the trial period.

 I understand that Derbyshire Constabulary are making extensive enquiries to assess whether or not the allegations made can be substantiated; and that Her Majesty's Customs and Excise and the Health and Safety Executive are also seeking to establish whether there have been breaches of the legislation for which they are responsible.

We understand from the National Criminal Intelligence Service (NCIS) that there is no evidence to suggest that the United Kingdom (UK) is being specifically or significantly targeted by producers in East Asia although small quantities of crystal methylamphetamine has been intercepted from the Philippines. It is believed that most UK seizures are produced within Europe.

<P>
<a name="20524w29.html_spnew8"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 Section 24 of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 creates a criminal offence for the unauthorised disclosure of confidential information relating to the use of animals in scientific procedures by Home Office Ministers and officials, members of the Animal Procedures Committee and others appointed for specific purposes under the Act, other than for the purposes of carrying out functions under the Act. The maximum punishment is two years imprisonment. Following the enactment of the Freedom of Information Act 2000, all statutory bars to the disclosure of information are being reviewed, including section 24 of the 1986 Act.

<a name="20524w29.html_para1">For some time now the Government has taken the position that greater openness and transparency regarding the regulation and use of animals in scientific procedures is desirable, providing it does not jeopardise the safety of individual scientists and their establishments or their legitimate commercial and intellectual interests. I am continuing my consideration of how these commitments can best be met. I hope to make a decision on whether to repeal or amend section 24 by the summer.

 <i>[holding answer 21 May 2002]:</i> The Home Office review of anti-social behaviour orders was published on 2 April 2002. This review found that ASBOs are being used successfully to reduce anti-social behaviour and increased public confidence in the partner agencies. The review also found that the use of ASBOs was not consistent between areas and the Government is taking a range of steps in the Police Reform Bill to make anti-social behaviour orders more effective. They include:

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>
<BR>
an interim order which will protect the community at the start of the court process.
<BR>
allowing ASBOs to cover a wider geographical area which will remove the need for repeat applications.

allowing ASBOs to be made in county courts and on conviction in criminal courts and thereby reducing the number of times witnesses need to appear and avoiding the need for a separate court process.

<P>

<a name="20524w30.html_para1">It should be noted that recorded violent crime is subject to changes in reporting and recording. For example, the 2001 British Crime Survey found that, over England and Wales as a whole, reporting to the police of common assault rose from 29 per cent in 1999 to 39 per cent in the year 2000. Also, the British Crime Survey has shown that, in England and Wales as a whole, the number of common assaults recorded in the survey decreased by 14 per cent between the 1999 and 2000 calendar years, whereas common assaults recorded by the police increased by an estimated nine per cent. Common assaults recorded by the police may therefore not necessarily be a reflection of the real level of this offence.

 There is close liaison with the governments and police of European countries competing in the World Cup. England will have around 8,000 supporters in Japan for the first phase of the tournament, but other European countries will have much lower levels of support. Hooligans are not expected to feature among their number. It is for each country to determine whether the behaviour of its supporters warrants the introduction of measures to prevent hooligans from travelling to such tournaments. To date, only Germany has felt it necessary or appropriate to introduce measures comparable to those in place in England and Wales, though a number of European governments are currently reviewing their football-related legislation.

 <i>[holding answer 21 May 2002]:</i> Work by the Home Office suggests that while many deprived areas do also have high crime rates a significant number do not and some deprived areas have in fact very low crime rates. 66 of the 88 Neighbourhood Renewal Fund areas are also in the top 88 for combined crime rates but 22 (i.e. quarter) are not and of those 22, seven have combined crime rates that are significantly lower than the mean for England.

<a name="20524w30.html_para2">Conversely some local authorities with significant crime problems are not in the 88 most deprived areas. These are typically city centres or local commercial areas.

From 1990 to 1995, statistics on the strength of the special constabulary in England and Wales were collected by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary. These were compiled at the end of the calendar year until 1993, and then for the financial year 1994&#150;95. Since 1995, these statistics have been collected by the Home Office Research Development and Statistics Directorate. They are compiled at the end of March and September each year.

Figures to March 1995 supplied by HMIC, figures from September 1995 supplied by Home Office Research, Development and Statistics Directorate. Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary.<P>

The government is committed to reversing this decline in numbers and achieving a stronger, increasingly professional special constabulary. Measures to achieve this include: A new headline role focusing on intelligence led patrolling and crime reduction initiatives; a new national foundation training package for special constables; joint Home Office/The Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) good practice guidance covering recruitment, management and deployment of specials; new conditions of service and conduct regulations.<P>

In January 2002 we ran a press campaign targeting Specials as part of the national recruitment campaign for the regular Police Service. And as my right hon. Friend, the Home Secretary (Mr. Blunkett) also announced at the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) last week, we will also be working with employers to encourage them to support employees who are specials&#151;in particular by giving them extra paid leave to carry out their police duties<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what plans he has to make 20 mph speed limits enforceable by the police with fixed penalty notices; and if he will make a statement. [56600]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20524w31.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Denham </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 21 May 2002]:</i> 20 mph speed limits are already enforceable by the police with fixed penalty notices.
<P>

<a name="20524w31.html_para4">The Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) issued publicly available guidelines on speed enforcement in February 2000. These suggest that normally a fixed penalty notice should be issued when, in a 20 mph zone, a driver's speed reaches 25 mph. The police will however, use their discretion to take account of the particular circumstances of any individual speeding offence.
<P>

<a name="20524w31.html_para5">20 mph speed limit zones are normally engineered by the use of road humps, chicanes, etc. to be predominantly self-enforcing.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

This table contains full-time equivalent figures that have been rounded to the nearest whole number. Because of rounding, there may be an apparent discrepancy between totals and the sums of the constituent items.<P>

It does not include officers on secondment to NCS/NCIS and their predecessors or to any central service organisation. This is because it is not possible to differentiate between English and Welsh police officers on secondment from Home Office records.<P>

* These forces have been affected by the boundary changes which took place in April 2000.<P>
