For example, last year the World Bank committed $860 million in these areas, but it needs to do more. The banks also need to look at their entire investment portfolios including lending for fossil fuels and help Governments make the right choices about their energy mix to underpin sustainable growth and poverty reduction. We expect this analysis to contribute to a better understanding of how to minimise the impact of development investments on carbon emissions.</p>

 During the last five years the World Bank (International Development Association (IDA) and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development) provided around $1.2 billion (&#163;609 million) in financing for activities in fossil fuels. Around one-third of this is for policy work and mine closure programmes. Of the remaining two-thirds, around 80 per cent. is for investment in gas projects, including infrastructure investment such as storage and distribution. Loans for fossil fuel extraction from the Asian Development Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development amounted to $350 million (&#163;178 million) and &#8364;768 million (&#163;518 million) respectively.

 Lasting security in Somalia will only be possible with a credible political reconciliation process. We believe that the Transitional Federal Government (TFG) is the only body that can bring stability across Somalia, as envisaged by the Transitional Federal Charter. But we strongly believe it must be more inclusive and develop a broad base of clan acceptance if it is to succeed. Therefore, we have repeatedly stressed to the TFG that it should reach out to all Somalis who reject violence, regardless of clan and that the National Reconciliation Congress, now scheduled to start in mid July, represents an excellent opportunity to do this. My noble Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, Lord Triesman of Tottenham, made this point in person to President Yusuf when he visited the UK in February and to the Somali Foreign Minister on 7 June. The meeting of the International Contact Group in London on 6 June sent the same strong message to the TFG through the Somali Foreign Minister. We will continue to work for this.</p>

 Local transport plans (LTP) are the mechanism by which local authorities undertake transport improvements at the local level. The objectives of the East Sussex LTP include the reduction of congestion to improve the efficiency of the transport network, the protection of the environment and the improvement of access to services. East Sussex county council received over &#163;10 million from Government to implement its LTP in 2007-08. In Eastbourne the plan's objectives will be delivered via the Eastbourne local area transport strategy which is aimed at addressing local needs.</p>

East Sussex county council have reported that the Bexhill to Hastings Link Road estimated cost has increased to around &#163;89 million and the region are currently considering whether it is still a priority at the higher cost.

 Bidders for the franchises that are out to tender currently (East Midlands, West Midlands, New Cross Country and InterCity East Coast) are required to consider bike-rail integration and facilities at stations in their bid submissions.

The Cycling Policy document advises TOCs to facilitate the carriages of cycles on off-peak services and encourages the carriage of folding cycles at all times. However, I accept that during the peak hours, where capacity is under pressure, there will be occasions where it is in the interests of the majority of passengers not to permit non-folding cycles on board.</p>

However, TOCs are best placed to know where and when pressure on services exists and they must be free to impose restrictions accordingly, although I hope that such restrictions are carefully considered and kept to a minimum.</p>

 The decision to repeal section 75(1)(b) of the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1975, known as the &#147;contract exemption&#148;, was motivated by the paramount need to ensure the safety of those being carried under contracts for the hire of a Private Hire Vehicle (PHV).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_444"><a name="70619w0007.htm_para13"><a name="07061962000516">PHV licence fees are set by local licensing authorities and vary widely from area to area. Making reasonable assumptions about the numbers of drivers, vehicles and operators likely to be involved in total across all sectors, and about average licence fees, we estimate that the total cost will be about &#163;1 million.</p>

Furthermore, the proportion of licensing cost which will be passed on to those awarding contracts will depend on contracts terms in each case.</p>

 There was no specific assessment of the needs of people with lymphoma as part of the &#147;Our Health, Our Care, Our Say&#148; White Paper. The White Paper's broad focus meant it did not deal with specific illnesses, but focussed instead on principles that would improve care for all patients such as greater integration between health and social care, more treatment in the community and better preventative and early intervention services.</p>

 The exact number of cetaceans killed or injured at sea every year is unknown, as it is not feasible to monitor all cetacean deaths. As such, I am unable to estimate the proportion of cetaceans killed or injured at sea that are washed ashore. In any event, this will be influenced by several factors, including distance from shore and the prevailing weather and sea conditions over a period of time.</p>

The annual proportion of UK-stranded harbour porpoises diagnosed as by-catches varied between 11 per cent. and 25 per cent. in the 2002-06 period. The proportion of UK-stranded common dolphins diagnosed as by-catch varied between 57-77 per cent. for the same period. The majority of these by-catches (for both species) occurred in SW England during the winter months. Although the annual numbers of harbour porpoises and common dolphin strandings reported in SW England has increased since the 1990s, a number of factors (particularly increased observer effort and possible changes in abundance and distribution of these species) are suspected to have played a role in this increase.</p>

Further analysis of the effectiveness of the 12 mile ban on sea bass pair trawling will be undertaken as more data become available.

 Local authorities are required to report quarterly data on municipal waste (encompassing household waste) to WasteDataFlow. When reporting data, authorities should specify the amount of waste collected for recycling that is subsequently rejected, at the point of collection, at a Materials Recycling Facility (MRF), or at the gate of the reprocessor.

The overall typical spread of reject rates for MRFs was from 5 per cent. to 25 per cent., with 10 to 15 per cent. being an average.

<p><a name="stpa_512"><a name="70619w0016.htm_para1"><a name="07061968000685">There is no evidence in published studies to indicate a causal link between an increase in flies or rodents as a result of alternate week collection. The characteristics of a location will influence the rodent population and simple hygiene practices can directly prevent or reduce rat and fly populations. An independent, DEFRA-funded research study on the use of alternate weekly collection services, carried out by Enviros Consulting and Cranfield university in 2006, drew the same conclusions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_513"><a name="70619w0016.htm_para2"><a name="07061968000686">Proper design of an alternate weekly collection service should avoid any increase in nuisance to householders. The waste and resources action programme is currently updating its guidance for local authorities on the design and implementation of alternate weekly collection services, in order to minimise nuisance and health risks.</p>

 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, and Defra Ministers, have held discussions recently with colleagues from other Departments, such as the Department of Trade and Industry and the Department for Work and Pensions, on the subject of greening the workplace, as part of the wider discussions on climate change. In addition, Defra co-chairs the Trade Union Sustainable Development Advisory Committee (TUSDAC) with the General Secretary of Prospect. Green workplace, energy and climate change issues are raised through this forum.</p>

 On 11 June at the Agriculture and Fisheries Council European Ministers accepted unanimously a recovery plan for the European eel. This plan has been in development since 2003 and its agreement at Council was vital if we are to see a recovery of a stock that has seen recruitment drop to 1-5 per cent. of historic level (pre-1980s).</p>

 The latest information from the Commission is that they intend to prepare two proposals for regulations concerning fishing opportunities: one relating to stocks in the Baltic sea to be presented in September 2007; and the other covering stocks in the Northeast Atlantic in November 2007, following receipt of the second instalment of the annual scientific advice from ICES in October. New proposals about deep-sea stocks are unlikely, as Council Regulation (EC) No. 2015/2006, concerning fishing opportunities for deep-sea species, already covers both 2007 and 2008.</p>

 In most cases, the UK seeks to follow the scientific advice from ICES on the appropriate catch level for a particular stock. However, there are some cases where, while accepting the ICES stock assessment, the UK does not agree with the management advice suggested by ICES. For example, additional information may be available from other sources, which suggests a different approach.</p>

Animals (Transport) (England) Order 2006, requires all transporters of livestock to avoid animals suffering from extremes of temperature. For journeys of more than eight hours, vehicles must be designed to maintain temperatures of between 5°C and 30°C (+/- 5°C). However, for journeys solely within the UK, we have a derogation from the lower end of the scale until the time the vehicle is first moved and during any loading/unloading at intermediate points. This is because livestock often housed outdoors are accustomed to cold weather and the animals&#146; body heat quickly raises the temperature above 0°C.</p>

 I have regular discussions with European Union (EU) ministers on a range of issues, including animal welfare. DEFRA would prefer to avoid the close confinement of all sows, but there are currently no free-farrowing systems suitable for widespread commercial adoption. Farrowing crates protect piglets from being crushed by the sow&#151;one of the largest causes of pig mortality. It is equally important to maintain the welfare of the piglet as that of the sow.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_520"><a name="70619w0018.htm_para2"><a name="07061968001129">There is a time limit on how long sows may be kept in farrowing crates: from seven days before the predicted day of farrowing until the piglets are weaned. After this period sows in the UK must be moved back to loose housing accommodation in which they are free to turn around easily.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_521"><a name="70619w0018.htm_para3"><a name="07061968001130">We have funded research to test and develop commercially viable farrowing systems that provide adequate protection to piglets but do not closely confine the sow. As yet, the risk of piglet mortality in alternative systems remains unacceptably high. Our research will contribute to the European Food Safety Authority's examination of a range of issues, including farrowing systems, leading up to the next review of the EU Directive on pig welfare.</p>

 The Criteria Proposals Group (CPG) and Criteria Review Panel (CRP) were established on the basis of recommendations from the Royal Society, the Royal Academy of Engineering, the Geological Society, and the DEFRA Chief Scientific Advisor, Professor Sir Howard Dalton. Both were ad-hoc groups charged with developing criteria for inclusion in the forthcoming Managing Radioactive Waste Safely consultation document. CPG, led by Professor Peter Styles of Keele university, developed draft criteria. Its proposals were independently reviewed by CRP, led by Professor Howard Wheater of Imperial college, London. Selection of members of the groups was made on the basis of the need to involve high calibre expertise across the range of earth science and related disciplines. Members of the two groups were paid a daily rate for their work. The cost of the work is currently estimated to be of the order of &#163;40,000.</p>

 In March 2007 the Government published &#145;Heritage Protection for the 21st Century&#146;, which sets out proposals to strengthen and clarify protection for world heritage sites. These measures include a commitment to produce a planning circular which will clarify policy on world heritage sites including the use of buffer zones. This will be published for consultation later this year.</p>

In some cases, a comprehensive visual study may be appropriate as a tool for achieving this. In some cases, also, buffer zones are one of the approaches which can be used for protecting the setting but they may not be appropriate for all world heritage sites.</p>

They have now been largely merged into local area agreements, which contain non-reward and reward targets, and typically run for three years. No local authority has a reward target specifically on adoptions which is dependent on performance in either 2006-07 or 2007-08. There is no detailed central record of non-reward targets in local area agreements, although the agreements themselves are available on the Improvement and Development Agency (IDeA) website.</p>

aims that an Apprentice is undertaking as part of the framework, including those identified as separate technical certificates. However, although in principle it is possible to identify those learners who have achieved both the full framework and a technical certificate, the required information is not contained on the framework record which is used to calculate success rates. The analysis would require the creation of a new methodology for bringing the information on technical certificates forward from the raw data to the framework record. The undertaking of this work would require a significant resource in terms of analyst time and could be provided only at disproportionate cost. Additionally it is not possible to identify those learners who have already obtained the technical certificate through prior learning.</p>

 Both fostering service providers and the providers of children&#146;s homes are already required to notify the Secretary of State of particular events, including the death of a looked after child in their care.</p>

Reviewing deaths will become mandatory in April 2008 though LSCBs have been able to do this since 2006. These arrangements include children in foster care and residential care.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_543"><a name="70619w0023.htm_para1"><a name="0706203002354">There are two elements to the child death review process: firstly, a rapid response by a group of professionals who are responsible for inquiring into and evaluating each unexpected death of a child; secondly, the review of deaths of all children in the local authority area through Child Death Overview Panels (CDOPs). CDOPs will identify any trends or patterns in these deaths. This information will be used by LSCBs to prevent or avoid such deaths in the future. It will inform local strategic planning for children&#146;s services and policy at a local and national level. Detailed guidance on how these procedures work is set out in &#145;Working Together to Safeguard Children&#146; (2006).</p>

Government plan to publish guidance this year to the NHS and partner agencies which supports the development of local diversion services by building on current best practice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_574"><a name="70619w0026.htm_para0"><a name="0706203002667">The prison population has a disproportionately high prevalence of mental illness, and so it has been the policy of the Ministry of Justice, the Home Office and Department of Health to improve the provision of mental health services in our prisons.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_575"><a name="70619w0026.htm_para1"><a name="0706203002668">Beginning in 2003, and completing in April 2006, the national health service took over the commissioning responsibility for all prison health services in public sector prisons. This was previously the responsibility of the Prison Service. One of the main reasons this transfer has made was to help ensure that prisoners had better access to mainstream health services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_576"><a name="70619w0026.htm_para2"><a name="0706203002669">All prisoners, both new prisoners and those transferred in from one prison to another, benefit from a new health screening process, introduced across the prison estate in 2004, that is designed to detect physical and mental health problems.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_577"><a name="70619w0026.htm_para3"><a name="0706203002670">Prisoners who are identified as needing further help can be referred to a mental health in-reach team, who will arrange further assessment and follow up referral.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_578"><a name="70619w0026.htm_para4"><a name="0706203002671">Investment in prison mental health in-reach services has been steadily increasing, with nearly &#163;20 million invested in these services each year since 2004-05, and 360 whole time equivalent staff employed, more than the initial commitment in the NHS Plan to create 300 posts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_579"><a name="70619w0026.htm_para5"><a name="0706203002672">People who are mentally too ill to remain in prison should be transferred to hospital. We have introduced tighter monitoring to identify prisoners waiting an unacceptably long period for transfer to hospital, and a protocol was issued to prisons and primary care trusts in October 2005 setting out what must be done when a prisoner has been waiting for a hospital place for more than three months following acceptance by the national health service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_580"><a name="70619w0026.htm_para6"><a name="0706203002673">These measures have helped bring about positive results. In 2006, 33 per cent. more prisoners, with mental illness too severe for prison, were transferred to hospital than in 2002&#151;up to 961 from 723. There has been a significant decrease in the number of people waiting over 12 weeks for a transfer&#151;in the quarter ending March 2007, 40 prisoners were waiting, down from 51 in the same quarter in 2005.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_581"><a name="70619w0026.htm_para7"><a name="0706203002674">The healthcare screening process also inquires about drug and alcohol use, and looks for evidence of dependence in those who report current or recent use. Reception screening should be focused to ensure that appropriate prescribed clinical management is undertaken by a doctor soon after reception. Clinical drug testing is used to establish the level of opiate dependence before clinical management begins. The new Integrated Drug Treatment System is introducing National Treatment Agency models of care to 49 prisons.</p>

 Information on reoffending rates from ISSP is not available in this form. ISSP tackles the most persistent offenders who are often damaged and deprived, and who suffer from mental health problems. This is, therefore an exceptionally difficult group of offenders who present a major challenge to ISSP teams. Nevertheless, despite the report showing 91 per cent. of young people given an ISSP were reconvicted at least once in the two years starting the programmes, it also showed that young offenders on ISSP committed 39 per cent. fewer crimes in the two years after starting the programme and that the seriousness of those crimes reduced by 13 per cent.</p>

The findings of the most recent research<sup>(1)</sup> show that levels of physical adjustments for disabled people are increasing. Among employers, there has been a slight increase in those having made adjustments since 2003 (from 42 per cent. to 45 per cent. for adapting the work environment). There has been a larger increase in changes made to physical accessibility by those providing goods, facilities and services (from 47 per cent. to 61 per cent.). Not all disabled people will require physical adjustments to be made to the workplace, or to the premises of a service provider, nor will it always be reasonable for an employer or service provider to make a physical adjustment.</p>

 Decisions on the level of contracted-out national insurance rebates are a matter for the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions. The current contracted-out rebate rates were set out in the Secretary of State's report laid before each House of Parliament on 1 March 2006 and reflected in the rebate Order made on 30 March 2006. This report gave due consideration to the report of the Government Actuary and to other considerations such as the fiscal conditions which prevailed at the time. As with all decisions which have a major impact on public expenditure, including previous rebate reviews, the recommended rates were agreed with HM Treasury.</p>

The two occasions were the application of a 9.0 per cent. cap on age-related percentages for contracted-out DC schemes for the period 1999-2000 to 2001-02 tax year, and the application of a 10.5 per cent. cap from 2002-03 to 2006-07.</p>

 There would be no impact on the number of employees who would be eligible for the proposed personal accounts savings scheme if the upper earnings limit for contributions were increased to &#163;43,000.

The summary of responses, published on 14 June 2007, contains detail on both the level of the limit and how it is to be designed. After further analysis, the Government believe that a contribution limit of &#163;3,600 better balances the need to focus personal accounts on the target market with the need to allow individuals to save flexibly for their retirement. The &#163;3,600 limit will be based on 2005 earnings levels, and will be uprated with earnings from 2005 to implementation in 2012 and beyond.</p>

<i> Notes:</i>  1. These rates are the real terms (prices) value of the Category A and Category A + Category B(L) and BSP and were calculated using the Retail Prices Index. The amounts are rounded to the nearest 10p. These are not the cash values.  2. There is no such thing as a "couples rate", though the sum of the Category A and Category B(L) pension is often referred to as such. Similarly there is no such thing as a "singles rate" though the maximum rate of the Category A pension is commonly referred to as the singles rate.  3. The couples rate is calculated as 160 per cent. of the full Category A.  4. The Category B (lower) pension is about 60 per cent. of the full-rate basic Category A Pension. It is payable by virtue of a spouse's qualifying years or earnings.<br>

 During the operational period from January 2003 to December 2006, 2,333 mobilised British military personnel (regular and reservists) who deployed to Iraq under Operation TELIC were assessed by, and received treatment from, the Defence Medical Services for mental health conditions thought to be related to their deployment. This represents around 2 per cent. of personnel deployed to Op TELIC over the same period.</p>

However, at a time when a growing number of personnel have been deployed to other operational theatres in addition to Iraq, it has become increasingly clear that it is difficult to attribute a subsequent mental health condition (which in many cases may not present itself until months or even years later) to Service on a specific deployment. We are currently, therefore, reviewing our methods of collating figures on Service personnel who are diagnosed with a mental health condition.</p>

 The treatment offered to Service personnel is based on their clinical needs. This applies to operational and non-operational casualties. All patients who require admission to hospital are treated in the most appropriate clinical environment according to their clinical need.</p>

That is why we have established a Military Managed Ward (MMW) at Selly Oak Hospital, the main receiving hospital for our operational casualties, where military patients can be grouped together when it is clinically appropriate to do so. Equally, however, in some cases their clinical condition will dictate that they be placed in a different location.</p>

As stated in the written ministerial statement on 20 March 2007, <i> Official Report</i>, column 36WS, by my hon. Friend the Defence Secretary, the two systems that met this definition, the RBL-755 and MLRS M26, have now been withdrawn from service.

Across East and West Sussex, a range of activities have been implemented in support of District Plans, such as CCTV in taxis in Eastbourne. Specifically in Brighton, a number of successful projects, including the Safe Haven project, have been taken forward in conjunction with the Centre for Public Innovation.

An Individual Support Programme for children (WISP) has also been successfully introduced. A pilot project is also under way, introducing a &#147;routine enquiry&#148; process about DV to GP surgeries and sexual health clinics. Work to introduce specialist domestic violence courts in Sussex continues. And Sussex police are currently seeking to bring the National Centre for Domestic Violence charity to Sussex. This charity works to deliver, on a next-day basis, the protection of civil orders to victims of domestic violence without any charge to the service or the victim.</p>

We have, for example, recently passed the Violent Crime Reduction Act, which gives the police and local communities the powers they need to tackle guns, knives and alcohol-related violence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_672"><a name="70619w0040.htm_para8"><a name="07062011001459">Domestic violence is a particular priority. In December 2006, it was announced that Birmingham, Coventry, Dudley, Sandwell (Warley and West Bromwich magistrates courts), Solihull and Walsall (Walsall and Aldridge magistrates courts) had been selected as Specialist Domestic Violence Court areas. These specialist courts promote a joint approach to tackling domestic violence, with the police, crown prosecutors, magistrates, courts and the probation service working together with specialist support services for victims. Agencies collectively identify, track and risk assess domestic violence cases, and better share information so that more offenders are brought to justice, victims are protected and better supported, and further violence is prevented.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_673"><a name="70619w0040.htm_para9"><a name="07062011001460">The Government, through the Government office for the west midlands, supports key partners in the statutory and voluntary sector in tackling gun crime and gang-related violence. For example, Birmingham Reducing Gang Violence has continued to be a focal point for activities and partnership work to reduce gun crime. It is chaired by the West Midlands police, and supported by a range of agencies and voluntary sector groups, including Birmingham city council, West Midlands Probation, Victim Support, Increase the Peace UK, Mothers in Pain and Street Pastors.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_674"><a name="70619w0040.htm_para10"><a name="07062011001461">The West Midlands is also well represented in the Tackling Violent Crime Programme, through which the Home Office works intensively with practitioners in local areas with high levels of more serious violent crime, to support their efforts to reduce, in particular, alcohol-related crime and domestic violence, to improve police and other agencies' performance and partnership working, and to improve local strategies. Currently four West Midlands police basic command units are funded to utilise a variety of interventions, including the greater use of fixed penalty notices for alcohol-related offences, routine visits to &#147;hotspot&#148; licensed premises, and the use of bus and taxi marshals at peak times.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_675"><a name="70619w0040.htm_para11"><a name="07062011001462">West Midlands police have also been particularly active over the past 12 months in addressing robbery. Three of the 28 areas nationally which became subject to special focus during the recent Robbery Initiative are in the West Midlands (Solihull, Wolverhampton and Coventry). These areas were required to produce an action plan, which would produce long-term, sustainable interventions and not rely purely on short-term police activity to yield short-term results.</p>
