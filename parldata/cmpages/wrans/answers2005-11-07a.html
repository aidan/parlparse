 On 21 May 2004, the Director of Public Prosecutions issued guidance to police officers and Crown prosecutors under section 37A of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984. The guidance sets out the cases that must be referred to prosecutors for charging decisions and the circumstances in which a release on bail before charge may be appropriate in accordance with the amendments to the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, introduced by the Criminal Justice Act 2003.

<a name="stpa_0">In April 2005, further guidance was issued to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) and the police on the subject of granting pre-charge bail to obtain a charging decision from a Crown prosecutor. The guidance was formulated as a result of issues raised during the implementation of the statutory charging arrangements, and establishes a standardised approach to the operation of pre-charge bail.

 The Food and Agricultural Organisation of the United Nations (FAO)&#039;s Global Information and Early Warning System (GIEWS) produces two sets of reports that warn of imminent food crises in Africa. The &quot;Foodcrops and Shortages Report&quot; from February 2005 stated that the harvest in Niger was normal against the five year average, and did not require exceptional and/or emergency assistance. The &quot;Food Supply Situation and Crop Prospects&quot; Report in April 2005 similarly omitted Niger from its list of countries facing food emergencies. Only in its June 2005 edition did the &quot;Foodcrops and Shortages Report&quot; recommend emergency assistance for Niger, and only in September 2005 did Niger feature on FAO/GIEWS&#039; list of countries facing food crises.

<a name="stpa_2">The FEWSNET bulletin first flagged Niger as a country under &quot;Warning Status&quot; in December 2004, but it was not until June 2005 that this was upgraded to &quot;Emergency Status&quot; demanding &quot;highest priority urgent action&quot;.

<a name="stpa_3">DFID attended the presentation of the World Food Programme (WFP)/FAO&#039;s initial Crop and Food Supply Assessment Mission (CFSAM) findings from the Sahel region in December 2004, where cereal production for the entire region was reported as average, in spite of drought and locusts, but where pockets of need were identified within all the Sahel countries. Based on the evidence, DFID judged that large scale food aid would not be required at that time.

<p>
<a name="51107w01.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_4">DFID does not have any officials based in Niger. The London based humanitarian unit responsible for monitoring emerging crises in Africa had been monitoring the situation in the Sahel since the locust invasions of August 2004. In April 2005, the first incontrovertible evidence of a deteriorating situation was provided by Medecins Sans Frontieres. A full account of DFID&#039;s subsequent response is set out in my parliamentary written statement on the Niger food crisis made on 11 October 2005, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 26&#150;27WS.

Following depopulation, the premises must be cleansed and disinfected to standards set by a DEFRA veterinarian and this may take several weeks for it to be completed. The premises must then remain empty of poultry for at least 21 days. We would then allow the premises to re-stock if there were no more outbreaks of the disease in the locality. Once restocked the poultry would be kept under close surveillance for a period of 21 days and subjected to clinical inspections during that period.

 On the 21 October the European Commission considered the encroaching avian influenza threat and, as a result, introduced a decision to ban bird markets, fairs and other gatherings of birds until the 31 January 2006, when the decision will be reviewed. This decision was implemented in England by the Avian Influenza (Preventive Measures) Regulations 2005 (2005 No. 2989). The ban will remain in place until the European law requiring it is lifted. We have worked with representatives of groups holding such events and assessed the risks. As a result, some gatherings may continue under licence and subject to biosecurity controls. We will consider any applications for a licence sympathetically and any which can be permitted to go ahead following a veterinary risk assessment will be licensed.

 In comparison to domestic chickens, feral pigeons are generally unsusceptible to highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI).

However, the risk cannot be completely discounted and the public is encouraged to report any unusual die-off in pigeons or any other wild birds to the DEFRA helpline (08459 33 55 77) when further advice will be provided.

 Defra has issued no specific guidance to waste collection authorities about the charging of charity shops for the collection by waste collection authorities of unusable items donated by members of the public since the publication of the Controlled Waste Regulations 1992. Guidance to waste collection authorities in Schedule 2 to these regulations covers the types of household waste for which a charge for collection may be made. Where waste collection authorities do decide to charge they must only recover their costs of collection and these costs must be set at a level so that the authorities do not make a profit. There are no plans to change this guidance.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will list recipients of payment under common agricultural policy agri-environment and rural development schemes for the last two years including <i>(a)</i> size of payment, <i>(b)</i> date of payment, <i>(c)</i> name of scheme under which payment was made, <i>(d)</i> name of recipient, <i>(e)</i> postal address of recipient and <i>(f)</i> location of enterprise in respect of which the payment was made.

<p><a name="st_52"><a name="51107w04.html_spnew4"><b> Jim Knight: </b> 
 The Rural Payments Agency (RPA) disclosed common agricultural policy (CAP) payment information on 22 March 2005, listing the names of CAP subsidy recipients and the amount paid to them in the last two years.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51107w04.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_55">The information represented an annual aggregate figure for payments to each recipient under all of the schemes paid by RPA, including agri-environment and rural development schemes. The full list of schemes covered by the disclosure is set out in Annex A.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51107w04.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_56">RPA investigated the practicalities of providing further breakdown by scheme, including scheme type, date of payment and name of scheme under which payment was made. It was concluded that it was unreasonable to produce this data because it is held in detailed scheme records and to reconcile the scheme statistics against the monies paid at the aggregate customer level would be extremely resource intensive.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51107w04.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_57">RPA published on its website in July 2005 a supplement to the CAP payments information giving details of payments by geographic location for the EAGGF (European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund) year 2003&#150;04. The regional analysis has been produced using the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS) and NUTS levels one and two were used to provide this analysis. It was decided that a more detailed regional breakdown and the release of full postal addresses would not be appropriate. The general privacy arguments were examined in detail and it was concluded that the risks around privacy intrusion outweighed the limited additional public value of the additional postal address data.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51107w04.html_para7">
<a name="stpa_58">Further, the diversion of more resources from other priority work, in particular considering RPA&#039;s imperative to commencing Single Payment Scheme payments to farmers by February 2006, to produce additional geographical or scheme breakdown would be manifestly unreasonable. However RPA continues to examine detailed requests on a case by case basis.

<p><a name="qn_63"><a name="51107w05.html_wqn9"><b> Mr. Paice: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment she has made of the possible existence in wild plants of the fireblight disease.  [23806]</p>






<br>&nbsp;<br><i>7 Nov 2005 : Column 24W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>



<p><a name="st_63"><a name="51107w05.html_spnew9"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 Fireblight, a bacterial plant disease, is well established throughout much of Europe and has been known to exist in the UK since the 1950s. It is a serious disease of apples, pears and related trees and shrubs in the family <i>Rosaceae</i>, sub family <i>Pomoideae</i>. The list of susceptible material includes several plants which commonly grow wild in England and Wales, including <i>Chaenomeles</i> (Flowering Quince), <i>Cotoneaster</i>, <i>Crataegus</i> (Hawthorn) and <i>Sorbus</i> (Mountain Ash).
</p>


<p>
<a name="51107w05.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_60">The first UK finding of fireblight was in Kent in 1957. It is now widespread in Wales, England and also parts of Scotland but absent from Northern Ireland. The disease can be spread by wind, rain, birds and pollinating insects, as well as on contaminated pruning tools and by the planting of infected plants which may or may not show symptoms. It is known to have spread in England along hawthorn hedges planted alongside railways, motorways and main roads. There are no pesticides currently available to treat the disease.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51107w05.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_61">Nurseries intending to move fireblight-host material have to be registered with DEFRA and must have at least two inspections per year in order to retain their ability to trade susceptible plants within the EU.
</p>





<p><a name="qn_64"><a name="51107w05.html_wqn10"><b> Mr. Paice: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what measures are in place to ensure that exporters of fireblight-susceptible species of trees and shrubs do not use other species&#039; names on the necessary paperwork; and what assessment she has made of whether those who inspect the paperwork are capable of <i>(a)</i> differentiating and <i>(b)</i> identifying the species.  [23807]</p>




<p><a name="st_64"><a name="51107w05.html_spnew10"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 Exporters of plants and plant products to non EC countries must satisfy the plant health requirements of the importing country. In many cases importing countries require consignments to be accompanied by a phytosanitary certificate issued by the official services in the country of origin as evidence that those requirements have been met. In the case of fireblight-susceptible host plants, where requested by an exporter and if required by the importing country, DEFRA&#039;s Plant Health and Seeds Inspectorate (PHSI) will undertake inspection of the material and, if it is found to comply with the conditions of import, will issue the necessary phytosanitary certificate. This would include details of the plant genera and species.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51107w05.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_62">In relation to movements within the EU, growers of fireblight host material are required to register with DEFRA as producers of plant material requiring a plant passport and they also have to apply to DEFRA for authorisation to issue plant passports. An element of the authorisation process is to designate a technically experienced person who is responsible for passporting and associated plant health matters on the premises. In order to retain their authorisation producers must be inspected at least twice a year by the PHSI. One of these inspections will take place during the period of growth of the plants and the other at the time of despatch of material, including a check of records and documentation. If at any time a registered plant passporter is shown to be deliberately falsifying information or contravening the passporting regulations, his authorisation to issue plant passports may be withdrawn.




<br>&nbsp;<br><i>7 Nov 2005 : Column 25W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>


<p>
<a name="51107w05.html_para4">
PHSI are normally graduates and invariably have a background or qualification in horticulture or agriculture. On appointment they receive a period of intensive training, which will include plant, pest and disease identification, familiarisation with the legislation under which they will operate, plant passporting and export certification arrangements etc. On completion of this formal training they shadow experienced Inspectors for a further period of field-based training, including visits to plant passporting and/or exporting nurseries. Identification of fireblight hosts is included as part of this general training.

<a name="stpa_83">The table shows monthly average farm gate milk prices in pence per litre for the last thirteen months for the United Kingdom, and weighted annual averages for 2001 to 2004. The average prices are calculated from monthly surveys of milk purchasers conducted in England and Wales by DEFRA, in Scotland by SEERAD and in Northern Ireland by DARD. The size of the sample surveyed is estimated to account for 99 per cent. of milk production this month. The farm gate price is the average price received by producers, net of delivery charges. No deduction has been made for superlevy.

Information about pedigree and performance can be commercially valuable and, although Defra will meet its share of future running costs, the industry will need to cover its costs. Our initial research did show that some basic information is available free from other sources, as it will be from NED. A recent study commissioned jointly with the industry indicated that the combination of the quality and accessibility of the information on the database will enable its costs to be recovered from fees.

The UK has been a net exporter of oil (crude and products) since the early 1980s. Annual figures for 1997 to 2004 are shown in the following table with net imports denoted by a minus (-) sign.

<i>[holding answer 25 October 2005]:</i> Some of England&#039;s regional development agencies (RDAs) have commissioned sculptures and statues in their regions over the last five years as part of their wider efforts to regenerate deprived or run down areas, consistent with RDAs&#039; statutory purposes set out in the RDAs Act 1998. Making the places where people live and work more attractive, can stimulate increased business investment, and community cohesion. Works of art also play a part in making business paths more attractive and assisting with inward investment and in promoting tourism and interpretation of historic areas and landscapes. RDAs play an important role in such developments, often working in partnership with business, local government and other public and voluntary organisations in order to promote the region and its economy.

Several indirect measures of state support for CHP were introduced in 2001&#150;02. Of those that can be enumerated, climate change levy exemption on fuel inputs to good quality CHP and good quality CHP electricity outputs were valued at up to &#163;80 million per annum, while eligibility for enhanced capital allowances is worth in the region of 10m per annum to the industry. Capital grants for community energy programme schemes were introduced in 2002&#150;03 and the spend on schemes including CHP was: &#163;427,000 in 2002&#150;03, &#163;4,315,000 in 2003&#150;04 and &#163;4,896,000 in 2004&#150;05.<br>

 Variability, or volatility, is a normal part of the working of a well-functioning commodity market. Current UK wholesale spot gas prices are determined by the price of oil and the day-to-day balance between demand and supply in the UK gas market.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51107w14.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_142">When the market is tight small changes in demand and supply will have a bigger impact on price volatility than if the market were over-supplied. The balance of demand and supply, and thus the volatility of prices, will depend on many external factors, including the weather and the availability of storage facilities or import infrastructure on a day-to-day basis. In view of the unpredictability of many of these factors it is not possible to make accurate estimates of future price volatility.

 The Government are firmly committed to tackling illegal migrant working. We have taken steps to strengthen the relevant legislation by reforming section 8 of the Asylum and Immigration Act 1996 and by supporting my friend&#039;s initiative on gangmaster licensing. We are introducing new measures for a civil penalty regime and a tougher criminal offence for employers in the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Bill, currently before the House. Our strategy also involves increasing enforcement, encouraging compliance by business, and developing joint working between agencies responsible for enforcing workplace regulations. We have also increased removals of those in breach of immigration laws.

 We have provided &#163;165 million to police authorities from the Rural Policing Fund since 2000&#150;01. The annual provision is &#163;30 million. We are currently considering rolling up a number of specific grants, including the Rural Policing Fund, into a single pot for each authority, to give police authorities greater financial flexibility. There are no plans to reduce the current level of funding for each authority.

In addition, we will continue to support the costs of community support officers (CSOs) recruited in the first three rounds from 2002 onwards. The grant will assist the police service to reach our target of 24,000 CSOs by 2008 and will support police authorities in building their own Neighbourhood Policing Teams.

<sup>(24)</sup> Though the holding prisons were, at the end of the month in which the prisoners died, operating over their respective CNAs, this does not necessarily mean that the prisoners who died were accommodated in &#039;crowded&#039; conditions&#151;for example, one of two prisoners accommodated in a cell certified for one.<br>

<sup>(25)</sup> One death in 2001 and one death in 2003 occurred in the custody of the Prison Escort and Custody Services. <br>

 There has been no such assessment. However, a recent internal review was carried out which looked at methods of entry of illegal drugs into prisons with a view to sharing good practice. Recommendations included giving greater priority to the use of intelligence, targeting the use of mobile phones by prisoners, increased intelligence-led searching, and a managed approach to disrupt the activities of prisoners engaged in drug trafficking.

 The National Offender Management Service (NOMS) keeps under review the demand on prison places and the capacity of prisons to accommodate those prisoners sent to them by the courts. It is ensuring maximum use of all spare capacity within the prison estate, increasing useable operational capacity in prisons by building additional places as part of an ongoing funded building programme, and returning to use accommodation at existing prisons.

<a name="stpa_204">The pre-Budget report 2005 will include an updated assessment on productivity performance in the UK. As reported in the HM Treasury Departmental Report 2005, the UK is making progress in boosting its productivity performance: between 1997 and 2001Q3, the UK trend rate of actual productivity growth on an output per worker basis (figures not adjusted for employment growth) is estimated to have grown by 2.5 per cent. a year compared with a growth rate of 2 per cent. a year in the previous economic cycle (1986Q2&#151;1997H1). Adjusting for the effect of employment growth, it is estimated that the underlying trend rate of productivity growth was 2.7 per cent. between 1997H1&#151;2001Q3 compared to 2.2 per cent. over the previous economic cycle (1986Q2&#151;1997H1).
