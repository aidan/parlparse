[133144]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00727w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Byers </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 21 July 2000]:</i> The policy under successive Governments has been that payments of Regional Selective Assistance are a commercial matter between the company and the Government and are not normally disclosed. Details of offers of grant of &#163;75,000 or more are given in "Labour Market Trends". The offer to Toyoda Gosei Company Ltd. (part of the Toyota group) was made in May 1999 and did not require EC approval. The Rover engine project (Hams Hall) and Jaguar Cars project received EC approval.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00727w01.html_wqn6"><B> Dr. Cable: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (1) what the planned net profit is of the ECGD for each year of the 2000 Spending Review (2001-2004); and how this figure would differ if loans by the ECGD were required to earn a 6 per cent. return;  [132452]
<P>
<UL>(2) if he will list the net profit or loss for the ECGD in the last three years; and how this would have varied had the agency been required to record returns below 6 per cent. as a loss.  [132457]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00727w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Caborn </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 25 July 2000]:</i> ECGD is set the financial objective by Ministers of breaking even over the longer term on its new business account. Given the nature of ECGD's business and the highly uncertain nature of the risks which it covers, it will clearly be many years before the outcome of any particular year's business can be known. In recognition of this, Ministers have set ECGD a more measurable objective of achieving a ratio (Reserve Coverage Ratio) of at least 1.5 between its reserves and estimates of expected losses on amounts at risk under its guarantees.

<a name="00727w01.html_para3">The Government have a target of generating 10 per cent. of the UK's electricity from renewable sources by 2010, subject to the cost to consumers being acceptable. We expect both onshore and offshore wind to be needed to meet this target. The Government are taking a range of measures to encourage renewables including a proposed obligation on electricity suppliers, exemption of renewable energy from the Climate Change Levy and an expanded research and development programme. We are also considering the scope for limited additional support for more expensive technologies, including offshore wind.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if he has reached a decision on the future of Companies House following the review announced by the Minister for Competitiveness on 16 February 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 557-58W.  [133762]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00727w02.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Alan Johnson: </B> 
 The first stage of the review of Companies House has now been completed. I am pleased to say that the review has confirmed that Companies House is performing well, both in meeting its own objectives and targets and in contributing to the achievement of wider Government objectives such as our e-Government strategy. Its standards of customer service are high, as shown by the award in 1998 of its third Charter Mark, and customers are generally satisfied with the service they get from Companies House. Companies House is already providing a wide range of services electronically. The CH Direct service offers electronic access to images of all documents dating back to 1995. All the major returns (except accounts) can be filed electronically. Plans are well advanced to introduce facilities to incorporate new companies electronically and to simplify the process for e-filing generally following the passing of the Electronic Communications Act 2000. Companies House is on track to have all services available electronically well in advance of the Government target of 2005.
<P>

<a name="00727w02.html_para7">The functions carried out by Companies House--the incorporation of companies, registration of information about their continuing operations and provision of information to the public--are and will continue to be essential to ensuring effective, competitive markets. The Review has confirmed that those functions are best delivered by retaining Companies House as an Executive Agency and that there is a continuing role for the private sector in the delivery of Companies House services.
<P>

<a name="00727w02.html_para8">The issue now is how Companies House can perform even better in future. I want to see Companies House continue to improve the quality of its services, setting and maintaining high standards of customer service and responsiveness to customer needs. Customers rightly look to Companies House as a reliable source of accurate and up-to-date information and we must ensure that it meets those expectations. Companies House will need to continue to modernise to improve the quality, range and flexibility of its services. Its operation is increasingly based on electronic interaction with customers, rather than the processing of paper, and this trend will continue, in line with the increasing use of e-commerce throughout the economy. Companies House's main operating system is now some 15 years old. It lacks flexibility and is not best-suited to supporting such an operation. It will therefore need to be replaced. The transition to a new system will need to be managed carefully and taken step by step to ensure that there is no interruption in the business. Substantial investment in IT will be required over the next three years or so to achieve this. Funding will be available from the cash reserves Companies House 



<P>
<P><I>27 Jul 2000 : Column: 724W</I><P>
has built up during its period as a Trading Fund. This investment will lay the basis for an even more successful next five years.
<P>

<a name="00727w02.html_para9">The report of stage 1 of the review of Companies House has been placed in the Library of the House.
<P>

<a name="00727w02.html_para10">Stage 2 of the review is now starting and will be completed in the autumn. As I announced in February, this second stage will consider whether any changes should be made to the way in which Companies House operates, including its aims and objectives, targets and financial controls. It will also consider in more detail the costs and funding of the investment in new systems.

 There are no United Nations trade sanctions against Iran. A UK national arms embargo was imposed on 1 March 1993. It covers all goods and technology on the Military List as well as items entered in Group 0 in Annex 1 of the European Council Decision 



<P>
<P><I>27 Jul 2000 : Column: 725W</I><P>
94/942/CFSP on the export of dual-use goods, as amended. An amendment was announced on 28 January 1998 to clarify that licences would not be approved for any equipment where there was knowledge or reason to suspect that it would go to a military end-user or be used for military purposes. The exception is equipment which would not normally require an export licence but is deemed licensable under the Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) end-use control and where WMD concerns are not subsequently substantiated.
<P>

<a name="00727w03.html_para3">All applications for export licences to Iran are considered by an interdepartmental committee of advisers and representatives from the DTI, Foreign and Commonwealth Office and Ministry of Defence. This committee meets once a month and makes recommendations on each application which are subsequently submitted to Ministers in the three Departments for approval. This procedure reflects the concerns that the Government has about exports to Iran and ensures that all licensing decisions are consistent with our policy.

 The main form of the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) funding support to the Long Ashton Research Station (LARS) is via the Competitive Strategic Grant, which provides funding for basic and strategic research programmes that map onto BBSRC's priorities and underpins LARS's mission. Unlike university grants, for which the Higher Education Funding Councils provide the infrastructure element of "dual funding", the Competitive Strategic Grant and capital funding meets the full costs of the various programmes. BBSRC has also provided equipment and minor works grants. In addition, BBSRC has awarded funds to LARS for research projects which LARS scientists have won in competition with other scientists from the bioscience community.

 My Department has no responsibility for the protection of data held at or accessible through websites. My Department has no special powers to mount prosecutions under the Data Protection Act. We have received no representation about prosecutions of electricity generating companies under that Act, but are aware of the public interest in the recent security breach at the website of the supply business of PowerGen. While the standards of security of websites are not regulated, my Department takes seriously its responsibility for promoting good information security to business. This is one of the vital factors in ensuring confidence in e-business. My officials have therefore had discussions with the company to understand the circumstances that led to the security breach, how the company solved the technical issues and how the business community as a whole might learn from their experience. I understand that the company resolved the vulnerability quickly and are making great efforts to learn how their management controls allowed it to happen. They intend to make public the results of their inquiries. Furthermore, we are exploring with the company how best we might disseminate the lessons learnt to improve the performance of all those UK companies who are rising to the challenge of working on-line.

 <i>[holding answer 20 July 2000]:</i> The Policy Information Market System (PIMS) provides a framework which measures the extent to which DFID's projects and programmes are being targeted on key policy areas. PIMS covers bilateral commitments with a value of &#163;100,000 or over. Contributions to multilateral agencies are excluded because they do not analyse their expenditure in the same way.

Principal objectives are those which are fundamental to the design of a programme or project, without which it would not be undertaken. Significant objectives are those which, although important, are not one of the primary reasons for undertaking the activities. Scoring against PIMS is an all-or-nothing procedure with the total commitment value or expenditure counting against each of the PIMS awarded to the project. As DFID policy areas are mutually supportive and overlapping, most new commitments contribute, to and are marked against, two or more markers.

 Our officials have in recent weeks been in dialogue with senior Government of Nepal officials in the Home Ministry and Prime Minister's Office in support of the campaign to make bonded labour illegal in Nepal. I am pleased to report that the Government of Nepal decided on 17 July to make this practice illegal and in so doing cancelled all related debts. The challenge now is how to ensure legislation is enforced, and to support these individuals in securing future livelihood opportunities. In addition to existing UK support to an Integrated Social Development Programme which works directly with bonded labourers and untouchables, we have informed the Government of Nepal that the UK is ready to assist further in the rehabilitation of bonded labourers. We are also working to mobilise the support of other donors.

 Given the relatively specialist nature of many of our publications, we have not normally made them available systematically in audio, braille or large print formats. The Departmental Report falls into this category. In the case of such publications, we consider any requests for audio or braille formats case by case and in the light of the provisions of the relevant legislation. We are however looking to continue to improve the accessibility of our publications for blind and visually impaired people, particularly in the case of those publications aimed at a broader public audience. This includes reviewing the scope for making more use of large print and audio formats, as well as ensuring the availability of material in appropriate formats via the internet.

Miss Juliet Wheldon, who is the new Treasury solicitor, fully meets all of these requirements.

It will provide a much needed boost to hard pressed prosecutors and caseworkers. As a result, the CPS's budget in 2001-02 will be 12 per cent. higher in real terms than now. This is on top of the additional funding of &#163;15.8 million for 2000-01 which I announced on 26 June 2000. These increases will address the concerns about resource constraints which were identified in the recent staff survey and stress audit.

To ask the Solicitor-General what plans he has to introduce guidance for the Crown Prosecution Service on decisions to drop cases on grounds of lack of credibility of a witness where the witness suffers from mental health problems.  [132903]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00727w06.html_spmin2"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 None. The Code for Crown Prosecutors issued by the DPP under section 10 of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985 gives guidance to prosecutors for use when deciding whether or not a case should be prosecuted. The code states that Crown Prosecutors must be satisfied there is enough evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction before a case may be prosecuted. When considering this, prosecutors will consider the admissibility and reliability of the evidence. This will include considering the credibility of each witness and any factors which impact on a witness's credibility. The code is presently under review and a revised edition will be published later this year.
<P>

<a name="00727w06.html_para0">The CPS is working with other criminal justice agencies to take forward initiatives recommended in the report "Speaking Up for Justice". The recommendations of the report aim to improve access to justice for vulnerable or intimidated witnesses. These initiatives include measures designed to assist vulnerable witnesses, including those with a disability, to give evidence in court proceedings. The availability of such measures will be a relevant consideration for prosecutors when making prosecution decisions.

<P>
<a name="00727w06.html_spmin6"><B>The Solicitor-General</B> 
 <i>[pursuant to his reply, 19 July 2000, c. 174]:</i> The fatal road traffic accident which happened in Colchester on 6 May 1999 was a tragedy. Understandably, the family of the deceased feels let down by the decision of the Crown Prosecution Service not to continue with the prosecution of the defendant for the offence of careless driving.
<P>

<a name="00727w06.html_para1">On 10 July 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 174W, I informed the hon. Member in a written answer that I would be speaking to the Chief Crown Prosecutor to discuss the circumstances of the case.
<P>

<a name="00727w06.html_para2">I have now met with the Chief Crown Prosecutor for Essex and the Branch Crown Prosecutor responsible for the prosecution team. I am satisfied with the explanation that I have been given as to why the criminal prosecution in this case was discontinued.
<P>

<a name="00727w06.html_para3">The history of the proceedings is this: the police were instructed to issue summons against the defendant for careless driving on 21 September 1999.
<P>

<a name="00727w06.html_para4">The case was listed at Colchester magistrates court for 9 November 1999 but was adjourned by agreement to 7 December to enable the defence to look at the prosecution statements. After the defendant entered a not guilty plea a pre-trial review was fixed for 21 December 1999. At the review the defence requested an adjournment to look into possible defects in the motor vehicle which the defendant was driving when the incident occurred. On 11 January 2000 the defence confirmed that the issue of defects to the motor vehicle would not be pursued. On the same day a medical report was faxed to the court which suggested that the defendant had a medical condition that would have affected her driving.
<P>

<a name="00727w06.html_para5">As the prosecution had not seen this medical evidence before it asked for the case to be adjourned for the Crown to look at the report and consider obtaining its own medical report. The case was therefore adjourned until 22 February 2000. However, on 26 January the defence made a request to the court that as the date and venue fixed was not convenient for the defence the matter be adjourned until 2 May 2000.

<P>

<a name="00727w06.html_para6">Meanwhile, a first medical report obtained on behalf of the prosecution was received at the CPS Branch Office on 14 February 2000. Unfortunately, the report was sent in an envelope marked "personal" so therefore was not opened until the lawyer dealing with the case returned from annual leave two weeks later. Hearing dates which had been fixed by the court (i.e. 4 and 18 April and 16 and 30 May) had to be adjourned at the request of the prosecution, so that points raised in the medical report which had been obtained could be clarified. Further medical reports were obtained by the prosecution on 25 April and 24 May 2000.
<P>

<a name="00727w06.html_para7">During the week of 1 May there was a case conference with the prosecution team at which it was concluded that it would not be possible to prove the case against the defendant. This was in the light of the evidence that the defendant was suffering an epileptic fit at the relevant time and therefore was not "driving". Consideration was given to proceeding with the case on an alternative basis but alternative charges were statute barred.
<P>

<a name="00727w06.html_para8">As I said, I have spoken at length with both the Chief Crown Prosecutor and the Branch Crown Prosecutor. Both took this case extremely seriously. Indeed the Branch Crown Prosecutor who had immediate carriage of the case pursued it in what I would describe as an exemplary manner. But the plain fact is that the Crown Prosecution Service could not prosecute--indeed it would have been unlawful to do so--in the face of the medical evidence.
<P>

<a name="00727w06.html_para9">The Chief Crown Prosecutor for Essex and I, either separately or together, will be happy to meet the hon. Member if he so wishes, to discuss the case.

<P>
<a name="00727w07.html_spnew0"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The Centre for Defence Medicine (CDM) will have academic teaching and clinical roles and will be a centre of excellence for military medicine. It will be relatively small at the beginning and will develop steadily over a number of years. The clinical element will be similar to the arrangements at the Ministry of Defence Hospital Units, with, initially, one ward of 32 beds staffed

and managed by Defence Medical Services (DMS) personnel and other DMS personnel integrated throughout the host Trust. DMS personnel will treat both Service and civilian patients. It is envisaged that when the CDM is fully developed its clinical side will have an annual throughput of some 2,700 Service outpatients. The catchment area for civilian patients will be the same as for the host Trust, the University Hospital Birmingham, within the West Midlands region. As a major tertiary care provider, the Trust treats patients from throughout the country and the DMS personnel will also have the opportunity to treat such patients.

<P>
<a name="00727w07.html_spnew1"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 A number of measures to improve retention in the Defence Medical Services (DMS) have been taken or are under active consideration. The decision to open the Centre for Defence Medicine (CDM) at Birmingham in April 2001 has been enthusiastically welcomed by members of the DMS. It is intended that the CDM will become, in partnership with its host Trust, University Hospital Birmingham NHS Trust, together with the University of Birmingham, a prestigious centre of expertise in military medicine, which we are confident will encourage retention of DMS personnel.
<P>

<a name="00727w07.html_para0">The frequency of operational deployments has been reduced for some specialties in Bosnia by the development of a multinational hospital facility at Sipovo, and work is in hand for a similar facility in Kosovo. Distinction Awards were introduced with effect from 1 April 1999 to bring DMS consultants' pay more closely into line with that of their NHS counterparts. Common terms of service have been agreed for medical and dental officers and pay spines based on these were submitted to the Armed Forces Pay Review Body in January 2000 for approval in principle. Future pension arrangements for medical and dental officers are also under review; a number of options are under consideration but no decisions have yet been taken. Common terms of service have also been agreed for nurses and work is in hand on the delivery of common terms of service for medical technicians. This year we introduced an annual Continuous Attitude Survey among all DMS personnel which will help inform our work on measures to improve retention.

 The explosive ordnance disposal on the Headquarters site at RAF Chilmark is programmed for completion by mid-October 2000. On the Ladydown site it is expected to take 2 to 3 years.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00727w08.html_spnew4"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The HQ North and HQ South parts of the RAF Chilmark site, together with the Proof Yard, are being re-checked for explosive ordnance following the discovery of projectiles in the Proof Yard in May 2000.
<P>

<a name="00727w08.html_para3">The re-checking started in May 2000 and is expected to be completed by the end of this year.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if the Crichel Down rules apply to the site of former RAF Chilmark; and if he will list <i>(a)</i> the former owners and <i>(b)</i> those who are in negotiation with his Department.  [132172]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00727w08.html_spnew5"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The Crichel Down rules apply to the former RAF Chilmark as they do to all surplus Government land acquired by or under the threat of compulsion. My Department has concluded that the obligation to offer land back to the former owners applies to parts of the site.
<P>

<a name="00727w08.html_para4">My Department is trying to trace the former owners or successors to establish whether they are interested in repurchasing the land. It is not possible to identify the former owners until this process has been completed. However, my Department is in discussion with Salisbury District Council, Wiltshire County Council, English Nature and the Wiltshire Trust, who are seeking to establish the Chilmark Trust in order to acquire the site. My Department will not be able to conclude discussions until the former owner position is clarified.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00727w08.html_spnew8"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The Department's Defence Estate in Wales is not being transferred to the private sector. The Ministry of Defence seeks to identify a commercial partner to support the work of the Army in the management of their estate and the provision of training services in Great Britain. The chosen partner will provide all the non-core functions considered appropriate. The strategic partnering project is in a very early stage and it is not possible to say with any certainty what the impact of introducing a strategic partner will be on the existing operation and on the consequent employment opportunities for local staff.

 No decision has yet been taken as to how crops grown from the contaminated rapeseed will be disposed of but the genetically modified element of the crop does not have the necessary authorisation under the Deliberate Release Directive (90/220) to enable it to be commercially marketed in the EC.
<P>

<a name="00727w10.html_para6">I am however, advised by the Food Standards Agency that while there is a possibility that some rapeseed containing a very low level of GM seed may have been grown in the UK last year, there is no information available on where this might have occurred. There is thus no way of being able to trace any oil from this source that may have entered the food chain as the oil cannot be distinguished from conventionally produced rapeseed oil by analytical means. This will in any case have been mixed with oil from other sources and dispersed widely.
<P>

<a name="00727w10.html_para7">The amount of oil from GM rapeseed in any single food product is likely to be extremely small, if it is present at all, but for the reasons given, there is no obvious way for consumers to be able to identify products which might contain traces of the GM derived oil.

SEAC advised that the spinal cord of older sheep could pose a potential risk to human health if eaten, and recommended an extension of the SRM controls to include this tissue once it had been established that there were practical methods for removing it from the carcase. The controls are precautionary, as at present there is no evidence that BSE is present in commercial sheep.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00727w11.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Edward Davey: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health what estimate he has made of the extra costs <i>(a)</i> per patient and <i>(b)</i> in aggregate, in prescription charges per year to patients using commonly prescribed generic drugs as a result of the price increases resulting from the introduction of patient packs; what action he has (i) taken and (ii) plans to minimise the costs to patients; and if he will make a statement.  [132885]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00727w11.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Stuart: </B> 
 The prescription charge is a flat-rate charge. Changes in the cost of medicines to the National Health Service do not therefore affect the charges paid by patients. We have given a commitment not to increase prescription charges by more than inflation (as measured by the retail prices index) for the rest of this Parliament.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Highways Agency has received a number of representations from Parish Councils, other community groups and individuals about military convoys on the A696. Officers from the Agency have discussed this on a number of occasions with Northumbria Police. While this is a matter of operational concern to the Agency, at present the movements of the convoys along the highway are largely the responsibility of the Ministry of Defence and the Police. The Police involvement depends upon the size and weight of the vehicles in the convoy. The Agency has had a number of meetings with the MOD and the Police in an attempt to ensure safety and minimise disruption due to the movements of convoys and their timing.</FONT></UL>

[132909]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00727w12.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 The demand for LPG vehicles, in particular for LPG dual fuel cars, is growing strongly thanks in large part to Government fuel duty incentives for road gas fuels and the Powershift programme, which is sponsored by my Department. In recognition of this increasing demand, my right hon. and noble Friend Lord Macdonald of Tradeston announced earlier this year an increase in the Powershift budget to &#163;10 million--almost a threefold increase on last year.
<P>

<a name="00727w12.html_para3">Between 1 April and 30 June, Powershift grants totalling &#163;2.5 million were offered towards the purchase of 2,077 LPG vehicles. Over the course of this financial year, Powershift expects to support the purchase of over 5,000 LPG vehicles. This is in addition to the 17,000 gas powered vehicles already registered with the DVLA at the end of 1999.

<P>
<a name="00727w12.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 SERPLAN made no estimates of the number of homes to be built in each local authority within Essex. The regional housing provision is distributed below county level by the strategic planning authorities through the preparation of structure and unitary development plans. In the case of Essex, Essex county council and Southend unitary authority are responsible for keeping the Essex and Southend on Sea structure plan up to date and Thurrock unitary authority is responsible for preparing a unitary development plan for its area.

 The North West Development Agency is not accountable to the North West Regional Assembly. However, the Assembly is designated as a Regional Chamber under the provision of the regional Development Agencies Act 1998 which requires the NWDA to consult the Assembly in the exercise of its functions and to have due regard to any views expressed by the Assembly. The NWDA has also entered into a Concordat with the Assembly and the Government Office for the North West, which refers to the Assembly's role in scrutinising the NWDA's Corporate Plan and monitoring its activity. The role is facilitated through twice yearly meetings between the NWDA and the Assembly at member level, regular meetings at officer level and the NWDA formally consults the Assembly on its Corporate Plan and other key documents.

 My officials have met each of the mobile phone operators at least twice since the Stewart report was published on 11 May.

<a name="00727w13.html_para9">The number of call-in and recovery cases--typically, about 150 of each a year--represents a very small proportion of the number of planning applications and appeals dealt with every year. They also tend to be rather more complicated than the generality of planning decisions. Nevertheless, it is clear that, overall, the decision-making process for called-in applications and recovered appeals needs to be expedited. The Department has been reviewing the procedures with a view to improving performance.

TRL are currently finalising their report for the first year's operation of the scheme, and I have asked that they divide off the journey time changes to give the information for the section between junctions 4 and 3. To clarify the reasons for changes in conditions between the M25 and junction 4, I have also asked TRL to review all of the data routinely obtained from sensors in the carriageway and to include their conclusions in the report. We expect to receive this within a month and I will write again with this information when it is available.
<BR>
In the meantime, should you wish to discuss this matter further Paul Harwood, the Project Manager for this section of the M4 would be happy to speak to you. His telephone number is 01306 878471.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what factors underlay the decision to delay the submission in draft of the United Kingdom discharge strategy to the OSPAR Commission meeting in Denmark in June; and what considerations led to the decision to submit the document to the meeting.  [133454]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00727w14.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 Publication of the Consultation Document on the UK Strategy for Radioactive Discharges 2001-2020 was not delayed: it was published as soon as possible after the document was finalised. The document was not submitted to the June meeting of the OSPAR Commission but, after publication, copies were circulated to those attending the meeting, since it was relevant to the discussions at the meeting on the implementation of the OSPAR Strategy with regard to Radioactive Substances.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions when he will publish the UK contribution to the OSPAR Quality Status report for the Celtic Seas Region.  [133612]<P>

<P>
<a name="00727w14.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 I have today published a "Quality Status Report of the Marine and Coastal Areas of the Irish Sea and Bristol Channel". This report was prepared for my Department by the Centre for the Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (CEFAS) as part of the work involved in preparing the "Quality Status Report of the Celtic Seas" which was launched by the OSPAR Commission on 30 June.
<P>

<a name="00727w14.html_para0">The report published today summarises and evaluates information on the current health of the coastal and marine environment of the Irish Sea and Bristol Channel, and the impact of man's activities upon these areas. The 



<P>
<P><I>27 Jul 2000 : Column: 772W</I><P>
assessment shows that the marine environment of the Irish Sea and Bristol Channel is generally in a good state of health, although it highlights over-fishing, endocrine- disrupting chemicals and the pressure for more intensive use of coastal land as being of particular concern. Its conclusions are relevant to policy considerations and to decisions affecting future developments near the coasts, and to the setting of conservation priorities.
<P>

<a name="00727w14.html_para1">In addition, the Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC) have today published a "Directory of the Celtic Coasts and Seas". This document was commissioned by DETR to complement the OSPAR "Quality Status Report of the Celtic Seas". The Directory describes the physical characteristics of the coastline of the Celtic Seas, the marine influences which affect it and regionally important habitats and species. It also describes the national, European and international measures which have been adopted to protect the natural resources in the area.

<a name="00727w14.html_wqn2"><B> Dr. Strang: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions how much money each local authority received from the Government under the rural bus subsidy scheme in <i>(a)</i> 1998-99 and <i>(b)</i> 1999-2000; and how much each local authority is expected to receive in 2000-01.  [132300]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00727w14.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 My Department is responsible only for Rural Bus Subsidy Grant (RBSG) payments to English local authorities; the figures requested for these authorities are set out in the table. In February this year we announced that RBSG was to continue for a further three years from March 2001. In addition to support under the rural bus subsidy scheme we have also provided &#163;28 million for 104 schemes approved in the first two Rural Bus Challenge competitions in 1998 and 1999; a further &#163;20 million is available for this year's Challenge competition.

<P>
<a name="00727w14.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 The creation of a National Park in the New Forest would neither repeal nor amend the New Forest Acts, which lay down the powers of the Verderers. A National Park Authority would, therefore, need to obtain any appropriate consent under those Acts before carrying out recreational development. As there would be no change to the New Forest Acts, the Verderers would retain the powers they currently have to prevent development.

<a name="00727w15.html_para0">Government have already stated that--subject to certain restrictions--companies with emission targets under the climate change levy agreements will be able to use traded emission credits to meet their obligations. This is likely to work through the wider UK Emissions Trading Scheme, under which trades are expected to take place from April next year, alongside the launch of the levy. Under the trading scheme there will be scope for creation of emission credits by projects which reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, the Government are taking a cautious view on the inclusion of forestry projects in the scheme. There are concerns about the security and permanence of carbon fixed in this way, as well as monitoring and verification issues, that will need to be addressed before such projects can be permitted.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what proposals he has for changes in the arrangements for safeguarding aerodromes and navigation facilities.  [133613]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00727w15.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 The safeguarding of certain aerodromes and navigation facilities is a process under which local planning authorities are directed to consult the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) on development proposals which may have consequences for the safe operation of those aerodromes or navigation facilities. The CAA has no powers to prevent development, but where it considers that a proposed development would affect protected airspace it can advise against it. Planning authorities are obliged to take such advice into account in making their decisions.
<P>

<a name="00727w15.html_para2">We consider that it would be more appropriate that those aerodromes which are currently safeguarded by the CAA should be safeguarded by the aerodrome operators themselves. Navigation aids which are provided for aerodrome navigation purposes should also be safeguarded by the aerodrome operator. The CAA will provide full training in this task and, as part of its responsibility for aerodrome licensing, will audit and oversee aerodrome operators' performance of the task.
<P>

<a name="00727w15.html_para3">Where a technical site is owned and operated by NATS, NATS should safeguard the facilities, subject to monitoring by the Authority as part of its regulatory assessment process.

<P>
<a name="00727w15.html_wqn5"><B> Mrs. Organ: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions when he intends to publish the recommendations of the advisory group set up to undertake a Fundamental Review of Compulsory Purchase Laws, Procedures and Compensation and the results of the associated research into the operation of the Crichel Down rules.  [133614]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00727w15.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 I am pleased to be able to announce that my Department has today published two reports. The first sets out the final recommendations of the advisory group set up in June 1998 to undertake a Fundamental Review of Compulsory Purchase Laws, Procedures and Compensation. The second sets out the findings of Gerald Eve and the University of Reading on the operation of the Crichel Down rules. Copies of both documents have been placed in the Library of the House.
<P>

<a name="00727w15.html_para5">We are publishing the findings of the advisory group in order to give interested parties an opportunity to comment before we in Government prepare our own response. The response will also take into account the many views which we have already received, including those from the Urban Task Force, on ways in which the compulsory purchase system might be improved. It is unlikely that any compulsory purchase arrangements could please everyone, but I welcome this opportunity for debate both to help clarify key concerns and to indicate the level of consensus likely to be achievable.
<P>

<a name="00727w15.html_para6">The advisory group have said that they consider that the current compulsory purchase arrangements are basically sound. However, they have identified a number of ways in which the existing procedures could be speeded up and the compensation provisions made simpler, more equitable and quicker to apply.
<P>

<a name="00727w15.html_para7">They also explored the scope for using existing compulsory purchase powers for regeneration purposes. The group concluded that, although local authorities could make greater use of their existing powers than most of them currently seem prepared to do, there would be advantage in clarifying the position by making an appropriate specific statutory provision.
<P>

<a name="00727w15.html_para8">The group found no justification for making any additional blanket payments over and above market value to compensate for the compulsory purchase of all properties, but they do suggest a proposal for "business-loss" payments aimed at small businesses and payable on a similar basis to the current "home-loss" payments. They also propose a power for those whose property is being compulsorily acquired which would enable them to serve the equivalent of a "notice to treat" on the acquiring authority; and one of their suggestions is that acquiring authorities should have explicit powers to ensure that, in tightly defined circumstances in areas 



<P>
<P><I>27 Jul 2000 : Column: 777W</I><P>
where local collapses in the property market have resulted in very low open market values, owner-occupiers can be provided with adequate replacement housing.
<P>

<a name="00727w15.html_para9">Turning to the operation of the Crichel Down rules, the Government acknowledge the shortcomings which the researchers have identified. They have confirmed the suspicions, which led to the commissioning of the research, that the current arrangements are not working well and, again, we need to establish a dialogue. We therefore invite views not only on the detailed operation of the rules but also on such fundamental concepts as the purpose of the rules, whether they are needed at all and, if so, whether they should be statutory and to which bodies they should apply.
<P>

<a name="00727w15.html_para10">We look forward to receiving views on the two reports. All comments received by my Department by Friday 13 October 2000 will be taken into account in preparing the Government's response. That will represent the second stage of the Fundamental Review and, as a third stage, we will then consult formally on those proposals.

 PINS has a key role to play in taking forward our modernising planning agenda. I am therefore very pleased to say that the Inspectorate has met all but one of the targets set for its work in England. Its annual report for 1999-2000, which is published today, shows that its performance delivered an improvement upon the timeliness targets for handling planning appeals. It has maintained the high standard for development plan

<a name="00727w16.html_para0">The agency continues to meet its 3 per cent. efficiency target. On-going investment in staff development and IT systems have improved performance and service to customers.

Surveys show that the Inspectorate's handling of appeals and its decisions are widely respected. Its quality target was not just met but exceeded.

 <i>[holding answer 11 April 2000]:</i> I understand that the Environment Agency has not commissioned research into the use of Magnox fuel in Magnox reactors or into dry storage techniques. However as part of the current Sellafield review, the agency is requiring BNFL to asses whether it would be practicable to modify the Thermal Oxide Reprocessing Plan (THORP) to enable it to reprocess spent Magnox fuel.

 The information is as follows:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(i) My Department, through a research contract with the National Institute of Agricultural Botany, has been monitoring field trials of GM herbicide tolerant oil seed rape for cross pollination with neighbouring crops and wild relatives since 1995. Last year the two fields of spring sown rape grown as part of the farm scale evaluations were included in this study. Some of the results from earlier years have already been published in scientific journals and a full report will be published later this year.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(ii) GM pollen drift is being measured between both the GM and non-GM sides of the fields of rape and maize in the farm scale evaluations and fields of these crops growing within a 1000 metre radius of the GM crop. In addition since 1993 all the sites at which research trials of GM crops have been grown and their immediate environs have been checked in subsequent years for 'GM volunteers' Reports of this monitoring are available on the public register held in the Department.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(iii) and (iv) Data in respect of impact on insect life and the sub-soil are being collected during the farm scale evaluations. The data will be reviewed by the Scientific Steering Committee overseeing the evaluations and submitted for publication as soon as possible in peer reviewed scientific journals.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions when he intends to publish the first results, including interim data, from the farm-scale evaluations of GM crops under way in the UK.  [120719]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00727w17.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 3 May 2000]:</i> The design of the farm scale evaluations requires data to be collected over a three-year period to give a big enough sample size to allow statistically valid conclusions to be drawn. The Scientific Steering Committee therefore takes the view that it is unlikely that sufficient data will be available for scientifically reliable results to be published until late 2002 for the spring sown crops and late 2003 for the autumn sown crops.
<P>

<a name="00727w17.html_para0">The Scientific Steering Committee and the research contractors have agreed that reports on progress with the evaluations should be prepared and published at six-monthly intervals. Two interim reports have already been agreed by the committee and published by the research consortium. A further report on progress with the evaluations will be published in late 2000. This will include analysis and assessment of the study protocols and the validity of data obtained this year.

<a name="00727w17.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Meacher </B>

<a name="00727w17.html_para12">The Annual Mass Emission Limit appears higher than needed. However, in practice this limit is not used for day to day regulation of the authorised process by the Environment Agency. In line with current Agency guidance (S2 5.01 on Waste Incineration), the process is controlled and limited by reference to the concentration of dioxins released to the air. The authorisation sets an emission concentration of 1.0 ng/m <sup>3</sup>  TEQ (Toxic Equivalent), which is a far tighter control parameter than is implied by the 30g mass limit. Tests on the plant in the years 1994 to 1999 have shown concentrations between 0.22 and 0.76 ng/m <sup>3</sup> .
<P>

<a name="00727w17.html_para13">The Environment Agency is considering the introduction of a 0.1 ng/m <sup>3</sup>  limit which could be considered to be BATNEEC (Best Available Technique Not Entailing Excessive Cost) for existing incinerators, and could therefore be achieved under existing legislation.

<P>
<a name="00727w19.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Armstrong: </B> 
 Dome Europe has won the competition to take over the Dome when the Millennium Experience ends on 31 December. We believe their proposals will deliver a high quality, innovative and economically sustainable long-term future for the Dome, of which the people of Greenwich and the United Kingdom can be proud.
<P>

<a name="00727w19.html_para0">The proposals will build on the remarkable achievements in constructing the Dome and delivering the Millennium Experience this year. Provision of a world-class visitor attraction will continue, and will benefit from Dome Europe's investment of around &#163;400 million in the core Dome site over the next five years.
<P>

<a name="00727w19.html_para1">In supporting the Dome's transition from the current Millennium Experience to another major visitor destination, Dome Europe is proposing to create an urban entertainment resort, through a combination of uses inside the Dome and on adjacent land. The latter will include hotels, a convention centre, commercial leisure, 



<P>
<P><I>27 Jul 2000 : Column: 788W</I><P>
restaurants, residential units, offices, retail and community facilities. While the proposals are all subject to the granting of planning permission, and much work remains to be done to complete the sale of the site, we are confident that Dome Europe's proposals will deliver an exciting contribution to the continued regeneration of the Greenwich Peninsula.
<P>

<a name="00727w19.html_para2">We have further decided that of the overall consideration for the sale of the Millennium Dome (details of which must remain commercially confidential at this stage), some &#163;53 million should be paid to the New Millennium Experience Company from total expected early payments from the competition of &#163;105 million. There is also provision for additional payment for land value in certain circumstances and a share of profits if and when the business changes hands. The remainder of this total amount, after meeting third party commitments, will go to English Partnerships. In reaching this view we took account of the benefits to the Greenwich Peninsula and the Thames Gateway in terms of continuity of jobs and assured future private investment in the site, building on the substantial public investment already made--more than one billion pounds--towards major environmental, transport and other improvements on the Peninsula.

Operating costs are helped where we can save farmers' time through simplified forms and census requirements, co-ordinated inspections and the move towards electronic forms.

The document contains a number of useful ideas for ensuring increased involvement by fishermen and other stakeholders in fisheries management and a greater focus on issues at the regional level. It builds upon the recent experience gained with the regional consultations which underpinned the development of the Irish Sea cod recovery programme. The Government will take the industry's ideas fully into account in further developing its approach to the 2002 review of the CFP.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food for what reason the United Kingdom Register of Organic Food Standards has made proposals concerning organic livestock and livestock products for standards which go beyond those required by European Council Regulation 1804/1999.  [132638]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00727w20.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 UKROFS has made a limited number of such proposals, which are permitted by Council Regulation (EC) 1804/1999. In some cases UKROFS has done so in order to carry forward existing UK organic standards and in others because it believes it necessary to do so in order to maintain consumer confidence in organic standards.

<a name="00727w21.html_para2">The Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment (ACRE) routinely assess the potential of any GMO to render a plant species and other organisms dependent on it extinct, whether through becoming more invasive, toxic to animals or through other means. To date no existing GMOs have been identified with the potential to render other species extinct. ACRE's remit has recently been extended to take into account effects of the ways that GM crops may be grown on biodiversity, compared to use of equivalent conventional crops. ACRE's work is augmented by a research programme funded by my Department.

 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="00727w22.html_para0">No. I am advised by the Food Standards Agency that all fresh meat produced in Great Britain for sale for human consumption is subject to full ante mortem and post mortem inspection by meat Hygiene Service inspectors. Only meat that has been passed as fit for human consumption is health marked and allowed to be marketed. These same general rules apply to "salvage meat" produced from tuberculosis reactor cattle and meat produced from cattle which may be infected with Mycobacterium bovis. However, the same rules require the total condemnation of all carcases with generalised TB infection, and in cases where evidence of TB infection is present (but infection is not generalised) the partial condemnation of affected organs or parts of the carcase is required. These requirements are based on harmonised European Commission rules.
<P>

<a name="00727w22.html_para1">Meat produced from cattle that have reacted positively to the tuberculin test, or from cattle which are found, at post mortem, to show signs indicative of being infected with bovine tuberculosis (M.bovis) is not therefore subject to any special labelling requirements when sold at either wholesale or retail level. The Department does not, in any case, sell "salvage meat" into the human food chain.

<a name="00727w22.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Stringer: </B> 
 Since 1998, the Government have required Departments to publish a thorough assessment of the impact of any regulatory proposal likely to impose a significant cost on business, charities or the voluntary sector. These assessments do not disaggregate the costs to the other groups affected by regulation, for example consumers and the public sector, nor are the cost savings of Deregulation Orders routinely collected. This information would be available only at disproportionate cost.

<a name="00727w22.html_para2">For the cost of regulation on business, I refer the hon. Member to the answer given by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry to the right hon. Member for Horsham (Mr. Maude) on 21 December 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column 450W.

In addition, many road closure orders are limited by statute. However, information about sunset clauses is not routinely collected and would be available only at disproportionate cost.

 The Chief Constable has advised that the criminal record of an applicant is, in the first instance, one of the matters taken into consideration in assessing his suitability to possess a legally held firearm. If a person with a criminal record is considered suitable to hold a firearm, no special or additional conditions are applied. Should the holder of a firearm certificate subsequently be convicted of a recordable criminal offence, then his suitability to retain a certificate will be reassessed.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport if all the design and construction contracts awarded by the New Millennium Experience Company complied with EU competition rules.  [125029]
<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="00727w25.html_spnew4"><B> Janet Anderson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 8 June 2000]:</i> The New Millennium Experience Company (NMEC) voluntarily followed EU competition rules for the key, large-scale construction and design contracts, having considered and taken on board legal advice that it was exempt from compliance.
<P>

<a name="00727w25.html_para1">All construction contracts to which the EU rules applied were tendered in compliance with them. Those construction contracts whose value fell under the EU threshold were competitively tendered in accordance with non-departmental public body (NDPB) procurement rules. When tendering for design services, NMEC also complied with EU competition rules or NDPB procurement rules whenever possible, however, the nature of these services meant that it was not always appropriate to do so. This was particularly the case when tendering for very specialist and/or unique goods and services, or when the timetable did not allow for a full-scale tendering process. In all cases where services were procured without competition, NMEC complied with Single Tender Action procedures.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00727w25.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Peter Ainsworth: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, pursuant to his answer of 14 June 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 648W, what fees <i>(a)</i> have been paid and <i>(b)</i> are estimated to be payable to each of the accountancy firms employed by the New Millennium Experience Company.  [127844]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00727w25.html_spnew5"><B> Janet Anderson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 26 June 2000]:</i> Over the lifetime of the project to date, the New Millennium Experience Company (NMEC) has paid its official auditors, Ernst & Young, a total of &#163;1,132,923 (excluding VAT) for audit services and other operational non-audit duties. Details of these fees have been and will be included in each of NMEC's Annual Reports and Financial Statements as recommended by good accounting practice.
<P>

<a name="00727w25.html_para2">Under the terms of the contracts with the other accountancy firms employed by NMEC, the company is obliged to seek permission before disclosing information about terms of employment. NMEC has written to these companies seeking their agreement to the release of the information requested. Should they agree I will write to the hon. Gentleman with details and place a copy of my letter in the Library. Any future fees payable will be dependent on the nature and scope of work to be undertaken and will be negotiated accordingly.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00727w25.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Baker: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what the policy of New Millennium Experience Company is in respect of the speed of payment of bills; and how much money has yet to be paid for bills submitted on or before 31 March.  [128398]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00727w25.html_spnew6"><B> Janet Anderson: </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 4 July 2000]:</i> It is the New Millennium Experience Company's (NMEC) policy that payments to suppliers should be made in accordance with those terms and conditions agreed 



<P>
<P><I>27 Jul 2000 : Column: 815W</I><P>
between the Company and its suppliers, provided that all trading terms and conditions have been complied with. In the period from 1 April 1999 to 31 December 1999 over 75 per cent. of invoices, by value, were paid within 30 days of invoice date.
<P>

<a name="00727w25.html_para3">Of those bills submitted on or before 31 March 2000, there are currently invoices to the value of approximately &#163;1 million awaiting payment (subject to final authorisation).
<P>
<P>
<a name="00727w25.html_wqn8"><B> Ann Clwyd: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport if all <i>(a)</i> Government and <i>(b)</i> other papers relating to the New Millennium Experience will be released under the proposed Freedom of Information Act.  [132547]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00727w25.html_spnew7"><B> Janet Anderson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 26 July 2000]:</i> My Department will respond to any requests for information within the spirit of the Freedom of Information Bill and, until a Freedom of Information Act comes into force, within both the letter and the spirit of the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information. We expect the Millennium Commission and the New Millennium Experience Company to do the same.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00727w26.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Simon Thomas: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport how many tickets for the Millennium Dome have been sold from outlets in <i>(a)</i> Wales and <i>(b)</i> the UK; and if he will make a statement.  [128161]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00727w26.html_spnew0"><B> Janet Anderson: </B> 
 There are various ways of purchasing tickets to visit the Dome; from Lottery outlets around the country, from the Dome ticket line, from travel and tourism companies and in person at the Dome. With so many possible purchase sources it is difficult to monitor the exact number of visitors from one particular location. Since 1 January 2000, a total of 2.9 million tickets have been sold; 639,693 of which have been sold direct from Lottery outlets across the UK; 7,981 have been sold from Lottery outlets in Wales.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport where the millennium products, on sale in the Millennium Dome, are available for purchase elsewhere.  [130290]<P>

<P>

 The New Millennium Experience Company's (NMEC) Licensing programme allowed certain companies to sell approved products through their own wide-ranging distribution channels, including the main high street stores, such as WH Smith and Tesco. The Dome merchandising range is a mixture of licensed products, which were made widely available, and exclusive products, which were manufactured for sale at the Dome.

 Most Government money specifically allocated to sport in England is channelled through the English Sports Council (Sport England). This is an independent body sponsored by this Department which, within an overall policy framework set by the Department, dispenses these funds according to its own detailed policies and priorities.

 The draft International Criminal Court Bill will be published on 22 August for consultation. We are publishing the Bill as soon as it is ready, although this is during the recess, because we are anxious to make progress on legislation as soon as parliamentary time allows. We hope that the draft Bill will receive support from all sides of the House and look forward to receiving comments from interested parliamentarians, individuals and organisations to whom we will be sending unsolicited copies. Any hon. Members who would like a copy of the consultation document sent directly to them at their constituencies or homes should contact the ICC Bill team, United Nations Department, at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. Copies will be despatched on the day of publication. Comments should be received by 12 October.

 Commission document COM(2000)119 proposes the creation of a Rapid Reaction Facility. This would allow for rapid intervention in the form of money from the community budget in situations of emerging or actual crisis in third countries. It would complement humanitarian intervention and other tools deployed in crisis situations. The proposal's legal base is Article 308 and voting in the Council would therefore be by unanimity. The Commission has proposed a budget of 30 million euro in year one. The proposal is still under discussion in the Council.

 <i>[holding answer 26 July 2000]:</i> The purpose of the United Nations International Drugs Control Programme research project into pleospora papaveracea is to determine its viability as a control agent specific to the opium poppy and to establish whether there are any environmental risks in its use.
<P>

<a name="00727w28.html_para6">UK funding was made available in 1998 exclusively for this project, which is expected to last a total of 3&#189; years. Before committing funding, the FCO sought advice from UK agricultural experts at MAFF and at Natural Resources International Ltd (who provide advice to DfID). Their comments, including an assessment of the risks to legitimate cultivated crops, were incorporated into the final design of the project. A British consultant, until recently at the Long Ashton Research Station, has been employed by UNDCP to review and oversee the project and, in particular, to conduct a detailed examination of host specificity of pleospora papaveracea. There has been no direct funding of Long Ashton.

 Limited situations exist where Working Families Tax Credit (WFTC) is partly disregarded in the assessment of Housing Benefit (HB). People who work 30 hours a week or more and who have children may get a partial disregard of WFTC if their earnings are very low. In addition, people with relevant child care costs which cannot be fully met from earnings can have the balance of those costs deducted from WFTC. We have no plans to introduce a wider disregard of WFTC.

 <i>[holding answer 21 July 2000]:</i> Figure 3.6 presents information for counties ranked into five equal sized groups. Although the underlying data were used in the production of the maps, DSS statisticians advise that precise results for individual counties are not robust enough to be presented separately. Results for individual counties are affected by sampling error and response biases and by the fact that the Family Resources Survey, from which HBAI estimates are drawn, has a sample stratified at regional, not county, level.

 Independent sector organisations which provide care services do not receive enhanced payments of Social Security benefits. A resident in an independent sector care home who was there on 31 March 1993 remains entitled by way of preserved rights to higher levels of Income Support as a contribution towards the fees charged by such homes which the resident is responsible for meeting.

The relevant local authority is responsible for meeting the fees and collecting a contribution from the resident; subject to the resident retaining from their income at least &#163;15.45 per week for personal expenses.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. All figures are estimates and are taken from HBAI which is based on the Family Resources Survey. All estimates are subject to sampling error and response bias.<P>

2. 'Dependent primarily' has been defined as income from benefits exceeding 50 per cent. of the family's total gross weekly income. HBAI counts the number of families/benefit units in receipt of Social Security benefits, not the number of households. Therefore figures are quoted on family/benefit unit level. An individual household may consist of more than one family/benefit unit therefore figures presented in the table will be higher than counting the number of households.<P>

3. National Insurance pension benefits consists of the Retirement Pension (including SERPS). Other National Insurance benefits include Jobseeker's Allowance (Contributory based), Incapacity Benefit and Widows Benefit. Income Support includes the income based element of Jobseeker's Allowance.<P>

4. The 'All benefits' line relates to the number of families with income below half average that are dependent primarily on income from Social Security benefits.<P>

5. All figures include the self-employed.<P>

6. Figures are presented for families in households below half average income before the deduction of housing costs (BHC) and after (AHC), in line with HBAI conventions. <P>

 The information requested is not available in the format requested. Such information as is available is as follows.
<P>

<a name="00727w34.html_para3">The number of individuals who were in the bottom two equivalised income deciles and where the hourly earnings of the head of the family in which they belong would have been below the national minimum wage had it existed in 1997-98, deflated from the 1999 rate is 800,000. The estimate is calculated using data from the 1997-98 Family Resources Survey. Of those 800,000 individuals it is estimated that 290,000 were in receipt of Council Tax Benefit. The sample size of the Family Resources Survey is not large enough to allow reliable estimates to be made of the number within the 800,000 who were in receipt of other benefits.

 Leaflet N1272 was withdrawn on 1 November 1999 as part of a review of all the Benefits Agency's leaflets. The review was carried out following extensive research with customers to find out what they wanted from leaflets. The research showed that customers did not find leaflets the best source of detailed information.
<P>

<a name="00727w34.html_para4">For those who would use a leaflet, the research showed that customers wanted the leaflets based on specific life events rather than covering specific benefits. They also wanted the leaflets to contain basic information about all the help they could get in that circumstance and they wanted the information to be just enough to help them to decide whether to claim. Based on the research we withdrew leaflet N1272 and replaced it with a less detailed leaflet SD6 "ill or disabled because of a disease or deafness caused by work".
<P>

<a name="00727w34.html_para5">There are no plans to issue a new leaflet specifically on asbestos-related diseases. However, the Benefits Agency issued replacement literature on 1 November 1999. Its leaflet SD6 "ill or disabled because of a disease or deafness caused by work" is aimed at customers and gives brief details of the Industrial Injuries scheme. It also issued a technical guide, DB1 "A guide to Industrial Injuries scheme benefits", on the same date. This gives

 Schools will be responsible for boosting standards of attainment at the relevant Key Stages over the period of the Spending Review. Full details of these additional responsibilities and the extra resources we are making available to help schools meet them will be announced in due course. We have already announced that headteachers in England will be given &#163;540 million in special grants next year as part of an increase in education spending in the UK of nearly &#163;12 billion from 2000-01

<P>
<a name="00727w36.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 No figures are available of the administrative costs of the Standards Fund. The Government have recognised the need to restrict the burden on schools as the size of the Fund has grown. The Department is reviewing the arrangements for the Standards Fund in consultation with schools, Local Education Authorities and other interested parties. As a result of the review changes will be made to simplify the operation of the Standards Fund from April 2001, details of which will be announced in the Autumn. The main changes resulting from the review will involve reducing the paperwork by simplifying the mechanics of payment and accounting; encouraging an approach focused on outcomes; giving schools and local authorities greater spending freedom; sharing timely management information, and spreading best practice.

<a name="00727w36.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Blunkett: </B> 
 I have today laid before the House the Employment Service's Annual Report and Accounts for 1999-2000 which gives full details of the Agency's performance and expenditure for that year.
<P>

<a name="00727w36.html_para4">The Annual Report records an excellent year's work by the Employment Service. For the first time since 1994-95 it has achieved and in many cases significantly exceeded all its targets for helping unemployed people into jobs. Jobcentres have also been giving record levels of customer service to jobseekers.

<a name="00727w36.html_para14">The Employment Service missed only one of its targets last year, for the correct application of the Jobseeker's Allowance process. It ended the year on 90 per cent. against a target of 96 per cent. Even here, however, there was a substantial improvement in performance during the course of the year.
<P>

<a name="00727w36.html_para15">1999-2000 was a very good year for the Employment Service. Its success was down to the effort and enthusiasm of everyone working in it. I am very grateful to them for that effort, commitment and determination to succeed. I look forward to building on this success in the year ahead and in setting up the new agency to deliver work-focused services to people of working age. I know that people in the Employment Service will rise to the new opportunities and challenges involved in making it a success.

 Based on the survey of 10,000 children conducted by the Office for National Statistics, and published in March 2000, it is estimated that 10 per cent. of children aged 5-15 years have a mental disorder. This includes emotional disorders--anxiety and depression--conduct disorders and hyperactivity. The majority of children with these mental ill health problems are being educated in mainstream schools.

<a name="00727w37.html_para2">My Department, working closely with the Department of Health and taking advice from experts in the child mental health field, is preparing good practice guidance, based on existing case studies, for a range of school settings. This will help teachers work effectively with pupils with emotional and mental health problems. It will be followed by further guidance next year, including examples of effective working between schools and local Child and Adolescent Mental Health services.
<P>

<a name="00727w37.html_para3">The Special Educational Needs element of the Standards Fund grant for England provides scope for funding projects for identifying and providing for the learning needs of children with mental health problems. A number of projects currently underway involve schools working with health services and educational psychologists, including projects with a specific focus on child mental health. We aim to include examples of good practice from these projects in our guidance and make them available on the Department's Internet site. In addition, the support provided under the Standards Fund for Special Educational Needs training may be used for training in relation to children with mental health problems.

Some &#163;620 million is available to support the pledge and allocations so far to Lancashire LEA amount to some &#163;15 million. This has helped to reduce the average infant class in Ribble Valley constituency to 24.8. In January 1997 the figure was 28.0. Over the same period, the average size of junior classes in the constituency has fallen from 30.5 to 30.4. Average secondary class sizes in the constituency have remained broadly stable over this period. Secondary classes nationally have been rising steadily for the last 12 years. In 1988 the figure was 19.9. In the budget, secondary headteachers received between &#163;30,000 and &#163;50,000 each to spend as they choose. If they spent it on teachers, they could reduce the secondary pupil:teacher ratio by 0.4.

 <i>[holding answer 26 July 2000]:</i> There is only one secondary school in the Ribble Valley constituency which has a sixth-form containing potential applicants to higher education. The Department's policy does not routinely allow the release of data for individual schools unless schools have been given the opportunity to confirm or amend their data, and there has been prior ministerial approval for such releases. UCAS do not release data without the prior permission of the school. In any case, it is not possible to make unequivocal links for individual students between school-based and UCAS data.

 The approximate contribution to the increase in the estimated cost in net present value of the Birmingham schools' rebuild package arising from each of the three causes given in my answer of 20 July is:

It is fixed each year and reflects the cost of all local authority borrowing. The rate changed between the outline and final business cases due to changes in the overall cost of local authority borrowing.

This typically means that these loans are repayable over a period of five years in equal annual instalments if the borrower's income is above 85 per cent. of national average earnings. Students entering higher education from 1998-99 are instead offered income contingent loans. Like mortgage style loans these are offered at a zero per cent. real terms interest rate but are repaid in accordance with Regulations in force at the time. The current Regulations require

It is too early to say when the Secretary of State will announce the first decisions of support and agreement for funding for particular City Academy proposals. We will shortly be making available details of the criteria against which we will be assessing proposals. I will ensure that these are sent to the hon. Member. Copies of all supported proposals will be placed in the Library.

 Further to my reply dated 11 January 2000, <i>Official Report,</i> column 146W, in order to achieve charitable status, UfI Ltd. has split into two companies: one, the charity "UFI Charitable Trust", which wholly owns the second, its trading subsidiary "Ufi Limited", which is the operating company.

<P>

<a name="00727w40.html_para1">The controls exercised by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State have been adjusted in the light of the new company structure.
<P>

<a name="00727w40.html_para2">Each company's Memorandum and Articles of Association were approved by the Secretary of State and the Department continues to exercise similar controls over the companies, although the Secretary of State's right to appoint the Chairman and between 30 and 49 per cent. of Ufi Limited's Board Directors/members is now time- limited to 31 March 2005. The Secretary of State's control over appointment of the Chairman and Directors of the charity is not time bound.
<P>

<a name="00727w40.html_para3">The previous Funding Agreement between the Department and Ufi Ltd. has been superseded by one with both companies which provides for a number of checks and controls on the spending of public funds. It specifies the requirement to submit an annual Financial Plan for the approval of the Secretary of State. The Funding Agreement and the Financial Plan provide the basis for financial support.
<P>

<a name="00727w40.html_para4">Ufi Limited will own the assets it creates (mainly intellectual property rights on learning products) and retain any receipts from the disposal of assets. The Department will take account of any income received by Ufi Limited as a result of Government investment, including asset disposal proceeds, in fixing the level of future financial support. This regime will apply only so long as Ufi Limited receives Government support.
<P>

<a name="00727w40.html_para5">If the Funding Agreement is terminated due to breach of contract or insolvency the intellectual property rights will pass to the Secretary of State if he so requests. The Memorandum of the charity provides that if it is wound up or dissolved the Secretary of State has a right of veto over the disposition of any remaining assets. The charity cannot dispose of any of the shares of Ufi Limited without the prior authority of the Secretary of State. The charity cannot alter the constitution of Ufi Limited in so far as this affects the Secretary of State's controls.

But he can only appoint from among those in the legal profession who are suitably qualified and who apply. Therefore the Government support the legal profession in the work it is doing to ensure that there are equal opportunities for all those who wish to pursue careers in the law.

 The Lord Chancellor has made no such assessment. He will discuss changes in court dress with the higher judiciary later this year. However, given the many important and pressing issues relating to reform of the justice system that the Government are addressing, changing court dress is unlikely to have a high priority in his Department's programme of work.

A benefit unit consists of a claimant, his or her partner and any child dependents.

 My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary, and I value very highly the important role Boards undertake as the watchdog of the Secretary of State and the independent and impartial advice they are able to provide, on the standards of fairness and humanity with which those placed in custody by the courts are treated. The majority of Boards work very effectively and provide a good service to Ministers and the public. However, in the light of changes within the Prison Service since the last major review of the role of the Boards of Visitors five years ago, my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary, and I have decided that the time is right for a further review of the Board's role and I am pleased to announce that the right hon. Member for Fareham (Sir Peter Lloyd) has agreed to chair a Working Group to take the review forward. Sir Peter is currently the Chairman of New Bridge, a charity which recruits and trains volunteers to visit prisoners and provides an employment service for ex-offenders.
<P>

<a name="00727w44.html_para1">A Board of Visitors is a body created by statute, and there is one attached to every Prison Service establishment in England and Wales. Board members are lay people appointed by the Secretary of State, who are empowered under the Prison Act 1952:

the composition of and appointments to Boards, including whether there should be any limitation on the overall period of service by members;

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> 6. The Prison Service should be clearly defined as an Executive Agency and be required to perform as such.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1> 9. We believe that service level agreements should be developed for every establishment in the public sector.

In many prisons the extra cost would be covered by the better use of resources.</FONT></UL>
<P>

 <i>[holding answer 18 July 2000]:</i> The Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis tells me that the Principal Security Officer and a member of the senior management team of the Palace of Westminster Security Force meets monthly with the Public and Commercial Services Union which represents the security officers. The minutes of these meetings are available to all staff. We are seeking the approval of the Public and Commercial Services Union to release the minutes of the meeting on 5 April 2000, at which the Principal Security Officer (PSO) informed the union representatives that it had been decided not to offer any further extension of service to staff over 60 years of age.
<P>

<a name="00727w45.html_para11">In the reply I gave on 24 May 2000, <i>Official Report,</i> column 496W, I acknowledged that the Metropolitan Police had experienced difficulties in recruiting security officers for the Palace of Westminster but that these have been overcome as a result of an external recruitment campaign.
<P>

<a name="00727w45.html_para12">Chief Superintendent Roylance of the Metropolitan Police (the officer in charge of policing the Palace of Westminster) met with the security officers' trade union representatives on 19 April after sending the letters on 13 April to those officers where a further extension of service had been declined. He did not meet them prior to the despatch of letters.
<P>

<a name="00727w45.html_para13">Internal selection within the Metropolitan Police Service is carried out at regular intervals by the local personnel unit at no additional cost. The recent external recruitment campaign for security officers was funded by the Metropolitan Police Service Central Recruitment Branch budget. The cost of the campaign advertisements was approximately &#163;33,086. Planning for the campaign began in February 2000 and the advertisements were placed in May. Consideration of the applications and candidate interviews are now in progress. Some 212 applications were received in response to the campaign

but it is not yet possible to say how many of the applicants are suitable. The total number of anticipated vacancies is 68, of which 17 were anticipated to be retirements of staff at or beyond the contractual age of retirement in 2000.
<P>

<a name="00727w45.html_para14">The Metropolitan Police compares favourably with other employers of security officers in terms of both salary and working conditions. The starting salary of a security officer is &#163;10,911 per annum and, in addition, Palace of Westminster officers receive &#163;1,622 per annum London Allowance and a Shift allowance.
<P>

<a name="00727w45.html_para15">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Education and Employment issued a publication: "Age Diversity in Employment: A Code of Practice" in 1999, a copy of which is in the Library. The code covers good practice in six aspects of the employment cycle, including retirement. I have no reason to believe that the retirement policy operated by the Metropolitan Police Service is not fairly applied in accordance with the advice given in the code.

<a name="00727w46.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The very few court proceedings brought for violation of bus lanes cannot be distinguished, in centrally collected statistics, from other offences connected with neglect of traffic directions or obstruction, waiting and parking.
<P>

<a name="00727w46.html_para0">However, the overwhelming majority of bus lane offences are dealt with by fixed penalty notice, and information obtained from the Metropolitan Police shows that 14,936 fixed penalties were issued by them for driving in a bus lane in 1997, 14,107 in 1998 and 12,527 in 1999 (an estimated figure which includes 3,247 detected using video technology and dealt with by way of conditional offer of fixed penalty).

<P>
<P>
<a name="00727w46.html_spnew1"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 The target for processing new travel document applications is six to eight weeks. This is already being met, on average, with applications submitted after September 1999. Applications submitted before this date, between January and August 1999, were taking in excess of nine months to process. However, there are now fewer than 300 of these applications left to process, all of which should be cleared over the next few weeks.
<P>

<a name="00727w46.html_para1">Since Autumn 1999 the number of staff in the Travel Document Section has increased from 20 to more than 90. These extra staff were needed to handle the increasing numbers of new applications and to process the older ones. There are approximately 5,000 new applications still awaiting consideration with staff currently processing those received in early June. The aim is to clear the bulk of these by the end of September.

 Enforcement of the law in respect of cycling offences is an operational matter for individual chief officers of police. The hazards caused by cyclists who break road traffic laws are recognised by chief officers and appropriate action is taken where such offences are detected.

 The Public Safety Radio Communication Service is designed to replace the current range of force-specific radio systems with a national service which meets the needs of modern-day policing.
<P>

<a name="00727w46.html_para4">Throughout the planning stages, as well as the contract negotiations, every effort has been made to keep the costs of the service down. The Police Information Technology Organisation (PITO), which is responsible for managing the Police Service Radio Communications Project (PSRCP), has regularly challenged and validated earlier assumptions and plans. Mechanisms such as benchmarking have been built into the main service contract to help ensure that both initial and future services remain Value For Money. Both the Association of Chief Police Officers and the Association of Police Authorities have concluded that the PSRCP meets technical requirements and offers value for money at a national level.

<a name="00727w46.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 Xenotransplantation includes the transplantation of organs, such as hearts and kidneys, between different animal species and from animals into humans. Organ transplantation is a hugely successful medical procedure--one that has transformed the lives of tens of thousands of people across the world. The critical shortage of human donor organs has led scientists to investigate xenotransplantation as an alternative potential source of organs. This is a policy on which the Department of Health leads.
<P>

<a name="00727w46.html_para5">As I indicated in my reply to my hon. Friend on 11 July 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 538W, almost all of the primates used in xenotransplantation research in the years 1995 to 1999 were euthanased. The majority were killed when they began to show clinical or biomedical evidence of terminal organ failure or when their clinical condition began to give rise to concern and some were euthanased when the procedure reached its pre-determined time point for completion. I understand that a small number of animals died unexpectedly before reaching the planned end point of the xenotransplantation procedure.

 <i>[holding answer 25 July 2000]:</i> Under the Immigration Rules, the Seasonal Agricultural Workers Scheme already enables non-European Economic Area (EEA) students between the ages of 18 and 25 who are in full-time education to enter the United Kingdom to do some seasonal work in agriculture. The scheme is organised through seven approved operators who issue work cards to the students to gain entry into the United Kingdom to participate in the scheme. There is an annual quota which was raised from 5,500 to 10,000 in 1996.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00727w47.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 25 July 2000]:</i> Agency staff are used to fill vacancies in the short term for a variety of reasons. These could include absences due to long-term sick or maternity leave, the need to provide particular skills for a short project or to cover vacancies that are waiting to be filled from recruitment exercises. Casual appointments, normally for less than 12 months are also made for similar reasons. It would not therefore be appropriate to draw a direct relationship between the use of Agency staff and vacancies in the Home Office.
<P>

<a name="00727w47.html_para1">The additional posts that have been made available to tackle the Asylum backlog in the Immigration and Nationality Directorate (IND) have provided opportunities for staff throughout the Home Office. But the vast majority of these additional posts are being filled by recruitment. I am committed to filling all permanent vacancies with permanent staff as soon as possible and a wide range of recruitment exercises have been taken place and are ongoing. For example, in IND, where there is the greatest number of vacancies, 30 recruitment campaigns are taking place and staff are currently joining IND at the rate of about 300 per month. However, until the staff have been selected and are able to join the Home Office, there will be an ongoing need for some vacancies to be covered by Agency staff.
<P>

<a name="00727w47.html_para2">All parts of The Home Office have delegated authority to manage resources, including staff numbers within agreed cash limits. Information on the use and cost of Agency staff is not collected centrally or accounted for separately and could be provided only at disproportionate costs.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department (1) what is the maximum percentage 



<P>
<P><I>27 Jul 2000 : Column: 898W</I><P>
of a police authority's total budget that he would regard as a sum too small to be reimbursed by his Department as an extraordinary operational expense;  [133186]
<P>
<UL>(2) on what grounds the request by Surrey Police for reimbursement of costs relating to the Pinochet operation was rejected by his Department.  [133184]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00727w48.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The Surrey Police were awarded a special payment of &#163;200,000 in March 1999 as a contribution towards the additional costs of protecting Senator Pinochet. A further special payment of &#163;550,000 requested by the Surrey Police in December 1999 was refused.
<P>

<a name="00727w48.html_para4">Their supplementary application was not approved because it was decided, in view of the limited funding available to meet an increasing number of grant applications, to draw up clearer criteria. These conditions require that the burden on the force should be unforeseen; commit them to exceptional additional expenditure, and directly impact on the force's efficiency. Additionally, we will consider special payments, subject to the availability of funding, to cover all or most of the extra costs for events of a national and international dimension that impose a burden on the resources of a force as a consequence of a decision by the Government.
<P>

<a name="00727w48.html_para5">Grant applications would normally be considered to the extent that they exceed 2 per cent. of the force's current revenue budget. In the case of Surrey, 2 per cent. of their budget for 1999-2000 was &#163;1.9 million.
<P>

<a name="00727w48.html_para6">Surrey's request for extra financial assistance had to compete with other more pressing needs, such as the Stansted hijack. We decided that those other demands had first call on the remaining available resources, particularly as some financial assistance had already been provided to Surrey for the protection of Senator Pinochet.
<P>

<a name="00727w48.html_para7">The total additional costs for protecting Senator Pinochet were estimated at &#163;750,000. They were estimated at around 0.8 per cent. of the budget of the Surrey Police.
<P>

<a name="00727w48.html_para8">Once account is taken of the special payment of &#163;200,000 made in March 1999 the proportion of the additional costs that fell on the Surrey Police was reduced to 0.6 per cent. of the force's 1999-2000 budget.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, pursuant to his answer to the hon. Member for Birmingham, Selly Oak (Dr. Jones) of 20 July 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 326W, on departmental initiatives, what is the estimated administrative costs to those bodies making bids for each of the initiatives; and if he will make a statement.

<P>

 The information requested on estimated administrative costs to those bodies making bids for Home Office initiatives is not held centrally, and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost by contacting every body that has made a bid since May 1997.

[133151]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00727w48.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer will shortly publish a comprehensive list of new public service agreements (relating to the Spending Review 2000) for all Government Departments. However, these public service agreements will not come into effect until April 2001.
<P>

<a name="00727w48.html_para9">The Public Service Agreement (PSA) relating to the 1998 Comprehensive Spending Review covers the period 1999-2002. No targets contained in that PSA have been discontinued, although some have already been met. The Home Office continues to work towards delivery of outstanding targets. Details of the targets, and performance against them up to December 1999, are recorded in the Home Office Annual Report 1999-2000 (copies of which are available in the Library). Information on progress will be provided in subsequent Home Office Annual Reports--the next of which is expected to be published around April 2001.

<P>
<a name="00727w49.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 Under the spending review, the amount of additional funding for Home Office-led crime reduction initiatives is likely to increase by at least 20 per cent. in 2001-02. However, the exact figures and the final breakdown between the crime reduction and police initiatives will not be finalised until September.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00727w49.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 Payment of grant to the Women's Royal Voluntary Service was formally reviewed in 1997. The review found that grant from the Home Office supported services which had the potential to recover costs in full from local purchasers (ie local authorities, health trusts and emergency services) and through fund-raising.
<P>

<a name="00727w49.html_para1">The Review recommended that the grant should gradually be reduced over 10 years to a level equivalent to that of our other largest voluntary sector grant recipients, which is currently around &#163;700,000 to &#163;900,000 a year.

preparations for the World Conference Against Racism; what were the decisions of this meeting; and what plans he has to publicise the conference.  [131395]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00727w49.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The meeting in Warsaw was one of a series of five Experts Fora convened by the Secretariat of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.
<P>

<a name="00727w49.html_para2">Invitees were selected from independent organisations knowledgeable in the field, rather than from Governments. The United Kingdom-based Minority Rights Group attended.
<P>

<a name="00727w49.html_para3">The purpose of the meeting was to discuss issues surrounding the protection of minorities and other vulnerable groups and the strengthening of human rights capacity at national level. The meeting was not supposed to make any decisions.
<P>

<a name="00727w49.html_para4">These five Experts Fora are not part of the preparatory process in which United Kingdom Government officials will continue to play an active part.
<P>

<a name="00727w49.html_para5">Until the preparatory process is further advanced, it would be premature to commence with publicising the World Conference.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00727w49.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The Data Protection Commissioner was known until 1 March 2000 as the Data Protection Registrar. Details of all prosecutions carried out by the Registrar/Commissioner up until 31 March 2000 are contained in the Registrar's 5 to 15 Annual Reports to Parliament and in the Commissioner's first such report.

 My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Office is responsible for data protection policy. The Data Protection Act 1998 sets out the requirements which individuals and bodies processing personal information must satisfy. The Act came into force in March, and we are keeping its operation under review.
