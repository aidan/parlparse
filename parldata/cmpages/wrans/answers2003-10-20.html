<P>
1. <a name="31020w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mrs. Dunwoody: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions if he will make a statement on <i>(a)</i> the proposed method of payment of state benefit for pensioners who cannot access a bank account and <i>(b)</i> the timetable for the receipt of such benefit after 2005.  [132601]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31020w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Andrew Smith: </B> 
 While over 90 per cent. of pensioners have bank or building society accounts, and nearly half of all pensioners already choose to be paid by Direct Payment, we of course recognise that there will be some whom we will not be able to pay in this way.
<P>

<a name="31020w01.html_para0">We are presently consulting groups such as Age Concern, Help the Aged and the National Pensioners Convention about paying such pensioners by cheque.
<P>

<a name="31020w01.html_para1">We plan to have this service in place from October next year.

 Jobcentre Plus and the Pensions Service are modernising the service we provide to our customers. Staff movement between different roles is an ongoing feature of the development of these-new services. Ministerial colleagues and I meet the Department's trade union representatives from time to time. Managers and union representatives at all levels meet routinely to discuss staffing plans.

17. <a name="31020w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Randall: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions if he will make a statement on the Government's policy on saving for retirement.  [132617]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31020w01.html_spnew2"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 Our aim is to help people choose how they plan for retirement, how much they save and how long they keep working. Our immediate priority was to tackle pensioner poverty and we have, through the Pension Credit, both increased the amount individuals receive and also rewarded those who have saved. Through our Green Paper and Action on Occupational Pensions proposals we have sought to increase security, promote flexibility of provision and reinvigorate the pensions partnership. We want to give individuals real choices about the savings decisions they take through the provision of the right information and the right products&#151;this we are doing through our informed choice programme and proposed suite of stakeholder

 Over one-and-a-half million stakeholder pensions have been sold since their introduction in April 2001; over half a million in the last 12 months for which figures are available. This is an encouraging start, and a sign of confidence in the product.

<P>
19. <a name="31020w01.html_wqn4"><B> Andrew Selous: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions if he will make a statement on Government plans to reform state pensions.  [132619]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31020w01.html_spnew4"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 We have done much to improve the State Pension. The introduction of State Second Pension focuses help on those with low to moderate earnings, and on qualifying carers and long term-disabled people who have broken work records.
<P>

<a name="31020w01.html_para2">We have increased the basic State Pension by more than the RPI for the last three years. We have also guaranteed to increase the basic State Pension in future years by 2.5 per cent. or the increase in the September Retail Prices Index whichever is the higher.
<P>

<a name="31020w01.html_para3">In addition, the new Pension Credit is designed to ensure that pensioners benefit from their savings. These initiatives will help provide greater security for tomorrow's pensioners.
<P>

<a name="31020w01.html_para4">We will continue to look at sensible and affordable ways of improving the State Pension, such as giving a better deal to people who defer their State Pension.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions how many pensioners the Government estimates will be receiving pension credit by 2006.  [132620]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31020w01.html_spnew5"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 We are the first Government ever to set a take up target for any benefit and we aim to have at least 3 million pensioner households receiving Pension Credit by 2006.
<P>

<a name="31020w01.html_para5">However, we want every pensioner to take up their entitlement. We have already written to 1.6 million pension households to tell them about Pension Credit and will be writing to the remainder by June 2004. In addition we are running a major advertising campaign on TV and in the press to familiarise, pensioners, their families and friends with Pension Credit and to encourage them to apply.

 Around 1.9 million pensioner households on our systems are already being paid Pension Credit. This represents over two million

<P>

<a name="31020w01.html_para6">Anyone who applies by October 2004 will be able to receive payment from the start of the scheme or the first date they are entitled.
<P>

<a name="31020w01.html_para7">Around half of all households are eligible for Pension Credit and stand to gain on average &#163;400 a year (or around &#163;7 a week).

<P>
23. <a name="31020w01.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Blizzard: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions how many pensioners are entitled to Pension Credit in Waveney constituency.  [132624]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31020w01.html_spnew7"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 The information is not available in the format requested. However, an estimated 300,000 pensioner households are eligible for Pension Credit in the Eastern region.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31020w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Pond: </B> 
 The Child Support Agency and Jobcentre Plus work closely together to provide customers with the best possible service.
<P>

<a name="31020w01.html_para8">Jobcentre Plus staff gather information on behalf of the Child Support Agency to ascertain either the details of the non-resident parent or the reasons why a parent with care on benefit does not wish to apply for child support. In the latter case, Jobcentre Plus staff also decide whether she has good cause.
<P>

<a name="31020w01.html_para9">Jobcentre Plus also collect maintenance by making deductions from non-resident parents' benefit payments.

However, it was material to that conclusion that there was intelligence evidence that the Iraqi authorities had intimidated scientists which UNMOVIC wished to interview; that rooms designated for such interviews had been bugged; and that some potential interviewees had been kept away from UNMOVIC by the Iraqi authorities and that there was evidence that Iraqi scientists had been intimidated into refusing interviews with UNMOVIC outside Iraq.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31020w02.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 Such availability is a matter for the US authorities which tendered the recycling contract. We understand that AbleUK won the particular contract for 13 ships in competition with US and foreign bidders and that other contracts have been won by US firms. Trade in waste for recovery or recycling is legal among OECD countries and the EU has its own needs for efficient and properly regulated ship recycling facilities as a contribution to sustainable development.

A total of 88 proposals have been submitted to amend and modify the existing provisions and to provide for new concessions. The UK has worked hard with the European Commission, and others to assess and meet the concerns of developing countries. Accordingly the WTO membership has now agreed to 25 of these agreement-specific proposals. However, central to the issue concerning special and differential treatment is how to take account of country differences (e.g. Singapore to Ghana) within WTO agreements. Developing countries are reluctant to address the issue of country classification now and only within the wider context of future negotiations. DFID is working with others on possible options to provide an effective delivery mechanism for special and differential treatment.

 The UK Government are committed to increasing access to medicines in the developing world. The factors recognised by the World Health Organisation (WHO) that can improve poor people's access are; affordable pricing, sustainable financing, reliable health and supply systems and the rational selection and use of existing drugs. Appropriate donations of medicines can play a useful role, including through the use of UK's tax relief on drug donations, although country-level procurement of affordable medicines is likely to be more sustainable in the long term.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31020w05.html_spnew5"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 The Zimbabwe Emergency Food Security and Vulnerability Assessment released in April made a provisional estimate of 5.5 million people needing food aid by the first quarter of 2004. This figure might rise, since, with inflation now almost 500 per cent., many more people, particularly in cities and towns, cannot afford food even where it is available. The Government of Zimbabwe lacks the foreign exchange to import grains and continues to restrict the role of the private sector in importing and distributing food. The number of people needing feeding in urban areas is being assessed this month.
<P>

<a name="31020w05.html_para6">To date, less than 40 per cent. of the funding required for the current World Food Programme's Emergency Operation has been pledged by donors. Food aid supplies are therefore secure only through December. An interruption in food supplies, combined with the high level of HIV/AIDS in Zimbabwe, would obviously risk a significant increase in mortality rates. We are working closely with other members of the international community to update the overall estimates of humanitarian need. We will continue to monitor the position closely and encourage further contributions as necessary. This week we announced an additional contribution of &#163;5 million to the WFP Emergency Operation. This is in addition to some &#163;11 million of new commitments we have already made this year through NGO partners for food aid and agricultural recovery, and some &#163;2 million granted to UNICEF for vaccines to immunise against childhood diseases.

<P>
<a name="31020w07.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Caplin: </B> 
 Since 2001 there have been three alleged incursions by military aircraft into the restricted airspace around AWE Aldermaston. The RAF Police Defence Flying Complaints Investigation Team investigated all these incidents and in each case it was found that no breach of the restriction had occurred. Alleged incursions of the restricted airspace by civilian aircraft would be the responsibility of my right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State for Transport.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence (1) whether the Ministry of Defence Police have jurisdiction over former Ministry of Defence dwellings and areas of the Colchester Garrison which have been sold by Annington Homes to private owners;  [132813]
<P>
<UL>(2) whether the security of military personnel and dependants living in Ministry of Defence housing at the Colchester Garrison has been reviewed following the disposal of dwellings by Annington Homes; and if he will make a statement.  [132812]<P></UL>

<P>
<a name="31020w07.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Caplin: </B> 
 The security situation in the Colchester estates that are now occupied by Service families housed by the Defence Housing Executive (DHE), owner-occupiers and civilian housing association tenants, is unchanged since I replied to the hon. Member's question on this matter on 18 June 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 246. The regular routine patrols continue and there has been no increase in crime since DHE's releases of surplus property and the lease of properties by AHL to Colne Housing Association.
<P>

<a name="31020w07.html_para0">Any incidents arising in the DHE patch are the responsibility of Ministry of Defence Police (MDP); the Essex police cover the non-DHE areas, and the two police forces assist each other when required. The Royal Military Police also patrol the estate. Overall these arrangements imply a greater police presence and better response times than anywhere else in Colchester.
<P>

<a name="31020w07.html_para1">75 per cent. of the DHE properties have the recommended level of door furniture security; the remainder have chains and spy holes but, in some cases, only 3-lever locks. These will be replaced with 5-lever locks in this financial year.

 The appropriate level of security clearance for locally engaged personal assistants is determined, in accordance with HM Government's statement of vetting policy, as announced to the House on 15 December 1994 (<i>Official Report</i>, columns 764&#150;66). The levels required for staff both locally engaged and UK based, are based on the need for them to have access to classified material. The requirement

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs whether, at the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference, the Government will seek to amend Article III-206, with particular reference to the provision that states that: When the Union has defined a position on a subject which is on the United Nations Security Council agenda, those member states which sit on the Security Council shall request that the Union Minister for Foreign Affairs be asked to present the Union's position; and if he will make a statement.  [131512]<P>

<a name="31020w09.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. MacShane: </B> 
 The Government will not seek to change the aforementioned provision in Article III-206 at the Intergovernmental Conference. This Article allows for a continuation of the current practice, in line with the Security Council's Rules of Procedure, whereby the Presidency can speak at open meetings of the Council. Under the new Treaty, the European Foreign Minister instead of the Presidency will represent the Union where non-members of the Council are permitted to speak and when the Union has defined a common position on the subject of the meeting.
<P>

<a name="31020w09.html_para0">The UK retains the right to speak in a national capacity as a permanent member of the Security Council. This is safeguarded in Art III-206.2, which states that

 The British Government continue to believe that securing a comprehensive settlement in Cyprus by 1 May 2004, and enabling Cyprus to accede to the EU as a reunited island, is in the best interests of all Cypriots, and of the wider region.

 The UK believes the weapons of greatest concern in developing countries are landmines and small arms and light weapons (SALW). It is on those weapons that we focus our efforts.

<P>

<a name="31020w11.html_para1">The UK is at the forefront of international efforts to curb the problem of small arms proliferation and the damage they cause. The UK fully supports the UN Programme of Action on SALW and the OSCE document on SALW which commit states to dispose, preferably by destruction, of small arms stocks that are surplus to national requirements.
<P>

<a name="31020w11.html_para2">The UK strategy on small arms and light weapons is supported by the &#163;20 million (2001&#150;04) SALW Global Conflict Prevention Pool jointly funded by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the Department for International Development and the Ministry of Defence. The UK has given the United Nations Development Programme &#163;7.5 million over three years to help fund a global programme of weapons collection, stockpile management, capacity building and destruction. In addition, the FCO has also directly funded SALW destruction projects in five developing countries including part funding for an EU SALW project in Cambodia.
<P>

<a name="31020w11.html_para3">The Government spends approximately &#163;15 million per year on humanitarian mine programmes. The Department for International Development is currently funding mine action in Iraq, Afghanistan, Sudan, Cambodia, Angola and Georgia. We also actively work towards the destruction of anti-personnel landmines by encouraging states which have not become party to the Ottawa Convention to ratify or accede at the earliest opportunity. Once party to the Convention, states are legally obliged to destroy stockpiled anti-personnel landmines and to clear mine-affected areas within a given timeframe.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what assessment he has made of the effectiveness of bilateral agreements on the free movement of labour and trade, between the EU and Switzerland; what steps the Government is taking to ensure these agreements are adhered to; and if he will make a statement.  [131930]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31020w11.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. MacShane: </B> 
 The bilateral agreements on trade provide an effective framework for trade between the EU and Switzerland. Switzerland is the EU's most important trading partner after the United States. In 2002 Switzerland was Britain's fourth biggest market for goods outside the EU with exports valued at &#163;3.3 billion. The UK is Switzerland's fifth biggest export market, valued at &#163;4.9 billion in 2002.

<P>

<a name="31020w11.html_para4">The 1999 Agreement relating to free movement of workers between the EU and Switzerland allows member states and Switzerland to maintain quotas on granting residence to Swiss or EU workers respectively for a transition period up to 2014. The Agreement has been operating smoothly. The UK, like many member states, has chosen not to maintain such quotas, in the interests of reaping the full economic benefits of free movement of labour. Negotiations are now underway to amend this Agreement to take account of EU Enlargement.
<P>

<a name="31020w11.html_para5">The Commission is directly responsible for monitoring the bilateral Agreements and does so through a framework of Joint Committees that meet at least once a month. The Government follows this process and can raise any relevant issues in Council Working Groups in Brussels.

 Extensive consultation with external representative bodies has been conducted both before Finance Act 2003 and after. Representations have also been received and considered from individuals, companies and organisations affected by the proposals and many useful suggestions have been made. These have been used to inform decision making, one example being the amendments I am today proposing to the Stamp Duty Land Tax treatment of leases, where continued consultation, as promised in the Budget, has helped shape the revisions to the Finance Act 2003.

<a name="31020w13.html_para0">Following a recommendation of the Julius Banking Consumer Codes Review Group, Professor Elaine Kempson independently reviewed the Banking code in November 2002. The majority of her recommendations were accepted and the new Banking Code came into force in March of this year.
<P>

<a name="31020w13.html_para1">Secondly, the OFT have agreed to a number of undertakings with the eight main clearing banks to address the findings of the Competition Commission Report into SME banking in March 2002. These remedies will make it easier for customers to shop around and to move accounts between banks. In addition the four leading clearing banks have agreed to offer SME customers in England and Wales an account paying interest of at least the Bank of England base rate minus 2.5 per cent., or a current account free of money transmission charges.

 The Government does not need guarantees from the European Commission about the future of the UK's VAT zero rates.

 The Secretary of State has discussed beef exports with Commissioner Byrne on a number of occasions, most recently on 22 September at the informal Agriculture Council at Taormina. Defra officials have also had regular meetings with the Commission officials. The Commission has sought advice from the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) on amending the Date-based Export Scheme (DBES) and our methodology of scaling up testing results to support our claim that restrictions should be lifted so that the UK can trade on the same basis as other member states. An EFSA Opinion is expected in early 2004.

 The Government has just completed a consultation on a proposal to implement the Large Combustion Plants Directive for plants first licensed before July 1987 using a national plan. Analysis conducted for my Department suggested that such an approach would lead to significant cost-savings when compared to the alternative implementation approach. The financial dynamics of a trading scheme will depend on the decisions of operators of plants who take part in such emissions-trading. An outline of how such a trading scheme might operate was included in the consultation document but further consideration would be needed before the scheme could be introduced.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what information regarding animal welfare <i>(a)</i> on the journey and <i>(b)</i> at the final destination is requested by the animal exports division before authorisations for exports are granted; and if she will make a statement.  [132442]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31020w14.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Before livestock are exported, transporters must submit a Route Plan setting out details of the proposed journey. Officials check that the transporter is authorised, that the proposed journey times are within the maximum allowable for the species and that all necessary rest, watering and feeding breaks are included. If assembly centres, staging points or slaughterhouses are included in the planned journey, staff check that these are EU approved premises. The use of Staging Points also requires the transporter to provide a statement to the effect that the necessary health requirements will be met there and that the animals are booked into the premises on the dates specified on the Route Plan.
<P>

<a name="31020w14.html_para0">Once staff are satisfied that the proposed journey appears to meet these conditions, the plan is sent to a Local Veterinary Inspector. The animals are then inspected to ensure they are fit for their intended journey and that they meet the health requirements of transit and destination countries.
<P>

<a name="31020w14.html_para1">Supervised loadings of vehicles may be carried out to ensure only fit and healthy animals are loaded, that the vehicle is suitable and that stocking densities are correct. Animals for slaughter or fattening may be inspected on arrival at the port or transfer onto a vessel.
<P>

<a name="31020w14.html_para2">These checks are carried out scrupulously and only when all have been satisfactorily completed will the animals be allowed to start their journey.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31020w14.html_spnew2"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 Atrazine is to be withdrawn from use as an agricultural pesticide throughout the European Community, following a full scientific review. Products containing atrazine will be withdrawn over an 18-month period which will begin on formal adoption of the relevant European Commission decision, which we anticipate within the next few months. However, certain 'essential uses' will be permitted until the end of 2007. The essential uses agreed for the United Kingdom are for sweetcorn and forestry.

 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="31020w14.html_para3">The role of the Food Standard Agency (FSA) regarding importation of agricultural produce includes ensuring necessary action is taken to protect public health where the use of illegal pesticides or veterinary medicines is detected. The FSA receives information on these from the European Commission and from surveillance carried out by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra). The FSA can also carry out its own surveillance where there are concerns for public health. The FSA and local authorities have regulatory powers to prevent food that poses a threat to human health from entering the food chain or to withdraw it from sale.
<P>

<a name="31020w14.html_para4">All food products of animal origin being imported to the United Kingdom from non-European Union countries are subject to documentary and identity checks at designated border inspection posts by an official veterinary surgeon. A percentage of consignments are subjected to a physical check, which may include laboratory tests for residues from illegal chemicals. These controls have been enhanced on certain produce from countries with known chemical residue problems. Products of non-animal origin are subject to routine inspection at ports of entry and may be examined, sampled and detained.

 The Government strongly supports impartiality in the broadcast media and there are relevant provisions in legislation to ensure that television and radio channels broadcasting in the UK maintain political impartiality.
<P>

<a name="31020w15.html_para0">Responsibility for what is broadcast on television and radio rests with the broadcasters and the broadcasting regulatory bodies&#151;the Governors of the BBC, the Independent Television Commission, the Welsh Fourth Channel Authority and the Radio Authority. The regulators' codes of practice place a requirement on broadcasters to treat controversial subjects with due accuracy and impartiality, both in news services and in the more general field of programmes dealing with matters of current public policy or industrial controversy. It is for the regulatory bodies, not Government, to decide whether any particular broadcaster is or is not complying with its obligations regarding impartiality.
<P>

<a name="31020w15.html_para1">Under the Communications Act 2003 the Office of Communications (Ofcom) will have similar responsibilities for maintaining impartiality from the end of this year.

<P>
<a name="31020w15.html_spnew4"><B> Mrs. McGuire: </B> 
 Scotland's manufacturing sector, along with that of other advanced economies, has experienced falling output in recent times, due to the global slowdown and re-structuring in key industries such as electronics.

 On 6 May 2003 the Government announced its intention to move the date of the English local council and Greater London authority elections in 2004 from 6 May to 10 June. This will enable them to be combined with the European Parliamentary elections and provide convenience to electors, enabling them to participate in all the elections at the same time rather than voting twice in a short period of time. As a consequence of combining these elections, the term of office for those sitting councillors in England affected

 About &#163;320 million per year would be raised by English local authorities if 100 per cent. council tax were charged on all long-term empty domestic property other than those subject to exemptions. This represents an additional &#163;160 million because there is currently a 50 per cent. discount on council tax for long-term empty domestic properties. There are, in addition, some categories of long-term empty domestic property that are exempt from council tax.

An analysis of the responses received was placed in the Library on 5 June. We have since received a number of representations on this matter, instigated by the National Association of Taxi and Private Hire Licensing and Enforcement Officers.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31020w17.html_spnew8"><B> Paul Goggins: </B> 
 The Government set out its position on these issues in its response, published in April this year, to the Fourth Report of the Home Affairs Committee (Session 2001&#150;02) "The Conduct of Investigations into Past Cases of Abuse in Children's Homes":
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"55. The Committee's recommendation [that the law of similar fact evidence is reformed to require a "striking similarity" in historical child abuse cases] would return the law on similar fact evidence (for these cases) to the position that applied following the case of Boardman in 1975. However, the test for admitting such evidence has developed since then to recognise that its value is not limited to cases of "striking similarity". For example, multiple accusations against an offender have a significance that derives from the unlikelihood that a person will be independently falsely accused of offences of a like nature, whether or not there is a particular degree of similarity. Whilst such accusations do not establish that an incident is true, and issues of collusion need to be considered carefully (as they would if the threshold were "strikingly similar"), such evidence is certainly relevant to assessing the cogency of a witness's account. Evidence of other incidents might also be relevant when considering an innocent explanation put forward by the defendant&#151;what might credibly be explained as a mistake on one occasion becomes much less so in respect of repeated incidents. Here, too, the relevance of the other allegations does not depend on establishing a particular level of similarity between the events.
<P>
<BR>
56. The Government is therefore concerned that reverting to the "strikingly similar" test would risk denying juries and magistrates a range of potentially highly relevant evidence. Our approach, as embodied in our proposals for reforming the law on evidence of bad character in the Criminal Justice Bill currently before Parliament, is to enable juries and magistrates to hear the widest range of relevant evidence that will assist them to reach a fair verdict. The admissibility of bad character evidence should therefore depend on its relevance to the issues in the case, rather than on a particular degree of similarity.
<P>
<BR>
57. We are not, however, complacent that dangers cannot arise where evidence is admitted in these circumstances. However, there are safeguards to ensure that trials are fair. For example, in determining whether to admit the evidence, the courts must consider whether it would be more prejudicial than probative. The judge will therefore be able to direct that the charges be considered evidentially separate if necessary. And where this might not be sufficient to secure a fair trial, the judge can order that the various charges are tried separately, ensuring that the jury in each case is not aware of the evidence in the others. The Criminal Justice Bill also proposes that judges should be under a duty to withdraw a case from the jury where it becomes clear that seemingly independent allegations are in fact the result of collusion or other distortion and a conviction would be unsafe.
<P>

58. The Committee also recommends a presumption in favour of ordering separate trials where allegations cannot be heard as evidence in support of each other on a similar fact basis. In their judgement in the case of Christou (1997), dealing with the severance of charges for sexual offences, the House of Lords held that a trial judge should exercise his discretion to sever to achieve a fair resolution of the issues. This is buttressed by the Human Rights Act 1998, which makes it clear that the courts must act in a way that is compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights including ensuring a fair trial. Given the centrality of fairness to the issue of severance, it is not clear what the proposed presumption would substantively add. The Committee is concerned that "sexual offences tend to engender greater prejudice than non-sexual offences" (paragraph 96). However, we do not agree that this warrants a special rule to deal with historic child abuse cases: the issue of prejudice will clearly be an important aspect of deciding whether severance is required and to the extent that there is a greater risk of prejudice in any particular case, whether of historic child abuse or any other, the argument in favour of severance will clearly be stronger."

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department whether the Government will adopt the recommendation by the Home Affairs Committee to amend the Criminal Justice Bill so that where the prosecution wish to interview a defence witness in advance of trial <i>(a)</i> they should be required to notify the defence and offer to interview the witness in the presence of the defence and <i>(b)</i> that interview would be tape-recorded.

 A Government amendment to Part 5 of the Criminal Justice Bill was agreed by the House of Lords on 14 July 2003. This introduced a new clause requiring the Secretary of State to prepare a code of practice giving guidance to police officers in relation to the arranging a conduct of police interviews with defence witnesses. This provides that the code must include guidance on the notification and presence of the accused's solicitor at the interview. It is also the Government's intention that the code should include guidance on making an accurate recording of the interview either by writing or audio-recording where this is appropriate. Further details of the amendment may be found in the House of Lords, <i>Official Report</i>, 14 July 2003, columns 744&#150;45W.

 There were 296 prisoners unlawfully at large as at 30 June 2003 (out of 75,000 prisoners who had been released on Home Detention Curfew between January 1999 and 30 June 2003) and who subsequently had their licences revoked for breaching the conditions of the scheme.

 The Home Office (with the exception of the Prison Service) is not a direct purchaser of food as this is provided through Facilities Management Contracts. Food purchased directly relates to official hospitality and where applicable we pay a subsidy to the Facility Management contractors for the provision of food in staff restaurants. By subsidising the costs of meals in the staff restaurants we are able to reduce the daily costs of staff working in central London which aids staff retention and provides them with a variety of nutritional snacks and hot meals.

 The Prison Service Security Manual gives instruction to all prisons on how to strip search prisoners in line with Prison Rule 41 and Young Offender Institution Rule 43. The frequency with which this is carried out is generally decided by the prison governor and the area manager, except for certain activities where there is mandatory routine strip searching, such as reception.
<P>

<a name="31020w19.html_para0">There is no equivalent central guidance issued by local authority secure children's homes. Each home operates its own policy according to their security needs. Some homes do not strip search any young persons in their care, while others may strip search all new arrivals. Strip searching may also be carried out where there is suspicion that illicit items are being concealed, sometimes with the assistance of the police. The methods used to perform a strip search are also decided by each centre without central guidance.
<P>

<a name="31020w19.html_para1">The Secure Training Centre (STC) Rules 1998 and the Operational Procedures of the companies that run the three STCs provide guidance that must be followed by staff involved in strip searching. These techniques are similar to those used by the Prison Service.

<a name="31020w19.html_para2">The current Prison Service Policy on strip searching in the Security Manual (Prison Service Order 1000) applies to all categories and types of prisoner. This includes instructions on techniques and frequency of strip searching.
<P>

<a name="31020w19.html_para3">The Prison Service recognises the sensitivities around the strip searching of young prisoners, and separate guidance has recently been issued to Governors of prisons holding juvenile prisoners emphasising the need for staff to be aware of specific child protection issues.
<P>

<a name="31020w19.html_para4">Training modules for new entrant officers also include specific advice for staff involved in conducting strip searches of young prisoners.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Department for Constitutional Affairs whether the Government plans to restrict coroners' post mortem retentions only to material that is required for evidentiary purposes of a legal nature.  [132339]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31020w20.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Lammy: </B> 
 The post-mortem examination in Northern Ireland is a key stage in the investigation of deaths referred to a coroner, as the findings identify the medical cause of death and often determine whether or not any further action on the part of the coroner is required. There are two main purposes for which it is necessary to retain organs or tissue samples, i.e. to enable the pathologist accurately to determine the cause of death or for evidential purposes in suspected criminal cases. It will therefore continue to be necessary to retain organs or tissue samples for both these reasons.

 On 13 October I published the legislative proposals for public consultation to regulate dangerous wild animals kept by private individuals in Northern Ireland. The proposed legislation will require anyone owning or wishing to own a dangerous wild animal to apply to the Department of the Environment for a licence. It will also establish stringent criteria, on matters such as public safety, security of accommodation and animal welfare, which will need to be met, and confirmed by inspection, before the grant of a licence. The draft legislation also specifies licence conditions which the licence holder will have to meet while any dangerous wild animal is being kept. The consultation paper has been circulated and the Department of the Environment would welcome any views on the legislative proposals.

 There are no forecasts of Northern Ireland manufacturing export sales. However, between 1996&#150;97 and 2001&#150;02, manufacturing export sales increased by 45 per cent. in real terms. The Invest NI Corporate Plan and "Building on Progress&#151;Priorities and Plans 2003&#150;06" includes a target for the growth of export sales. The current target is for manufacturing export sales to increase by 10 per cent. each year in real terms between April 2002 and March 2005.

 The Raising the Achievement of Dyslexia Pupils: Dyslexia Friendly Teaching project was one of 16 projects in receipt of grant under the Department's Special Educational Needs (SEN) Training and Development Fund 2002&#150;03. The fund was established to provide one-off pump priming support to aid the creation of new, or extended, in-service training and development opportunities for teachers and other staff, both in mainstream and special schools. The aim was to help improve and reinforce skills in the area of SEN and disabilities.
<P>

<a name="31020w22.html_para4">This particular project is being delivered by the Institute of Education at Manchester Metropolitan University (MMU), working in collaboration with the British Dyslexia Association. It involves a validated module, targeted at new or recently qualified teachers and learning support assistants, and includes the creation of course materials and video case studies of successful practice in schools and classes. This material has now been completed and is in the process of being edited and transferred to a DVD format for the classroom and a CD-ROM covering the teaching

 Additional funding for such schools would need to come through the budget shares calculated in accordance with the local education authority's school funding formula. Any school concerned with this issue should press for change through local consultative procedures. The Department will be considering the overall needs of such schools through a working group being set up this autumn.

<a name="31020w23.html_spnew1"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 On 16 July 2003 my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education pledged to commission research into the support networks of pregnant teenage asylum seekers, <i>Official Report</i>, column 95WH.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31020w23.html_spnew2"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 The Government recognises that making child care affordable is a key challenge for the National Childcare Strategy and has made a substantial investment to achieve this. We have funded a substantial expansion in child care provision in the public, private

<P>

<a name="31020w23.html_para2">Working parents, subject to the level of their income, may receive support through the child care element of the Working Tax Credit (WTC). Tax credits are rightly targeted at lower and middle income families who may use a range of registered or approved child care. The child care element of the Working Tax Credit provides for up to 70 per cent. of costs of eligible child care. It can pay up to &#163;94.50 a week for one child (where the childcare cost is &#163;135), and up to &#163;140 a week for two or more children (where the cost is &#163;200).
<P>

<a name="31020w23.html_para3">No Government has provided the kind of direct support for the costs of child care that is delivered by the child care element of the Working Tax Credit. Over &#163;650 million a year is now spent on supporting parents with child care costs.
<P>

<a name="31020w23.html_para4">Families are further supported through early education places, which can be used to off-set the cost of child care. As a result of our policies, all four year olds are able to access a free, good quality, part-time early education place. From April 2004, six months ahead of the original target, this will be extended to all three year olds. Currently 88 per cent. of three year olds are able to benefit from some level of free provision.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31020w23.html_spnew3"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 The local authority area of Redcar and Cleveland is planning to create an additional 360 childcare places in 2003&#150;04 bringing their total stock of childcare places to approximately 3100 by April 2004. This will represent some 13 places for every 100 children aged 0&#150;14 in the area compared with an estimated national average by 2004 of 15 places for every 100 children.
<P>

<a name="31020w23.html_para6">To help meet the national target for a further 250,000 new childcare places by March 2006 Redcar and Cleveland have been allocated a target to create 598 new childcare places in 2004&#150;06.

 Pay, contractual arrangements and job descriptions are matters for local determination: the Government believe that this is the best way of ensuring a flexible system that can respond to local needs and circumstances. Many local authorities, including Leicestershire, have reviewed support staff pay and undertaken job evaluations in the light of the agreement&#151;commonly known as the Single Status Agreement&#151;made in 1997 by the National Joint Council for Local Government Services. I understand that that National Joint Council is in the process of issuing guidance about the grading of school support staff.

 We do not expect that any tuition fees will be paid to Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) in advance of the academic year for which they are charged. From 2006, students will decide whether they will defer payment until after they graduate, or whether to pay their tuition fees up front. Where a student chooses to defer payment, the Government will pay the tuition fee to the HEI during the academic year for which it is charged. The details of the arrangements for the timing of the payment or payments during the academic year have yet to be finalised.

A further 121,000 tonnes were imported, a proportion of which may have been re-exported. It is not possible to identify exports of sand by source, i.e. whether they were obtained from marine dredging or were land won.

<P>
<a name="31020w26.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 The regulatory impact assessments referred to in my answer of 17 July took account of the costs and benefits to all relevant sectors, and were produced in accordance with best practice, as set out in the Cabinet Office publication "Better Policy Making: A Guide to Regulatory Impact Assessment". All the assessments were published in the corresponding DTI and Defra consultation papers, and placed on the appropriate Departmental website.

 <i>[holding answer 14 October 2003]:</i> We are currently working on implementing the EU Emissions Trading Scheme. We have already undertaken a draft consultation on different methodologies and a consultation is under way on draft regulations. A consultation on the draft national allocation plan will start in December 2003. Other analytical work is under way. It is not possible at present to calculate the impact on specific sectors while a number of aspects of implementation are still to be agreed and action by other member states to be finalised.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31020w26.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 I have been asked to reply. All licence applications are assessed on a case-by-case basis against the Consolidated EU and National Arms Export Licensing Criteria. The stated end-use of the equipment is one factor taken into account when making the assessment.
<P>

<a name="31020w26.html_para3">The Hawk trainer aircraft are intended solely for training purposes, although they would have limited combat capability as they are fitted with the necessary systems and interfaces to allow them to carry a range of weapons for training for combat.

<P>

<a name="31020w26.html_para4">Beyond the standard end-user undertaking requirements for export licences (which our Posts overseas will monitor), no specific additional conditions would normally be placed on the end-use of any equipment and technology licensed for transfer to India.
<P>

<a name="31020w26.html_para5">The Indian Air Force already has a range of other aircraft that are much more suitable for combat purposes, including modern Mirage 2000 and SU-30 aircraft. Although it would be possible for the Indians to convert the aircraft in an operational role, we are confident they are purchasing the aircraft for training purposes to fill a gap between their existing trainer aircraft and their front-line fast jets. The Hawk is to be used to teach Indian pilots to fly fast jets safely.

 The government's Sector Advisory Panel for IT meets regularly to assess the system for issuing work permits. The composition of the panel is broad and includes members from representative organisations and contractor groups. This panel advises in the UK's national interest and ensures that we strike the right balance between enabling employers to move skilled staff from within their companies while protecting job opportunities for resident workers. This policy is kept under regular review.

 Decisions on closures of individual post offices are an operational matter for Post Office Ltd., but all such proposals are subject to public consultation under the Code of Practice agreed between Post Office Ltd. and Postwatch. Post Office Ltd's decision to close Brondesbury Crown post office has been taken in the context of its programme to restructure the urban post office network and the need to address the substantial losses made by the Crown office part of the network. I understand from Post Office Ltd. that there are three alternative offices between half and three-quarters of a mile from Brondesbury.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry how many gas-fired power stations are classified as <i>(a)</i> shipper nominated interruptible, <i>(b)</i> Transco nominated interruptible and <i>(c)</i> network sensitive loads.  [132435]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31020w27.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 There are 19 interruptible Combined Cycle Gas Turbine stations (CCGTs) in England and Wales. Transco has rights of interruption over all of these CCGTs. The shippers' contractual arrangements are not fully known, but it is thought that in the great majority of cases, they do have interruption rights. Even if they do not, the stations may still be self-interrupted in order to arbitrage between the gas and electricity markets. One of these CCGTs is a Network Sensitive Load, which means that its position within one of the Transco Networks makes it more likely to be interrupted for reasons of local capacity constraints. Another CCGT is in a network sensitive position from an electricity perspective. Based on National Grid Transco's latest information and experience of this station switching fuels when interrupted in the past, there is a high degree of confidence in the station's alternative fuel capability.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health (1) what measures other than advising women of lifestyle changes his Department is taking to prevent breast cancer;  [131315]

 It is not clear exactly what causes breast cancer, but it is thought that there are many risk factors, some already well established and some still being investigated. The main risk factors are being female and increasing age. The majority of other risk factors are linked to lifestyle. Key prevention measures include improving dietary intake, including increasing fruit and vegetable consumption, increasing physical activity and staying at a healthy weight.
<P>

<a name="31020w28.html_para6">About five per cent. of all breast cancer cases (fewer than 2,000 per year) may be caused by breast cancer genes. The National Institute for Clinical Excellence is developing a clinical guideline on the classification and care of women at risk of familial breast cancer in primary, secondary care and tertiary care. The guideline is expected to be published in February 2004.

<a name="31020w28.html_para7">The Government's White Paper, "Our Inheritance, Our Future&#151;Realising the Potential of Genetics in the NHS", was published in June 2003.

It is envisaged that there will be six evaluated pilot sites in England to inform the future development of cancer genetic services, as envisaged in the National Health Service Cancer Plan. Bids for pilot project funding must be submitted by 31 October 2003.

The remit of the COC is to advise Government Departments on all aspects of the carcinogenicity of chemicals. The COC is currently reviewing new data on this issue.
<P>

<a name="31020w28.html_para12">The COC has also considered the possible association between alcoholic beverages and breast cancer. A statement was issued in 1995, indicating that there was not enough evidence to conclude that the ingestion of alcoholic beverages was a cause of breast cancer. The COC is reviewing new data on this issue with a view to updating its statement next year.

 Since 1 April 2002, all new staff in care homes have been required to obtain a satisfactory Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) check as part of their pre-employment checks. The impact of this requirement was assessed as part of a Regulatory Impact Assessment.
<P>

<a name="31020w29.html_para2">However, in the light of the initial difficulties experienced by the CRB in dealing with the level of demand for checks, in June 2003 the National Care Standards Commission (NCSC) issued interim guidance on how to deal with recruitment of care home staff, while steps were taken to improve the CRB's performance. The intention of the guidance was to enable care homes to recruit staff while ensuring residents were protected.

<a name="31020w29.html_para3">Following significant improvements made at the CRB, the NCSC rightly decided to look again at its guidance.

<a name="31020w30.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 Nine choice pilot schemes are in operation. Local schemes covering a wide range of specialties are operating in Berkshire, Dorset and Somerset, Greater Manchester, London, Trent, Surrey and Sussex and West Yorkshire. In addition, we have a national coronary heart disease choice pilot and an ophthalmology choice pilot operating across the south of England. Strategic health authorities, primary care trusts and national health service trusts are involved in the planning and delivery of choice pilots. NHS Direct has also provided support to three pilot schemes that are operating with call centre based patient care advisers.

 NHS Direct is currently involved in three pilot schemes to offer choice of hospital to national health service patients.

 A number of pilot schemes are currently offering patients choice over the hospital in which they receive their treatment.

The experience and learning of the choice pilots will support the national roll-out of patient choice.

<a name="31020w30.html_para1">The number of reports received via the yellow card scheme does not directly equate to the number of people who suffer adverse reactions to drugs for a number of reasons, including an unknown level of under-reporting. It is important to note that the reporting of a reaction does not necessarily mean it was caused by the drug and may relate to other factors, such as the patients underlying illness or other medicines taken concurrently.
<P>

<a name="31020w30.html_para2">As with all medicines, the MHRA and the Committee on Safety of Medicines are keeping the safety of venlafaxine under continuous review.

 The table shows the number of national health service sight tests paid for in Calderdale and Kirklees Health Authority (HA) for 1997&#150;98 to 2002&#150;03. Figures for the number of sight tests by constituency or age are not collected centrally. The table shows the number of sight tests where "patient aged 60 and over" was given as the eligibility category and all other sight tests.
<P>

<a name="31020w30.html_para5">Eligibility to NHS sight tests was extended to those aged 60 and over from 1 April 1999. There was an increase of 2.4 million sight tests between 1998&#150;99 and 1999&#150;2000 in England. It is fair to assume that the vast majority of this increase was due to newly eligible people aged 60 or over obtaining NHS sight tests.
<P>

<a name="31020w30.html_para6">However, some patients aged 60 and over will be eligible for sight tests for other reasons as well (for example, on income grounds). The classification for such patients will depend on the patient and the

Work focusing on telemedicine and e-health is being taken forward by the Isle of Man. A working group has met seven times since February 2001 and members have visited a number of telemedicine applications either being piloted or in everyday use. This work has been particularly useful to those administrations with the challenge of delivering health and social care in rural and remote communities.

<P>

 High blood pressure is addressed through the national service framework (NSF) for coronary heart disease, which identifies the importance of prevention, detection and effective treatment of high blood pressure.




<P>
<P><I>20 Oct 2003 : Column 467W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="31020w32.html_para0">National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines for the management of hypertension in primary care to be published in February 2004, and the new general medical services contract, will further support national health service action to tackle high blood pressure.
<P>

<a name="31020w32.html_para1">It is also essential that individuals across the population be made aware of the risks associated with high blood pressure and the importance of regular testing. The Department has contributed to the funding of the Blood Pressure Association's national blood pressure testing week in September 2002 and again this year. This voluntary screening event offers people the chance to visit temporary blood pressure testing stations in order to check their own blood pressure numbers and find out more about high blood pressure.
<P>

<a name="31020w32.html_para2">The Department, working jointly with the Food Standards Agency, has called on industry to take a lead in reducing salt in processed foods and together will lead a salt stakeholders meeting to highlight the role of all sectors including industry health and consumer bodies.
<P>

<a name="31020w32.html_para3">Wider initiatives, such as five-a-day, to increase fruit and vegetable consumption and the recently formed, cross-government activity co-ordination team to increase mass participation in physical activity and sport, also have the potential to reduce the risk of high blood pressure in individuals.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31020w32.html_spnew2"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 The Department's policy for recommending influenza vaccination is to protect those most at risk from serious illness should they catch influenza.
<P>

<a name="31020w32.html_para4">If employees of companies are in the recommended risk group to be vaccinated they can receive their flu vaccination from their general practitioner free of charge. Otherwise it is a decision for individual companies as to whether or not they offer their employees influenza vaccination under an occupational health scheme.
<P>
<P>
<a name="31020w32.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Hancock: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health what plans he has to extend the provision of free influenza vaccinations to citizens under 65; what assessment he has made of the cost of extending provision; and if he will make a statement.  [132462]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31020w32.html_spnew3"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 Departmental policy is determined following recommendations from the Joint Committee on Vaccinations and Immunisation (JCVI). This is an independent group of experts, which reviews all current research on the subject of immunisation and its recommendation is based on reducing morbidity and mortality among the population.




<P>
<P><I>20 Oct 2003 : Column 468W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="31020w32.html_para5">Based upon current scientific research, the JCVI recommends that people aged 65 years and over and those aged under 65 years of age in certain clinical risk groups benefit most from being immunised against influenza.
<P>

<P>

<a name="31020w32.html_para7">A draft guideline was issued to a stakeholder group for consultation on 2 June 2003. A second draft was published for public consultation on 26 August.

<sup>(18)</sup> In October 2002, responsibilities for dentistry were moved from health authorities (HAs) to primary care trusts (PCTs).<P>

<P>

<i>Note:</i><P>

Registrations lapse if patients do not return to their dentist within 15 months. The registration figures for children therefore exclude those who have not been to their GDS dentist within the past 15 months. The figures also exclude children who receive dental treatment from other national health service dental services, including dental access centres.<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what proportion of children were registered with an NHS dentist in each primary care trust in the last year for which figures are available.  [131030]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31020w32.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 At 30 June 2003, 6.7 million children were registered with a general dental service (GDS) dentist in England, 60.4 per cent. of the population of children. Information on the percentage of the population and of children registered with a dentist in each strategic health authority area and primary care trust (PCT) area by region at 30 June 2003, has been placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="31020w32.html_para11">Primary care trusts have little influence over the provision of general dental services in their area under the current statutory arrangements. Proposals in the Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Bill will give PCTs a duty to secure the provision of primary dental services. The proposed changes will help underpin a modernised high-quality primary dental service provided through contracts between PCTs and dental practices properly integrated with the rest of the national health service. With these new responsibilities will go the &#163;1.2 billion financial resources currently held centrally.
<P>

<a name="31020w32.html_para12">Registrations lapse if patients do not return to their dentist within 15 months, and so the registration figures exclude patients who have not been to their GDS dentist within the past 15 months.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health (1) whether his Department has completed an audit of whether the guidance "Good Practice in Continence Services" has improved paediatric continence services;  [132876]
<P>
<UL>(2) what assessment his Department has made of how the children's national service framework will improve services for children with continence problems;  [132885]
<P>
(3) what assessment his Department has made of how many children in England suffer from <i>(a)</i> nocturnal enuresis, <i>(b)</i> daytime wetting and <i>(c)</i> constipation and soiling.  [132887]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31020w32.html_spnew10"><B> Dr. Ladyman: </B> 
 Good Practice in Continence Services was issued by the Department in April 2000 and provides guidance to primary care trusts (PCTs) on continence services. This includes that PCTs should have specialist continence services in place, which provide patients with an individual assessment of their needs. Provision of these services in England is a matter for PCTs, which are responsible for determining the level of services required to meet the needs of their local populations.
<P>

<a name="31020w32.html_para13">The children's national service framework (NSF) will set out standards covering a broad range of services, including the management of common childhood conditions. Whilst few specific conditions will be covered, the standards are likely to cover what support should be available to children and their parents in managing a wide range of conditions and problems, including enuresis and soiling. The NSF will emphasise the promotion of evidence-based clinical guidelines and a number of examples of good practice in a range of different areas.
<P>

<a name="31020w32.html_para14">Information on the prevalence of these common conditions in childhood is not collected centrally.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31020w33.html_spnew5"><B> Dr. Ladyman: </B> 
 Functional electrical stimulation (FES) is available only in specialist centres where there is an interest in the procedure. It requires physiotherapists who have specialist training in the technique supported by specialist medical physicists. The forthcoming National Clinical Guidelines for Stroke from the Royal College of Physicians states that FES should not be used on a routine basis and that it should only be considered for a very select group of stroke patients as determined by local protocols. We do not know how many national health service trusts provide FES as a treatment for stroke.
