To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what price incentives the Government support to encourage consumers to purchase energy efficient products.  [67966]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90201w01.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 On 1 July 1998 a reduced VAT rate of 5 per cent. was introduced for the installation of certain energy saving materials under Government funded grant schemes. The reduced rate is targeted at the less well-off.
<P>

<a name="90201w01.html_para0">So far, over 135,000 people have benefited from Government-funded incentive schemes run by the Energy Saving Trust to encourage consumers to install energy efficiency measures. Current schemes include incentives to install insulation, efficient heating, efficient lighting and appliances and small scale Combined Heat and Power.
<P>

<a name="90201w01.html_para1">The Government's Home Energy Efficiency Scheme provides grants for energy efficiency measures for householders receiving income related benefits, disability allowance, or who are over sixty years old. HEES has helped over 2.5 million households over the last seven years.

 I am pleased to be able to announce today the conclusion of the consultation. Routine domestic tasks provided by charities on a not for profit basis are VAT exempt welfare services when an assessment has been carried out which shows that there is a risk to recipients' physical or mental health or welfare because they are unable to carry out the tasks safely or adequately, or without significant pain or discomfort. Customs will be publicising the details.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security what <i>(a)</i> financial and <i>(b)</i> other assistance is available to severely disabled under-fives who have difficulties in walking to allow access to the Motability scheme.  [68697]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90201w01.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Bayley: </B> 
 Access to the Motability Scheme is via receipt of the Higher Rate Mobility Component of Disability Living Allowance, or War Pensioners Mobility Supplement. We recognise that Disability Living Allowance does not help with the mobility needs of severely disabled children under five years old, and this is why we have proposed extending the higher rate mobility component (currently worth &#163;35.85 a week) to three and

four year olds to help combat the disadvantage which they suffer. The change is intended to take effect from April 2001. This help will be neither means-tested nor subject to a contribution condition, and it will be tax-free. It will also allow access to the Motability Scheme under the normal rules.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90201w01.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 Of the 840,000 UK State pensions paid to people living abroad, about 380,000 already receive annual upratings. The total annual cost of unfreezing the remaining pensions paid abroad is &#163;275 million. Due to competing demands and constraints on Social Security spending, in the UK there are no plans to do so.

1. Numbers are rounded to the nearest thousand.<P>

2. Income support replaced supplementary benefit in April 1998.<P>

3. Data are not available for 1995.<P>

4. Numbers are given at a point in time. For 1979, the month was November. For 1980, to 1984 the month was December. In 1986 and 1996, the month was February and from 1987 to 1998, the month was May.<P>

5. Sample sizes: 1977-82 supplementary pension cases 1 in 200; supplementary allowance cases 1 in 50. 1983-87 supplementary pension cases 1 in 200, supplementary allowance cases 1 in 50. 1988-1993 1 in 100. 1994 to date 1 in 20.<P>

6. The numbers of income support and supplementary benefit claimants for the period prior to 1996 include claims for income support for the unemployed. In October 1996, jobseeker's allowance replaced income support as the benefit claimed by the unemployed. The figures from 1996 onwards therefore do not include any claims by the unemployed.<P>

7. The numbers of lone parents claiming income support for the period prior to 1996 may include claims by unemployed lone parents. The figures provided for 1996 onwards will not include unemployed lone parents.<P>

8. An estimate of the 1998 population of Great Britain has not published by the Office for National Statistics. We have therefore used the population estimate for 1997 when completing our calculation for 1998.<P>

<P>
<a name="90201w03.html_spmin0"><B>The Prime Minister:</B> 
 The 1999 report of the Review Body on Senior Salaries, covering pay arrangements for the senior civil service, senior military officers and the judiciary, together with the annual uprating of Parliamentary salaries, has been published today. Copies are available in the Vote Office and the Library of the House. I am grateful to the Chairman and Members of the Pay Review Body for the work they have put into their report.
<P>

<a name="90201w03.html_para1">In the Comprehensive Spending Review, the Government made it clear that public sector pay settlements would need to be fair, affordable and consistent with the targets for public service improvements which we have set. The terms of reference of the Review Body on Senior Salaries were revised to ensure that, in making its recommendations, four key considerations set out in the Comprehensive Spending Review were taken into account:
<P>

<a name="90201w03.html_para2"><P>

<P>
</FONT></UL>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the requirements on departments to stay within their three year expenditure limits; and
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="90201w03.html_para5"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the Government's inflation target, requiring responsibility in pay settlements across the public and private sectors.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="90201w03.html_para6">The main recommendations of the Review Body on Senior Salaries are:
<P>

<a name="90201w03.html_para7"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>an increase of 2.8 per cent. in the minimum and maximum values of each of the pay bands for the senior civil service. Within the bands, Departments will determine individual awards on the basis of performance.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="90201w03.html_para8"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>an increase of 3.3 per cent. in the maxima of the pay ranges within which individual salaries are set for senior military personnel.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="90201w03.html_para9"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>an increase of 3.5 per cent. in judicial salaries.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="90201w03.html_para10">The Review Body recommended that these increases should take effect from 1 April 1999.
<P>

<a name="90201w03.html_para11">The Government are satisfied that these recommendations reflect the key considerations set out in the Comprehensive Spending Review and we have therefore decided to accept them. The additional cost of the recommendations will be contained within the Departmental expenditure limits announced in July and it remains the Government's intention to meet the objectives 



<P>
<P><I>1 Feb 1999 : Column: 422</I><P>
and targets set out in the Public Service Agreements. This is in line with the Government's prudent and disciplined approach to public spending and their commitment to delivering high quality public services and low inflation.
<P>

<a name="90201w03.html_para12">The Lord Chancellor will respond in the next few weeks to the Review Body's recommendations on the fee structure for part-time judiciary which, although included in this report, was an exercise separate from the Review Body's consideration of senior salaries.
<P>

<a name="90201w03.html_para13">Pay increases for Members of Parliament and Ministers are linked automatically to the increase in pay bands for the senior civil service. Their pay entitlement from 1 April 1999 will therefore increase by 2.8 per cent. in addition to the 1.5 per cent. increase due as the deferred second stage of the 1998 pay award.
<P>

<a name="90201w03.html_para14">The Review Body on Senior Salaries will produce shortly a further report on the pay of junior Ministers in the House of Lords, office holders in the devolved administrations and on certain aspects of Parliamentary allowances.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what powers included in the Criminal Justice (Terrorism and Conspiracy) Act 1998 have been used; on how many occasions; and if he will make a statement.  [67922]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90201w04.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 Records indicate that, as of today's date, no cases have come to court in the United Kingdom involving the use of the powers in sections 1-4 of the Criminal Justice (Terrorism and Conspiracy) Act 1998 (concerning proscribed and specified organisations). However, investigations continue and use of the powers is of course, available for the future. As to sections 5-7 of the Act (conspiracy to commit offences outside the United Kingdom), information on their use is not collected centrally, but it is expected that data on convictions will begin to become available in Spring 1999.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department (1) what assessment he has made of changes in the incidence of graffiti over the past five years;  [68458]
<P>
<UL>(2) if he will make a statement on the Government's initiative to prevent graffiti on public property; and what is his estimate of the annual amount of money spent on cleaning up graffiti on public property;  [68455]
<P>
(3) what plans his Department has to introduce a national or regional graffiti tackling squad.  [68457]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90201w05.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 Graffiti is a form of criminal damage, which is recorded in the Home Offices Statistical Bulletin "Notifiable Offences". According to the Bulletin covering England and Wales, April 1997 to March 1998, there were 861,800 offences of criminal damage recorded in 1997-98, a fall of 8.2 per cent. on the previous year. The Bulletin does not give a sub-total for graffiti. It is not possible, therefore, to comment on the changes of incidences of graffiti over the past five years. Nor is it possible to estimate with any degree of accuracy the amount of money spent on cleaning up graffiti on public property.
<P>

<a name="90201w05.html_para1">The Government do, however, take this form of offence seriously. Under the Criminal Damage Act 1971, where the value of the damage is more than &#163;2,000, the maximum penalty is ten years' imprisonment for those over 18, and up to two years' detention in a Young Offenders Institution for those aged 15-17.
<P>

<a name="90201w05.html_para2">The Government have no present plans for a national or regional graffiti tackling squad. One of the most effective ways of tackling crimes such as vandalism and graffiti is through co-ordinated preventative action at local level involving all of the relevant agencies such as the police, local authorities, schools and other voluntary bodies leading to a plan of action.
<P>

 The first two stages of the Quinquennial Review of the Prison Service have now been concluded and I am today placing in the Library copies of the Evaluation of Performance and the Prior Options Report. A revised Framework Document is being finalised and will be published shortly.
<P>

<a name="90201w05.html_para6">The Evaluation of Performance concludes that since becoming an agency, and during a period of rising prison population, the Prison Service has achieved a remarkable turnaround in performance to which agency status has contributed for the following reasons:
<P>

<a name="90201w05.html_para7"><P>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a more cohesive organisation with a more visible Director General enables him to provide clearer leadership and to communicate with the organisation more effectively and to speak publicly for the Prison Service.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="90201w05.html_para10">The Prior Options Report reviews agency and other organisational options for the Prison Service and concludes that continued agency status offers the most appropriate and cost effective means of achieving Home Office aims. It notes and endorses the major agenda of work already in progress or planned as a result of the Comprehensive Spending Review and the Prison Probation Review. It notes the need for further work in the next period of agency status on contractorisation issues taking into account experience with tighter "contracts" between Headquarters and individual prisons and the overall contribution of the private sector to prison services.
<P>

<a name="90201w05.html_para11">In the light of these findings, I am accepting the recommendation of the Prior Options Report that agency status should be reconfirmed.

 There has been very little uptake of organic farming in Northern Ireland.

<a name="90201w06.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Ingram </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 28 January 1999]:</i> Plastic baton rounds are used by the police and Army in Northern Ireland only where life or property is at risk, and provide a means by which police officers and soldiers can protect themselves when under attack. Ideally, it would not be necessary to use them: if there were no violent disorder then there would be no requirement to deploy plastic baton rounds.
<P>

<a name="90201w06.html_para12">The nature and scale of public order situations which can arise in Northern Ireland and the threat of terrorist attack often prevent the security forces from attempting to control rioters at close quarters. Plastic baton rounds have allowed the police and the Army to keep a distance between themselves and other lethal missiles. Alternatives methods of riot control have been employed and considered but have generally proved less effective in Northern Ireland conditions.

As I have made clear, the figures for the development budget announced at the time of the Comprehensive Spending Review took account of some of the anticipated proceeds in subsequent years from the sale of the Commonwealth Development Corporation. However, if the proceeds were not realised in full, the development budget would nevertheless be maintained at the levels announced for 1999-2000 to 2001-02.

 We have not been directly involved in assessing the need for post-trauma counselling although other donors, including United Nations Children's Fund, have been involved in this important area.

 We have continued to be a key donor to the 1998 crisis. The World Food Programme currently holds enough stocks until the end of March. We have pressed the UN system to increase efficiency and effectiveness by producing an appeal for 1999 which is realistic and focused on humanitarian priorities and which makes full use of all delivery methods. The UN 1999 Consolidated Appeal was issued last week and we will

 Our programme of support to the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement and the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs helped ensure that these agencies moved speedily to conduct initial damage and needs assessments following the severe earthquake on Colombia on 25 January. We have responded quickly to the appeal for assistance from the Government of Colombia by contributing US$1 million through humanitarian agencies. In addition, the European Community's Humanitarian Office has contributed $1.25 million, of which the UK share is $187,500.

 EC Council Directive 92/102, which requires all sheep to be tagged or tattooed before they leave the holding of birth, was adopted in November 1992. The Directive requires Member States to establish a system of identifying and registering animals. The Scottish agricultural industry is being consulted on how best to meet this legal requirement. Questions about the practicality of unique tagging of animals, the costs

associated with doing so and the necessary additional record-keeping involved have all been raised during the consultations and are under consideration. The flexibility allowed within the Directive as to when to apply the tag should help minimise welfare concerns. It is estimated that tagging sheep in according with the Directive could cost about approximately &#163;2 million.

 This matter was considered in the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) Report "Fragments of Irradiated Nuclear Fuel in the Dounreay Local Environment", which was referred to in the Answer of 14 January.

turn, was informed by work carried out by the Committee on Medical Aspects of Radiation in the Environment (COMARE).
<P>

<a name="90201w08.html_para6">The advice in the SEPA report was that the fuel fragments were not likely to affect the health of members of the public unless there was direct skin contact with, or accidental ingestion of, a fragment.
<P>

<a name="90201w08.html_para7">The effect of contact or ingestion would depend on the nature and length of contact with, and the activity of, the fragment. In the event of accidental contact with a fragment the effect could be some blistering of the skin and possible infection, unless the contact was prolonged. The effect of ingestion would depend on the activity of the fragment and whether it passed through the body or lodged in the gut. The immediate effects could range from no detectable effect to severe gastro-intestinal illness. In the longer term, the risks of developing a cancer could be marginally increased. The annual probability of bait collectors within the intertidal zone at Sandside beach making skin contact with a fragment was estimated at 1 in 200,000 in the SEPA report. There have been no known cases of bait collectors or any other member of the public coming into contact with particles.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90201w09.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. George Robertson: </B> 
 The 1999 Report of the Armed Forces Pay Review Body has been published today. Copies are available in the Vote Office and the Library of the House. I am grateful to the Chairman and members of the Review Body for the work they have put into the report.
<P>

<a name="90201w09.html_para11">In the Comprehensive Spending Review the Government made it clear that public sector pay settlements would need to be fair, affordable and consistent with targets for public service improvements we have set. The new arrangements announced in the CSR for the Pay Review Bodies were designed to ensure a closer and more effective link between pay settlements, departmental expenditure limits and service delivery targets. Under these new arrangements, the AFPRB now reports to me, as responsible Departmental Minister, as well as to the Prime Minister. The Terms of Reference of the AFPRB were revised to ensure that, in making their recommendations, four key consideration set out in the CSR were taken into account:

<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="90201w09.html_para16">The AFPRB has recommended an increase in basic military salary of about 3.5 per cent. for all ranks, with the exception of: Privates and Lance Corporals (and their equivalents) who should receive 3.6 per cent.; Lieutenants and Captains (and their equivalents) who should receive 3.7 per cent.; and Brigadiers (and their equivalents) who should receive 3.3 per cent. Additional Pay (eg Flying Pay and Submarine Pay) will also increase by 3.3 per cent.
<P>

<a name="90201w09.html_para17">I am satisfied that these recommendations take account of the four key considerations and will support the Services' strategies to achieve full manning. The additional cost of this settlement will be contained within my Department's expenditure limits announced in July and we will continue to meet the objectives and targets set out in my Public Service Agreements. This is in line with the Government's prudent and disciplined approach to public spending and its commitment to delivering high quality public services and low inflation.
<P>

<a name="90201w09.html_para18">The AFPRB's recommendations are to be accepted in full, with implementation effective from 1 April 1999.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90201w09.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson: </B> 
 The Ministry of Defence continues to liaise closely with the US Government on all aspects of Gulf veterans' illnesses. These links are of 



<P>
<P><I>1 Feb 1999 : Column: 444</I><P>
particular importance because the USA has the largest population of Gulf veterans--some 700,000 US personnel deployed to the Gulf in 1990-91--and there is a substantial federally funded research programme underway there.
<P>

<a name="90201w09.html_para19">My predecessor, my right hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton, North and Bellshill (Dr. Reid), visited the US in October 1997 to discuss Gulf veterans' illnesses issues and I intend to visit the US myself later this year to see at first hand how the US Government are responding to this complex and difficult problem and to discuss the way forward. The MOD has a full time Gulf Health Liaison Officer based in Washington, who works on a daily basis with US federal agencies and research teams. In addition, the UK is represented on the US Persian Gulf veterans Co-ordinating Board Research Working Group, which oversees all US federal research looking at Gulf veterans' illnesses, in order that the UK can have full visibility of that research, both to keep abreast of the latest developments and to avoid duplication of effort. In the course of dealing with this subject, MOD officials have also discussed Gulf veterans' illnesses issues with officials and researchers from a number of other counties, including France, Canada, the Netherlands and Denmark.
<P>

<a name="90201w09.html_para20">The MOD continues to monitor all published research which may be relevant to the issue of Gulf veterans' illnesses. In June last year, my Department announced that it would be funding an independent systematic literature review of worldwide published research relating to Gulf veterans' illnesses. The review, commissioned through the Medical Research Council (MRC), will be carried out over a period of 3 years by a team led by Professor Glyn Lewis at the University of Wales School of Medicine in Cardiff. The findings of the review will be published at six-monthly intervals. An initial report to the MRC is expected in the Spring, with the first full report likely to be published in Autumn.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how many British Gulf War veterans have subsequently tested positive for depleted uranium poisoning having not exhibited symptoms during examination by Medical Assessment Programme physicians which indicated a requirement for a specific referral to another agency or organisation for depleted uranium testing.  [65974]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90201w09.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson: </B> 
 In general, the Ministry of Defence has no knowledge of any tests, including those to detect the presence of DU, which may have been carried out on Gulf veterans independently of the Gulf veterans' Medical Assessment Programme (MAP), through other organisations providing medical or radiological services. However, the Ministry of Defence is aware that a US physician is reported as having carried out tests for the presence of DU on some UK Gulf veterans. So far, however, my Department has not received any details of the methodology behind the tests which have been performed or of the results reportedly obtained. Hence, at present, the MOD is not able to comment on these reported findings.
<P>

<a name="90201w09.html_para21">Nevertheless, as I explained in my reply of 16 December 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>521</i>, I have asked my officials to collate the information which the 



<P>
<P><I>1 Feb 1999 : Column: 445</I><P>
MOD possesses concerning mechanisms which could be used to test for the presence of uranium in the human body. I expect to publish this work shortly, and shall make arrangements for copies to be placed in the Library of the House.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90201w09.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Beith: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence for what reason the standard battery of tests routinely carried out on Medical Assessment Programme patients does not include a specific test to detect depleted uranium.  [65973]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90201w09.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson: </B> 
 The medical programme which became the Gulf veterans' Medical Assessment Programme (MAP) was set up in July 1993 in order to examine veterans who were unwell and who believed their illness was related to their service in the Gulf. The intention was to provide a diagnosis wherever possible and to document all illness in veterans referred to the Programme. A veteran referred to the Programme was examined by a Consultant Physician and a number of tests and examinations were carried out. This essentially remains the case today.
<P>

<a name="90201w09.html_para22">When the Programme was first established, Wg Cdr (now Gp Capt) Bill Coker (who ran it until December 1996) initially carried out those tests he felt necessary on clinical grounds to establish a diagnosis. When the number of patients referred to the MAP increased, he carried out a number of screening tests, similar to those then used by the US Department of Defense's Comprehensive Clinical Evaluation Programme (the US DoD's equivalent to the MAP). These screening tests did not include a test to detect the presence of uranium because Gp Capt Coker had not previously seen any features in patients to indicate that such testing was clinically necessary. The US experience had suggested that the urinary excretion of uranium was only significantly increased in those veterans with retained DU fragments. As MOD was not aware of any UK Service personnel who had sustained shrapnel injuries from DU-based ammunition, it was not thought appropriate to screen routinely for uranium excretion, although testing could be carried out on a case by case basis if clinically indicated. Any other tests considered clinically appropriate would also be performed, these additional tests varying from patient to patient. This system of investigation was in place at the time of the Royal College of Physicians' (RCP) clinical audit in 1995.
<P>

<a name="90201w09.html_para23">The RCP's subsequent report, published in July 1995, endorsed the MAP's professional independence and integrity and made specific comments on how the Programme could be improved. However, with the exception of a recommendation concerning psychiatric assessments, the RCP did not recommend any changes to the tests and examinations carried out by the MAP.

<a name="90201w09.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson: </B> 
 The Ministry of Defence is aware that Aspartame, an artificial sweetener, has been suggested as a possible cause of the illnesses being experienced by some Gulf veterans. However, this is only one of many such suggestions in this context and my Department is not aware of any published scientific evidence to support this theory. So far as the Ministry of Defence is aware, no specific research is being conducted to investigate a possible relationship between the consumption of Aspartame and Gulf veterans' illnesses.

 When it became apparent that organophosphate (OP) pesticides had been more widely used by UK forces during the Gulf conflict than had previously been thought, the Ministry of Defence carried out an urgent investigation into the circumstances in 



<P>
<P><I>1 Feb 1999 : Column: 447</I><P>
which they had been used. The investigation team's report was published on 10 December 1996. Copies of this report were placed in the Library of the House. Broadly, the team found that OP pesticides were, in the main, used properly by personnel who are trained in the safe use of such products, including the wearing of Personal Protective Equipment.
<P>

<a name="90201w09.html_para39">The Ministry of Defence is currently funding a programme of research into different aspects of Gulf veterans' illnesses. None of these studies is specifically aimed at investigating a possible relationship between exposure to OP pesticides and such illnesses.
<P>

<a name="90201w09.html_para40">Research to investigate the effects of low level exposure to OP pesticides in the context of the health concerns of farm workers, funded jointly by the Department of Health, Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF) and the Health and Safety Executive, is well under way at the Institute of Occupational Medicine in Edinburgh. This will be an important step towards understanding the possible effects of potential exposures during the Gulf conflict. Final data analysis is currently taking place and the study as a whole is expected to be completed in April this year. The study team's report is expected later in the Summer. The MAFF is also currently funding a study at the Chemical and Biological Defence Sector of the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency (DERA) at Porton Down to determine whether a low dose of the OP diazinon will give rise to adverse long term effects.

 The cost to date of Project ASH is around &#163;2.7m including VAT. A contract for development and production was placed with EDS Defence Ltd. in November 1994. Other companies which have been involved are Bactec International Ltd., for database population, VEGA Group PLC, providing technical support to the Ministry of Defence Procurement Executive, and Thompson-Thorn Missile Electronics Ltd., who are conducting work on training needs. Although ASH was accepted into service in October 1996, further work was required to be done to the database and for management aid for handling unexploded ordnance. Following user trials in February 1999 it is expected that an improved version of ASH will be accepted and subsequently deployed to Bosnia to assist Army Explosive Ordnance Disposal teams.

 The MOD spent &#163;550 million, VAT-exclusive; to the nearest &#163;50 million, on defence equipment from contractors based in Scotland during 1996-97. The MOD does not record payments made to sub-contractors and has not made an estimate of what those payments might be.

[68080]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90201w10.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The Armed Forces use propellant produced at Royal Ordnance Bishopton to fire a range of 105mm and 155mm artillery projectiles and 120mm tank projectiles, the Naval 4.5" Gun and rocket motors for the Royal Navy's Sea Wolf and Sea Skua missiles. It also produces raw propellant material used in a number of in-service missiles and small calibre ammunition manufactured at other locations. We have considered carefully the future supply of propellants currently made at Royal Ordnance Bishopton and are satisfied that, where necessary, sufficient and reliable alternative sources exist overseas to meet future MOD requirements should the facility close. Royal Ordnance remain responsible for meeting all its commitments under existing contracts with the MOD.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90201w12.html_spnew5"><B> Janet Anderson: </B> 
 The New Millennium Experience Company (NMEC) has implemented a number of procedures for controlling waste during the construction phase of the dome. All contractors are required to specify waste management practices within their tender documentation, and implementation of these practices is assessed by weekly inspections and spot checks.
<P>

<a name="90201w12.html_para1">During the year of the Millennium Experience, NMEC will adopt a waste management strategy based on the concepts of waste reduction, re-use, recycling and efficient removal from the site. NMEC is currently investigating supply strategies that will minimise the quantity of packaging coming onto the site, but will then provide facilities to allow separation of those major waste streams that are generated in order that they can be processed or recycled efficiently.
<P>

<a name="90201w12.html_para2">The final details of the operational strategy will be defined with the assistance of site caterers who are likely to have the greatest impact on waste generation. However, where it is practical to do so, NMEC's catering strategy will encourage use of re-usable cutlery and crockery. Where this is not possible caterers will aim to use cutlery and crockery made from recycled or recyclable materials.

<P>

<a name="90201w12.html_para3">At official level, the arrangements for parliamentary accountability for expenditure on the dome mirror those which apply to all non-departmental public bodies.

<P>

<a name="90201w13.html_para13">There are already a number of useful guides for people with disabilities, some of which are published by Government Departments.

 The Government value the social, economic and environmental benefits that inland waterways can bring and are keen to maximise the full potential of the canal network.

<a name="90201w15.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 A serious incident occurred at Bow Junction in East London on 8 October 1994 and was mentioned in paragraph 233 of the Chief Inspecting Officer of Railways' Annual Report on Railway Safety for 1994-96. The cause of a failure of the signalling system was a series of failures in the design, commissioning and testing of intermediate stages of signalling works because of poor communications and lack of project management staff. The project was restarted only after all management and safety procedures had been examined, critically reviewed and rewritten or strengthened as necessary. In February/March 1995, HSE's Railway Inspectorate carried out a thorough audit of these new procedures. The audit team of four, led by a Principal Railway Inspector and including inspectors with railway signalling background, communicated their findings to Railtrack on 1 March 1995. The project has been continually monitored until its substantial completion last year.

<a name="90201w15.html_para2">The comparison which they provide is, however, misleading. This is because they do not reflect the Comprehensive Spending Review's full provision for personal social services, which started from a zero base, looking at expenditure needs afresh. The only fair comparison is to look at total resources provided for social services which, in aggregate, show a 6.1 per cent. cash increase or a 3.5 per cent. real terms increase between 1998-99 and 1999-2000. The increased resources we are making available will meet the costs of looking after existing and new community care clients, and enable local authorities to deliver real improvements in services.

 There are no specific tax incentives available for manufacturers of motor vehicles powered by road fuel gases.

Duty on road fuel gases has been frozen for the last two Budgets, and the Government are committed to at least maintaining the 1997 duty differential between road fuel gases and ordinary diesel. My Department is also funding the Powershift programme which provides grants to help cover the additional cost of purchasing gas powered vehicles.

<a name="90201w16.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Meale: </B> 
 When the previous Government published their White Paper "Making Waste Work" in 1995, they set a number of indicative targets for waste. One of the primary targets was to increase recycling and recovery so that they dealt with 40 per cent. of municipal waste by 2005. There was also a subsidiary target to recycle or compost 25 per cent. of household waste by 2000. These indicative targets were set for the whole of England and Wales and it is up to each individual local authority to determine their own priorities in the light of these targets.
<P>

<a name="90201w16.html_para2">The latest figures for municipal waste relate to 1996-97--the first year after publication of "Making Waste Work". Recycling and energy recovery of municipal waste stood at around 13 per cent., with recycling running at around 7 per cent. of household waste. No comparable figures are available for five years ago.
<P>

<a name="90201w16.html_para3">The Department is not able to release details of the recycling rate of an individual authority, or for individual materials within this rate, because the figures that are supplied to it for the Department's Municipal Waste Survey are done so on a confidential basis.
<P>

<a name="90201w16.html_para4">The Government are currently preparing a new waste strategy. The consultation paper "Less Waste: More Value" confirmed their support for the targets in "Making Waste Work", but considers that there is a need for a substantial increase in recycling and recovery, going beyond the targets set by the previous Government.
<P>

<a name="90201w16.html_para5">We believe that, for targets to be effective in changing behaviour towards a desired end, they have to be challenging but achievable, underpinned by a clear course of action, and capable of proper measurement and public explanation. Targets also need to be justified against the principles of good regulation: accountability, transparency, targeting, consistency, and proportionality.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what are the current official guidelines on the building of public waste incinerators near densely populated areas.  [68136]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90201w17.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The building of public waste incinerators will normally require the grant of planning permission under the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended) and an authorisation under the Environmental Protection Act 1990. Government guidance on the location of incinerators is included in Planning Policy Guidance note 23 "Planning and Pollution Control". This will be updated soon when Planning Policy Guidance note 10 "Planning and Waste Management" is published. The Department also issued a guidance note to local authorities in August 1997, on the provision of incinerators in connection with the slaughter of cattle under the "Over Thirty Months Scheme".

The title of city is an honour conferred by Her Majesty The Queen, by Letters Patent; it is not a right which can be claimed by the fulfilment of specific conditions.

<P>
<a name="90201w17.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The Government have welcomed London Transport's phased opening strategy of the Jubilee Line Extension project and their confirmation that it will open in good time for the Millennium Experience. It would, however, be irresponsible not to have in place contingency arrangements to manage problems on any of the main transport links to the Millennium site over the Millennium Year, including any failure of the Jubilee Line. I therefore asked London Underground Ltd., through my Millennium Access Co-ordination Group, to lead the production of contingency plans for this and other eventualities.
<P>

<a name="90201w17.html_para4">London Underground have, in association with London's other transport operators, developed plans to cover a wide-range of possible scenarios and identified an underlying command and control strategy to direct the plans should they need to be invoked.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90201w17.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Gareth R. Thomas: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions when he will announce the outcome of consultation on the local government finance settlement for 1999-2000; and if he will make a statement.  [68858]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90201w17.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Prescott: </B> 
 I have today laid before the House the Local Government Finance Report (England) 1999-2000 and the Special Grant Report (No. 37). These reports establish the amounts of revenue support grant (RSG) and non-domestic rates (NDR) to be paid to local authorities in 1999-2000, and the basis of their distribution; and provide for Standard Spending Assessment (SSA) Reduction Grant and Central Support Protection Grant to be paid to certain authorities for 1999-2000. Drafts of these reports were issued for consultation on 2 December 1998. The Department received written representations from the Local Government Association and the Association of London Government, as well as from 215 individual local authorities and six local authority groups. My Ministerial colleagues at DETR also met the Associations, 72 delegations from local councils and four from local authority groups.
<P>

<a name="90201w17.html_para6">My proposals included changes to grant distribution to give a fairer system. Having considered the views of the local authority associations and others who have commented on my initial proposals, I have decided to make only the changes in the SSA methodology which formed the basis of consultation, and no others. The SSAs for individual authorities may be slightly different from those at consultation, generally reflecting more accurate data that have become available since then.
<P>

<a name="90201w17.html_para7">However, changes in the method of distribution mean that some authorities do much less well than others. The change to the formula for children's social services, in particular, has had a serious impact on some authorities. Following representations, I have concluded that I should make some changes to my proposals for a Central Support Protection Grant. This will ensure that authorities with education responsibilities can continue to provide services while they adjust their spending plans. I shall therefore provide an extra &#163;30 million in Central Support Protection Grant to ensure that all authorities with education and social services responsibilities receive at least 1.5 per cent. more grant in 1999-2000 than they did in 1998-99. I can also confirm that no local authority will receive less grant in 1999-2000 than they did in 1998-99.
<P>

<a name="90201w17.html_para8">I also received representations from local government on council tax benefit subsidy limitation. I have considered these carefully but decided to make no change to the scheme I proposed on 2 December.
<P>

<a name="90201w17.html_para9">This year's local government finance settlement is the most generous since the introduction of the council tax. We have made grant distribution fairer. No authority will lose grant next year. Many will benefit from substantially increased resources, reflecting a 5.5 per cent. overall increase in funding.




<P>
<P><I>1 Feb 1999 : Column: 475</I><P>

<P>

<a name="90201w17.html_para10">For the longer term, we have published SSA totals for the next three years, and do not expect to make further changes in the method of distribution. Authorities therefore have a firm basis for planning long term, sustained service improvements.
<P>

<a name="90201w17.html_para11">There is no excuse on the basis of this settlement for councils to inflict steep council tax rises on their local communities. Our increased funding for local government is generous, but affordable. We look to councils to strike the same balance.
<P>

<a name="90201w17.html_para12">Last year we produced, for the first time, a Plain English guide to local government finance. This was widely welcomed, and I have arranged for an updated edition to be produced.
<P>

<a name="90201w17.html_para13">I shall be sending copies of these reports and the Plain English guide to all authorities, together with tables showing each authority's Standard Spending Assessment and its entitlement to RSG, NDR and special grant. Copies of the reports, tables, and the guide are available in the Vote Office and the Library.

 In the 1997-98 session, the House of Commons considered 1,685 amendments made by the House of Lords to bills originating in this House. This House agreed to 1,615 of these amendments (four with amendments of its own) and disagreed to 70. To give precise statistics as to how many of each were Government amendments would incur a disproportionate cost. However, the House of Lords Public Bill Sessional Statistics for Session 1997-98 is a document which is in the public domain. This contains information concerning Government defeats in the House of Lords, stating in each case whether these were subsequently reversed by the House of Commons.

To ask the Minister of State, Lord Chancellor's Department how many <i>(a)</i> informal and <i>(b)</i> formal complaints have been made to his Department about the activities and attitudes of immigration appeal adjudicators by other adjudicators in each of the last five years; how many were from <i>(a)</i> women and <i>(b)</i> people from ethnic minorities; and what was the outcome of each complaint.  [68486]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90201w18.html_spnew14"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 No such complaints are recorded as having been made to the Lord Chancellor's Department between 1994 and 1996.
<P>

<a name="90201w18.html_para4">In 1997 there were three informal complaints. Two of them were from a female member of a minority ethnic community. One of these complaints was resolved by agreement between the parties and the other was superseded by further discussions and correspondence. The third complaint was discussed with the individual concerned and no further action taken.
<P>

<a name="90201w18.html_para5">In 1998 there were four informal and two formal complaints, all from a female member of a minority ethnic community. The complainant requested that the matters of substance raised in the informal and one of the formal complaints should be recorded but did not seek further action. The Lord Chancellor determined in relation to the other formal complaint that the adjudicator concerned should have made more careful enquiries in handling of complaint from solicitors and not have referred to the "promulgation" of a determination.

 Following an announcement in Parliament on 18 December 1996, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>752</i>, that the then Government intended to review Asylum and Immigration Appeals, the Regional Immigration Adjudicators asked one of their number, Dr. H. H. Storey, to prepare a paper which could be submitted to the Lord Chancellor's Department, setting out the Authority's response to that Review. Dr. Storey prepared the paper and it was submitted to the Lord Chancellor's Department in May 1997. From that date Dr. Storey has, with the endorsement of the present and previous Chief Adjudicator, continued to work on research projects for the Authority, in addition to his normal duties. Dr. Storey was originally chosen because the Regional Adjudicators considered him to be the person best qualified for the position. He is a former University Lecturer and an expert on European and Human Rights law.

<a name="90201w18.html_spnew16"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 A European Panel was established in 1997 by the Chief Immigration Adjudicator as a result of specific concerns expressed by practitioners that it occasionally happened that cases with complex European issues were listed before relatively inexperienced Adjudicators. The intention was to create a core of Adjudicators who could be trained in European law, and that this core be widened as quickly as possible. The first group of Adjudicators were nominated by Regional Adjudicators. All full-time Adjudicators in post as at November 1998 have now been trained and are on the Panel.

To ask the Minister of State, Lord Chancellor's Department if it is mandatory for the Chief Adjudicator of the Immigration Appeal Authority to report the nature and number of complaints of race or gender prejudice or discrimination by members of the authority about other members to his Department.  [68483]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90201w18.html_spnew17"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The Chief Immigration Adjudicator is responsible, in liaison with the Lord Chancellor, his officials and the Court Service, for the efficient operation of the Adjudicators' system. The Lord Chancellor would expect the Chief Immigration Adjudicator, and all other Tribunal Presidents or Tribunal Heads, to inform him of any complaint against a member of the judiciary, whether it is from a member of the public or a fellow member of the judiciary.

Our enhanced student support arrangements for FE and HE will also promote access to learning; and the introduction of Individual Learning Accounts will give people the flexibility to decide what, how and when to learn, and empower them to take greater control of their own career and personal development needs.

<a name="90201w20.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 Schools and local education authorities are under a duty to identify children with special educational needs, including those with autistic spectrum disorders, and to arrange provision which meets the needs of individual children. Statements of special educational need set out the range of difficulties and the special provision to be made for the education of children with the most severe and complex needs, including a proportion of the children whose needs arise from autistic spectrum disorders. When arranging provision, after consultation with parents, local education authorities are able to place children with autism in mainstream schools, SEN units in mainstream schools, special schools or specialist autism schools, either in the maintained, voluntary or independent sectors. The Department is funding five regional pilots which will be looking at arrangements for the co-ordination of SEN provision and services. It is expected that some of the projects will focus on provision for pupils with autism. The Department aims to extend regional co-operation arrangements to all areas from April 2000.
<P>

<a name="90201w20.html_para0">Under the Education (School Information) (England) Regulations 1998 local education authorities are required to publish annually information about the arrangements they make for children with special educational needs, including those with autistic spectrum disorders. 



<P>
<P><I>1 Feb 1999 : Column: 485</I><P>
Authorities may, if they wish, publish specific guidance on the arrangements they make for children with autistic spectrum disorders. Any such guidance must be consistent with authorities' duties under the law and have regard to the SEN <i>Code of Practice</i>.

<P>
<P><I>1 Feb 1999 : Column: 488</I><P>

<P>

<a name="90201w21.html_para0">In the Comprehensive Spending Review, the Government made it clear that public sector pay settlements would need to be fair, affordable, and consistent with the targets for public service improvements we have set. That is why new arrangements were announced in the CSR for the Pay Review Bodies, designed to ensure a closer and more effective link between pay settlements and departmental expenditure limits and service delivery targets. As part of these arrangements, the Prime Minister asked the School Teachers' Review Body to ensure that, in making its recommendations, four key considerations set out in the CSR were taken into account:
<P>

<a name="90201w21.html_para1"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>recruitment, retention and motivation of the groups concerned
<P>
<BR>
the requirements on Departments to meet their output targets for the delivery of services
<P>
<BR>
requirements on departments to stay within their three year expenditure limits, and
<P>
<BR>
the Government's inflation target, requiring responsibility in pay settlements across the public and private sectors.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="90201w21.html_para2">I am satisfied that the recommendations meet these considerations. Accordingly I have decided to accept the Review Body's main recommendations to restructure the pay of headteachers from September, at a cost of 0.1% of the total teacher paybill in 1999-2000 and 0.2% in a full year, and to award a general increase of 3.5% to the pay of all teachers from 1 April. The full cost of the settlement in 1999-2000 will be 3.6%. This will be affordable within my Department's Expenditure Limits announced in the CSR in July (Cm 4011), and is fully consistent with the targets for improved services set out in my Department's Public Service Agreement published in December (Cm 4181). It is in line with the Government's prudent and disciplined approach to public spending and its commitment to deliver high quality public services and low inflation.

<a name="90201w21.html_para3">The restructuring of headteachers' pay is necessary to enable schools, especially small primary schools, to recruit, retain and motivate headteachers of the quality that we need to improve standards of education. It recognises the role headteachers will play in making the proposals in the Green Paper "Teachers: Meeting the Challenge of Change" work, and it recognises the responsibility headteachers have always had for managing and improving the performance of their teachers and schools. The Review Body makes it clear that headteachers' pay should be linked to their performance against agreed targets, with no automatic increases. It recommends improvements in the performance management and review mechanism for headteachers and I propose those improvements, subject to consultation, with effect from September 1999.
<P>

<a name="90201w21.html_para4">I am grateful to the Review Body for recommending a general increase at a level which is fair and which I can implement without staging. I hope teachers will welcome the fact that they will receive their pay increase in full on 1 April this year.

<a name="90201w22.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 In order to pass the new performance threshold proposed in the Green Paper "Teachers: Meeting the Challenge of Change" (Cm 4164), teachers would have to demonstrate that they had consistently achieved national standards centred on strong classroom performance. The number of teachers transferring to the upper salary spine will depend on the outcomes of individual assessments against these national standards. The Government expect that, over time, a majority of teachers will be of a standard to pass the threshold if they wish to do so.

In it we confirm that unattached teachers and supply teachers employed by the local education authority will be able to apply for threshold assessment provided that they have reached spine point 9 for qualifications and experience and if they can demonstrate that they meet the national threshold standards. Normally, their applications would be assessed by the relevant head, teacher in charge or senior manager with appropriate line management responsibility, and validated by an external assessor. In exceptional circumstances, the teacher may need to apply direct to the external assessor through the local education authority.

 The Green Paper "Teachers: Meeting the Challenge of Change" proposes that teachers successful at the new performance threshold could receive a salary increase of up to 10 per cent. It would be for governing bodies to decide, on the advice of the head, where on the upper pay spine to place teachers who had passed the threshold assessment, assigned on a combination of excellent performance and extra responsibility. This decision will determine the exact salary level for each teacher.
<P>

<a name="90201w22.html_para0">As estimated 220,000 full-time equivalent teachers in England will have reached spine point nine for qualifications and experience by September 1999 and will therefore be eligible to apply for assessment at the performance threshold to the new upper pay spine.

There would therefore seem to be no reason why local education authorities should wish to include provision for such costs in their Individual Schools Budgets. The Financing of Maintained Schools Regulations 1999 permit the central retention by LEAs of funds to meet redundancy costs which are not properly chargeable to individual schools.

<a name="90201w23.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Fatchett: </B> 
 The Chevening scholarship programme is our main scholarship scheme overseas. It is co-funded by the FCO and DfID. It has a well developed procedure for selection of students, and for maintaining contact when they return home. Chevening Scholars benefit from studying at Higher Education Institutions in the UK, experience the British way of life, make valuable contacts with British counterparts, and return home with a better understanding of the UK and of British values. On return home they make an important contribution to the life of their own countries.

There are now some seven Public Gas Transporters (PGTs). A consumer seeking a gas connection can either seek a connection from a PGT; purchase and lay the pipe himself, or his PGT can use the system of supplemental charges whereby the cost of the connection is recovered over a protracted period of time through an additional charge on each unit of gas used. I understand that a number of PGTs continue to be granted geographical extensions to their licences and that a growing number of premises is being connected to the main gas system.

 Providing a local call service is not cost-free. Where free local calls are offered, this is usually tied to higher monthly standing charges. BT are free to package their tariffs as they wish as long as their overall prices fall within the price cap set by OFTEL. Other operators are not subject to this price cap. However, BT are not able to price their services below cost as this would be anti-competitive. Average UK business and consumer telecommunications prices as a whole (combining standing charges and call charges on various tariffs) are below US, EU or OECD averages.

 We are close to agreeing with the plaintiffs' solicitors the arrangements for dealing with the 65,000 claims received to date and the further 35,000 claims expected. We are currently tendering for a national spirometry testing programme which we aim to start by the end of March. This should ensure that interim payments and, in some cases, full and final settlements, can begin to be offered to miners who are most severely disabled in the Spring. We hope that full examinations under the agreed Medical Assessment Process will commence in early Summer.

 "The New NHS Modern and Dependable: A National Framework for Assessing Performance" was published for consultation in January 1998 to signal our commitment to a broader based approach to assessing National Health Service performance. It included an initial set of high level performance indicators, which included two composite indicators in the "Effective Delivery of Appropriate Healthcare" area relevant to neurological services. The first was a chronic care management indicator including age and sex standardised admission rates for epilepsy. The second was a discharge from hospital indicator which included the rate of discharge home within 56 days of emergency admission from home with a stroke. Following consultation, the revised NHS performance assessment framework will be published shortly, together with a revised set of initial high level performance indicators. The high level performance indicators will continue to develop over time to ensure they focus on the outcomes that matter most to patients and the public.

<a name="90201w30.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The Centre for Policy on Ageing submitted their report on national standards for older people in residential care only very recently. We intend to publish the proposed standards for consultation shortly. Following consultation, we will consider the cost implications of introducing the standards prior to taking any decision about their implementation.

 Uniforms are provided free of charge to nursing students. They are provided either by the local National Health Service trust or by the higher education institution; in the latter case, the costs are met through NHS contracts. A case came to our attention last week where a university was seeking to charge for nurses' uniforms, in a way not sanctioned by their contract. As soon as we heard about the proposal we asked officials to investigate and the university concerned has now withdrawn its proposal. NHS education commissioners have been reminded of the policy in this area.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90201w30.html_wqn12"><B> Dr. Iddon: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will make a statement on the reports and recommendations of the Health Pay Review bodies.  [68859]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90201w30.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Dobson: </B> 
 I am responding on behalf of my right hon. Friends the Prime Minister, the Secretary of State for Wales and the Secretary of State for Scotland to the reports of the Review Body on Doctors' and Dentists' Remuneration (DDRB) and the Review Body on Nursing Staff, Midwives, Health Visitors and Professions Allied to Medicine (NPRB), which have been published today. Copies are available in the Vote Office and the Library. I am grateful to the chairmen and members of these Review Bodies for their hard work.
<P>

<a name="90201w30.html_para4">Nurses are to get their biggest real terms increase for 10 years, and for the first time in 5 years the award is being paid nationally in full with no staging. The NPRB have recommended an across the board increase of 4.7 per cent. for nurses, midwives and health visitors. Around 70,000 D grade staff nurses will receive 8.2 per cent.-8.4 per cent., worth an extra &#163;1,100-&#163;1,200 a year. In addition, minimum starting pay for newly qualified nurses will rise to &#163;14,400, an increase of 12 per cent. In inner London starting pay for a newly qualified nurse will be at least &#163;17,325 including London Allowance. The guaranteed London Allowance affecting 50,000 nurses will increase by 15.4 per cent. On top of these pay increases, almost half of all nurses will receive pay increments worth at least a further 3.4 per cent. With these increases, more than two thirds of qualified nurses will earn &#163;20,000 or more per year.
<P>

<a name="90201w30.html_para5">The NPRB have also recommended an across the board increase of 4.7 per cent. for physiotherapists, radiographers and other professions allied to medicine (PAMs). Starting pay for basic grade PAMs with a degree after four years' training will increase on 1 April from &#163;14,180 to &#163;15,405, a rise of 8.6 per cent., with similar rises for other basic grade PAMs. The maximum of scale for highly skilled Senior 1 grade PAMs will increase from &#163;21,485 to &#163;23,130 from 1 April, a rise of 7.7 per cent.
<P>

<a name="90201w30.html_para6">The Government have decided to accept all the NPRB pay recommendations for 1999-2000, with no staging. The headline settlement of 4.7 per cent. for nurses and other NPRB staff groups is significantly higher than for any of the other Review Body groups announced today, and more than we would expect for pay settlements in the public sector generally or elsewhere in the National Health Service. However, this is justified by the exceptional problems of nurse recruitment and retention which result from the failure of the last Government to put in place an adequate training and pay system for the 



<P>
<P><I>1 Feb 1999 : Column: 525</I><P>
profession. We are pleased that the NPRB have recommended an exceptional increase for an exceptional problem.
<P>

<a name="90201w30.html_para7">The Doctors' and Dentists' Review Body (DDRB) has recommended a general pay increase of 3.5 per cent. for salaried doctors and dentists and for the pay element of fees for general medical practitioners. General practitioners will also receive the &#163;60 million additional income recommended by DDRB last year for payment from 1999-2000. General dental practitioners' fees will also increase by 3.5 per cent. once the 0.9 per cent. addition to the feescale, awarded in 1998-99 only, has been removed. The DDRB has also recommended an additional &#163;500 per year on the consultant scale maximum. The Government have accepted these recommendations for the coming year in full, with no staging.
<P>

<a name="90201w30.html_para8">The DDRB also recommended an extra &#163;50 million a year from 2000-2001 to reward individual consultants for increases in workload and intensity of work. Our negotiations with the profession on a new consultant contract are covering these issues. We will consider this recommendation very carefully in the context of the negotiations, and are willing to make an investment in rewards and incentives if the negotiations deliver a better service for patients. We will, therefore, decide on the level of any extra funding for future years, and how such funding might be allocated, when the negotiations are complete.
<P>

<a name="90201w30.html_para9">Health authorities and NHS trusts can now use these opportunities to support a modern approach to recruiting, retaining and motivating key staff. I can announce today we are backing this with an allocation from the Modernisation Fund of &#163;100m already earmarked for staff, which will go to all health authorities in England. This is in addition to the 6.5 per cent. increase in allocations to health authorities; and it will not affect the sums already announced within the Modernisation Fund for waiting lists, capital, mental health, primary care and information technology which already come to almost &#163;1 billion for the coming year. The pay increases are therefore affordable both nationally and locally.
<P>

<a name="90201w30.html_para10">This extra funding will help us get the nurses and other staff in place to take forward effectively the Government's programme for modernising the NHS. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Scotland will be releasing an additional &#163;20m to Health Boards from his Modernisation Programme. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Wales is making &#163;6m available as a contribution to modernising the service including recruitment and retention initiatives.




<P>
<P><I>1 Feb 1999 : Column: 526</I><P>

<P>

<a name="90201w30.html_para11">In its evidence to the Nursing Pay Review Body, the Department drew attention to recruitment and retention concerns and asked for changes to address this by starting to modernise the nursing pay scales. The Review Body has responded by improving starting pay for nurses, as well as continuing the discretionary points for staff at the top of pay scales.
<P>

<a name="90201w30.html_para12">We are supporting local recruitment plans with a high-profile, recruitment campaign for nurses which starts tonight on television. The aim is to attract more people into nursing and encourage qualified nurses and midwives to come back to work in the NHS. The focus of the campaign is on the value and rewards of a career in nursing and is intended to help recruit the extra nurses and midwives the NHS needs. The TV campaign will run for a month, backed by activity through to March in the national and regional press, in magazines and on radio.
<P>

<a name="90201w30.html_para13">These settlements are fair and are being paid in full. They provide a platform for us to move forward on pay modernisation. We will publish detailed proposals for modernising the NHS pay system shortly. The kind of pay system needed in a modern NHS will:
<P>

<a name="90201w30.html_para14"><P>

<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>simplify and modernise conditions of service, with national core conditions and appropriate local flexibility.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="90201w30.html_para18">These changes are crucial to the modernisation of the NHS. They respond directly to concerns expressed by the Review Bodies, and are the only realistic way to satisfy nurses' aspirations for fewer pay ceilings and better reward for the job done. They provide the essential background for future investment in pay and staff development.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90201w32.html_spmin1"><B>The Attorney-General</B> 
 <i>[holding answer 20 January 1999]:</i> Councillor Frank MacGrath was the subject of three separate sets of criminal proceedings which arose out of an investigation by the Lancashire Constabulary known as Operation Angel involving allegations of fraud and corruption. Expenditure identified by the CPS as attributable to this series of cases comprises Counsel's fees &#163;250,134 and payments in relation to witness expenses of &#163;2,496. However, the complexity and inter-relationship of these cases make it impossible to attribute specific expenditure to Councillor MacGrath. The CPS staff working on the case did so as part of their ordinary department duties and their salary and associated cost cannot be separately apportioned.
<P>

<a name="90201w32.html_para5">I understand from the Lord Chancellor's Department that information about the passage of the case through the magistrates court is held only in manual records and therefore is not readily available. It could be obtained only at disproportionate cost.
<P>

<a name="90201w32.html_para6">I am further informed by the Lord Chancellor's Department that, according to information readily available, Frank MacGrath was granted legal aid in the Crown Court and the total amount paid to defence lawyers was &#163;120,936.46. In addition, there were payments amounting to &#163;47,153.88 from Central funds. Just over 71 hours were spent in Crown Court hearings and this cost an estimated &#163;21,200.

 The Department has not commissioned any research in this area. However, the Department regularly reviews new information on food chemical safety and, when appropriate, seeks advice from its expert advisory committees. In 1992 the Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment (COT) completed a thorough review of the toxicity of aspartame and reaffirmed its earlier advice that aspartame was safe to use. The COT also considered reports linking aspartame with a variety of adverse effects such as headache, seizures and behavioural difficulties in children. There was insufficient evidence to support such claims. Aspartame has also been given safety clearance

by the European Commission's Scientific Committee for Food. A study published in 1996 which suggested a link between aspartame and brain cancer was rejected by the Committee on Carcinogenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment.

 Setting up the FSA is expected to involve additional one-off costs of around &#163;12 million per annum over three years and additional ongoing costs of about &#163;29 million per annum, taking account of the collection costs associated with the proposed levy. In addition, current food safety and standards functions, and their associated expenditure, will transfer to the Food Standards Agency from MAFF, DH, and the devolved administrations.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food how many slaughterhouse premises have closed in the last 12 months; and what effect this has had on reducing journey times of livestock to slaughter within the UK.  [67872]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90201w32.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 During 1998, 28 slaughterhouse licences (red meat and poultry meat) were revoked because they had ceased operating. The effect on journey times will vary according to the location of the farm of origin and the nearest slaughterhouse. Whilst we would prefer animals to be slaughtered close to the farm, this may not occur for a variety of reasons. Legislation lays down clear rules to protect the welfare of animals during transport, and there is no reason why animals should not be transported safely and humanely.

 None. However, the House of Lords Science and Technology Committee, in its report of 17 March 1998 "Resistance to Antibiotics and other Antimicrobial Agents", recommended extreme economy of use of fluoroquinolones in veterinary practice (recommendation 11.21). The report also recommended the development of a Code of Practice on when such compounds should be prescribed. The Government accept this recommendation and their response to the report is available in the Library of the House.

 Genetically modified crops will not be grown until they have passed all the relevant statutory procedures. Once they have done so, it will be for the market to determine whether they provide nutritional or other benefits over alternative varieties.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food if he will assess the capability of the length of time for which <i>(a)</i> agricultural, <i>(b)</i> agroforestry and <i>(c)</i> horticultural research projects are funded by his Department with the biological systems which they are designed to assess; and if he will assess the benefits of more long term research funding in respect of the longer rotations in organic systems.  [67661]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90201w32.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 Research is funded for an appropriate length of time bearing in mind the particular biological and agricultural systems being investigated. However, in many cases it is not appropriate to let an individual contract which covers the whole period of the research. Instead, the research is funded by a number of consecutive contracts. This assists the management of the research and allows changes of priorities and redirection during the course of the work. This holds for all of the Ministry's agricultural research including that on organic systems.

 A list of the individuals and organisations who responded to my Department's consultation on a set of indicators for sustainable agriculture follows. Copies of the responses are available in the MAAF Main Library. These indicators are intended to complement the wider set of indicators on sustainable development for the UK which is being developed by the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions. The aim is to publish the agriculture indicators as a pilot set later this year, and to develop them further over the next three to five years.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food by what date the UK will be in full compliance with EU rules on meat inspection.  [68128]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90201w33.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 Full compliance with EU rules on veterinary supervision in licensed meat plants in Great Britain is not possible in the short term, essentially because of a shortage of veterinarians willing to undertake meat hygiene work in the UK. It is not known how long it will take to achieve full compliance, as this will depend on the Meat Hygiene Service's ability to secure the services of additional Official Veterinary Surgeons, and on future changes in the size and structure of the meat industry. Therefore, it may be some years before the levels and frequency of veterinary supervision required by the EU meat hygiene Directives are achieved in all GB licensed meat plants.

 None; but I welcome the initiatives taken by many retailers to introduce voluntary labelling schemes giving consumers more information about rearing standards. My right hon. Friend the Minister has received assurances from the major supermarkets that all their own label fresh pork, bacon, ham, sausages and pork pies will come from stall and tether and meat and bone meal free production systems; also, they will not label as British processed products produced from imported fresh port.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food if he will estimate the annual tonnage of pork meat products entering the UK; and what estimate he has of the percentage of this imported meat which is produced from animals that would not meet UK <i>(a)</i> welfare, <i>(b)</i> veterinary and <i>(c)</i> feed regulation standards.  [68142]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90201w33.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 In the five years 1994-98, the UK imported around 160,000 tonnes of pork on average every year from other EU member states (imports from third countries are minimal). All would have met EU welfare, veterinary and feed requirements. Since March 1996, the UK has not permitted mammalian meat and bone meal to be fed to farm animals, a ban which is not in place in all member states. Also, since 1 January 1999, the UK has had a ban on housing pigs in close confinement stall and tether systems; although it is impossible to say what proportion of imported pork has not met these production standards since their introduction, it is likely to be very small.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90201w33.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 Single Market Legislation and European Court of Justice Rulings protect the free circulation of goods in the EU. In areas where there is a common market, such as pigmeat, if products conform to EU requirements, individual member states cannot introduce a unilateral ban. In respect of third country trade, the World Trade Organisation Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures gives WTO members the right to take measures necessary for the protection of human, animal or plant life or health, provided that these are based on scientific principles and are not maintained without sufficient scientific evidence.
