Notes:<br>

1. The data source is an un-validated scan of the pension service computer system at 4 June 2005. Not all households in Northern Ireland containing a person aged-75 or over will appear on the scan, since not all pensioners are entitled to the retirement pension.<br>

2. In producing this analysis, individual records were attributed to parliamentary constituencies (PC&#039;s) on the basis of their postcode. Not all records can be correctly allocated to a PC using this method, and some cannot be allocated at all.<br>

The recommendations of the Committee of Ministers, based on the findings of the Committee of Experts which evaluated the UK&#039;s compliance with the charter, were that the authorities of the United Kingdom facilitate the establishment of a television channel or an equivalent television service in Scottish Gaelic and overcome the shortcomings in Scottish Gaelic radio broadcasting.

<a name="stpa_2">Since the charter came into force on 1 July 2001, the Government have brought forward provisions, enacted in the Communications Act 2003, changing the status of the Gaelic broadcasting funding body, now called the Gaelic Media Service (CMS), to allow it for the first time to hold a broadcasting licence. My right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State, has also committed herself to seeking a better deal for Gaelic broadcasting and my Department have been working with all the interested parties to put together a sustainable strategy for Gaelic television. We have also confirmed, in the Green Paper on BBC Charter Review of March 2005, that the BBC will have a key role to play in any future channel. Furthermore, although funding responsibility were devolved to the Scottish Executive as part of the devolution settlement in 1999, my right hon. Friend has offered a one-off contribution of &#163;250,000 from DCMS budgets as part of arrangements for establishing a Gaelic channel.

We have received correspondence on this issue from a number of individuals including veterinary surgeons.

Consultees were allowed four months, until 5 May, to comment. Over 300 responses have been received and the comments, including those relating to the record-keeping provisions and their perceived impact on small animal veterinarians, are currently being considered and will be taken into account in finalising the draft Regulations. The VMD has kept interested parties informed of developments on key issues by publishing a series of reaction notes and has held public meetings on 21 and 22 June to discuss the outcome of the formal consultation. A further meeting with the British Small Animal Veterinary Association has been arranged for 29 June. VMD officials have also been in touch with officials in other member states to ascertain their approach to the implementation of these provisions.

 All companies should operate within the laws of the country in which they are operating. UK companies operating in developing countries should be accountable to the Government and citizens of those countries. DFID recognises that, in many developing countries, the systems for monitoring and regulating business activity are weak. Our priority is to support countries&#039; efforts to develop an appropriate legal framework, including protection of the environment and community rights, and to strengthen their capacity to enforce these laws. An example is the pathways to environmental action in Kenya where DFID supports work with local regulatory authorities and the private sector to find the best means of meeting environmental standards.

 Company law provides a flexible framework which can be used by both commercial companies and companies formed for an altruistic purpose. We will be codifying directors&#039; general duties in our proposed Company Law Reform Bill. In the case of a commercial company, directors have a duty to promote the success of the company for the benefit of its members. This means that the directors should put commercial considerations first, but, in doing so, they should foster effective relationships with employees, customers and suppliers, and in the community more widely. They need to pay regard to the long run as well as the short term consequences of their actions. We believe that this approach can both drive long-term company performance and maximise overall competitiveness and ensure that directors pay regard to the company&#039;s impact on the community and the environment.

 It is not known how many full driving licence holders have never taken a driving test. The Road Traffic Act 1934 provided that all new applicants would have to undertake a test of competence to drive. The Act provided an exemption from the need to take a driving test for those drivers who had held a provisional licence prior to 1 April 1934. In addition between 18 February 1947 and 17 February 1948 provisional licences obtained during the second world war were converted to full licences without the requirement to sit a driving test. Records kept at this time did not distinguish between full licence holders who obtained full entitlement as a consequence of passing a test and those who relied on the exemptions contained in the appropriate Acts.

 The rolling stock formations now in use on the Fenchurch street to Shoeburyness rail line are sufficient to accommodate demand within the limits prescribed to control overcrowding. Constraints that would place a limit on increased passenger capacity include the number of trains available; the fact that platforms on the Tilbury loop section of the c2c network cannot accommodate trains longer than 8 cars; and signalling headways and therefore the number of trains that can stop in the West Ham area.

The constituency level breakdown refers to the constituencies that existed during the periods that the awards were in payment, but do not yet reflect constituency changes that occurred at the last general election. HMRC is currently producing new estimates based on the new constituency boundaries and hope to include them in the above publications very shortly.

A three wave model of intervention has been developed, designed to identify and support those children experiencing difficulty in literacy and/or mathematics, a good many of whom are likely to fall somewhere on the dyslexia spectrum. We have also produced guidance material on classroom strategies to enable dyslexic pupils to access learning and have recently released a new interactive CD-ROM based in-service training resource, Learning and

 Dyslexia is extremely difficult to identify in very young children until they begin to develop their literacy skills, and therefore signs of language delay is a more appropriate indicator term in early years. Early signs of dyslexia could include difficulties with speech and language, particularly with rhyming. All early education settings, in receipt of Government funding, must have regard to the Special Educational Needs (SEN) Code of Practice, published in November 2001. This gives practical advice to those settings in carrying out their statutory duties to identify, assess and make suitable provision for children with SEN, including those with specific learning difficulties such as delayed language development.

<a name="stpa_81">The Curriculum Guidance for the Foundation Stage, for children aged 3&#150;5 years, of the National Curriculum makes clear that monitoring of each child&#039;s progress is essential and that any particular difficulties in any areas of learning are identified and addressed. This should form part of the statutory Foundation Stage Profile, and the reception teacher&#039;s on-going observational assessment of individual children to record their achievements in working towards their Early Learning Goals. These set out expectations as to what most children should achieve by the end of the Foundation Stage.

 It is difficult to estimate the costs of maintenance support for EU students who may become eligible for support as a result of the regulation changes in the light of the ECJ ruling. As explained in the answer to PQ3979 there is uncertainty around forecasting numbers of students and we have limited information on the income distribution of EU students in order to estimate their entitlement to elements of the student support package. Based on that limited data we estimate that the additional cost of providing maintenance support for EU students that may become eligible for support as a result of the change in regulations would be around &#163;10 million <sup>1</sup> in resource terms in financial year 2006&#150;07 <sup>2</sup> .

<sup>(37)</sup>School based expenditure includes only expenditure incurred directly by the schools. This includes the pay of teachers and school-based support staff, school premises costs, books and equipment, and certain other supplies and services, less any capital items funded from recurrent spending and income from sales, fees, charges, rents and rates. This excludes the central cost of support services such as home to school transport, local authority administration and the financing of capital expenditure.<br>

<sup>(38)</sup>Pupil numbers include only those pupils attending LEA maintained schools and are drawn from the DfES Annual Schools Census adjusted to be on a financial year basis.<br>

<sup>(39)</sup>1999&#150;2000 saw a change in data source when the data collection moved from the RO1 form collected by the ODPM to the section 52 form from the DfES. 2003&#150;04 is the latest year for which figures are available.<br>

<sup>(40)</sup>The main difference between 1985&#150;86 and 2003&#150;04 is that meals and milk are no longer excluded and that no adjustments for balances are now made. However, 1985&#150;86 also includes all premature retirement compensation (PRC) and Crombie payments, mandatory payments and other indirect employee expenses, while in 2003&#150;04 only the schools element of these categories is included. Also, for some LEAs, expenditure that had previously been attributed to the school sectors was reported within the LEA part of the section 52 form in 2003&#150;04 and would therefore be excluded, though this is not quantifiable from existing sources.<br>

Note:<br>

Figures are rounded to the nearest &#163;10 and are in cash terms.<br>

<a name="stpa_93">From 2006/07 funding will begin to taper for the trailblazer&quot; local programmes as part of the planned process of incorporation in to mainstream services. Everton&#039;s Sure Start local programme funding for 2006/07 will be &#163;590,717. Early Excellence Centres have been funded until March 2006. However, Liverpool local authority will receive children&#039;s centre funding of &#163;2,955,804 for 2004&#150;06 and &#163;9,025,886 for 2006&#150;08. This is to support existing children&#039;s centres like Everton as well as to develop more. We expect Early Years provision to be maintained and to grow through children&#039;s centres, so that by 2010 there is a children&#039;s centre for every community. The Sure Start budget will more than double to &#163;1.8 million by 2008. Exactly how and when this funding is used to support children&#039;s centres is a matter for the local authority to decide based on their assessment of existing provision, levels of deprivation and families needs.

Non-Schengen states may choose to follow the requirements, though they would not be bound by the timetable. Similar information has not been collated for Non-EU states. All ED member states which issue identity cards are considering introducing biometrics to increase security. This is part of a world-wide move towards using biometrics in travel and other identity documents, not an EU requirement as there is no legal basis for the Community to act on identity cards. Our information on current procedures is that biometric information is only currently stored on the Italian national identity card.

 We have taken a number of steps to assess the accuracy of biometric readings. We have closely reviewed leading scientific evidence in the field; consulted with biometric experts from academia and industry; sought to build on the experience and knowledge of other organisations, such as IND, PITO and Communications-Electronic Security Group&#039;s (CESG&#039;s) biometric readings group and we have conducted a review of the experiences of other examples of biometric systems, including systems holding millions of sample records. Current thinking is that three separate biometrics will be recorded (iris image; fingerprints and facial recognition) which would increase the accuracy of biometric readings from individuals. In addition, we will keep emerging research in this field under constant review and it is envisaged we will hold performance tests during procurement and the early phase of implementation of the ID card scheme.

 The Home Office and UKPS (UK Passport Service) have examined the use of facial recognition as part of the biometric enrolment trial. This was not a technology evaluation but supported the view that facial recognition has applications in 1-to-1 matching but is not suitable for matching against very large numbers of records. Facial recognition is still being considered as one of the biometric technologies which may be used for Identity Cards. Police Information Technology Organisation (PITO) has an active biometrics programme and maintains awareness of many biometric and human identification technologies, including facial recognition. PITO is engaged in producing a facial images database for identification purposes as part of the Facial Images National Database (FIND) project which should complete in 2006. UKPS is currently assessing the suitability of automatic face recognition technology for use within the passport application process for detecting fraudulent applications. A standalone Automatic Face Recognition (AFR) system is being deployed in the UKPS&#039;s seven fraud and intelligence units to help prove the concept and to establish the benefits of using AFR, and assist in the development of technical and

 The information to be kept on the National Identity Register is set out in Schedule 1 of the Identity Cards Bill. Entitlement to free treatment is not included in the Schedule, neither is it a registrable fact as defined in Clause 1(5) of the Identity Cards Bill. This means that such information could not be held on the National Identity Register unless approved by further primary legislation. However, information contained on the National Identity Register, for example about a person&#039;s immigration status, could be relevant to decisions on whether an individual is entitled to free NHS treatment.

 There are no plans to issue newly arrived asylum seekers with Identity Cards as it is difficult to check the biographical footprint of asylum seekers as they arrive in the UK without any documents to confirm their identity. Asylum seekers are issued with biometric Asylum Registration Cards (ARC) which contains a fingerprint of the individual that it has been issued to. The biometric ARC card is used to prevent an individual lodging multiple applications for asylum. Clause 2(4) of the Identity Cards Bill allows an entry for an individual to be made in the Register (whether or not he has applied to be, or is entitled to be entered in it) if the Secretary of State considers that the addition of the entry to the Register would be consistent with the statutory purposes. This clause will allow a failed asylum seeker to be entered into the Register to ensure that they cannot assume a different identity while they remain in the UK or if they make a subsequent attempt

Explanations for the reconciling items are as follows:<br>

1.Notional charges&#151;The estimates include notional charges, which are non-budget&quot; items and thus do not appear in the Budget figurework.<br>

2.Pension changes&#151;In late December 2004, HM Treasury provided details of changes required to Northern Ireland budgets as a result of a change in methodology for determining employers&#039; contribution rates for the Civil Service Pension Scheme and the Teacher&#039;s Pension Scheme. These changes were not available at the time of publication of the Priorities and Budget document, but have been included in the estimates document.<br>

3.Admin receipts&#151;The departmental administration figures in column 1 of the estimates are on a gross basis, with any associated receipts being included in the Accruing Resources figures in column 5. The administration cost limits in the Priorities and Budget are presented on a net basis after allowing for any associated administration receipts.<br>





4.AME&#151;The administrative element of Annually Managed Expenditure (AME) is included in the Estimates, but not included in Table 4 of the Priorities and Budget, which focuses on the Departmental Expenditure Limit (DEL).<br>

 The Baha&quot;&#039;-&quot;s are the largest non-Muslim religious group in Iran yet, unlike Christians, Jews and Zoroastrians, are not recognised in Iran&#039;s constitution. Members of the Baha&quot;&#039;-&quot; community have suffered intimidation and harassment, had property confiscated and been denied access to education and employment, apparently on account of their faith. A number of Baha&quot;&#039;-&quot; sites have been demolished, organisers of Baha&quot;&#039;-&quot; community activities have reportedly been harassed and the Baha&quot;&#039;-&quot; faith has been denigrated in the state-owned media. Many of these acts appear to have been carried

 In an agreement reached with Iran in Paris in November 2004, the UK, France and Germany (the E3&quot;), supported by the EU High Representative, proposed a framework for negotiating long-term arrangements for Iran&#039;s nuclear programme and co-operation in other areas. Iran agreed to suspend fully all uranium enrichment related and reprocessing activities while the discussions continue; the agreement makes clear that this is essential to the continuation of the process. The discussions have been taken forward by a Steering Committee and three Working Groups covering nuclear issues, political/security issues, and technology/co-operation. Both sides have put forward ideas. Following a ministerial meeting in Geneva on 25 May, the E3 have now agreed to present further ideas in late July or early August. These are still under internal discussion.

 In the European Union, all genetically modified (GM) foods are subject to a mandatory pre-market safety assessment before they can be permitted to enter the food chain. This assessment is the responsibility of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and is based on a wide body of scientific evidence submitted in support of each application, including data on the presence of antibiotic resistance marker genes (ARMs). The significance of the presence of these genes is assessed on a case by case basis.

<a name="50628w33.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_189">In April 2004, the EFSA scientific panel on genetically modified organisms published an opinion on the use of ARMs in GM plants. The UK advisory committee on novel foods and processes (ACNFP) considered this opinion at its meeting in May 2004. The Committee agreed with EFSA&#039;s conclusion that the safety of ARMS should take into account both the prevalence of resistance to the antibiotic among bacteria, in the intestine or in the environment, and the extent of use of the antibiotic and its importance for clinical human or animal therapy.

 There are currently no plans to meet the charity Children with Leukaemia. The recent publication in the British Medical Journal by Dr.Draper and colleagues found a statistically increased incidence of leukaemia for children whose home address at birth was near power lines compared with those further away. The work was funded by the Department and has significantly added to the body of knowledge built up over the last few years regarding this very important subject. The work will continue with an investigation of the electromagnetic field (EMF) exposures at the addresses studied.

A number of population studies in the past have linked magnetic field exposure with a raised incidence of childhood leukaemia. This has led to the International Agency for Cancer Research to classify extremely low frequency fields or ELF, such as those associated with power lines and domestic wiring as a possible carcinogen&quot;. The World Health Organisation and indeed the Health Protection Agency have recommended additional research and the need for further precautionary measures to be considered.

The Department also published a best practice guide entitled Organising and delivering psychological therapies&quot; (2004) in order to help local services deliver acceptable, accessible, equitable, cost effective and safe psychological therapy services.
