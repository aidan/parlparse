termination of each private finance initiative (PFI) and public/private partnerships (PPP) contract is set out in the following table.

The termination liabilities to the Department, for example, will be different if the Department itself voluntary terminates a contract compared to termination by another party. The liabilities to the Department arising from third party termination are particularly hard to determine in advance.</p>

The distribution of formula and specific grants between authorities reflects the circumstances relevant to authorities.

 This is a local matter, which falls to national health service providers locally. However, I am advised that despite the Private Finance Initiative process stopping in June 2006, Essex Rivers remains committed to centralise core services at Colchester general hospital. The trust&#146;s intention is to achieve the same strategic ends over a longer period using other avenues for finance and taking advantage of opportunities as they arise. This is the central theme of the trust&#146;s investment strategy, launched in September 2006, for which consultation ended on 22 December 2006.</p>

The European Commission has not recently issued any new instructions about practices in the dairy sector, but it did adopt Commission Decision 2006/694/EC, the preamble (recitals) to which set down how the Commission intends the controls on antibiotics in milk should operate within the Community. The decision required all member states to prohibit the placing on the market of curd cheese manufactured by Bowland Dairy Products Ltd. of Barrowford, Lancashire, and the question of compensation is a matter for it to pursue with the Commission.</p>

According to the Sport England Active People Survey conducted between October 2005 and October 2006, 10.5 per cent. of the adult population went to the gym at least once in the previous four weeks. Of these, 16.8 per cent. met the Chief Medical Officer&#146;s (CMO) recommendation of at least 30 minutes of at least moderate intensity physical activity on five or more days of the week, exclusively through gym-based exercise. 27.9 per cent. of those who went to the gym at least once in the previous four weeks, were also reported as meeting the CMO&#146;s recommendation through moderate/vigorous intensity sport and active recreation. According to the survey, the average duration of a visit to the gym is 76 minutes. Gym-based exercise is likely to confer a significant general health benefit for those who participate regularly.</p>

 The polonium traces in the investigation into the death of Mr. Litvinenko were found to be Polonium-210 (Po-210). It occurs naturally and is present in the environment and in people at very low concentrations. It can also be made by irradiation of other materials. Polonium-210 has a half-life of 138 days. It undergoes decay by emitting alpha particles, accompanied by very low intensity gamma rays.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_348"><a name="70111w0011.htm_para1"><a name="0701124001012">Polonium-210 can only represent a radiation hazard if it is ingested, inhaled or otherwise taken into the body&#151;for example, through an open wound. Where patches of contamination have been discovered in public places these have equated to polonium that weighs less than one millionth of a millionth of a gram&#151;hence they are so low to cause no concern to immediate or longer term health.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_349"><a name="70111w0011.htm_para2"><a name="0701124001013">Police officers and the NHS Ambulance Service undertaking all activities in the death of Mr. Litvinenko are working to the principle of as low as is reasonably practicable (ALARP) and in addition are working to a maximum radiation dose constraint of 1 mSv. This is the legal limit of exposure for members of the public as defined under the Ionising Radiation Regulations 1999. Though legislation and best practice allow higher dose limits for emergency activities and employees, setting this lower constraint level ensures that the risks to emergency workers are kept low.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_350"><a name="70111w0011.htm_para3"><a name="0701124001014">The Fire and Rescue Service (FRS) had no operational involvement in this case. In the case of an accidental release of polonium FRS personnel would be engaged only after a full assessment of the level of release had been made and specialist radiological advice obtained. Firefighter operations in the contaminated area would be restricted and those likely to be exposed would be equipped with appropriate personal and respiratory protective equipment. This and associated control measures adopted by the FRS would aim to protect staff from accidental release of Polonium-210.</p>

 The Department's &#145;National Framework for Mental Health&#146;, containing recommendations for dealing with people with a dual diagnosis of mental disorder and substance misuse, details best practice guidance on effective approaches to commissioning and the provision of treatment services. The framework advocates an integrated care mechanism for those diagnosed with both mental health and substance misuse problems, drawing on the expertise of all local providers, voluntary organisations and other to deliver effective service improvement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_354"><a name="70111w0011.htm_para7"><a name="0701124001024">For drug and alcohol misuse, there is a recognition that a significant number of those presenting for treatment have associated mental health problems.</p>

It should be noted that as the voluntary sector is a major provider in terms of drug treatment the links with mental health bodies, including those in the statutory sector are already well established and we will continue to use all available opportunities to maintain and strengthen these links.</p>

This provides guidance to local national health service organisations in developing an integrated system of interventions and treatment to meet the needs of local people whose alcohol use is harmful. It is expected that MoCAM will be used by primary care trusts working in partnership with local commissioning groups and local service providers. This will include both the voluntary and mental health services.</p>

 Since 1963, for Northwest Europe, and 1967 for the rest of the world, the Ministry of Defence has offered to repatriate the bodies of all those who die in military service, for burial in the United Kingdom. However, if the family elect to have a funeral overseas, the Ministry of Defence will pay for the next of kin and a companion to attend at public expense and, should local conditions prevent their attendance, then a visit to the grave may be arranged up to two years after the death. While this policy of repatriation was not made retrospective, in the event of the discovery of identifiable human remains on a historic battlefield, or crash site, the Department will, assuming we can trace their relatives, provide the opportunity for two people to attend the service funeral at public expense.</p>

The scheme also funds a carer to accompany the widow/er on the UK section of the pilgrimage, from which point appropriate care is provided. We review periodically the administration of the scheme, which is administered for the Department by the Royal British Legion, but we have no plans to change our policy for eligible war widow/ers to visit their spouse's grave/memorial.</p>

<i> [holding answer 9 January 2007]: </i>It is not possible to accurately identify the numbers of responses specifically generated by television advertising. However, Army advertising as a whole over the period 1 April to 1 December 2006 generated 163,770 inquiries to join the Regular Army. This compares very favourably with 88,000 inquiries for the same period last year. Of these, the Army judges that the multi-media Infantry &#145;Forward as One&#146; campaign generated 113,000 inquiries, with the balance attributable to the &#145;Everest West Ridge&#146; campaign. From these campaigns, the Army has received 30,020 specific inquiries to join the Infantry. Enlistments to the Infantry are currently up 30 per cent. compared with the same period in the financial year 2005-06 and the number of newly trained infantrymen that are forecast to join their units by the end of this financial year is up 15 per cent. on last year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_391"><a name="70111w0015.htm_para19"><a name="0701124001779">However, the regulations do recognise that certain age-related practices may be justifiable where they are a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim. Such objective justification will not be an easy test, and providers of vocational training will have to produce supporting evidence if challenged: assertions that an age-based approach was necessary will not be enough. For further information on objective justification, please refer to pages 30 and 31 of the Acas guidance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_392"><a name="70111w0015.htm_para20"><a name="0701124001780">If you provide vocational training and currently set age limits or requirements, you will need to consider whether these are capable of being justified. You would have to be able to demonstrate this if challenged.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_393"><a name="70111w0015.htm_para21"><a name="0701124001781"><i> What about funding? Isn&#146;t that access?</i></p>

<p><a name="stpa_394"><a name="70111w0015.htm_para22"><a name="0701124001782">Article 3.3 of the Directive clearly states that the Directive does not apply to payments of any kind made by state schemes. The power to make provision for support for students is set out in section 22 of the Teaching and Higher Education Act 1998. The grants and loans for tuition fees and maintenance paid to students under the Education (Student Support) Regulations 2006 (which are made under section 22) are from public funds. Student support in the UK is therefore a &#147;state scheme&#148;. As such funding falls outside scope of the Directive it is not covered by the age regulations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_395"><a name="70111w0015.htm_para23"><a name="0701124001783">Maintenance loans for students affect maintenance during study, not admission to a course of study. They are not related to access and fall outside the scope of the Directive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_396"><a name="70111w0015.htm_para24"><a name="0701124001784">Bursaries and scholarships are also not covered, because they are incentives, as opposed to relating directly to access.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_398"><a name="70111w0015.htm_para26"><a name="0701124001786">Age limits set in relation to Government funding are outside the scope of the Directive, as explained above. However, any decision to deny access to a training course to people outside that age group would need to be objectively justified by the training provider.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_400"><a name="70111w0015.htm_para28"><a name="0701124001788">What this means is illustrated by the following two examples:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_401"><a name="70111w0015.htm_para29"><a name="0701124001789">Training Provider X run an IT course which receives Government funding for participants under 25. The training provider only admit people within this age limit and refuses places to anybody 26 or over on grounds of their age. This would have to be objectively justified.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_402"><a name="70111w0015.htm_para30"><a name="0701124001790">Training Provider Y also run an IT course which receives Government funding for participants under 25, who are offered free/subsidised places. However, rather than denying access to people aged 26 or over they instead require them to pay for their own place on the course. This would not need to be objectively justified.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_403"><a name="70111w0015.htm_para31"><a name="0701124001791">For further information on objective justification, please refer to pages 30 and 31 of the Acas guidance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_405"><a name="70111w0015.htm_para33"><a name="0701124001793">There is also a provision in the regulations which allows for Positive Action to be taken in connection with access to vocational training, to compensate for  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_406"><a name="70111w0015.htm_para34"><a name="0701124001794">Positive action should not be confused with positive discrimination. A guarantee of work once the training is completed should never be offered or implied. For further information on positive action, please refer to page 29 of the Acas guidance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_408"><a name="70111w0015.htm_para36"><a name="0701124001796">As Article 6(1)(a) of the EU Employment Directive makes clear, the protection of vulnerable groups is a legitimate aim. The promotion of vocational integration is also a legitimate aim listed in the Directive. Special employment-related measures to integrate particular sections of the population into the workforce are common throughout the EU. For example, the UK Government supports apprenticeship programmes which are designed by employers to develop occupational competence and wider employability, and hence help to integrate into the workforce those who would otherwise lack the necessary skills.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_409"><a name="70111w0015.htm_para37"><a name="0701124001797"><i> What does vocational integration mean?</i></p>

<p><a name="stpa_410"><a name="70111w0015.htm_para38"><a name="0701124001798">The process of vocational integration should lead to an individual benefiting from educational opportunities, in order to become employable, and to achieve employment. Although the term &#147;vocational integration&#148; cannot be precisely defined, it relates to any action intended to help the transition of individuals from education or unemployment to work and their integration into the working world, or the movement of individuals between occupations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_411"><a name="70111w0015.htm_para39"><a name="0701124001799">It should be remembered, however, that education of pupils in schools does not constitute vocational training within the meaning of the Directive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_413"><a name="70111w0015.htm_para41"><a name="0701124001801">The following are just some of the issues vocational training providers will need to consider:</p>
