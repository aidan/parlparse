<br>&nbsp;<br><i>20 Jul 2005 : Column 1704W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>



<p><a name="st_1"><a name="50720w01.html_spmin1"><b>The Solicitor-General:</b> 
 The Government&#039;s decision to implement section 43 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 will give effect to recommendations made nearly 20 years ago by Lord Roskill&#039;s Fraud Trials Committee, and more recently by Sir Robin Auld in his &quot;Review of the Criminal Courts&quot;, that the most serious and complex fraud cases should be heard without a jury. The justification for the change is that the efforts made by the prosecution and the court to keep such cases to a manageable length mean that sometimes the defendant cannot be tried for charges that fully expose the extent of the criminality alleged. Moreover, notwithstanding these efforts, some trials are inordinately long and impose an unreasonable burden on juries, whose members ask to be excused and sometimes as a result the jury becomes unrepresentative. In other cases the number of jurors can fall worryingly low because jurors cannot continue to serve for a prolonged period.

In addition, for some crops like beet or potatoes, cross-pollination does not affect the harvested material, so if a GM variety cross-pollinated a non-GM variety, the produce of the latter would not have any GM content. Pollen produced by crop plants may be dispersed by insects or on the wind. The frequency of cross-pollination events between crops decreases with distance, but it is known that they may occur infrequently over very long distances. This makes it difficult to think in terms of guaranteeing zero cross-contamination by the use of buffer zones.

<p><a name="st_17"><a name="50720w03.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 Defra has not assessed the effect of poor air quality on the structure of historic buildings in St. Albans. The effect of acid rain on materials has been studied by the then Department of the Environment through the National Materials Exposure Programme (NMEP). This was initiated by Building Effects Review Group (BERG) in 1987 and consisted of 29 sites. The UK NMEP was part of the International Materials Exposure Programme set up under the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe framework. The UK continues to maintain sites in London and Lincoln as part of this programme. Details of this programme can be found at www.unece.org/env/wge/materials.htm.

<a name="50720w03.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_36">In recent years concern for the effects of pollutants on heritage buildings has focussed on the multipollutant atmospheres found in modern urban areas. In cities such as St. Albans where brick is commonly used the main concern is the soiling of facades by particulates from vehicles. Details can be found at http://www.corr-institute.se/MULTI-ASSESS/
</p>


<p>
<a name="50720w03.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_37">The pollutants that form acid rain are principally sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. These are released from the combustion of fossil fuels like coal and oil. The UK is a party to several protocols under the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe&#039;s Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Pollution aimed at reducing emissions of acidifying gases. The UK has also agreed to meet emissions ceilings according to the national emissions ceilings directive. National emissions of sulphur dioxide have reduced from 3,721 kilotonnes in 1990 to 1,002 kilotonnes in 2002; and national emissions of nitrogen oxides have reduced from 2,771 kilotonnes in 1990 to 1,582 kilotonnes in 2002. These improvements are due mainly to reduced emissions from electricity generation, industry, domestic heating and road transport.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50720w03.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_38">St. Albans city and district council has designated three air quality management areas in respect of the annual mean nitrogen dioxide objective which has to be achieved by end of December 2005; one of the air quality management areas designated in November 2004 comprises properties in London Road, central St. Albans and this relates to emissions from local road transport.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50720w03.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_39">Once a local authority has designated an air quality management area, it has a duty to take action, along with other stakeholders, to work towards meeting the air quality objective(s). Where local road transport is identified as a major source of local air pollution concentrations, those local authorities are being recommended to integrate their air quality action plans into the local transport plan. St. Albans city and district council will therefore be working with Hertfordshire county council to take forward measures to tackle the emissions sources within the city centre.

A review of the higher level organisations is underway and in parallel, a detailed cost/benefit analysis is being carried out on a number of site options. By the end of the year we expect to be reasonably clear about the size and structure of the new organisation(s). Sites currently under consideration are all within the travel to work area for most existing staff. Any significant collocation is unlikely to commence much before 2007, but if a major new build is required, moves may extend well beyond 2008.

 All Territorial Army (TA) personnel currently called up for deployments must be at least 18 years of age and have completed Phase 1 and Phase 2 training. Upon mobilisation, all soldiers receive health checks and additional preparation and training for 10 days at the Reserves Training and Mobilisation Centre (RTMC), before attending five days further pre-deployment training, designed specifically for the theatre to which they are deploying, at the Operational Training Advisory Group (OPTAG). Provided all training and medical standards have been met, soldiers are deemed fit to deploy to theatres and at this stage the majority will join a regular unit, for up to two months prior to deployment, where they will undergo further integration and training.

 The Home Office Departmental Report 2004&#150;05 (Cm 6528) sets out to Parliament how the Department has delivered its public services and how it achieved its key targets during 2004&#150;05.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50720w21.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_136">The report also sets out the structure of the Department and summarises the plans for the next financial year&#151;2005&#150;06. The report reflects the Department&#039;s three pillars of responsibility, around which the ministerial team is organised. These are: policing, security, community safety and active communities; National Offender Management Service and the criminal justice system; and immigration, citizenship and nationality. Our activities and achievements are brigaded under the Department&#039;s strategic objectives.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50720w21.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_137">The report is available to other stakeholders including the public and is accessible via the Home Office website.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50720w21.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_138">The total production costs of the report incurred by the Department including design, layout and printing costs excluding VAT is &#163;60,228 while the total VAT inclusive cost is &#163;67,732. This does not included the potential cost of an HMTL web-version for the visually impaired, which it is intended to produce in the near future. Nor, as in previous years, does it include the costs of Home Office staff time involved in the production of the report as identifying these would involve disproportionate cost.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department pursuant to his answer of 5 July 2005, <i>Official Report,</i> column 382W, on domestic violence, if he will make it his policy to extend the self-completion component of the British Crime Survey to adults over 59 years; and if he will make a statement. [12060]</p>




<p><a name="st_194"><a name="50720w21.html_spnew6"><b> Hazel Blears: </b> 
 Respondents over the age of 60 are not asked to undertake British Crime Survey (BCS) self-completions. Traditionally, this has been because older people are sometimes less able or willing to use the laptop computers. There is evidence from the BCS that older respondents in the 16 to 59 age group are more likely to require interviewer assistance for the self-completion (see Budd and Mattinson, 2000). There is, however, also anecdotal evidence from interviewers and survey companies to suggest that this is increasingly less of a problem.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50720w21.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_139">However, the decision to limit the upper age range has remained, primarily for research reasons. Inclusion of the 60 and over age group in modules relating to &#039;interpersonal violence&#039; issues (such as sexual victimisation) is methodologically problematic. The issue of &#039;elder abuse&#039; (in common with the issue of child abuse) tends to be explored in a different context, using dedicated surveys.

 XHIBIT (eXchange Hearing Information By Internet Technology) was first used at Lincoln Crown Court on 11 April 2005. The Department is paying a fixed cost for the development and introduction of XHIBIT to all courts in England and Wales, and so is not charged on an individual court basis. XHIBIT will be in use in all 101 Crown court centres across England and Wales by April next year. The total charge to introduce and operate the system will be &#163;20 million.

<a name="50720w23.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_146">The decision to introduce nationally was based on pilots in Essex and at Snaresbrook Crown Court. These pilots, along with an assessment of the first 11 courts to receive XHIBIT, is showing that the new system is making Crown courts more effective. For example, it reduces the clerical effort required to capture and distribute hearing information, such as, results, bail orders and imprisonment orders. Previously, such information took days to reach other criminal justice agencies, now they can get it in minutes allowing them to operate better. Local assessment of XHIBIT&#039;s effectiveness in Lincoln is scheduled for September 2005. XHIBIT&#039;s reliability is currently above that which the supplier is contracted to provide. This is monitored on a daily basis by the XHIBIT National Support Centre.

 We currently have no plans to modify the Data Protection Act 1998, as the Act properly and proportionately implements Directive 95/46/EC. The Act includes the powers available to the Information Commissioner; the definition of personal data (which is already relatively broad, as the directive requires it to be); the provisions relating to transfer of personal data outside the European Economic Area; the guarantee of the right of subject access (except where the Act provides legitimate exemptions, as allowed by the directive); and the position of structured manual records (where the directive makes clear that a high degree of structure must be involved). The full provisions of the Act also apply to CCTV systems recording the actions of identifiable individuals, as such information is clearly personal data within the meaning of the legislation.

 Urban traffic control techniques are a key part of the delivery of sustainable local transport. The introduction of traffic signal control at individual junctions or over wide areas often requires a balance of the conflicting demands of vehicular traffic capacity and provision for vulnerable users such as pedestrians.

<a name="50720w25.html_para6">
Studies have shown that good, coordinated traffic signal operation can reduce delays to traffic which in turn can lead to reductions in pollution. Benefits will vary from site to site but typical delay reductions due to coordinated operation under the SCOOT urban traffic control system, used in many UK towns and cities, compared with un-coordinated operation were measured as 23 per cent. in Worcester and 30 per cent. in Southampton.

<sup>(46)</sup> Figures are less than 500 and subject to a high degree of sampling variation.<br>

Notes:<br>

1. Based on a 5 per cent. sample and therefore subject to sampling variation.<br>

2. Figures are in thousands and rounded to the nearest hundred.<br>

3. From November 2002, the methodology for producing these figures was changed to allow statistics to be published much sooner. This has resulted in a small increase in the reported caseload. This is because some cases which have actually terminated but have not yet been updated on the computer system are now included.<br>

4. Parliamentary constituencies are allocated using the relevant ONS post code directory.<br>

 We are committed to making work pay for all those who are able to work, and to supporting households in sustaining employment.

<a name="50720w31.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_43">We have made significant progress in taking forward our Housing Benefit Reform Programme which was launched in October 2002. As part of this reform, we implemented the local housing allowance in nine pathfinder authorities for tenants in the deregulated private sector. Nine more local authorities will implement the local housing allowance between April and July 2005. Early results from the Pathfinders are contained in the evaluation report &quot;Delivering the Local Housing Allowance: A summary of the early experiences of implementing the Local Housing Allowance in the nine Pathfinder areas&quot;, published in April, which is available in the Library.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50720w31.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_44">In April 2004, we introduced a number of measures to improve work incentives for housing benefit recipients. These included removing the need for people to reclaim housing benefit when they start a job. In most cases this ensures that benefit claims remain &quot;live&quot; while local authorities determine whether someone is entitled to continue claiming housing benefit. We also applied the additional earnings disregard in housing benefit and council tax benefit to those customers who are working for 16 or more hours a week and who have children or are disabled, and to some people of 50 or over who have recently returned to work. In addition, we extended housing benefit run-on to people receiving incapacity benefit and severe disablement allowance.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50720w31.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_45">As part of our reform programme, we are also reducing administrative complexity and providing housing benefit recipients with a clearer understanding of their benefit entitlement on return to work.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50720w31.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_46">We have also introduced a range of other measures which act as real incentives for people to move off benefit and into work. The National Minimum Wage was introduced in April 1999. It established minimum standards of pay in the labour market. In October 2004 the minimum wage was increased from &#163;4.50 per hour to &#163;4.85 for workers aged 22 and over and from &#163;3.80 per hour to &#163;4.10 per hour for people aged 18&#150;21.

credits: the child tax credit (CTC) and the working tax credit (WTC) both of which are designed to make work pay.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50720w31.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_48">The Adviser Discretion Fund was introduced in July 2001, giving Jobcentre Plus Advisers direct access to funds to remove immediate barriers to employment and help people move quickly into work. In October 2004 we introduced Job Grant to help people manage until they receive their first wages. Additionally, housing benefit and council tax benefit extended payments allow maximum housing benefit and council tax benefit to continue for the first four weeks after starting work.

<p><a name="st_50"><a name="50720w31.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Plaskitt: </b> 
 Currently there are no facilities for direct communication between the Department for Work and Pension Information Technology (IT) Systems and Local Authority Housing Benefit IT systems.

<a name="stpa_50">DWP also provides electronic transfers of data to relevant local authorities on awards, changes and terminations of income support, job seekers allowance and pension credit for customers known to be in receipt of housing benefit or council tax benefit.

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_177">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your questions concerning the closure of the Jobcentre Plus office in Newtown and the economic effect on the town. This is something which falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Acting Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_178">Firstly, I must make it clear that there are no plans to close the Jobcentre Plus Office in Newtown. As David Anderson, the former Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus outlined in his letter to you of 31 March, it is the behind the scenes Benefit Processing work that will eventually transfer to our Processing Centre in Wrexham.</p>
</ul>
<p>





<br>&nbsp;<br><i>20 Jul 2005 : Column 1820W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_179">The centralisation of Benefit Processing, at a smaller number of larger sites, will play a crucial role in helping Jobcentre Plus to meet the Government&#039;s efficiency challenge and I know that Charles Morse, the District Manager for North West Wales and Powys wrote to you on 27 May detailing the timescales for the transfer of this work.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_180">It is not envisaged that the transfer of Benefit Processing to Wrexham will have an adverse impact upon the wider local economy. Customers will continue to have access to the fully integrated Jobcentre Plus service at Afon House and, through our enhanced Personal Adviser service for customers on inactive benefits, we will continue to target our help at some of our most disadvantaged customers.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_181">Nevertheless, I recognise that the decision to centralise Benefit Processing has led to surplus staff. Unfortunately, it has not proved possible to identify suitable redeployment opportunities for all those staff involved. Consequently, it has been necessary to run a Voluntary Early Release Scheme and in the coming months, as we complete the transfer of work to Wrexham, a number of staff will be leaving Jobcentre Plus under the terms of our scheme.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_182">While the loss of experienced staff is always regrettable, the challenges that Jobcentre Plus has taken up are about providing a better and more efficient service to our customers, and there is no doubt in my mind that the decision to centralise Benefit Processing is the correct one.

Notes:<br>

1. All figures are for Great Britain. They are in millions and rounded to the nearest 50,000.<br>

2. Entitlement levels for pension credit are estimated using the 2002/03 Family Resources Survey modelled using the Department&#039;s Policy Simulation Model.<br>

3. Results are subject to sampling and reporting errors and estimation assumptions, and are therefore indicative only.<br>

4. Analysis suggests that due to uncertainties, a margin of error of 250,000 should be placed around the central projections. So the projection for 2004&#150;05 could lie in the range 3.55 million to 4.05 million households.<br>

5. The projections of individuals include some people aged under 60 who are partners of claimants aged 60 or over.<br>

 Since 1997 the Government&#039;s priority has been to tackle the scourge of unemployment, inactivity and poverty through investment in, and reform of, the welfare state. The UK now has one of the strongest labour markets in the world, with the best combination of employment and unemployment of the major world economies. More people are moving from welfare back into work with employment up almost 200,000 in the last year and by over 2 million since 1997.

<sup>(51)</sup> Mid-2003 population estimates are the latest data available. Mid-2004 population estimates will be published on 25 August 2005.<br>

<sup>(52)</sup> Population estimates for 1981 to 2000 have been revised in light of the 2001 census. These figures are on 2001 boundaries. Figures for 1975 to 1980 are on 1981 boundaries.<br>

<sup>(53)</sup> The Local Government Reorganisation (LGR) between 1995 and 1998 resulted in major changes to some county boundaries. From 1997 Milton Keynes UA was no longer included in Buckinghamshire. From 1998 Medway UA was no longer included in Kent and Southend-on-Sea UA and Thurrock UA were no longer included in Essex. Also in 1998 Berkshire ceased to exist and was split into Reading UA, Bracknell Forest UA, West Berkshire UA, Slough UA, Windsor and Maidenhead UA and Wokingham UA.<br>

<sup>(54)</sup> The data for 1975 to 1980 and for 1981 to 2003 are not directly comparable due to a number of boundary changes (in addition to the Local Government Reorganisation) between 1981 and 2001. There have been no boundary changes since mid-2001 affecting these counties.<br>

 DFID has recently launched a new policy on conditionality. Our policy makes it clear that we do not believe that conditionality can &quot;buy&quot; reform. Our aid programmes are based on partner commitment to reducing poverty, respect for human rights and international obligations and the strengthening of financial systems.

<p><a name="st_96"><a name="50720w37.html_spnew2"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 The Department for International Development uses a financial model to help inform decisions on bilateral aid allocation in Africa and other regions. The model takes account of the extent of a 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>20 Jul 2005 : Column 1840W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
country&#039;s poverty and the likely effectiveness of aid in reducing poverty there. The amount of aid which countries are likely to receive from other donors is also taken into account. As such, there is a good correlation between UK aid to African countries and levels of poverty. For example, the three poorest countries in terms of GNI per capita, Sierra Leone, Malawi and Tanzania, are also the three highest recipients of UK aid per capita.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50720w37.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_94">Once aid has been allocated, we take a number of actions to ensure it reaches the poor and impacts on poverty. We have learnt that the best way for aid to deliver sustainable poverty reduction is to support developing countries own priorities&#151;and to build capacity and accountability for delivery of services which improve the lives of the poor. As such, we help countries to develop and implement their own Poverty Reduction Strategies, which take into account the interests and needs of the poor. An important part of this is to strengthen monitoring systems and the accountability of governments to their citizens (including the poor). We also work closely with countries to strengthen public financial management and tackle corruption.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50720w37.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_95">Before providing funds directly through government systems, we undertake a rigorous assessment of whether policies are sound and funds will be properly used. Where risks are too high, we channel funds directly to the poor through the United Nations or non-government organisations.

<a name="stpa_96">Debt relief is provided to countries which qualify for the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative.

In some limited cases, commitments have been made for specific interventions at the global level. This is generally for reasons of international coordination or advocacy.

 At the G8 summit at Gleneagles, G8 Heads agreed a package of comprehensive support to help accelerate progress towards the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), particularly in Africa which is falling behind. In advance of the summit, the United Nations published a comprehensive review of prospects for achieving the MDGs called &#039;Investing in Development&#039;, which informed UK policy.

<a name="stpa_146">G8 Heads agreed several specific measures to tackle the health and HIV/AIDS related MDGs. They undertook to support African Governments&#039; commitment to ensure access to basic health care for all (free wherever countries choose to provide this) to reduce mortality among those most at risk of dying from preventable causes, particularly women and children. This includes a commitment to invest in improved health systems, which are critical for progress across the board.

<a name="stpa_147">On malaria, the G8 committed to work with African countries to scale up action to reach 85 per cent. of the vulnerable populations with the interventions that will save 600,000 children&#039;s lives a year by 2015. These include ensuring access to anti-malaria insecticide-treated mosquito nets, adequate and sustainable supplies of Combination Therapies including Artemisin, presumptive treatment for pregnant women and babies, household residual spraying and the capacity in African health services to effectively use them.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50720w40.html_para19">
<a name="stpa_148">The G8 Heads committed to the aims of an AIDS-free generation, significantly reducing HIV infections, aiming as close as possible to universal access to treatment for all who need it by 2010 and ensuring proper support for all children left orphaned or vulnerable by AIDS. They committed to increase resources to tackle AIDS, including through replenishing the Global Fund to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis (TB) and malaria (GFATM). They also undertook to work with the World Health Organisation (WHO), the Joint UN Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and other international bodies to develop and implement a package for HIV prevention, treatment and care, and to improve coordination through implementing the &#039;Three Ones&#039; principles.

<a name="stpa_149">To encourage the development of vaccines, microbicides and drugs for AIDS, TB, malaria and other neglected diseases, the G8 leaders committed to increase direct investment and take forward market incentives, through mechanisms such as Public Private Partnerships and Advance Purchase Commitments. We also re-affirmed our commitments made at the G8 summit at Evian, agreeing to improve access to affordable medicines by encouraging differential pricing of drugs by originator companies and by supporting the appropriate use of flexibilities in agreements on intellectual property rights where necessary.

They also agreed a new proposal to cancel the debt stock of qualifying HIPCs to the International Development Association of the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the African Development Fund of the African Development Bank. In addition, they agreed the need to find a solution to Nigeria&#039;s debts. G8 leaders re-affirmed their support for these agreements when they met at Gleneagles, and welcomed the Paris club&#039;s agreement on 29 June which will result in the elimination all of Nigeria&#039;s $29 billion bilateral debt to Paris club creditors.

 Water and sanitation, like education and health, are fundamental to the development of poor countries.

DFID is prioritising immediate action in 12 African countries. I also announced increased support for the European Union water facility and World Bank water programmes. The key to spending more money well will be helping governments in Africa to improve the priority given to water and sanitation in their own country plans, so that they better reflect the needs and aspirations of the poorest.

It will also estimate the proportions of the poverty reduction budget support (PRBS) and debt relief benefiting the water and sanitation sector.

<i>[holding answer 19 July 2005]:</i> DFID recognises the importance of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank being transparent and accountable to parliaments in developing countries. Clearly, such accountability needs to be at the heart of their relationship.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50720w43.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_171">The main means by which parliaments should engage with the Bank and the IMF activities is through the Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS) process. This is a national strategy for development that sets the agenda, which donors, including the World Bank, should follow in each country.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50720w43.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_172">In the past, parliamentary involvement in the PRS process has often been weak. However, over the past two years, DFID country offices have begun to support stronger involvement of parliamentarians in the PRS process. We are providing active support for parliamentary involvement in Malawi and Tanzania, where an independent Monitoring Group was established to oversee the joint commitments made around the PRS.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50720w43.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_173">In Board meetings, DFID encourages the World Bank and the IMF to engage with parliaments as much as possible. We also actively push for them to make more of their documents public and will continue to pursue this both at Board meetings and in discussions with staff. In fact, in March this year a new Bank disclosure policy was approved which, among other things, makes Board minutes public. The World Bank is now working closely with parliamentarians in some of its borrowing member countries to involve them in the design and implementation of its lending programmes.

The World Bank Institute has a major Parliamentary Strengthening Programme. A key objective is to strengthen the capacity of parliaments to scrutinise the allocation and use of public funds, and oversee the PRS. Since it began in 1996, it has delivered activities in a range of countries including Bangladesh, Cambodia, Ghana, Kenya, Indonesia and Uganda.
</p>


<p>

<a name="stpa_174">The World Bank Institute has also supported the African Parliamentarians Network Against Corruption (APNAC) and the Global Organization of Parliamentarians against Corruption (GOPAC) to encourage parliamentary scrutiny and action against corruption.

<p>
<a name="50720w43.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_175">Outside the PRS, the main means of oversight is the Parliamentary Network on the World Bank. This provides opportunities for parliaments to scrutinise the World Bank and engage more deeply in development policy issues.

 Funding for cancer research was centralised in 1999, when the research and development (R&D) office of the HPSS was established. Since then, that office has allocated a total of &#163;5.9 million for cancer research and related education and training initiatives. Details of expenditure on cancer research are not readily available prior to 1999. The R&D office is currently engaged in a major research programme involving some 15 different projects focussing on the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of cancer.

The pharmaceutical industry also provides funding to support clinical trials in cancer therapy. My Department does not hold information on these initiatives centrally.

<a name="stpa_194">It is important to note that a report of an adverse drug reaction does not necessarily mean that it was caused by the drug. Many factors have to be taken into account in assessing causal relationships including temporal association, the possible contribution of concomitant medication and the underlying disease. It is particularly important to note that causality has not been established for fatal reports.

<p><a name="st_174"><a name="50720w48.html_spnew5"><b> Jane Kennedy: </b> 
 No estimate has been made by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) of the number of bed days lost due to adverse drug reactions. The MHRA has, however funded a study conducted from November 2001 to April 2002, published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) on 2 July 2004 <sup>1</sup> , conducted in two large hospitals in Merseyside. This suggested that adverse drug reactions account for 6.5 per cent. of hospital admissions. The median bed stay was eight days, accounting for 4 per cent. of the hospital bed capacity. Patients admitted with adverse drugs reactions, who were of a median age of 76 years, were significantly older than patients without adverse drug reactions, who were of a median age of 66 years. A copy of the BMJ article is available in the Library.

Notes:<br>

1. A finished admission episode is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. Please note that admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>

2. Due to reasons of confidentiality, figures between one and five have been suppressed and replaced with *.<br>

3. The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 14 (seven prior to 2002&#150;03) diagnosis fields in the hospital episode statistics (HES) data set and provides the main reason why the patient was in hospital.<br>

4. Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data, that is, the data is ungrossed.<br>

<p><a name="st_188"><a name="50720w50.html_spnew4"><b> Jane Kennedy </b> 
<i>[holding answer 18 July 2005]:</i> The Government are monitoring the impact of the clinical trials directive in collaboration with its partners in clinical research. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is the licensing authority for clinical trials under the Medicines for Human Use (Clinical Trials) Regulations 2004, which implemented Directive 2001/20/EC (the Clinical Trials Directive) in United Kingdom law with effect from 1 May 2004. The MHRA asked the UK Clinical Research Collaboration (UKCRC) to analyse the available evidence on impacts that can be attributed to the Directive. The UKCRC has reviewed the preliminary evidence and found that no sources of information measure reliably the effects of the directive on the volume and type of clinical research, the difficulties or benefits it has produced, or the impact on research costs. It has agreed on the need for a reliable and independently derived set of metrics.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50720w50.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_202">At this early stage, there is evidence of good performance by the MHRA in approving clinical trials promptly and of a reduction in the time taken for ethics committee review. There is also evidence that in other respects, in 2004&#150;05 it took longer to set up trials and to secure permission to begin them in some national health service organisations. This may in part have been due to confusion in universities and the NHS about the interpretation of the law, leading to inconsistent behaviour and delay in reaching agreement. Financial information also suggests an initial decline in the numbers of early phase trials recruiting volunteers outside the NHS. Members of the UKCRC, including the Government, have agreed to collaborate on actions designed to speed up the approval of trials and reduce costs. The Government aims to work with its partners to build on this country&#039;s excellent reputation in clinical research.

 The criminal investigation unit of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) investigates all suspected breaches of medicines legislation brought to its attention. Examples of illicit purchases include the internet, pubs, clubs, boot fairs and by mail order. Illicit sales by their nature involve hidden transactions for which records are not usually kept and occur outside of the tightly regulated and monitored licensed system. The MHRA and the Department therefore have no estimates for these types of purchases.

<a name="stpa_221">The illegal sales that the MHRA has investigated predominantly involve lifestyle drugs which include those to treat erectile dysfunction, obesity, hair loss and anti-smoking. Erectile dysfunction medicines include Viagra, Cialis, Levitra and Uprima which are all licensed for supply in the United Kingdom. However, unlicensed generic versions coming mainly from India and China have been and are being investigated.

<a name="50720w52.html_para9">
As part of its anti-counterfeiting strategy, the MHRA is extending its existing Medicines Market Surveillance programme, which currently targets medicines at the point of retail, to further target medicines across the whole of the legitimate UK supply chain. Over a period of time, this will provide evidence of the existence or not of counterfeit medicines in the legitimate UK supply chain. The extended market surveillance programme is being supported by key stakeholders such as the pharmaceutical industry, trade groups, patient groups, distributors and the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain (RPSGB) and is a good example of collaborative work in this area.

 Ministers have agreed to the implementation of newborn screening for cystic fibrosis. About a fifth of babies born in England are offered newborn screening for cystic fibrosis.

<a name="stpa_233">Initially the emphasis is on developing the framework for the new programme and ensuring that existing screening provision meets consistent standards. The pace of further introduction of screening will depend on primary care trust&#039;s local priorities and resource commitment.

<i>[holding answer 12 July 2005]:</i> The policy considerations which underlie the abolition of the Commission for Patient and Public Involvement in Health (CPPIH) derive from the intention that the abolition of CPPIH will provide the opportunity for arrangements to be made for the provision of stronger, more efficient support and advice to forums.
