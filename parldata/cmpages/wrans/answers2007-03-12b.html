DFID has channelled all its funding for the returns process through the UN-administered common humanitarian fund (CHF). The multi-donor CHF is an ideal way of supporting returns as it provides fast and predictable funding. Of the $133 million allocated so far by the CHF (of which the DFID contribution makes up  60 per cent.), $12.4 million was given to support the returns process.</p>

 PFI credits relate solely to schools capital funding. Future PFI credits available to the Department as part of its capital baseline are largely assigned to the Building Schools for the Future (BSF) programme. PFI contracts usually cover a 25 to 30 year period. After this, the buildings will normally transfer to the local authority which is the signatory to the contract. Partnerships for Schools, our delivery partner for BSF, is working with each local authority which has joined the programme to establish which school projects are suitable for investment through PFI. This is decided on value for money grounds and is usually for those projects where the school is to be largely rebuilt, rather than refurbished.</p>

The Department has no plans beyond the next spending review period ending 2010-11. The PFI percentage figure is established by dividing PFI credits by the total schools capital funding baseline, including PFI credits.</p>

 As part of the national School Sport Strategy, all schools in Eastbourne are part of the Hailsham School Sport Partnership (a family of schools which work together to increase participation in PE and school sport). The partnership has received over &#163;1 million in the past three years to support its work in raising participation levels, linking schools to local sports clubs, and increasing the number of pupils involved in sports volunteering. It has seen the percentage of pupils participating in at least two hours of high quality PE and school sport a week rise from 80 per cent. in 2003 to 92 per cent. in 2006.</p>

The total investment in these three partnerships has been over &#163;3 million since 2003/04. The partnerships also benefit from extra funding for: Competition Managers in the area&#151;raising the quality and quantity of school competition; a Community Sports Coach&#151;bringing a sports specialist into schools; and school swimming&#151;helping weak swimmers become more confident in the water before they finish primary school.</p>

 If we do nothing to the secondary curriculum schools will not have the flexibility and space for stretching students and helping those who have fallen below the expected level in English and mathematics. We risk therefore being unable to increase the number of students who reach the age of 14 at a level which enables them to take full advantage of the increased choices we are making available in the 14-19 phase. The consequence of that will be that some young people become disengaged from learning and unable to meet their aspirations. Those young people are more likely to drop out of education and training post 16 and are less likely to succeed in later life.</p>

 Where a health and social services trust charges for car parking at a hospital under an income generation scheme, all of the revenue raised is available for use as decided by the trust to enhance and improve patient care. Such resources are therefore spent alongside that raised through the normal commissioning process and the trust will decide to which medical specialty they should be allocated.</p>

The Defence Budget for future years will be set in the Comprehensive Spending Review.</p>

 As paragraphs 5-7 and 5-8 of the White Paper: &#145;The Future of the United Kingdom's Nuclear Deterrent&#146; (Cm 6994) make clear, our policy is to maintain continuous at sea deterrent patrolling to ensure our deterrent remains fully credible. There would, theoretically, be a number of alternative postures to continuous patrolling but we do not regard them as providing credible deterrence. However, for a given size of fleet, the cost difference between maintaining continuous deterrent patrolling and not doing so would potentially be relatively minor since the costs directly associated with operating the submarine on patrol are a very small proportion of the overall costs of maintaining, supporting and operating the deterrent. Total expenditure on the capital and running costs of the Trident nuclear deterrent, including the costs of the Atomic Weapons Establishment, in 2006-07 is expected to be around &#163;1,500 million.</p>

For example, there has been a full debate in the House of Lords, and I have given a speech at King&#146;s College, London; provided the Defence Committee with wide-ranging evidence; taken part in a televised debate with CND; and discussed the future deterrent with a panel of experts at RUSI.

 As set out in paragraph 5 to 14 of the White Paper on the &#145;Future of the United Kingdom's Nuclear Deterrent&#146; (Cm 6994), we estimate that the in-service costs of the UK's nuclear deterrent will be around 5 to 6 per cent. of the defence budget once the proposed fleet of replacement SSBNs comes into service. This calcution is based on initial whole life estimates of in-service and disposal costs for the deterrent capability and the estimated costs of the Atomic Weapons Establishment, averaged over  the currently expected life of the new submarines and compared to the current defence budget. Taking similar costs for the current system, from 1998 to 2005, and comparing them to the actual defence budgets for those years, the average annual in-service cost was around 4 per cent. of the defence budget. The cost of the deterrent in 2006-07, including the cost of the Atomic Weapons Establishment, is expected to be around &#163;1,500 million, or just over five per cent of the current defence budget.</p>

<i> [holding answer 8 March 2007]: </i>As stated in the Defence Industrial Strategy, it is government policy to retain the UK submarine manufacturing and skills base for the foreseeable future as it will be essential to the maintenance of the UK&#146;s independent nuclear deterrent. Key to that is the establishment of a design and build programme which balances sustainability requirements with military need and affordability. MOD is working closely with industry to agree such a programme, together with other issues such as collaboration and rationalisation to ensure a viable enterprise well into the future. The Government response to the House of Commons Defence Committee&#146;s report &#147;The Future of the UK&#146;s Strategic Nuclear Deterrent: the Manufacturing and Skills Base&#148; (HC 59 dated 19 December 2006) provides further information on this issue.</p>

 It was always understood when we bid that national lottery funding for London 2012 would involve some loss of income to the non-Olympic good causes. Non-Olympic distributors may lose an average of 5 per cent. of their income because of sales diversion to Olympic lottery games over the period 2005-06 to 2012-13. In addition, we have already announced that &#163;410 million will be taken from non-Olympic lottery proceeds between 2009 and 2012. No decision has been made about how that amount will be shared between the various non-Olympic good causes nor on the further use of lottery funding to meet any of the &#163;900 million in additional costs that have been announced.

 The UK helps the Afghan Government co-ordinate eradication to ensure it is targeted in areas with access to alternative legal livelihoods, as set out in the National Drug Control Strategy.

 Officials from our embassy in Kinshasa and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in London have frequent discussions with their Congolese counterparts both in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and London about the removal of failed asylum seekers from the UK. The most recent discussions surrounded the return of  38 Congolese nationals on a charter flight to the DRC on 26 February. These discussions included an assurance from the Congolese Government that returnees would be well treated upon their return and of their continued cooperation for future returns. We also continue to work with the Congolese authorities on encouraging the voluntary return of failed asylum seekers to the DRC.</p>

 The question of ethnic minority rights in Nepal has come to the fore recently in the form of disturbances and protests in the Terai region. We have called for all parties in the interim Parliament to acknowledge the rights of ethnic minority groups and have stressed the need for greater inclusion, not only in the political process, but in society as a whole. The comprehensive peace agreement has done much to raise the expectations of a number of disenfranchised groups in Nepal. It is important that the coming interim Government ensure that ethnic minority rights are addressed urgently. Failure to do so risks undermining the peace process as Nepal moves towards elections to a constituent assembly in June.</p>

 In April 2006, Nepal had its second &#145;people's movement&#146; against the autocratic rule of the King. Women played a significant part, coming onto the streets in huge numbers to demand a more inclusive democratic system of government. Their protests did much to ensure that gender equality and justice were placed on the national agenda. This new emphasis on equal rights resulted in the passage of legislation which requires 33 per cent. of women's representation at all levels of the state structure and, for the first time, allowed for the right to citizenship to be passed on through the mother not just the father.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_169"><a name="70312w0019.htm_para0"><a name="07031242000698">But the inclusion of women in society remains largely cosmetic. The current Government, due to be replaced by an interim Government in the coming weeks, have only one female Minister. Although the interim Parliament formed in January has an increased number of women, this is largely due to the Maoists who fielded women for 37 per cent. of their 83 seats. Moreover, although the interim constitution notes the inclusion of traditionally marginalised groups such as women, it remains to be seen whether the constituent assembly elections will include the 33 per cent. of women candidates required by legislation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_170"><a name="70312w0019.htm_para1"><a name="07031242000699">Discrimination in Nepal is rooted in culture and religion and while legislation can make it unlawful, it will take a long time to change attitudes and perceptions. A huge cultural shift is required if women in Nepal are to participate in the peace process and play a significant part in the constituent assembly. In addition, structural changes in society are necessary in which poverty and the education of women need to be addressed.</p>

 The Nepalese Government and people are to be congratulated on the progress made so far in the peace process. In less than a year, Prime Minister Koirala and the alliance of seven democratic parties has signed a Comprehensive Peace Agreement with Maoists, drafted and agreed an interim constitution, formed an interim Parliament including 83 nominated Maoist MPs and secured a UN Security Council Resolution providing for a UN Mission to monitor weapons and combatants and provide technical assistance to the election process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_173"><a name="70312w0019.htm_para4"><a name="07031242000704">However, the process remains fragile and will require commitment from all parties as well as the support of the international community to continue to make progress towards free and fair elections to a constituent assembly in June.</p>

 Under the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) of November 2006, the Maoists agreed that their People&#146;s Liberation Army (PLA) would be confined to seven main cantonment sites, spread across Nepal, while the Nepal army would be confined to barracks. Maoist weapons would be stored in sealed containers, to which they would keep the keys, but the UN would monitor the integrity of the containers and the confinement of combatants to the camps. Maoists moved the PLA and their weapons to the proposed cantonment sites almost immediately and the UN has moved quickly to complete the registration of combatants and storage of weapons.</p>

 The CAVR Commission for Truth and Reconciliation was appointed by the then UN Transitional Administration in East Timor at the urging of the National Council of Timorese resistence, a representative East Timorese political body. Its report was delivered to East Timorese President Gusmao in October 2005, who subsequently presented its findings to the Timorese Parliament. The report has not yet been discussed by the East Timorese Parliament. However, in addressing the UN Security Council on  23 January 2006 President Gusmao expressed caution about the recommendations contained in the report, noting the need to achieve restorative justice rather than punitive justice and warning of the need to consolidate democracy in East Timor and Indonesia. In the absence of further interventions by the East Timorese Government and Parliament, we do not believe it will serve the interests of the people of East Timor for the United Kingdom to call for the report to be placed on the agenda of the UN Security Council at this stage.</p>

They will all have compulsory criminal record checks, all be subject to the same complaints system and all have to hold a certificate issued by a county court judge.

 A justices&#146; clerk or legal adviser advises magistrates in all cases in which an application under section 6 of the Immigration Act 1971 is made. As qualified barristers or solicitors, they are fully trained and experienced in the research of legal issues. In giving advice, justices&#146; clerks and legal advisers have access to the statutory provisions and commentary on it, as well as Home Office circulars giving guidance. Because of the relative infrequency of such applications, however, there is no specific national training for legal advisers or magistrates on the topic, although some courts may provide specific local training.</p>

 The Department has made clear that ambulance clinicians are not expected to take all patients from 999 calls to accident and emergency departments.

In 2005-06, national health service ambulance trusts in England received 5.96 million 999 calls, and attended 4.77 million incidents. Of those incidents attended, 73 per cent. resulted in an emergency patient journey. Guidance was issued in 2002, 2004 and 2005 to this effect.</p>

 The role of national programme local service providers (LSPs) is to deliver information technology systems and services across the national health service within clusters of strategic health authorities, in London (BT), the south (Fujitsu), and the north, midlands and east (CSC). LSPs ensure the integration of existing local systems and, where necessary, implement new systems so that the national applications can be delivered locally, while maintaining common standards. All LSPs have contracted to develop and deliver a fully integrated NHS care record solution, and are in the process of doing so.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_266"><a name="70312w0029.htm_para0"><a name="07031247001810">Like all contracts, those between the Department and the LSPs provide for obligations and undertakings on either party. Among the key requirements which the contracts place on the LSPs are that functions and services are shown to work before they are bought. If providers do not deliver to their contractual obligations they are not paid. In this way the cost of non-delivery rests with the supplier, not the taxpayer. So, for example, we have retained extensive rights under the contracts to defer payments, receive compensation for missed milestones and, if necessary, terminate contracts, for failure to achieve required performance or deployment activity. We also reserve the right to consent to the appointment of key personnel of the prime contractor and material subcontractors, and have an interventionist approach to assurance including step-in rights or the appointment of a third party in certain critical circumstances if necessary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_267"><a name="70312w0029.htm_para1"><a name="07031247001811">These arrangements have been devised to secure an optimum balance between cost, risk, incentive and quality of outcome for the provision of the systems and services that we have specified for the benefit of patients, the NHS and taxpayers.</p>

 The Department for Work and Pensions was formed on 8 June 2001 from parts of the former Department of Social Security, the former Department for Education and Employment, and the Employment Service.

This work included new branding design, staff research and consultation, and the application of the logos to key items such as stationery, building signs and electronic media.

 It is for the trustees of the pension schemes to apply for assistance rather than individual members. Of 995 schemes that have been notified to FAS, 659 have subsequently qualified. &#145;Notification&#146; of a scheme occurs when trustees or members formally notify FAS of their scheme&#146;s basic details, after which a scheme can then be considered for FAS qualification. We estimate that 40,000 members of qualified schemes will be eligible for FAS. The vast majority of these potential recipients have yet to reach payment age and our best estimate is that perhaps 9,000 people are already 65.</p>

 There is a strong relationship between on-flows and off-flows from incapacity benefit, and generally, both have been falling year on year as a proportion of the caseload. So falling off-flows are a result of falling on-flows.</p>

 Forecasts of incapacity benefits are constructed by extending historic patterns in benefit on-flows and off-flows into the future. Events such as entering the benefit, moving between rates, gaining additional entitlements and leaving the benefit are simulated on the basis past trends examined by age and gender.
