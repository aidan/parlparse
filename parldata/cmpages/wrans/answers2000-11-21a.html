<P>
<P>
<a name="01121w01.html_spnew1"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The Ministry of Defence is taking a number of steps designed to help those who participated as volunteers in trials at Porton Down. The Ministry of Defence is very grateful to all those whose participation in studies at Porton Down made possible the research to provide safe and effective protection for UK armed forces against chemical and biological weapons. Suggestions have been made that some Porton Down volunteers suffer unusual patterns of ill health because of their participation. The Ministry of Defence has seen no scientific evidence to support that belief, but takes such suggestions seriously. Therefore we are:
<P>

<a name="01121w01.html_para2"><P>

<P>
<a name="01121w01.html_spnew2"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 Some 20,000 volunteers, national servicemen and non-conscripts have taken part in vital research at Porton Down. A thorough investigation by Wiltshire police of the Porton Down volunteer programme from 1939 to 1989 is under way. There are no plans for a further independent investigation.

<a name="01121w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 I assume that the hon. Member is referring to the announcement I made on 18 May 2000 regarding an extension to attributable benefits available to members of the reserve forces. We are actively processing claims from known individuals who believe they have an entitlement and are taking measures to identify other individuals who may not be aware of my announcement. To allow the Ministry of Defence to make payments the new regulations must be in place; this has taken longer than anticipated but will be completed early in the new year. Payments will then be made shortly thereafter. In the meantime, the Ministry of Defence will write during the next month to individuals who have already made a claim, and advise them whether they qualify under the new regulations. Once the regulations are in place, new claims will in future be processed in the formal time frame of approximately 8-10 weeks.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what the cost is of the MOD accelerating the Army's Watchkeeper unmanned air vehicle reconnaissance project; when the research project will be completed; when the Army will have operational capability of Watchkeeper; and if he will make a statement.  [138975]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01121w01.html_spnew4"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 We do not expect the overall cost of the Watchkeeper Unmanned Aerial Vehicle capability to increase if it is advanced. We are currently considering, as part of our normal planning processes, whether there is scope to accommodate earlier expenditure within the Department's overall Equipment Programme.

<a name="01121w01.html_para9">Watchkeeper is in an assessment phase which is expected to last up to three years. Once this phase is complete a decision will be made on moving to production. On current plans this would lead to an In Service Date of 2008.

<P>
<P>
<a name="01121w01.html_spnew5"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The Royal Navy is very aware of its responsibility for the application of good environmental practices on the high seas. The RN takes into consideration known cetacean migration routes, breeding grounds and similar information when planning exercise activity. Instructions are then issued to ships, submarines and aircraft on actions to take to minimise impact or when encountering marine activity.

<P>
<P>
<a name="01121w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 Since 1995 UK submarines have made 29 visits to alongside Z berths outside of UK Naval Bases. In addition to the alongside Z berths, there are a number of mooring buoys that have Z berth status in Plymouth Sound, at Spithead, off the Isle of Skye, Loch Ewe, off Rothesay, and in Loth Goil and at Mare Harbour in the Falkland Islands. Submarines use these mooring buoys, sometimes for as little as an hour or two, to carry out crew transfers or to take on high priority spare parts, and detailed records are not kept of all such visits. To provide details of all movement between Z berths within UK Naval Bases could be provided only at disproportional cost.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what estimate he has made of the value of ultra-low sulphur petrol sold as unleaded petrol in the last 12 months; and if he will make a statement.  [138776]

<P>
<P>
<a name="01121w02.html_spnew2"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 Companies have been selling various different types of low sulphur fuel for some while; however, the agreement on a specific quality level for what is now regarded as ULSP was only set out on 24 March 2000. According to HM Customs and Excise data, around a third of petrol released for consumption in the UK is ULSP.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what recent discussions he has had with petrol companies on the impact on prices at the pump of <i>(a)</i> the proposed reduction in fuel duty and <i>(b)</i> reductions in the price of oil on the world market.  [139020]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01121w02.html_spnew3"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 The retail price of gasoline is set at the forecourts by competitive marketing between the petrol companies. The United Kingdom Petroleum Industry Association, which represents the major oil companies, has indicated that it expects that competitive pressure will result in the proposed reduction in fuel duty being passed on to consumers at the pump. The price of petrol at the pump is also influenced, in part, by the price of oil on the world market. World oil prices are now 8 per cent. below their October peak and, over the same period, wholesale gasoline prices have fallen by a similar amount.

<a name="01121w02.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Peter Bradley: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what assessment he has made of the difference in price of fuel in rural and urban filling stations; and if he will make a statement.  [139022]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01121w02.html_spnew4"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 The Department does not collect separate retail price data for rural and urban filling stations. Retail road fuel prices are a matter for individual companies to determine. Under UK competition law, it is the responsibility of the Director General of Fair Trading (DGFT) to investigate allegations of anti-competitive behaviour and possible abuses of market power. The DGFT can act if pricing levels are the result of anti-competitive behaviour but he has no powers to act in relation to prices as such.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what recent discussions he has had with petrol companies on the timing of the introduction of ultra-low sulphur fuel in rural and urban petrol filling stations.  [139021]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01121w02.html_spnew5"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 The rate at which ultra-low sulphur petrol (ULSP) can be made available is relative to the speed with which the whole supply chain from refinery to filling station can be switched over to the lower sulphur material. This will be achieved by dilution of the higher-sulphur product, and hence the sales of fuel relative to the size of storage at filling stations will determine the speed of changeover. In the slowest case this is unlikely to be greater than three months from the time of availability from the supply point. According to HM Customs and Excise data, ULSP currently constitutes around a third of petrol released for consumption in the UK. The proposed reduction in duty is conditional on there being nation-wide access to the fuel.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what plans he has to make the clocking of motor vehicle odometers a criminal offence.  [138808]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01121w02.html_spnew8"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 It is not a criminal offence to alter the mileage shown on an odometer where this is done for legitimate reasons--such as mileage correction where a new odometer has to be fitted to a vehicle. However it is an offence to sell or to offer for sale in the course of a business a vehicle with a false mileage reading. The key to stamping out illegal practice in this area is to provide prospective purchasers and enforcement authorities with more reliable information about the true mileage of second-hand vehicles. The Government intend to do this by making the recording of mileage on vehicle registration documents and on vehicle licence applications mandatory and by introducing a system for recording vehicle mileage during MoT tests. This will complement an industry initiative to record mileage at the time that vehicles are serviced.

<P>
<a name="01121w02.html_spnew10"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The 1988 Control of Misleading Advertisements Regulations and the 1968 Trade Descriptions Act already apply to internet advertising in the same way that they apply to other forms of advertising.

the internet and the Director General of Fair Trading can seek an injunction to prevent the continued publication of a misleading advertisement on the internet. The Advertising Standards Authority is also able to rule on complaints about internet advertisements, and the Committee of Advertising Practice--the industry body which writes the British Codes of Advertising Practice and Sales Promotion--recently launched its admark scheme which will enable browsers to identify advertisements placed by advertisers who have agreed to comply with the Codes of Practice and to be bound by the ASA's rulings.

 In May I circulated a consultation document concerning the issue of dismissals by British Coal in the course of the 1984-85 miners dispute. In the absence of evidence that dismissed men had been deprived of any pension rights to which they had been entitled prior to their dismissal, the document made proposals aimed at addressing injustices which might have occurred at that time while endeavouring not to re-open old wounds or create new anomalies.

We recently approved a seven-year programme which includes a teacher education component training 6,000 new teachers per year; though, because of high attrition rates (particularly through HIV/AIDS), it will take several years to reach the target. Malawi is also exploring the scope for increased efficiency through ideas such as multi-grade teaching.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what consideration he gave to calling in the planning application made by Northumberland County Council to itself for the relocation of the Lyneburn travellers site, Lynemouth, Northumberland, to Lyneburn Cottage, Lynemouth; and what plans he has to seek the revocation of planning permission for this development.  [138818]<P>

<a name="01121w04.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The Northumberland County Council's Planning and Regulation Committee have determined an application by their Environment Directorate on 5 September 2000 for the development of an 11 pitch gypsy site at Lyneburn Cottage, Lynemouth. However, the application and local concerns about it did not come to the attention of the Government Office for the North East until shortly after that date. It was thus too late for the Secretary of State to consider whether or not to intervene by calling-in the application for his own determination.

<P>

<a name="01121w04.html_para1">The Government Office has since had correspondence with three local parish councils on the subject. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State is in general reluctant to intervene in matters for which a local planning authority is properly responsible, unless they raise issues of more than local importance. His policy continues to be very selective about the applications he would call-in for his determination. My predecessor gave examples of such cases to the House in a written answer on 16 June 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column 138W, which is now included as Annex 5 to the recent DETR Circular 5/2000.
<P>

<a name="01121w04.html_para2">As the right hon. Member is aware from a previous case, with which I know he is very familiar, the Secretary of State would also not wish to intervene once a local decision has been taken unless the issues raised were of national importance. An example would be where the authority's decision appeared to be grossly wrong. Although I understand some local concerns about cases where a local planning authority is determining a planning application from another part of the council, this is common practice and is subject to strict regulations and rules of propriety. From the information currently available, this case does not appear to be one in which the Secretary of State should be seeking revocation of the planning permission that the county council has granted.

 The Environment Agency expects to publish their report on oxygenate occurrence later this week. I have deposited an advance copy in the Library of the House. The report was carried out to review the presence and behaviour of MTBE in England and Wales. It does not contain a definitive list of all sites where MTBE has been detected in groundwater, but provides supporting statistics and tables, and concludes that current usage does not pose a major threat to public water supplies.
<P>

<a name="01121w05.html_para8">Finland is to resubmit the draft risk assessment for further discussion by EU technical experts in December 2000 and for consideration by the EU Competent Authorities for existing substances in February 2000.

The draft conclusions do not indicate any significant risk of adverse effects for human health or the environment from current levels of exposure to MTBE; but there is concern about the implications of taste and odour of MTBE at low levels.

<P>
<P>
<a name="01121w06.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 The Franchising Director regulates fare increases through the franchise agreements he has with train operating companies. Train operators are not allowed to increase key fares by more than RPI-1 per cent. annually. This includes all saver tickets (or unrestricted Standard Returns where no Saver exists) and standard Weekly Season tickets. Further controls apply to London commuter fares, where the cap can be adjusted by &#177;2 per cent. depending upon performance. The Rail Regulator does have powers under the Competition Act 1998 to investigate train operators where he has reasonable grounds to believe that they are charging excessive prices.

 Franchise agreements stipulate that saver tickets need not be valid before 1030 on weekdays, nor for any journey beginning between 1500 and 1900 on certain flows from London, in line with the restrictions which existed under British Rail. It is a matter for train operating companies to decide whether or not to offer saver tickets in peak hours.

 Renovation grants, which are given at the discretion of local authorities, are calculated on the basis of the cost of the relevant works and the amount the applicant can afford to contribute. They have no upper limit. There is a limit of &#163;20,000 for disabled facilities grants, which are mandatory, but local authorities have discretion to pay more. Home repair assistance, which is available for smaller works, is limited to &#163;2,000 per grant.
<P>

<a name="01121w06.html_para0">Residents of park homes are eligible for renovation grants, home repair assistance and disabled facilities grants if they meet the other criteria for the grants. The grants are available to both owners and tenants but, for a renovation grant or disabled facilities grant, the owner of the dwelling must also own the land on which it is stationed. Where a grant is not available, the local authority has the option of assisting in other ways, for example by offering a tenancy in its own housing or nomination to a registered social landlord.

<P>
<P>
<a name="01121w07.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 The 'sum of sectors' policy, which was agreed by the UK and the US in 1978, covers transatlantic air fares for journeys which include one or more additional domestic sectors. It provides that the total fare must be no lower than the sum of the published fares for all the sectors flown on that journey. The policy was adopted to reduce the advantage that US airlines enjoy as a result of the exclusion of UK carriers from the US domestic market. Such an advantage, if it had been allowed to persist, could have resulted in even more passengers connecting at US gateways being channelled onto US carriers for the transatlantic sector.
<P>

<a name="01121w07.html_para1">In October, British Midland sought to offer promotional fares from UK regional points to the US via Manchester which breached the sum of sectors policy. These fares were automatically disallowed by the CAA. However, following advice from the CAA, we decided that the operation of this 22-year-old policy needed to be reassessed. In particular, he wished to be satisfied that the right balance existed between the need to protect UK carriers from unfair competition and the need to promote healthy competition which would bring benefits to consumers and to the regions.
<P>

<a name="01121w07.html_para2">We have concluded that the policy should no longer be applied to transatlantic journeys serving UK regional points. Such a change of policy would mean that journeys from a range of 'behind' points to points in the US via 



<P>
<P><I>21 Nov 2000 : Column: 123W</I><P>
regional UK gateways would no longer need to cost the sum of the fares of the two individual sectors. The effect will be to encourage keener competition on transatlantic routes to and from UK regional points, with the prospect of lower transatlantic fares and commensurate benefits for the regions.
<P>

<a name="01121w07.html_para3">In arriving at this conclusion, we have had regard to the advice of the CAA, the industry and those hon. Members who have written to us on the subject. Whereas we recognise that there is no consensus, we are satisfied that the consumer benefits are sufficient to warrant this change in policy.
<P>

<a name="01121w07.html_para4">My right hon. and noble Friend the Minister for Transport has therefore written today to Rodney Slater, the US Secretary for Transportation, commending this policy change to him.
<P>

<a name="01121w07.html_para5">Given the potential consumer benefits and the even-handed application of the policy as between UK and US carriers, and while the US is considering our proposal, we have asked the CAA not to intervene on tariff filings by carriers of either side for services to UK regional points if they contravene the 'sum of sectors' policy.

<P>
<a name="01121w07.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Rammell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions when he plans to make an announcement on the arrangements for transitional measures for negative subsidy authorities; and if he will make a statement on the impact of these measures on Harlow.  [139837]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01121w07.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 "Negative subsidy" authorities are those that have been transferring resources from their Housing Revenue Account (HRA) to their general fund under section 80(2) of the Local Government and Housing Act 1989 ("LGHA 1989"). From April 2001, when the Major Repairs Allowance (MRA) is paid for the first time, these authorities will generally make a much smaller transfer, as they will be eligible for more HRA subsidy than without the MRA, and in many cases the transfer will end.
<P>

<a name="01121w07.html_para6">Authorities have a number of options to compensate for the reduction in the transfer from their HRA: in principle they could reduce the cost of services charged to their general fund, or fund them in the short term from reserves, or increase their council tax. It is a matter for the authority concerned as to how it adapts to this change in the income of their general fund. However, as I announced earlier this year, we intended to provide transitional measures for these authorities to allow them time to adjust to their new financial position. We sought views on the form for these transitional measures in a consultation paper "A New Financial Framework for Local Authority Housing: Resource Accounting in the Housing Revenue Account, Transitional Measures for 'Negative Subsidy' Authorities" issued in August 2000. We have given careful consideration to the responses received.
<P>

<a name="01121w07.html_para7">We do not intend that authorities should be forced to make transfers from their HRA to their general fund under the transitional measures. We take the view that it is a matter for local decision as to whether to leave resources in the HRA, where they can be used to support the housing service, or to transfer them under the transitional measures to the general fund to support other services. An 



<P>
<P><I>21 Nov 2000 : Column: 124W</I><P>
authority will be free to adopt a different policy on applying for transitional measures in each year for which measures are available, if it so chooses.
<P>

<a name="01121w07.html_para8">We intend to provide transitional measures that will allow authorities that were in "negative subsidy" in the financial year 1999-2000, for a period of no more than 10 years, to transfer extra resources from their HRA to their general fund in addition to any transfer required by section 80(2). There will be an upper limit as to the amount that can be transferred in each year during that period, in addition to any transfer under section 80(2). Authorities wishing to take advantage of these transitional measures will need to apply each year to the Secretary of State for a special determination to allow a transfer under the terms of the transitional measures.
<P>

<a name="01121w07.html_para9">We would expect to give that approval for transfers, other than any transfers under section 80(2), and make the special determinations at any time after the making of the HRA subsidy determination for the financial year in question but before the final decision under section 80A of the LGHA 1989 as to the amount of HRA subsidy payable for that financial year. We will, of course, consider representations from authorities as to the amount to be transferred in respect of any financial year. But, other than in very exceptional circumstances, we expect to adopt the following approach to calculate the maximum amount an authority may transfer each year.
<P>

<a name="01121w07.html_para10">The maximum period for any authority for which transitional measures will be available will be 10 years. Transitional measures will be available to many authorities only for a shorter period. The first year in which authorities can benefit from these transitional measures will be 2001-02.
<P>

<a name="01121w07.html_para11">The maximum amount that an authority will be allowed to transfer each year under the transitional measures will depend on a 'base amount' for each authority, and will be reduced year by year, by a fixed step reduction, from this 'base amount'.
<P>

<a name="01121w07.html_para12">The 'base amount' for each authority will be equal to the amount of the transfer under section 80(2) from their HRA to their general fund in respect of financial year 1999-2000. The step reduction in the amount of the maximum transfer under transitional measures for each authority will be the larger of:

<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>either an amount equal to the additional amount that would be raised from an increase of &#163;10 in Band D council tax (and equivalent increases in the other Bands) based on the authority's council tax base for 1999-2000;

</FONT></UL>
<a name="01121w07.html_para14"><P>

<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="01121w07.html_para15">The maximum amount any authority could apply to transfer under the transitional measures in 2001-02 will be the 'base amount' less one step reduction, less any transfer the authority will make under section 80(2). The maximum amount in year two will be the 'base amount' less two step reductions, less any transfer under section 80(2), and so on. In each year an authority must also make any transfer required under section 80(2).
<P>

<a name="01121w07.html_para16">Where an authority which makes a transfer under the transitional measures in year one, makes no such transfer in year two, and in year three applies to make a further transfer, the maximum amount the authority will be 



<P>
<P><I>21 Nov 2000 : Column: 125W</I><P>
allowed to transfer in year three will be the 'base amount', less any transfer under section 80(2), less the three step reductions.
<P>

<a name="01121w07.html_para17">Calculations are based on the position in 1999-2000 as that is the latest year for which audited data will be available in the immediate future.
<P>

<a name="01121w07.html_para18">The amount of the maximum transfer the authority could apply to make under transitional measures, and period of the transitional measures may be reduced if there is a significant improvement in an authority's financial position, in respect of either their HRA or their general fund, as a result of some other factor, or if the size of the authority's stock changes by 10 per cent. or 3,000 properties from their 1999-2000 figure. In any event, we would not expect to agree to transitional measures, in addition to any section 80(2) transfer, if their effect would be to increase the total transfer from the HRA to the general fund above a limit calculated as the amount of the transfer in 1999-2000 less the annual step reductions for that authority.
<P>

<a name="01121w07.html_para19">In due course, and subject to parliamentary approval, we intend to repeal section 80(2) and end the requirement in statute to make such transfers from the HRA to the general fund. Until then section 80(2) will continue to apply and will determine the minimum size of any transfer.
<P>

<a name="01121w07.html_para20">We do not yet have audited accounts for Harlow so there will remain some uncertainty at the margin as to the effect of the transitional measures until the figures are confirmed. However we expect that:
<P>

<a name="01121w07.html_para21">Harlow will be allocated an MRA of &#163;6.6 million in 2001-02 and equivalent amounts will continue to be allocated in subsequent years, subject to retaining stock at the current level.
<P>

<a name="01121w07.html_para22">In 1999-2000 Harlow transferred about &#163;3.5 million from their HRA to their general fund. In the absence of transitional measures that transfer would cease from April 2001 and Harlow would (in the absence of other changes to the subsidy system) also have retained about &#163;2.8 million of new resources in their HRA.
<P>

<a name="01121w07.html_para23">Harlow will benefit from transitional measures for 10 years and so can continue to make a transfer for that period under the measures from their HRA to their general fund.
<P>

<a name="01121w07.html_para24">Their annual step reduction in the transfer would be about &#163;350,000. That is equal to the additional amount that would be raised from an increase of about &#163;12-&#163;14 in Band D council tax based on their council tax base for 1999-2000.

<P>
<P>
<a name="01121w08.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The Government are proposing to make two changes and have laid before Parliament the draft "Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) (Amendment) (England and Wales) Regulations 2000" which are subject to the affirmative resolution procedure.
<P>

<a name="01121w08.html_para0">The first targets to be met under the EC Directive on Packaging and Packaging Waste fall due in 2001. The recovery and recycling obligations placed on producers under the Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) Regulations ('the Regulations') are to enable the UK to meet its obligations under the Packaging Waste Directive, in particular, to meet the recovery and recycling targets--that is at least 50 per cent. of packaging waste to be recovered, at least 25 per cent. recycled and 15 per cent. of each packaging material recycled.
<P>

<a name="01121w08.html_para1">The recovery carried out in the first three quarters of this year suggests that we are on course to make further progress in 2000 towards the directive targets and I am placing a copy of a "Note on 2000 Packaging Data" in the Library of the House.
<P>

<a name="01121w08.html_para2">The Government published a consultation paper in August 2000 on targets for 2001 and proposed, on the basis of the data available at the time, and taking account of estimates for the additional tonnages which were expected to be obligated in 2001, that there should be a recovery target of 58 per cent. and a material-specific recycling target of 18 per cent. for each material.
<P>

<a name="01121w08.html_para3">However, because there are now more recent data available from industry, my Department has reviewed all the figures that were used to inform the development of the targets in the consultation paper. The revised figures suggest that a recovery target of 56 per cent., together with a material-specific recycling target of 18 per cent., would allow the UK to discharge its targets under the Packaging Waste Directive, and these are the targets which I am proposing, subject to parliamentary approval. These targets are expected to achieve recovery of 51 per cent. against the 50 per cent. target. We estimate that a cushion of 1 per cent. (which is around 96,000 tonnes) should be sufficient, provided that the underlying data and assumptions are broadly correct. I think it is only prudent to provide a small safety margin to allow for error in the Department's assessment of the additional tonnages which have to be brought within the scope of obligated packaging by 2001 and also to take account of the possibility that the tonnage reported by the smaller businesses (with turnover between &#163;2 million and &#163;5 million) who were obligated for the first time this year may decrease in their second year of obligation, as their figures improve, as was the case with the data provided by the larger (turnover over &#163;5 million) businesses in their second year of obligation.




<P>
<P><I>21 Nov 2000 : Column: 127W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="01121w08.html_para4">The national targets for next year need to be seen as leading on to higher targets and they need to be high enough to sustain a tighter PRN market and avoid a repeat of the imbalance between supply and demand of reprocessing capacity that has recently prevailed.
<P>

<a name="01121w08.html_para5">In the responses to the consultation paper on targets for 2001 a number of comments were made about the UK system. I will be discussing these with the Advisory Committee on Packaging and will be considering with them what issues need to be looked at once the targets for 2001 have been met and once we know the outcome of the review of the packaging directive next year.
<P>

<a name="01121w08.html_para6">The Government is also proposing to change the mechanism according to which the registration fee paid each year by members of compliance schemes is determined. I am proposing to replace the previous sliding-scale system with a flat fee of &#163;460 per scheme member per year, regardless of the size of the compliance scheme. The flat fee more accurately reflects the enforcing authorities' monitoring costs and takes account of concerns about a system that was perceived by most compliance schemes to be unfair and anti-competitive. I believe that a registration fee based on an equal-for-all principle will provide for competition between schemes on the grounds of their performance and operational efficiency, rather than on the grounds of a regulatory fee differential.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what proposals he has to reform legislation on business tenancies.  [139901]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01121w08.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 We propose shortly to consult on use of the order-making procedure in the draft Regulatory Reform Bill to implement a number of detailed improvements to the workings of business tenancies legislation.
<P>

<a name="01121w08.html_para7">Part II of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1954 gives business tenants, in most circumstances, a statutory right to renew their leases. We do not propose to change this, but we wish to improve the workings of the Act to ensure that it operates more efficiently in the interests of both landlords and tenants. Many of our proposals stem from the Law Commission's 1992 review of the workings of the Act.
<P>

<a name="01121w08.html_para8">Among the proposals are changes in the arrangements under which parties may mutually agree to exclude security of tenure before the lease comes into effect. The Law Commission considered that the present procedure of applying to the court serves little purpose, and we are instead proposing that in most cases tenants should receive advance notice with a "health warning" drawing attention to the implications of excluding security of tenure. The tenant would have time to take professional advice and consider alternative arrangements.
<P>

<a name="01121w08.html_para9">Our proposals would also streamline the renewal process, making it simpler and quicker for tenants to renew their leases. They would remove traps for tenants, generally making the system fairer between the parties. Tenants as well as landlords would be able to apply for 



<P>
<P><I>21 Nov 2000 : Column: 128W</I><P>
interim rent, pending settlement on the rent for the new tenancy; while the method for determining interim rent would be fairer.
<P>

<a name="01121w08.html_para10">We are also about to issue a consultation paper on section 57 of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1954. This enables certain landlords of business premises who are in the public sector or who are public sector providers to apply to central Government for certificates which they can then use to circumvent or curtail the renewal of a business tenancy. The consultation paper seeks views on a change of policy by my Department in considering applications for certificates, and on options for repeal bearing in mind the facility for parties to agree to exclude security of tenure from business leases.
<P>

<a name="01121w08.html_para11">Both the Deregulation Committee here and the Delegated Powers and Deregulation Committee in the Lords have approved the principle of advance consultation on prospective use of the powers in the Regulatory Reform Bill.

Large scale civil engineering projects such as the reconstruction of further bridges at Novi Sad will be considered within the context of the medium term investment required for infrastructure in Serbia. The International Financial Institutions and private sector investors are likely to play important roles in this regard.

 While the number and value of oil for food contracts placed on hold by the UN Iraq Sanctions Committee changes daily, in early November the value of contracts placed on hold was about $2.2 billion, of which $0.3 billion of contracts were on hold at UK request. At the same time, Iraqi bureaucracy was reported to be holding back the delivery of $1.1 billion worth of goods already approved by the Sanctions Committee. Where we place holds on contracts we do so mostly temporarily, because of concerns about the goods possible use in Iraq's Weapons of Mass Destruction programmes or because of a lack of (often basic) information about goods which might be of concern.
<P>

<a name="01121w09.html_para4">Since the oil for food programme began in December 1996, almost $16 billion worth of contracts have been approved, including $8.1 billion of food, $1.4 billion of health and $1.1 billion of oil spare parts. Through Security Council resolutions we have introduced a fast-track system for contracts in key humanitarian and infrastructure sectors. To date more than $2 billion worth of goods have been processed in this way.

 Our consultation document "The European Social Fund: proposals for co-financing in England" proposes that Government Offices should be able to start channelling ESF money through co-financing organisations (CFOs) from 1 September 2001 onwards, once the latter are ready to start operating as CFOs. We shall consider carefully partners' views on that proposal before publishing a firm timetable.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what estimate he has made of the effects of co-financing organisations on the distribution of ESGF Objective 3 grants to small specialist training providers.  [139128]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01121w10.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 The Objective 3 operational programme for 2000-06 sets out the planned spending by policy field and the indicative financial allocations for each measure. The introduction of co-financing will not affect those spending plans or indicative allocations. We expect that voluntary and community-sector providers will often be well placed to secure ESF money, because they are close to local communities and able to deliver innovative programmes. We expect co-financing to be of great benefit to all providers, and especially those in the voluntary and community sectors.

<P>
<P>
<a name="01121w10.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 We do not envisage that co-financing organisations (CFOs) will take over all that administration. Rather, our consultation document "The European Social Fund: proposals for co-financing in England" proposes that prospective CFOs would apply to the Government Office and regional Programme Monitoring Committee for ESF funding. Such applications would be assessed in line with criteria that the Government Office would set out. CFOs would channel both ESF money and the required match funding to providers in a single funding stream. We are seeking the views of partner organisations on how CFOs might best carry out that role.

 The consultation document "The European Social Fund: proposals for co-financing in England" proposes criteria that Government Offices and regional Programme Monitoring Committees would use to decide whether a body should become a co-financing organisation (CFO). The criteria will need to be fair and clear, to remain appropriate over time, and to promote consistency in decision-making within and between regions. We shall consider partners' views on the proposed criteria carefully.

<P>
<a name="01121w11.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 We have considered the BSE Inquiry findings in this area, none of which indicate that there is any need to reconsider the safety of the BSE carcases which were buried between 1988 and 1991.
<P>

<a name="01121w11.html_para0">No BSE suspects have been disposed of by landfilling since 1991 when sufficient carcase incineration capacity came on stream to process the number of cases arising at that time.
<P>

<a name="01121w11.html_para1">The Environment Agency has regulatory responsibility for supervising the safe operation of landfill sites. The Agency monitors ground water quality in the vicinity of licensed landfill sites as a check for any leachate contamination. Following their assumption of responsibility in this area in 1996, the Agency carried out detailed assessments of all the sites concerned, and a quantitative assessment to be typical of those sites that appeared to be most vulnerable. The results showed potential risks from the landfilling that took place to be extremely low.
<P>

<a name="01121w11.html_para2">SEAC had previously advised that in relation to landfill sites where BSE suspects were buried it was unlikely that leachate would pose a significant problem, but that such sites should be appropriately engineered and managed to minimise leachate migration.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what action was taken to retain water running off the mountains and hills near the source of the River Severn above the main settlements on that river.  [138558]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01121w11.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 16 November 2000]:</i> At present, the only way of retaining water running off the mountains near the source of the river Severn is by utilising the storage capacity in Clywedog Reservoir, situated near Llanidloes.
<P>

<a name="01121w11.html_para3">The reservoir is managed by the Environment Agency and is principally for regulating flows in the River Severn. There are statutory controls which require the lowering of water levels to reduce the risk of flooding locally. However, the geographic location of the reservoir means that any flood protection benefit of retaining water is limited to settlements close to the reservoir. There are little or no similar benefits to other settlements further downstream.
<P>

<a name="01121w11.html_para4">I understand that, prior to the flooding in October and in common with practice over recent years, the Agency managed water levels in the reservoir so that they were below that which is statutorily required, so helping to maximise its storage potential. Given the very large flows of water run off from recent exceptional weather, options to retain it are very limited.

<P>
<P>
<a name="01121w11.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 16 November 2000]:</i> The Government's aim is to alleviate the risk of flooding. It is not possible always to guarantee full protection. Once the flood waters have subsided enough for them to assess the situation fully, the Environment Agency will be able to estimate the cost of necessary and justifiable flood alleviation schemes.

 The estimated cost of providing free television licences for everyone aged 70 years or over is &#163;529 million a year, and providing free television licences for everyone aged 65 years or over would cost an estimated &#163;714 million a year, excluding administrative costs in both cases. Estimating the cost of providing free licences only to people who are retired is subject to the difficulty of defining who is "retired". For example, someone may have retired from their main occupation but may still be in employment, such as part-time work. The costs have therefore been estimated for all people in the relevant age groups, irrespective of their employment status.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport how many pensioners will benefit from free television licences <i>(a)</i> nationally and <i>(b)</i> in Coventry South in 2000.  [139080]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01121w12.html_spnew2"><B> Janet Anderson: </B> 
 Television licences cover households rather than individuals. The estimated number of households in the United Kingdom currently entitled to the free television licence for the over-75s is 3.6 million. 2.8 million applications have been received to date. In addition, approximately 500,000 eligible households are beneficiaries of the &#163;5 Accommodation for Residential Care scheme and will benefit from the free licence when their current licence is renewed. TV Licensing, which administers this concession for the BBC as Licensing Authority, is not able to provide geographical breakdowns of the number of free licences issued. However, estimates of the over-75 population based on the 1991 Census indicate that there were approximately 6,400 people aged 75 or over in the Coventry, South constituency.

[139062]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01121w12.html_spnew3"><B> Janet Anderson: </B> 
 Yes. The directions issued by the Secretary of State to introduce this concession have the effect that on the issue or renewal of an Accommodation for Residential Care licence, no fee will be payable in respect of residents who are aged 75 or over.

 Earlier this year the Minister for Sport and I presided over the launch of the British Tourist Authority's sports tourism strategy. This strategy sets out how the BTA will work with key partners such as Sport England to attract overseas visitors to the UK to participate in and to watch sport. The BTA has since taken forward a number of initiatives, including the launch of a new sports tourism website as part of its participation in the important international World Travel Market Exhibition at Earl's Court earlier this month. In addition, the BTA is due to launch its new UK sports tourism map in Paris in January 2001.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what progress has been made since December 1999 towards a unified accommodation grading scheme for the whole of the UK.  [139268]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01121w12.html_spnew7"><B> Janet Anderson: </B> 
 Responsibility for tourism policy, including accommodation grading, in the other countries of the United Kingdom now rests with the devolved Administrations. In England a number of new voluntary schemes have been successfully introduced over the last 15 months following extensive research into visitor expectations. Our key priority is to ensure that these schemes, which cover hotels and guest accommodation, holiday parks and self-catering accommodation, make a noticeable impact on increasing accommodation quality.
<P>

<a name="01121w12.html_para1">Since December 1999, we have not made any significant progress towards a unified accommodation grading scheme for the whole of the UK. The hotels and guest accommodation scheme applies across the UK for establishments inspected by the AA and RAC, which inspect to exactly the same standards as the English Tourism Council in England--the other national tourist boards each operate different schemes and in Northern Ireland tourism accommodation is subject to statutory regulation (but voluntary classification). The holiday parks scheme was jointly developed by all four countries and has identical standards across the UK and so represents some progress towards a unified approach. The self-catering scheme in England is also broadly similar to those in Scotland and Wales.

 Under the United Kingdom's arrangements for broadcasting, it is the responsibility of the broadcasting regulators and broadcasters to set and enforce standards. In doing so, they maintain guidelines for programme makers on the standards to be observed. This guidance draws on research into public attitudes and includes advice on the portrayal of sex and violence in programmes. The future of the regulation of electronic communications, including broadcasting, is being considered in a White Paper to be published later this year.

<a name="01121w14.html_wqn0"><B> Miss Widdecombe: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, pursuant to his answer of 24 October 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 115W, what account he took of <i>(a)</i> the types of criminal offence mentioned by the right hon. Member for Maidstone and the Weald, of 24 May 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 977-78, and <i>(b)</i> the criminal offence of possessing child pornography under section 160 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 in making his decision on amendments to the immigration rules concerned with refusing entry to those convicted of certain criminal offences; what plans he has to refuse entry to persons convicted of the offences mentioned in <i>(a)</i> and <i>(b)</i> above; and if he will make a statement.  [136152]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01121w14.html_spnew0"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 Passengers with convictions for paedophilia, dealing in child pornography and Class C drugs are naturally of concern. Under United Kingdom law, the maximum sentence for these offences is less than 10 years, which may lead to concern that such offences do not appear to be covered by the proposed amendments to Immigration Rule 320(18). But if there is reason to consider that any passenger who has such a conviction is a risk to public safety, they can be refused under Rule 320(19) on the grounds that, in the light of their character, conduct or associations, their exclusion from the United Kingdom is conducive to the public good. All cases are considered on individual merit, in the light of all relevant factors prevalent at the time.
<P>

<a name="01121w14.html_para0">The purpose of the Government's proposed changes to Rule 320(18) is to strengthen the provision by ensuring that it is more consistently and effectively applied. At present, travellers to the United Kingdom are not routinely questioned about criminal convictions, so refusal under Rule 320(18) is currently unlikely, despite the apparently low threshold for offences to which it applies.
<P>

<a name="01121w14.html_para1">Our proposals will require all travellers to declare any convictions for which they have been imprisoned. No threshold will be specified for offences which should be declared.
<P>

<a name="01121w14.html_para2">In order to provide clear, workable guidelines for officers working in the pressurised environment of the immigration control, and to focus the power on those offences of most concern to the public, we will apply the mandatory requirement to refuse entry under Rule 320(18) to those offences of most concern to the public. That is why we propose a threshold of offences punishable by a maximum of 10 years imprisonment, or more, or any offences involving violence, violent sexual behaviour or 



<P>
<P><I>21 Nov 2000 : Column: 149W</I><P>
firearms. The current threshold of 12 months covers a very wide range of offences for which a first-time offender may not even receive a custodial sentence. Mandatory refusal could not be justified in all such cases. We believe that it is essential to strike a careful balance between public safety and the need to avoid delays at ports and airports.

<P>
<P>
<a name="01121w14.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 The number of legal advisers currently employed in the Home Office Legal Adviser's Branch is 36 (three of whom work part-time). A team of two lawyers advises on matters relating to animals in addition to advising on other subjects.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, pursuant to his answer of 17 April 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 380W, on animal experiments, if he will provide a breakdown of the total yearly Government expenditure on research into alternative methods that do not involve animals, stating <i>(a)</i> which departments (i) carry out and (ii) sponsor such research, <i>(b)</i> how much is spent by each and <i>(c)</i> the type of animal research for which alternatives are sought; and if he will make a statement.  [138991]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01121w14.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 Further to my previous answer of 17 April 2000, <i>Official Report,</i> column 379W, I repeat that most of the work done on alternatives is neither done by the Government nor with Government money. The budget the Home Office makes available to the Animal Procedures Committee for research into alternatives has, none the less, risen to &#163;265,000 for 2000-01. By "alternatives", we are referring to the development and promotion of alternatives which (1) replace animal use, (2) reduce the number of animals used or (3) refine the procedures involved to minimise suffering (3Rs).
<P>

<a name="01121w14.html_para3">This money is not the only money spent by Government Departments on alternatives. For example, the Health and Safety Executive, the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council and the Medical Research Council have, in the past year, been very active in taking initiatives in this area.
<P>

<a name="01121w14.html_para4">Last year, the Home Office asked the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions, the Department of Trade and Industry, the Ministry of Defence, the Department of Health, the Scottish Office, the Welsh Office and the Northern Ireland Office for an indication of the level of each Department's funding of alternatives. It was very difficult for these Departments to specify exactly how much they spent on alternative research because:
<P>

<a name="01121w14.html_para5"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>they could not identify all such work that is sponsored, which would involve extensive reviews of thousands of different projects; and
<P>
<BR>
many programmes of work which are not specifically intended for developing alternatives do, nevertheless, result in that development, by design or chance.

<a name="01121w14.html_para6">The amount spent does not relate to annual set allocations of funds, as provided for the Animal Procedures Committee. The Home Office was, however, provided with an estimated figure, totalling over &#163;2 million, for the yearly expenditure across Government for research into alternatives.
<P>

<a name="01121w14.html_para7">I work closely with other Government Departments to ensure the rigorous application of the 3Rs. Additionally, the cross-Whitehall concordat on data sharing should enable Government Departments to reduce the duplication of tests on animals.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what discussions he has had with EU ministers regarding the welfare of animals in the EU, with particular regard to tests carried out on animals; and if he will make a statement.  [139407]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01121w14.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The Home Office plays an active part in meetings of the European Union National Competent Authorities responsible for the implementation of Directive 86/609/EEC, which relates to the approximation of laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the member states regarding the protection of animals used for experimental and other scientific purposes. We take a lead in formulating European policies, standards and targets for animal care and use that platform to promote a wider influence outside Europe.
<P>

<a name="01121w14.html_para8">The United Kingdom Government will continue to support the European Centre for the Validation of Alternative Methods (ECVAM) through contributions to the European Union. It is their task to commission, monitor and co-ordinate research into alternatives and to develop the processes of validation--that is, the assessment of alternative methods to see whether they are reliable and whether they produce a level of information similar to the animal based tests they are to replace.

<P>
<P>
<a name="01121w15.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The Prison Service seeks to ensure that its offending behaviour programmes are effective by designing them in line with extensive research on what works in preventing re-offending, and by inviting an independent panel, established for the purpose, to accredit them as conforming to the lessons drawn from that research. The Sex Offender Treatment Programmes run at Usk are so accredited.
<P>

<a name="01121w15.html_para4">All prisons offering the Prison Service's Sex Offender Treatment Programme are audited annually on the effectiveness of their delivery, because research suggests that effective delivery is a crucial factor in reducing reconvictions. Usk prison and six other establishments were awarded a score of 95 out of 100 in the 1999-2000 audit, the highest achieved among the 23 establishments running the programme. This reflects the consistently high quality treatment delivered by a well motivated team at Usk.
<P>

<a name="01121w15.html_para5">The Prison Service monitors against control groups the reconviction data on those who have undergone such programmes. More data, however, are needed before firm conclusions can be drawn about the overall effectiveness of Sex Offender Treatment Programmes, such as those run at Usk.

 Apart from any military training offered by the Ministry of Defence, for example for the Territorial Army and other reserve forces and for Cadet forces, the Government do not generally sponsor training for gun owners. The safe and responsible use of firearms by private individuals is a matter for the individual concerned who must satisfy the local police that he or she is fit to be entrusted with a firearms and can be permitted to possess it without danger to the public safety or the peace.

<a name="01121w15.html_para6">There are a number of means by which a private individual in the United Kingdom may obtain training in the handling and use of firearms which may involve some degree of Government endorsement or support.

<i>Note:</i><P>

Changes in the number of persons cautioned or found guilty for drunkenness offences including the variations between police force areas are likely to reflect changes or variations in police practice, as well as actual changes or variations in the level of drunkenness. To a large extent, they reflect changes in the Metropolitan police, which has fallen from 47 per cent. in 1990 to 4 per cent. in 1999 of the total England and Wales 'known offenders'. In 1995 the Metropolitan police introduced informal warnings for offences of drunkenness. <P>

Current Government initiatives supporting volunteering include: the Active Community Unit's Black and Minority Ethnic Twinning Initiative; the Home Office Older Volunteers Initiative; the National Database of Volunteering Opportunities; the Active Community Demonstration Projects; Timebank; the Community Channel and Millennium Volunteers. The United Nations Year of the Volunteer in 2001 will also focus attention on the contribution made by volunteers to their communities.

<P>

<a name="01121w16.html_para3">In 1988, the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD), the independent body which advises the Government on drug misuse matters, concluded that there was insufficient evidence of a social problem arising from the misuse of khat in the United Kingdom to justify bringing the plant under the controls of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971. However, the Home Office is currently collating updated information on the extent of its misuse and if this indicates that the situation has changed significantly the ACMD will be asked for fresh advice.

 General practitioners order their supply of flu vaccine direct from manufacturers. This year there are five suppliers of flu vaccine. Unfortunately one of the manufacturers, Solvay, has encountered problems in growing a strain of the vaccine which has led to delays in some deliveries. Solvay have been in touch with the affected GPs to tell them details of any delays, but have confirmed that all ordered vaccine will be delivered by the end of November, in time to protect people this winter.
<P>

<a name="01121w16.html_para7">Latest figures as at 8 November, show that 9.8 million doses of vaccine have already been distributed. This along with the amount of vaccine still to be delivered, is a sufficient amount to exceed our immunisation target of 60 per cent. uptake in those aged 65 and over, and to achieve a substantial rise in uptake among those at risk under 65.

 Advances in healthcare and changes to the practice of medicine, particularly the increasing sub specialisation of doctors, results in changes to the way healthcare is delivered to patients. The Government are keen to see that patients have access to services at as local a level as possible but against this desire must be balanced the need to ensure that patients receive the highest levels of clinical care, wherever that care is provided. It is up to local health communities to determine the best way to provide the highest standards of clinical care for their patients.

 The Department, at ministerial and official level, has regular contact with the General Medical Council (GMC). We have recently (3 August) amended the Medical Act 1983 to give the GMC powers to deal quickly and more effectively with doctors whose fitness to practice comes into question, and are working closely with them to introduce revalidation of doctors.
<P>

<a name="01121w17.html_para10">These achievements are part of our overall package of reforms to protect patients from incompetent doctors, and the regulation, for the first time, of private doctors under the Care Standards Act is a further step in providing patients with proper safeguards. To ensure that we are putting in place a proper robust system of regulation for private doctors discussions have been held, and are continuing, with the GMC among others. We see the regulation of private doctors as ensuring that patients can have confidence that any information they get about the service being provided is accurate, that there are proper quality assurance systems in place and if the patient is unhappy about the treatment provided they will have access to a formal and effective complaints procedure. Where the National Care Standards Commission has concerns about the quality of care being delivered by a private doctor it will be able to withdraw registration to prevent the doctor from practising in those premises and inform the GMC.
<P>

<a name="01121w17.html_para11">Of course, the GMC has an important role in the development of all the standards to which independent healthcare providers will be regulated, and are therefore part of the External Consultation Group which we have established to help the Department in developing these standards.

 The Quality Protects initiative is a key part of our programme for tackling social exclusion. It focuses on improving the life chances of some of the most vulnerable children in our society: children in care; children in need of protection and disabled children. On 20 October, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State announced the extension of the programme from its original three years to five years. The programme is supported by a special grant of &#163;885 million over the five years. The NHS plan and the Department's Public Service Agreement set challenging new targets to narrow the gap in life chances between children in care and their peers through better outcomes for care leavers; higher educational attainment; reduced offending; and maximising the role of adoption.
<P>

<a name="01121w18.html_para2">Although there remains a long way to go, the initial evidence suggests that Quality Protects is beginning to deliver better opportunities for some of the most vulnerable children. 500 more children were adopted from care in 1999-2000 than the previous year--a 23 per cent. increase. More young people are remaining in care until they are 18. The number of re-registrations on child protection registers is down, as is the number of children de-registered who had been on the register for over two years. Children in care are experiencing fewer placement moves.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will use his powers under the Health Act 1998 to change the membership of the General Dental Council; what is the constitution of the present Council, as regards representation of dentists, professions complimentary to medicine and laymen; and if he will make a statement. [R] [138260]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01121w18.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The General Dental Council currently comprises 50 members of whom 41 are dentists, six are lay people, three are doctors and one a professional complementary to dentistry. In consultation with the Department, the Council is working up proposals for a smaller Council with a much larger proportion of lay members. We will use powers under Section 60 of the Health Act 1999 to implement these changes. We plan to lay an Order before Parliament early in 2001.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what measures he intends to adopt as part of the National Plan to lower death rates from coronary heart disease, diabetes and tuberculosis, strokes, liver cancer and diabetes among older persons in ethnic minorities.  [138319]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01121w19.html_spnew0"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 On 14 November my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State announced additional resources for the National Health Service totalling &#163;450 million targeted at tackling cancer and heart disease including extra money for life saving drugs and to reduce waiting times, and extra support for smoking cessation services. We will also double the money targeted at dealing with the health effects of deprivation in England's poorest areas, many of which have significant ethnic minority communities.
<P>

<a name="01121w19.html_para0">The NHS Plan sets out the actions to be taken to reduce inequalities through investment and reform in key services. These significant new resources will help the NHS to deliver these commitments.
<P>

<a name="01121w19.html_para1">Tackling cancer and coronary heart disease, which are the two biggest killer diseases, will make a significant inroad into inequalities in health. We recently published the NHS Cancer Plan, a comprehensive programme of action linking prevention, diagnosis, treatment, care and research. The Plan pledges to cut the death rate from all cancers by one fifth by 2010; this includes the death rate from liver cell cancer secondary to hepatitis C.
<P>

<a name="01121w19.html_para2">A National Service Framework (NSF) coronary heart disease and the NHS Cancer Plan have already been published. These set the standards for improving a range of services which older people use, including those from ethnic minorities. The Diabetes National Service Framework, to be published in 2001 for implementation in the NHS from 2002, will pay particular heed to the needs of those who are disproportionately affected by diabetes, such as people from minority ethnic groups. The National Service Framework for Older People, which is to be introduced from April 2001, will also help to ensure that the health and social care needs of older people from all backgrounds are properly addressed.

<a name="01121w19.html_para3">Control of communicable disease, including tuberculosis, is identified in the National Priorities Guidance as a "must do" activity. Control of tuberculosis in older persons is based on a strategy of treatment of identified cases and screening of their close contacts, screening and treatment for immigrants from countries with a high prevalence of tuberculosis and active surveillance of tuberculosis. Surveillance of tuberculosis has been enhanced to allow more detailed identification of risk groups and to assess the success of treatment in individual cases. Detailed Guidance to the NHS is set out in the report of the Interdepartmental Working Group on Tuberculosis entitled "The Prevention and Control of Tuberculosis in the United Kingdom: Recommendations for the Prevention and Control of Tuberculosis at Local Level", copies of which are available in the Library.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health how many complaints against medical practitioners practising in Scotland were handled by the General Medical Council in each of the last five years; how many were dismissed; and what penalties were applied where the complaint was found to be justified.  [137538]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01121w19.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Denham </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 13 November 2000]:</i> These matters are the responsibility of the General Medical Council. I understand that the GMC will shortly be in a position to provide this information when they have completed improvements to their information technology systems.

<a name="01121w19.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Ivan Henderson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health what percentage of practice nurses employed by <i>(a)</i> GPs and <i>(b)</i> NHS hospitals received the full pay increase awarded under the last agreement by the Pay Review Body.  [138820]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01121w19.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 We accepted in full the recommendations of the Review Body for Nursing staff, Midwives, Health Visitors and Professions Allied to Medicine (NPRB) for 2000-01 in respect of approximately 431,000 nurses, midwives and health visitors who are directly employed by National Health Service bodies.
<P>

<a name="01121w19.html_para4">In a letter dated 21 February (AL(NM) 1/2000) all NHS employers were told that

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>
<BR>
"Employers must ensure that the new pay scales are implemented quickly to allow staff to receive their increased salaries in April",
and we have no evidence that any NHS employer failed to do so.

<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="01121w19.html_para5">Another 10,700 whole-time equivalent nurses are employed by about 8,700 individual general practitioner practices. These staff do not automatically benefit from national pay awards, although many GP employers do employ staff on terms and conditions of service that are analogous to those of NHS employees. We have already specified in the Core Contract for Personal Medical Services that adoption of NPRB recommendations, where these are both accepted and adopted by the Government across the rest of the NHS is mandatory and we are working with the representatives of the profession to encourage all practices to match NMRB awards in the light of the extra investment announced on 14 November 2000.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what additional funding he intends to make available to health authorities to pay for placements at residential care homes by way of intermediate care.  [138827]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01121w20.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The National Health Service Plan makes available new resources rising to &#163;900 million annually to the NHS and social services for intermediate care and related services by 2003-04, over and above additional recurrent funding of &#163;150 million this year, and a one-off allocation of &#163;63 million to help expand capacity this winter.
<P>

<a name="01121w20.html_para0">The additional investment will be used to support a wide range of intermediate care and related services which aim to promote the independence and improved quality of care for older people, including residential intermediate care. The precise use of the funds will be for local health and social care communities to determine together, based on joint plans aimed at maximising the contribution of all partners in health and social care towards the development of effective intermediate care.

 Where a prisoner is transferred to either a National Health Service or private psychiatric hospital under section 47 of the Mental Health Act 1983, responsibility for funding the placement rests with the health authority for the area in which the individual was usually resident before the commencement of the detention. Where a previous address cannot be determined, the health authority for the area in which the offence was committed is responsible for funding the placement.

<P>
<P><I>21 Nov 2000 : Column: 170W</I><P>
Devon (Mr. Harvey) of 14 November 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 812-13, what provision has been made to meet the cost of free nursing care; how much will transfer to health authority budgets from social services budgets for this purpose cost; and how much is to replace payments previously made by people under means- testing.  [138990]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01121w20.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hutton </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 20 November 2000]:</i> We have estimated that the additional cost to the Exchequer of providing free nursing care, as outlined in the NHS Plan, will be &#163;420 million over the next three years. This additional cost arises principally from the replacement of the costs of nursing care incurred by individuals in nursing homes, who are not supported by local authorities or the NHS. Additional funding of this level was included in the Department of Health programme in the recent spending review settlement.
<P>

<a name="01121w20.html_para1">Provision for the costs of free nursing care has been included in the Department's spending review settlement and will be made available to the NHS for that purpose subject to Parliament's approval of legislative proposals on free nursing care.

By 2004 there will be 7,500 more consultants, 2,000 more general practitioners and 20,000 more nurses. Coventry will of course benefit from the Government's commitment to this unparalleled increase in the number of key NHS staff.

 Every health authority has a maternity services liaison committee (MSLC) where commissioners, providers and users of maternity services develop services in partnership. MSLCs enable users to influence their own care as well as the development of local and national standards and policy, in line with the patient focus of the NHS Plan.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what discussions he had with the senior judiciary on 14 November concerning the issue of court dress; and if he will make a statement.  [138770]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01121w21.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Lock: </B> 
 Reform of court dress was raised by the Lord Chancellor at his meeting with the higher judiciary on 14 November. Given the many important reforms to the justice system which the Department is carrying forward, reform of court dress has no immediate priority.
<P>
<P>
<a name="01121w21.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Dismore: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department if he will review his policy concerning court dress when presiding in parliamentary debates.  [139615]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01121w21.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Lock: </B> 
 As my hon. Friend knows, the traditions, procedural rules and views of the House of Lords regarding the wearing of formal dress for its Speaker are different from those in the House of Commons. The Lord Chancellor took the initiative in making a number of changes to his formal dress in 1998, having consulted the relevant Committee of the House. The Lord Chancellor would consult in a similar manner if he has any proposals for change in the future, but has no present plans to put forward any such proposals.

<P>
<P>
<a name="01121w21.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Lock: </B> 
 No. It is important for the Lord Chancellor and the senior judiciary to be able to discuss matters candidly and frankly and that such notes of any discussions should be protected. The minutes of that meeting will, therefore, be witheld under Exemption 2 of Part II of the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information.

In July 1999, an additional request was sent to British Telecom to include the national number in all phone books in England and Wales.

<a name="01121w21.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Lock: </B> 
 The Public Record Office has a duty under the Public Records Acts to provide custody for those Government records that have been selected for permanent preservation. Under section 3.4 of the Public Records Act 1958, Government Departments and agencies may apply for the Lord Chancellor's permission to retain records over-30-years old. Under section 5.6 of the Act, Departments and agencies can apply for extended closure of records.
<P>

<a name="01121w21.html_para1">The Public Record Office is now aware of any records in its custody or held in other departments relating to the wartime internment of the Duke of Buccleuch. There are no files on this subject listed in its catalogue. There may be information in files on other subjects, but this could be discovered only at disproportionate cost.

The request, therefore, falls within the terms of exemption 2 of the Code of Practice.
