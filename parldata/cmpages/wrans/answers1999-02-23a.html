<a name="90223w01.htm_wqn0"><B> Mr. Chaytor: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (1) if it is Her Majesty's Government's policy to support the eight elements of an ideal result as outlined in the European Commission Note from Directorate General I to the Article 113 Committee on investment and the World Trade Organisation; and if he will make a statement;  [71755]
<P>
<UL>(2) if her Majesty's Government supports the Investor- State Dispute Settlement set out in the European Commission Note from Directorate General I to the Article 113 Committee on investment and the World Trade Organisation; and if he will make a statement;  [71753]
<P>
(3) if Her Majesty's Government have asked the European Commission to redraft the leaked Note from Directorate General I to the Article 113 Committee on investment and the World Trade Organisation; and if he will make a statement;  [71756]
<P>
(4) if Her Majesty's Government have objected to the contents of the European Commission Note from Directorate General I to the Article 113 Committee on investment and the World Trade Organisation; and if he will make a statement.  [71754]

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if he will make a statement on the European Commission Note from DG1 to the Article 113 committee on investment in the World Trade Organisation.  [72249]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90223w01.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 It is the Government's policy, shared by our EU partners, that the meeting of World Trade Organisation Ministers in Seattle later this year should lead to a comprehensive new "Round" of WTO negotiations, and that investment should be included on the agenda. However, the Government's policy is that any investment negotiation must be based around a new set of objectives, derived by consensus. We are in the process of consulting with all interested groups within the UK on what the Government's objectives for a new negotiation might be. As part of our general consultations over the UK's objectives for the new "Round". I am convening a series of meetings including other Ministers, NGOs, TUs and business organisations. No conclusions have been reached on the inclusion or exclusion of an investor-state dispute settlement mechanism, or indeed on any other individual issue.
<P>

<a name="90223w01.htm_para0">The European Commission circulated an internal discussion paper on possible elements of a WTO investment agreement to Member States on 15 December 1998, with a view to stimulating discussion within the EU. The paper does not represent the views of the UK 



<P>
<P><I>23 Feb 1999 : Column: 202</I><P>
Government. The UK has called for a discussion of the paper by EU investment experts, but such a discussion has not yet taken place.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90223w01.htm_wqn2"><B> Mr. Chaytor: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry for what reasons Chapters E and F were omitted from the publicly released European Commission Note from Directorate General I to the Article 113 Committee on Investment and the WTO; and if will make a statement.  [72056]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90223w01.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Wilson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 22 February 1999]:</i> The Note was issued by the European Commission and its contents are a matter for them. However, I have drawn their attention to my hon. Friend's interest and have asked them to respond directly to him.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90223w01.htm_wqn3"><B> Mr. Robathan: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry how much funding <i>(a)</i> London First and <i>(b)</i> London First Centre has received from his Department per annum since 1992; and for what purposes the funding was specified.  [72167]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90223w01.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Wills: </B> 
 Since its incorporation in February 1994, London First Centre (LFC) has received annual grants from the DTI's Invest in Britain Bureau for the co- ordination of inward investment activities in the Greater London area of &#163;500k (94-95); &#163;1,000k (95-96); &#163;1,010k (96-97); &#163;1,015k (97-98); and &#163;1,015k (98-99).
<P>

<a name="90223w01.htm_para1">London First, of which LFC is a wholly owned subsidiary, has not received grant funding from the DTI. It is financed from members' contributions, donations, project and sundry income.

<a name="90223w01.htm_sbhd2"><H4><center>Crown Prosecution Service</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="90223w01.htm_wqn4"><B> Mr. Cox: </B> 
To ask the Attorney-General how many cases were referred to the Crown Prosecution Service in each of the last three years; in how many cases court proceedings were recommended; and if he will make a statement.  [72548]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90223w01.htm_spmin0"><B>The Attorney-General:</B> 
 The table shows the number of cases which the Crown Prosecution Service received from the police, and the number which the Service finalised, in each of the last three years. Both figures are inclusive of cases submitted for pre-charge advice and non-criminal proceedings, and the numbers of these completed in each year are shown separately.
<P>

<a name="90223w01.htm_para2">The table then shows the number and the proportion of cases in which a prosecution did not proceed. These outcomes are divided into those cases discontinued by the Service, and those which were written off because the defendant could not be traced or had died, or because proceedings were adjourned indefinitely.
<P>

<a name="90223w01.htm_para3">Finally, the table shows the number and proportion of cases in which a prosecution proceeded. These are divided 



<P>
<P><I>23 Feb 1999 : Column: 203</I><P>
into cases in which the defendant was bound over to keep the peace, those which proceeded to a committal hearing, and those which proceeded to a trial or guilty plea.
<P>

<a name="90223w01.htm_para4">The Code for Crown Prosecutors requires that there should be sufficient reliable evidence to give a realistic prospect of conviction, and that the prosecution should be in the public interest. These criteria are applied in every case. Every case discontinued must be reviewed by a Crown Prosecutor and, wherever time allows, the police must be consulted before a decision is taken. The number of cases discontinued against the opinion of the police is very small: a survey conducted in 1994 showed that the police objected to discontinuance on only 4 per cent. of occasions when they were consulted.
<P>

<a name="90223w01.htm_para5">However, discontinuance is not primarily the result of a Crown Prosecutor's judgment. More than half of discontinued cases are unable to proceed because witnesses fail to appear at court, refuse to give evidence or change their evidence, defendants produce driving documents proving their innocence on the day of the trial; evidence is excluded because of irregularities in its collection; or due to lack of continuity evidence in the 



<P>
<P><I>23 Feb 1999 : Column: 204</I><P>
prosecution case which cannot be provided by the police. In these circumstances, the Crown Prosecution Service has no choice but to discontinue proceedings.
<P>

<a name="90223w01.htm_para6">There is no connection between discontinuance and writing off a case. The latter does not represent the termination of proceedings, but is an administrative procedure whereby dormant cases are removed from the record of live proceedings, so giving a more accurate account of work on hand. The majority of write offs occur where the police cannot trace a defendant for service of a summons, or where a warrant for arrest remains unexecuted following the defendant's failure to surrender to bail. If the defendant is subsequently arrested, the prosecution can then recommence.

 The UK currently has a delegation in Colombia engaged in final negotiations on the UN Biosafety Protocol. This instrument will govern the transboundary movement of Living Modified Organisms (effectively the same as GMOs).
<P>

<a name="90223w02.htm_para0">While many of the developing countries want to see socio-economic factors such as the effect on traditional farming practices form part of the risk assessment, exporting countries disagree. My instructions are that the UK, on its own and as part of the EU negotiating group, should seek an outcome that includes some reference to socio-economic factors and encourages research into impacts on farming practices. We expect that countries will always be able to ban imports where there is evidence of serious damage to the environment or human health.

<P>

<a name="90223w03.htm_para1">Some payments are made to SBS for services provided and milestones achieved, but SBS's earnings depend mainly on casework productivity improvements. The programme delay means that productivity has not improved as fast as expected.

We are aware of 12 applications within the last two years under the rules, by staff managed by the Prison Service, for permission to work in the private sector. In the same period, elsewhere in the Department, applications were received from two former members of staff for permission to provide advice to private companies, one in connection with a project outside the United Kingdom.

 The Government are committed to improving the position of victims and witnesses within the criminal justice system. We are increasing very substantially our annual grant to Victim Support to enable them to establish in magistrates' courts a support service for victims, witnesses and other court users to complement the highly successful service they have already established at all Crown Court centres. Up to an additional &#163;2.8 million a year will be provided for this purpose in 1999-2000, rising to up to &#163;4.5 million in 2001-02.
<P>

<a name="90223w03.htm_para4">We shall also be providing an additional &#163;1.8 million a year from 1999-2000 onwards to enable Victim Support further to develop their community based schemes and the support services provided at the Crown Court.
<P>

<a name="90223w03.htm_para5">By 2001-02, therefore, our grant to Victim Support will have risen to some &#163;19 million a year, an increase of 50 per cent. over the current figure of &#163;12.7 million. This substantial injection of new money will enable Victim Support to provide a more complete and seamless service for victims and witnesses, from the reporting of the offence through to the conclusion of the case in the courts and, as appropriate, beyond.

 I am acutely concerned about the financial position at Reid Kerr College. That is why I agreed to the appointment of consultants last autumn. This report describes a number of steps to be taken by the College's Board of Management in order to draw up a recovery plan aimed at securing the College's future. We have offered financial assistance to the Board, but attached stringent conditions to ensure that the College's problems are addressed immediately, and have sought to ensure that the Board has access to appropriate expertise to assist in framing and implementing the recovery plan.

 Most of the timber grown in Scotland is transported along 'B' or 'C' class roads for part of its journey from the forest.

The amount of timber carried by sea has not changed significantly over the past 10 years.

 Health Boards, in conjunction with NHS Trusts, prepared detailed plans for achieving reductions in waiting lists and waiting times. A clinical and professional Support Force examined the plans and discussed them with representatives of Health Boards and NHS Trusts. Prior to recommending the plans for approval, the Support Force ensured that they were robust, deliverable and would achieve value for money, through an assessment of the project costs and the anticipated impact on waiting lists. Monitoring of expenditure by Health Boards on their plans, and the outcomes achieved, is ongoing.

To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland what are the criteria he has applied <i>(a)</i> in selecting the areas in which solicitors will receive an enhanced fixed payment for summary criminal legal aid cases and <i>(b)</i> in determining the level of the enhanced payment.  [71860]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90223w07.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. McLeish: </B> 
 The criteria were chosen to reflect a combination of small numbers of cases dealt with and time taken to travel to the court.
<P>

<a name="90223w07.htm_para8">The 15 Sheriff courts in Scotland with the lowest throughput of cases were therefore identified. Any courts which were less than 40 miles from the nearest other sheriff court and which could be reached without a sea crossing were eliminated from the list. The resultant list of courts for which an additional payment will be available is Campbeltown, Stornoway, Lockmaddy, Kirkwall, Lerwick, Oban, Portree, Lochgilphead and Rothesay Sheriff courts.
<P>

<a name="90223w07.htm_para9">The additional fee of &#163;50 was determined to provide reasonable remuneration to solicitors who have to represent clients in these courts. The Sheriff Court core fee has also been increased to &#163;500 for all courts. From 1 July 1999 legal aid in Scotland will be a matter for the Scottish Parliament.

<P>
<a name="90223w09.htm_spmin2"><B>The Prime Minister:</B> 
 I agree with my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary. As I told the House on 10 February 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 313-14, the facts to which the Foreign Affairs Committee Report drew attention had already been covered by Sir Thomas Legg's inquiry, which confirmed that there was no conspiracy or cover up.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90223w09.htm_spmin4"><B>The Prime Minister:</B> 
 No central record is kept of any formal notes of dissent except where they lead to the issuing of a Ministerial instruction (or "Direction") as provided for in the procedures set out in paragraphs 12-15 of the Treasury document <i>The Responsibilities of an Accounting Officer</i>. Under these procedures the Treasury is informed when a Ministerial Direction is issued. Until December 1994 Departments were required to inform the Treasury about Ministerial Directions concerning propriety and regularity only, and not those concerning value for money. From December 1994 Departments were required to inform the Treasury of both kinds of Directions. Treasury records show that since 1981 the Treasury has been informed of 28 Directions. No central record is held of notes (if there are any) recording an Accounting Officer's dissatisfaction at a Ministerial Direction.

highlighted in the advice on tackling the millennium bug that Action 2000 makes available to small businesses. We have also been encouraging other countries to take testing seriously. However, decisions on the appropriate level of testing are for individual organisations to make, whether they are in the public or private sector, depending on the business risks faced if a particular system, or the interfaces between that system and other organisations, fails. In a number of sectors, there has been a co-ordinated approach to testing.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90223w10.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The Lord Chancellor has no plans to change the present system of selecting Immigration Adjudicators. Immigration Adjudicator posts may be occupied on a full or part-time basis. There are no statutory qualifications for appointment as an Immigration Adjudicator. However, in practice the Lord Chancellor will normally consider only persons who hold a seven year general qualification within the meaning of section 71 of the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990, who are advocates or solicitors in Scotland, or barristers or solicitors in Northern Ireland, of not less than 7 years' standing. Part-time posts are filled by application and interview following an open advertised competition, save on a few occasions the Lord Chancellor had directly seconded serving Circuit Judges and Recorders on the recommendation of the Chief Immigration Adjudicator, His Honour Judge Dunn QC. Full-time Immigration Adjudicators are normally appointed, following application and interview, from the ranks of those who have gained sufficient experience through service as part-time Immigration Adjudicators or part-time legal members of the Immigration Appeal Tribunal.

 The Government's planned reforms were first outlined in October 1997.

The full text of the White Paper is available on the Internet, and a shortened summary has been widely circulated. In addition, the Explanatory Notes for the Access to Justice Bill are publicly available, and set out details of the Government's intentions for the reformed scheme.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will set out the conventions governing the propriety and cost of press releases issued by his Department, its agencies and non-departmental bodies; and what is the total cost of the press releases issued since May 1997.  [71471]<P>

 <i>[holding answer 16 February 1999]:</i> Rules governing the work of the Government Information and Communications Service (GICS) were set out in guidance published by the Cabinet Office in July 1997. More specific guidance on the writing and issuing of press releases is given in the Working Guide for Government Information Officers. Copies of both documents are in the Library of the House.
<P>

<a name="90223w12.htm_para0">Since May 1997 (May 1997-December 1998) the Treasury has been billed a total of &#163;22,819 for the services of the Central Office of Information, which distribute press releases electronically, by fax and by courier service. This figure does not include postage. The same information requested of the Treasury's agencies and non-departmental bodies is not held centrally and could be obtained only a disproportionate cost.

 <i>[holding answer 22 February 1999]:</i> In common with other departments, the work of press officers in the Treasury includes responding to any misinformed allegations concerning Government policy or activity which are published in the media. They are supported in this work by other officials as necessary.
<P>

<a name="90223w12.htm_para1">Because this is a routine part of a Department's work and it is not separately recorded from other tasks, to provide the further information requested would involve disproportionate cost.

<P>

 The Cantor Financial Futures Exchange (CFFE) applied for recognition in September 1998 and, with effect from today, has been granted recognition as an Overseas Investment Exchange, having satisfied the conditions under sections 37 and 40 of the Financial Services Act 1986. CFFE is therefore able to carry out investment business in the UK.

<a name="90223w12.htm_wqn8"><B> Mr. Cousins: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if the Inland Revenue monitors <i>(a)</i> whether customers receiving the married couples tax allowances are living permanently together and if this is required before they receive the married couples tax allowance and <i>(b)</i> if customers receiving the additional personal tax allowance 



<P>
<P><I>23 Feb 1999 : Column: 243</I><P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="90223w12.htm_spnew8"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 The married couples allowance is available to a married couple who live together at some time during a year of assessment. A husband and wife are treated as living together for income tax purposes unless they are separated under a court order or by a deed of separation, or they are in fact separated and the separation is likely to remain permanent.
<P>

<a name="90223w12.htm_para6">The additional personal allowance is available to people who are not living with a spouse (or who live with a spouse who is totally incapacitated) and who have one or more qualifying children resident with them at some time during a year of assessment.
<P>

<a name="90223w12.htm_para7">The Inland Revenue treat claims to personal tax allowances in much the same way as other claims to relief, Revenue staff apply risk assessment procedures in order to identify potentially incorrect claims. If the Revenue have a reason to believe that an allowance is being falsely claimed, they have powers to make appropriate inquiries and recover any tax lost.

<a name="90223w13.htm_para3">If the deductions exceed the liability to income tax and Class 4 national insurance contribution then the individual can claim a repayment of the excess.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90223w13.htm_spnew3"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 It is estimated that, very roughly, half a million individual subcontractors will be issued with registration cards (and paid with deductions on account of income tax and Class 4 national insurance contributions) under the new Construction Industry Scheme. This broadly equates to those remaining in the scheme and who have annual turnovers (less materials) of under &#163;30,000.
<P>

<a name="90223w13.htm_para4">A more exact assessment is not possible because of the large number of formerly self-employed subcontractors who have moved into employment, and because of uncertainty about how many other individuals will decide to apply for registration cards.

 All family credit recipients will also be eligible for working families tax credit. Working families tax credit is more generous and will have a higher income threshold, and a slower taper than family credit. In addition, it will include a new childcare tax credit, which will provide up to 70 per cent. of eligible childcare costs up to maximum costs of &#163;100 per week for one child and &#163;150 per week for two or more children.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health, pursuant to his answer of 28 January 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, columns <i>324-26</i>, on average wages, if he will list the actual average wage paid by each of the London health authorities in each year since 1995.  [68962]<P>

<P>
<a name="90223w14.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The precise information requested is not collected centrally. Information is collected about the annual total salaries and wages paid to National Health Service staff each year, and the number of directly employed staff at a single point in time, for example, 30 September. Workforce figures for individual health authority areas are not available centrally for 1995. The table uses these two pieces of information to produce estimates of average wages. These estimates should be interpreted with caution for the following reasons.




<P>
<P><I>23 Feb 1999 : Column: 248</I><P>

<P>

<a name="90223w14.htm_para0">The number of staff employed by individual organisations will change over the course of a year. These changes are not reflected in the point in time estimate for workforce numbers, but are reflected in the total annual salaries and wages.
<P>

<a name="90223w14.htm_para1">The coverage of the workforce numbers and salaries and wages differ slightly. For example, the costs of non-executive board members and non-nursing staff on short-term, flexible contracts who work on an "as and when" basis are included in the salaries and wages figures, but are excluded from the workforce figures.
<P>

<a name="90223w14.htm_para2">The figures collected by the Department for individual NHS trusts and health authorities were collected to provide national estimates and were validated accordingly. For example, small inaccuracies in the figures for individual organisations may not have been identified.

<a name="90223w14.htm_spnew7"><B> Mr. George Robertson: </B> 
 On 19 October 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, column 979, I announced that we would be forming the joint Royal Navy/Royal Air Force Harrier force to be known as Joint Force 2000. Since last October, work has continued on the organisational changes necessary to take forward the Joint Force 2000 initiative. I can confirm that the new Headquarters will form in RAF Strike Command on 1 April next year under the command of a Rear Admiral. This Headquarters will be located at RAF High Wycombe. He will have two subordinate force commanders, both of whom will be RAF Air Commodores, one of whom will command the combined Harrier force, Joint Force 2000, and the other the RAF's existing forces of Nimrod Maritime Patrol aircraft and Search and Rescue helicopters. As importantly, we have also decided, subject to a period of consultation with Trades Unions and other interested parties which begins today, that the RN's Sea Harrier force, currently based at RNAS Yeovilton, will join the RAF's Harrier force at RAF Cottesmore and RAF Wittering in 2003.

 My Department has begun to consult widely and developed new working relationships with the business community, both in-country and in the UK since 1997. As we make clear in our Development White Paper, business has a strong interest in successful development and the sustainable economic growth necessary to reduce poverty requires a thriving private sector. We consult through established business groups rather than on a company by company basis. I have so far met with six of the thirty-six Ambassadors for British Business to discuss areas of particular interest to my Department's objectives.

Guidance has also been issued to ensure that if more than one Minister needs to be aware of a paper it is specifically drawn to each Minister's attention. News Departments have clear guidelines to avoid using press lines that are misleading or incomplete. Procedures are also in place to ensure that reports received out of hours from the Ministry of Defence are correctly received, logged and distributed.

 Mr. Penfold arrived in Conakry on 5 June 1997. He discussed his communications needs with the FCO on 11 June. Equipment enabling him to send and receive material marked "restricted" was sent to Conakry on 26 June 1997, arriving on 7 July. For security reasons, the equipment needed to be housed in a protective steel cabinet. The slight delay arose from the need to assemble the various components (some of which had been returned for repair from other posts) and test them before dispatch.
<P>

<a name="90223w17.htm_para0">Mr. Penfold has said that staff in Conakry at that time, after consulting him decided not to use the equipment as it was too large for the hotel room. Mr. Penfold and his staff continued to use the commercial facilities available in the hotel.

 Since the UK/China human rights dialogue was established in September 1997, and the EU/China human rights dialogue resumed in October 1997, China has taken several positive steps. These include signature of two international covenants and agreement to report to the UN under those covenants in respect of Hong Kong. It has received visits by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, as well as allowing a visit to Tibet by EU Troika Ambassadors. It has also extended an invitation to visit to the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture. We have been able to discuss issues of serious concern including the death penalty, religion, Tibet and individual cases. China has begun to collaborate with the UK and EU on human rights cooperation programmes, which include projects in the areas of Civil and Political as well as Economic and Social rights, and has hosted two EU/China legal affairs seminars and a seminar on the rights of women.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>BA does not have a policy on telephoning people outside Office Hours. For operational reasons, the vast majority of calls will be made during the day, Monday to Friday. However, offices do operate flexible working hours resulting in calls potentially being made outside of 'normal' working hours. It is also the case that certain units within BA will need to telephone people in the evening or weekends, for example, where we are seeking to contact people who are no longer in receipt of benefits, or where there is a time difference, eg, people abroad who need to be contacted by our Pensions and Overseas Directorate. In providing a quality service, staff will be sensitive to keep unsociable calls to a minimum.</FONT></UL>

 A special exercise will be carried out to identify all new and repeat claims (system and clerical) to Jobseeker's Allowance processed during the NIRS closure period (20 June to 8 November 1998). Each claim identified will then be reviewed to ensure correct entitlement was paid. The special exercise will ensure that those claims paid on the basis of information provided by jobseekers are identified and reviewed.
<P>

<a name="90223w19.htm_para2">A date has not yet been finalised when the special exercise will commence, but it is not expected to be before April 1999. The position will be kept under review but, depending on other work priorities impacting on the field, the intention is to clear the relevant cases by the end of this year.
<P>

<a name="90223w19.htm_para3">Claims made since 9 November (the date NIRS2 became "live" for Jobseeker's Allowance) are automatically reviewed by the Jobseeker's Allowance computer system upon confirmation of contribution information supplied by NIRS2.

<a name="90223w19.htm_para4">Claims made from January which could not be assessed using information from NIRS2 have been assessed using other evidence. These cases will be reviewed on an ongoing basis, when contribution information is updated to NIRS2, as NIRS2 automatically notifies the JSA computer system of the revised details.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment if he will estimate <i>(a)</i> how many students resident in Newcastle are educated in local education authorities outside Newcastle, <i>(b)</i> how many students are educated in Newcastle local education authority schools who are resident in other local education authorities, <i>(c)</i> how many school students resident in Newcastle were educated in non-local education authority schools in 1996-97 and <i>(d)</i> how many school students resident in Newcastle who will be educated in local education authority schools in 1999-2000 in each local education authority in the City of Newcastle.

<a name="90223w20.htm_spnew3"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 The following table sets out the estimated information requested for <i>(a)</i> and <i>(b)</i> for 1996-97, although the figures should be treated with caution since, following the reform of inter-authority recoupment in 1995-96, many authorities made representations that it was no longer possible for them to collect robust data on cross-border pupil movements. There are no comparable data for 1999-2000 and information on the residence of pupils attending independent schools has never been collected centrally.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment if he will list those who attended the launch of the New Deal "Public Relations Toolkit for Employers"; and what was the cost.  [71367]<P>

<a name="90223w20.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Andrew Smith: </B> 
 The reception for small and medium-sized enterprises is estimated to have cost &#163;1,400. It provided an opportunity to recognise and thank small and medium-sized enterprises for their involvement in New Deal. The Public Relations Toolkit was prepared to help them publicise their company through that involvement, or more widely, should they wish to do so. The following is a list of the companies and representative organisations that attended.

 Local Education Authorities are funded to provide education for school-aged children of asylum seekers on the school roll, in the same way as they are for all other children on roll.

This is something which falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of the Agency.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>There are four main categories of young people whose stay on the Gateway may properly extend beyond the normal four month maximum. The first category covers young people who are not required to go on to an option at the end of four months because they are clearly intending to cease claiming Jobseeker's Allowance in the very near future. Examples, include young people who are due to start full time work; emigrate; or leave Jobseeker's Allowance to claim maternity allowance. The second category covers situations where entry to a New Deal option is, by agreement with a Personal Adviser, delayed for a short period where there is good reason. Examples include circumstances where a young person has suffered a bereavement; suffers a short-term illness; or where their planned provision is unexpectedly not available.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The third category covers young people who refuse to enter a New Deal option. In these circumstances their case will normally be referred to an adjudication officer for a decision on the individual's benefit entitlement during which time the young person is regarded as still being on the Gateway. The fourth category covers returners to the Gateway. If a young person leaves the Gateway and subsequently returns within 13 weeks, they will re-enter the Gateway at the point which they left.</FONT></UL>

<P>
<a name="90223w21.htm_spnew3"><B> Ms Hodge: </B> 
 We are acting to ensure that the Department's policies meet the needs of disabled people and that we comply with our legal requirements. The Department already takes positive steps to make it easier for disabled people to make use of its services. We shall continue to do so, not only by complying fully with new duties in the Disability Discrimination Act but by aiming to exceed them where appropriate.
<P>

<a name="90223w21.htm_para2">The Department issued internal guidance recently on mainstreaming which ensures that all new and existing policies and programmes are assessed for any adverse impact not only on disabled people, but on any minority or disadvantaged group. That includes the need to ensure that our policies and their outcomes comply with the law. Where necessary we shall act to remove or reduce the impact on these groups. This complements the guidance "Policy Appraisal for Equal Treatment" which the Cabinet Office issued to all Government Departments in November 1998, and which was signed jointly by the Minister for Women, the Secretary of State for Education and Employment, and the Home Secretary.
<P>

<a name="90223w21.htm_para3">The Departmental Board monitors the Department's performance and will publish information on the progress being made in this area, as will other Government Departments.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what amounts in his Department's budget for 1998-99 can be attributed to spending on disabled people; and what proportion this represents of total departmental spending.  [71289]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90223w21.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Mudie: </B> 
 Approximately &#163;290 million of this Department's budget for 1998-99 can be attributed directly to spending on disabled people. This represents 1.9 per cent. of the Department's total budget for 1998-99.
<P>

<a name="90223w21.htm_para4">In addition, disabled people are able to benefit from the Department's mainstream expenditure on education, employment and training, but it is not possible to identify separately the amount of this.

 <i>[holding answer 2 February 1999]:</i> 11 schools in EAZs have informed QCA that they have disapplied the National Curriculum under Section 363 of the Education Act 1996 to provide wider opportunities for work-related learning at Key Stage 4 from September 1998. As regulations only came into force in September 1998, it is likely that more schools will take advantage of this provision during the remainder of this academic year and next academic year.
<P>

<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The procedure for monitoring claimants of Jobseeker's Allowance starts when they make their first claim. The jobseeker is seen by an adviser for a New Jobseeker Interview and is subsequently seen fortnightly until they cease claiming Jobseeker's Allowance. The progress in finding work for jobseekers who remain unemployed is reviewed with them after 13 weeks, after six months and every six months thereafter. For those young people aged between 18 and 24 the six month review triggers their entry on to the New Deal.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I should explain that Lone Parents do not normally claim Jobseeker's Allowance, since they are normally entitled to Income Support. New Deal for Lone Parents is a voluntary programme and participants continue to claim Income Support whilst participating on it. The only Lone Parents who claim jobseeker's Allowance are therefore those who voluntarily join the New Deal for 18-24 year olds or for those aged over 25, and those who are willing to meet the Jobseeker's Allowance benefit conditions by making themselves available for and actively seeking work.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>All claimants of Jobseeker's Allowance are recorded by the Employment Service on its Labour Market Computer System. This is used to record their progress in line with the structure of fortnightly attendance and regular reviews. In addition, jobseekers who are on New Deal are tracked by their Personal Adviser throughout their time on the programme.</FONT></UL>

<P>

<a name="90223w22.htm_para0">Asset management is kept under close review, and those which are surplus to requirements are disposed of as quickly as possible, subject to value-for-money considerations. They are normally disposed of on the open market by public auction or tender. The exception to this rule is that in DfEE, good working IT equipment is gifted to education and employment bodies and projects via third-party organisations. The following table lists items reported as sold by the Department, its agencies and associated public bodies since the information on assets was published in the National Assets Register of November 1997.

<a name="90223w23.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Andrew Smith: </B> 
 We received a range of responses from individuals, employers, employers' organisations and campaigning organisations. For the most part, respondents felt the Code was clear, useful and covered the right areas, though a number of suggestions were made about how the Code could be further improved. With these comments in mind, we will be developing more detailed guidance on implementing the standards recommended in the Code, together with providing illustrative case studies.
