 The Office of the Third Sector (OTS) is working with key partners to understand the impact of the economic downturn on third sector organisations. At present the available evidence is incomplete and somewhat inconsistent, indicating it is too soon since the start of the downturn to fully evaluate the impact on the sector at a national or constituency level.</p>

This package of support was designed together with third sector leaders and took into account submissions from over 80 charities. This action plan builds on the wide range of measures the Government have put in place to support people through the economic downturn, and on the Government&#146;s long-term commitment to voluntary organisations and social enterprises.</p>

Includes activity in English national health service hospitals and English NHS commissioned activity in the independent sector.<br>
<i> Alcohol-related admissions:</i><br>
The number of alcohol-related admissions is based on the methodology developed by the North West Public Health Observatory (NWPHO). Following international best practice, the NWPHO methodology includes a wide range of diseases and injuries in which alcohol plays a part and estimates the proportion of cases that are attributable to the consumption of alcohol. Details of the conditions and associated proportions can be found in the report Jones et al. (2008) Alcohol-attributable fractions for England: Alcohol-attributable mortality and hospital admissions.<br>
Figures for under 16s only include admissions where one or more alcohol-specific conditions were listed. This is because the research on which the attributable fractions are based does not cover under 16s. Alcohol-specific conditions are those that are wholly attributed to alcohol&#151;that is, those with an attributable fraction of one. They are:<br>
Alcoholic cardiomyopathy (142.6)<br>
Alcoholic gastritis (K29.2)<br>
Alcoholic myopathy (G72.1)<br>
Alcoholic polyneuropathy (G62.1)<br>
Alcohol-induced pseudo-Cushing's syndrome (E24.4)<br>
Degeneration of nervous system due to alcohol (G31.2)<br>
Mental and behavioural disorders due to use of alcohol (F10)<br>
Accidental poisoning by and exposure to alcohol (X45)<br>
Ethanol poisoning (T51.0)<br>
Methanol poisoning (T51.1)<br>
Toxic effect of alcohol, unspecified (T51.9)<br>
Number of episodes in which the patient had an alcohol-related primary or secondary diagnosis These figures represent the number of episodes where an alcohol-related diagnosis was recorded in any of the 20 (14 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and seven prior to 2002-03) primary and secondary diagnosis fields in a hospital episode statistics (HES) record. Each episode is only counted once in each count, even if an alcohol-related diagnosis is recorded in more than one diagnosis field of the record.<br>
<i> Ungrossed data:</i><br>
Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).<br>
<i> Finished admission episodes:</i><br>
A finished admission episode is the first period of inpatient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. Finished admission episodes are counted against the year in which the admission episode finishes. Admissions do not represent the number of inpatients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>

<tr valign="top"><td class="tabletext" colspan="6"><i> Primary diagnosis:</i><br>
The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 20 (14 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and seven prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in the HES data set and provides the main reason why the patient was admitted to hospital.<br>
<i> Secondary diagnosis:</i><br>
As well as the primary diagnosis, there are up to 19 (13 from 2002-03 to 2007-08 and six prior to 2002-03) secondary diagnosis fields in HES that show other diagnoses relevant to the episode of care.<br>
<i> Data quality:</i><br>
HES are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts in England.<br>
Data are also received from a number of independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br>
<i> Assessing growth through time:</i><br>
HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. The quality and coverage of the data have improved over time. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series.<br>
Some of the increase in figures for later years (particularly 2006-07 onwards) may be due to the improvement in the coverage of independent sector activity.<br>
Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example, a number of procedures may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and may no longer be accounted for in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.<br>
<i> Assignment of episodes to years:</i><br>
Years are assigned by the end of the first period of care in a patient's hospital stay.<br>

It also highlights the importance of maintaining public confidence in the process of internal review, securing full and open participation from the different agencies and professionals involved and balancing the constraints on public information-sharing when criminal proceedings are outstanding. The importance of this is reinforced by the passage referred to above in Lord Laming's Report. &#147;Working Together to Safeguard Children&#148; sets out clearly that the LSCB SCR overview report should contain an executive summary that will be made public.</p>

1. Includes planned expenditure on the provision for pupils with statements and the provision for non-statemented pupils with SEN, support for inclusion, inter authority recoupment, fees for pupils at independent special schools and abroad, educational psychology service, local authority functions in relation to child protection, therapies and other health related services, parent partnership, guidance and information, the monitoring of SEN provision and inclusion administration, assessment and co-ordination. Also included is the funding delegated to nursery, primary and secondary schools identified as &#147;notional SEN&#148; and the individual schools budget (ISB) for special schools.<br>
2. The ISB for special schools will include some general education costs for pupils with SEN in addition to those costs specifically for SEN while the figures recorded against &#147;notional SEN&#148; are only indicative of the amount that might by spent by schools on SEN. In 2005-06, 2006-07, 2007-08 and 2008-09 local authorities in England also budgeted &#163;499.6 million, &#163;528.5 million, &#163;554.9 million and &#163;552.6 million for SEN transport expenditure but this is not included in the above table as figures are not available prior to 2005-06.<br>
3. The number of pupils with SEN for each year is calculated as the combination of the full-time equivalent (FTE) number of pupils in special schools, the headcount of the number of pupils in maintained nursery, primary and secondary schools with statements, the headcount of the number of pupils in pupil referral units with statements, the headcount of SEN pupils without statements in maintained nursery, primary, and secondary schools, the headcount of SEN pupils without statements in pupil referral units and the headcount of pupils in independent schools and academies with statements. These figures are drawn from the DCSF January Schools Census.<br>
4. Pupil numbers are only available up to 2008 and consequently we have been unable to convert pupil numbers to a financial year basis as the 2009 pupil numbers are not available yet. Consequently there is a mismatch between the financial year planned expenditure and the academic year pupil numbers. The number of pupils with SEN in the January preceding the financial year have been used to calculate the unit costs provided above (e.g. the 2008-09 unit cost is calculated by dividing the 2008-09 planned expenditure by the January 2008 pupil numbers).<br>
5. Total expenditure figures are rounded to the nearest &#163;1,000 with per pupil figures rounded to the nearest &#163;10.<br>
6. Cash terms figures as reported by local authorities as at 23 March 2009.<br>
7. Financial data are taken from local authorities&#146; Children, Schools and Families budget statements (formally section 52) submitted to the DCSF while pupil numbers are drawn from the DCSF January schools census.<br>

For Jobcentre Plus, the essential first stage of this expanded LEP initiative was an extensive programme of employer engagement - negotiations with many individual employers to establish whether, and in what specific ways, the employer could agree to work through an LEP-style business partnership.</p>

During 2008 we continued to engage with new employers, including at local level many small and medium sized enterprises. By the end of January 2009 more than 20,000 employers had recruited through LEPs.</p>

This process does not involve the same quality assurance approach as National Statistics: our administrative data is internally validated to assure its accuracy, in line with NAO guidelines. Monthly figures are available starting from November 2007, when a new system for recording outcomes was introduced.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_626"><a name="90331w0030.htm_para7"><a name="0904017002642">Taken together, measures announced since Budget 2007 will lift around a further 500,000 children out of poverty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_627"><a name="90331w0030.htm_para8"><a name="0904017002643">Budget 2008 also included introducing child poverty pilots to draw on new ideas to tackle child poverty over the long-term. A suite of nine pilots are in various stages of set-up or early delivery, and interim evidence is expected in early 2010.</p>

 The information is in the table, and provides separate data for unfilled and notified vacancies to give the fullest picture of the number of Jobcentre Plus vacancies in any particular constituency. The labour market is dynamic and many new vacancies are filled so quickly they do not appear in the statistics for live unfilled vacancies, which are based on a snapshot of the vacancies available on a particular day.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_628"><a name="90331w0030.htm_para9"><a name="0904017002649">The coverage of these figures relates only to Jobcentre Plus notified and unfilled vacancies. Many vacancies come up through other recruitment channels and the proportion accounted for by Jobcentre Plus is likely to vary over time, according to the occupation of the vacancy and industry of the employer, and by local area. Estimates of the number of unfilled job vacancies across the economy as a whole are available from the monthly ONS Vacancy Survey, based on a sample of some 6,000 enterprises. However, the ONS survey is currently designed to provide national estimates only.</p>

1. Data are unrounded.<br>
2. Changes to Jobcentre Plus vacancy handling procedures have led to a major discontinuity in the vacancy statistics pre and post May 2006. Consequently, care should be taken in interpreting time-series data.<br>
3. Notified vacancies. Monthly data on the inflow of newly notified vacancies to Jobcentre Plus.<br>
4. The stocks of Live unfilled vacancies reflect more accurately job opportunities available via Jobcentre Plus. In the case of unfilled vacancies, use of the figures on live vacancies is recommended (i.e. excluding suspended vacancies), and this is the default option. Live vacancies may still include some vacancies which have already been filled or are otherwise no longer open.<br>
5. To provide a geographic breakdown, in most cases the postcode of the vacancy is used to allocate the vacancy to a local area. Where this is missing or invalid, the employers&#146; postcode or the postcode of the local Jobcentre Plus office is used.<br>
6. These figures are published at www.nomisweb.co.uk<br>
7. The median duration is measured in days between notification and closure.<br>
8. For most purposes, the median will give a more representative measure of the average duration a mean figure tends to be distorted by a small number of vacancies that have very long durations.<br>

 Worker complaints and case loads for each of the national minimum wage compliance teams are closely and continually monitored.
