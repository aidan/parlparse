the Ministry of Defence (MOD) operates a system of delegated authority
to Top Level Budget (TLB) holders. Some are single Service but several,
for example, the Defence Procurement Agency, the Defence Logistics
Organisation and the Chief of Joint Operations support all three
Services and their budgets are not broken down by Service.</p><p><a name="06051772000575">Information
on spending by TLBs can be found in the Government's Expenditure Plans
(GEP) 2005-06 to 2007-08 MOD (Cmd6532) a copy of which is available in
the Library of the House. This sets out past expenditure and future
spending plans. It provides breakdowns of consumption by activity area.
This includes the single Service Top Level Budget holders, and in the
case of the RAF this shows the Commander-in-Chief Strike and the
Commander-in-Chief Personnel and Training Command. More recently, the
MOD has published the 2004-05 Annual Report and Accounts which provides
the same breakdown. Figures for 2005-06 will be published in our Annual
Report and Accounts which is planned for publication before the summer

Maude:</b> To ask the Secretary of State for
Defence what comparative assessment he has made of the National
Radiological Protection Board research papers of 1988 and 1993 on the
incidence in cancer among men from the UK who participated in the
nuclear weapon test programmes.
[71446]</p><p><a name="06051772000577"><b><a name="06051772000799">Mr.
Watson:</b> Assessment of the 1988 report, which examined
cancer incidence up to the end of 1983, led to the conclusion that
presence at the UK atmospheric nuclear test sites had increased the
risk of multiple myeloma and leukaemia (other than chronic lymphatic
leukaemia) compared with controls selected from members of the armed
forces who had not been present at the tests. This was because the
level of these cancers among the control group was lower than would be
expected for the general population rather than because it was higher
for those who took part in the tests. These findings did not correlate
with the risk of exposure from ionising radiation; rather levels in the
controls were inexplicably low. The 1993 analysis extended follow up to
the end of 1990. Rates of multiple myeloma and the relevant leukaemias
in the additional follow-up years were slightly lower in test
participants compared with controls, whose rates were as in the general
population. Because the differential increase in incidence of the
relevant leukaemias mirrors the likely pattern of radiation-induced
leukaemias, it was accepted that a possible slight risk of lymphatic
leukaemia (other than chronic leukaemia) in the first 25 years after
participation could not be ruled out. The small hazard of multiple
myeloma in the 1988 report was not found in 1993 and was considered a
chance finding. Both the 1988 and 1993 studies, found that presence at
the sites had no detectable effect on the risk of developing any other
malignancy. A further study, published in 2003, also confirmed these
findings.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="06051772000027">Paveway IV

Figures for 1998/99 to 2001/02 are points based upon the students best
three A levels. In 2002/03 the UCAS tariff replaced A level scores. The
tariff covers a wider range of qualifications though it is possible to
identify those students with the tariff equivalent of 3 grade Bs (300
points) or 3 grade Cs (240 points). However, tariff score contains an
unlimited number of eligible qualifications, not just the student best
three A levels.  <sup>(2)</sup> Including students with less

clandestine international procurement network. The International Atomic
Energy Agency (IAEA) has also reported that Iran has in its possession
a document describing the procedures for the reduction of UF6 to
uranium metal in small quantities, and the casting of enriched and
depleted uranium metal into hemispheres, related to the fabrication of
nuclear weapon components. The IAEA has indicated that the existence of
this document is a matter of concern. Information has also been made
available to the IAEA concerning possible Iranian work on the design of
a missile re-entry vehicle which could have a military nuclear
dimension. Iran has refused to discuss this information with the
IAEA.</p><p><a name="060517124000042">IAEA Director
General, Dr. ElBaradei, in his report on 2 September 2005 noted that
after &#147;two and a half years of intensive inspections and
investigation, Iran&#146;s full transparency is essential and
long-overdue&#148;. The IAEA is still unable to conclude that there
are no undeclared nuclear materials or activities in Iran. At a press

in recent weeks that Iran might consider withdrawing from the nuclear
non-proliferation treaty (NPT) in certain circumstances. For example,
President Ahmadinejad said on 24 April,</p><a name="060517124000107"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#145;working in
the framework of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and the

adopted a Resolution on Iran under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, the

the NPT.</p><p><a name="060517124000047">Such

claim at the UN General Assembly in September 2005 that
&#145;continued interaction and technical and legal co-operation with
the IAEA will be the centrepiece of our nuclear policy&#146;, and
with the commitment of Iran&#146;s Ambassador to the IAEA in August
2005 that Iran would &#145;never&#146; leave the NPT. They have
presumably been made to influence Security Council deliberations
presently under way. As the IAEA Board and the Security Council have
made clear, Iran needs to build confidence that its nuclear

The next steps will be to establish a working party of WTO members that
indicate an interest, and for Iran to submit a memorandum of foreign
trade regime describing its current trading regime and setting out the
reforms it intends to make in order to ensure that this regime is
compatible with WTO norms. The European Union has traditionally
supported the principle of Iran's accession to the WTO, which should
promote economic reform, liberalisation, transparency and respect for
property rights, and reduce discriminatory trade practices. As part of
the accession process Iran must agree acceptable terms and complete
bilateral negotiations with all interested WTO parties before it could

The Department is using both conventional and public-private

such a high volume of projects in planning, delays have been
encountered in some projects, both under conventional and PPP
procurement, due to site issues, uncertainty over long-term enrolments

have introduced tough new legislation, supported the appointment of a
dedicated senior police officer as national co-ordinator for domestic

satisfied that the information requested is not being sought for a
proper purpose. Following recent attempts to defraud or intimidate
members of a number of leading companies, we are looking at what
measures can be taken to strengthen shareholder protection further in

future use on which to consult locally yet. Any such options will be
determined largely by who takes an interest in purchasing the site when
it is put onto the market. The Home Office continues to work closely
with Centrex on that process and, once options begin to emerge, we will
be in a position to 
<br><notus-date day="17" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>17 May 2006 : Column 1027W</b><br>engage with local people over the future use of the site. The Centrex
estates and facilities management team, along with staff working on

with local planning authorities around all three Centrex sites that are
closing and will be focusing more effort on these discussions over the
coming months.</p><p><a name="06051816000193">Any
change in the use of sites will, of course, require planning permission

Number DNA in serious crime when other options have been exhausted. Low
Copy Number (LCN) DNA analysis is a specialist DNA service and the
decision to use it is purely a police operational matter. In view of
the additional complexity of interpretation and cost implications of
using LCN DNA analysis, each submission to a laboratory during an
investigation will be considered on a case-by-case basis following
discussion with the force Scientific Support Unit. Forces are now
developing strict evaluation criteria for its use in serious
crime.</p><p><a name="06051816000356"><b><a name="06051816001107">Lynne

profiling DNA (SGM+) is very high and while the probabilities vary with
the features of the particular profile, e.g. if the profile is degraded
or only a partial profile, the probability of a &#147;chance&#148;
or &#147;adventitious&#148; match with a full SGM+ to SGM+ is
generally less than one in a billion. In any event, the Crown
Prosecution Service make it very clear that in every case involving a
DNA profile there must also be appropriate supporting evidence before a
case can proceed. It follows that any prosecution should be based on a
DNA profile and other admissible and credible
evidence.</p><p><a name="06051816000358"><b><a name="06051816001109">Lynne

being wrongly convicted solely on the basis of their DNA being found at
a crime scene. A match between DNA taken from an individual and that
from a crime scene is intelligence, indicating that the individual has
been present at the scene?the police and Crown Prosecution Service take
account of the fact that there may be an innocent explanation for this.
Home Office Circular 58/2004 to chief officers states that there should
be further supporting evidence, in addition to the match, before
someone is charged. This is also reflected in guidance issued by the

expected that when prisons face operational pressures there may be an
impact on a range of activities, including education and training,
particularly in hard pressed local prisons. However, since April 2002,
over 150,000 basic skills qualifications have been achieved by learners
in prison.</p><p><a name="06051816000689">The Home
Office and DfES have established the Offenders Learning and Skills

skills for offenders in both custody and the community. This combined
with plans set out in the &#145;Reducing Re-offending through Skills

enable more offenders in custody and those serving their sentences in

printed 3,000 copies of its annual report and accounts for the
financial year 2003-04. Most of these were issued free of charge to
Parliament, colleagues elsewhere in the Home Office and criminal
justice system and senior managers within HMPS. HMPS provided 350
copies to The Stationery Office, the official publishers, who offered
these for sale through their retail outlets at a cover price (fixed by
TSO) of &#163;23. The distribution list used by HMPS is shown in the
following table.</p><p><a name="06051816000695">The
total cost of producing 3,000 copies of the annual report and accounts
2003-04 was approximately &#163;26,000. The contract for design work
was awarded to The Brightside Partnership and the contract for printing
was awarded to Formara Printers. Distribution costs were mostly covered
by HMPS&#146; internal mail and messenger services. Normal postage
costs applied to copies distributed externally and would have amounted
to no more than
&#163;80.</p><p><a name="06051816000696">Copies of
the document are held in the Library. Printed copies of the document
may still be available from TSO outlets at a cost of &#163;23.

published by the Home Office. The Chief Scientific Adviser may decide
not to publish in a Home Office series on the grounds of inadequate
scientific quality following external peer review, as the results are
out of date or for operational reasons. In these circumstances the
researcher is usually released to publish the results through other
means. We do not have a record centrally of which reports released in
this way have subsequently been published in scientific journals or
other non HO
public.</p><p><a name="06051816000881">In other cases

regulation orders outside Greater London and of similar orders within
Greater London. The orders are made by local authorities or the
Secretary of State according to the type of road and can make a wide
range of provisions as to how the road is to be used. The orders are
made in the interests of avoiding danger, preventing damage,
facilitating passage along the road, preventing vehicular use of the
road in a way that is unsuitable for the road or surrounding area,

requirements are often known as the sex offenders register. The

portrayal of women in some parts of the media. However I believe there
is a significant difference between material which is intended or is
likely to stir up hatred and material which may
&#145;objectify&#146; a person and it would be a very large step to
criminalise material in the second group. Moreover, in practical terms
hatred is a concept well understood by the courts&#151;it includes
behaviour which is likely directly to drive up violence and the fear of
violence. It is less clear what &#147;sexually objectifying
material&#148; is and what the direct effects of such material would
be. I believe there would be genuine difficulties for the courts in
defining &#147;sexually objectifying material&#148;. This could
cover a very wide range of material including much that is commonly
available through the media, works of art and comedy
material.</p><p><a name="06051816000912">Legislation,

complicit, would not be admissible in criminal or civil proceedings in
the UK. It does not matter whether the evidence was obtained here or
abroad.</p><p><a name="06051816000960">During the
individual appeals against certification under powers provided under
Part four of the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Act (ATCSA), the
Special Immigration Appeals Commission (SIAC) emphatically rejected any
suggestion that evidence relied upon by the Government was, or even may
have been, obtained by torture. The Court of Appeal later confirmed the
view of SIAC.</p><p><a name="06051816000961">On 8
December 2005 the House of Lords ruled unanimously that evidence
obtained by torture was inadmissible in SIAC proceedings. The decision
will not impact on the Government&#146;s ability to fight terrorism,
or change current practices, as the Government&#146;s own stated
policy was already not to rely on evidence which we knew or believed to
have been obtained as a result of torture. It is not always possible 
<br><notus-date day="17" month="5" year="2006" textMonth="May"></notus-date><b>17 May 2006 : Column 1059W</b><br>to know where all intelligence information has come
from or the precise circumstances under which it was obtained. The
Security Service and Secret Intelligence Service receive material from
a wide range of foreign intelligence services. The agencies evaluate
the reliability of this intelligence against other information
available to them. It is then passed, together with an assessment of
reliability, to the Government. It may be necessary in some
circumstances to rely operationally on material which may have been
obtained through the use of torture where it is considered necessary to
do so, in particular for preventing terrorist attack and protecting
life. The House of Lords&#146; judgment confirmed that material which
had, or may have been, obtained through torture could be used for
operational
purposes.</p><p><a name="06051816000962">We do not
condone torture in any way, nor would we carry out this completely
unacceptable behaviour. However, we do have an obligation to protect
national security and public safety. We would be deficient in this duty
if we did not properly assess all the information available to
us.</p><p><a name="06051816000963"><b><a name="06051816001233">John

will be affected by this ruling. In criminal proceedings in England and
Wales, the courts have a range of powers to prevent the admission of
evidence that may have been obtained improperly or illegally, including
through means of torture. Courts have the discretion to exclude
evidence if it is unduly prejudicial or unfair, and a judicial
discretion to stay proceedings if they are considered to be an abuse of
the court's

the ECHR, the right to a fair trial. Article three of the ECHR also
prohibits torture and inhuman or degrading treatment. In addition, a
confession is not admissible unless it meets the requirements set out
in sections 76 and 78 of Police and Criminal Evidence Act (PACE). That
is, the evidence will not be admissible if it is unreliable or has been
obtained by oppression. Section 76(8) of PACE states that oppression
includes torture, inhuman and degrading treatment and the use or threat
of violence.</p>

significant contribution to economic growth and poverty reduction in
the developing world but that, in many countries, this contribution is
being constrained by problems of poor management. Pressures are being
generated by high demand for fish products in rich countries, by
poverty and the increasing numbers of people having to resort to
fishing to sustain basic livelihoods and, in some places, by developed
countries subsidising their own fleets to move into the waters of
poorer countries.</p><p><a name="06051819000058">In
the long run, the contribution of sustainable fishing to the economies
of developing countries can only be realised if the rich countries take
into account the impact of their policies on developing countries and
if the latter have the capacity to manage! their own resources in a
sustainable way</p><p><a name="06051819000059">DFID
is working hard to ensure that international fisheries policy takes
account of impacts on developing countries. Particular problems are
being caused by illegal fishing&#151;DFID-funded research has found
that countries in Sub-Saharan Africa are losing as much as $1 billion a
year from this alone. DFID is now working closely with DEFRA to support
the development of an international plan of action to tackle illegal
