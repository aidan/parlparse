There are around 3,000 refugees in official sites in Mwaro and Muyinga provinces. The UN Mission in Burundi (ONUB) has increased its patrols in the area where Banyamulenge are known to be living and will monitor protection arrangements efforts promised by the Burundi authorities.

<p><a name="50131w01.html_spnew3"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 Cyclical periods of drought and cassava pest (manioc mosaic) are having an adverse impact on the availability of food and on household&#039;s capacity to produce food in the northern provinces of Burundi. The World Food Programme (WFP) has said it will assist 520,000 people in the provinces of Kirundo and Muyinga for the next two months. This month it delivered 1,485 metric tonnes of food aid to 176,000 people in the communes of Busoni, Bugabira and Kirundo.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50131w01.html_para3">
Distribution of food aid and emergency agricultural inputs (seeds and tools) have been increased since July 2004, but these have had a limited impact because of poor rains, extremely low productivity of the land, reduced arable land by household and the poor health status of the population. The negative impact of these combined factors on food security and nutrition show the widespread and extreme fragility of an average Burundian household.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50131w01.html_para4">
DFID has contributed &#163;750,000 to the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) through the UN Consolidated Appeal for emergency agriculture activities in an effort to improve the food security situation. The WFP has said it has enough funding for food aid for the next five months. We are concentrating our efforts on food security through the FAO and looking at other support in an effort to prevent a recurrence of the present situation.

<p><a name="50131w01.html_spnew5"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 The last 18 months has seen the formation of many new Iraqi Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) seeking to address and articulate the rights of ordinary Iraqis. CSOs include such bodies as non-governmental organisations, professional unions and associations, faith-based organisations, government and legislative bodies. With little history of independent civil society in Iraq, many of these CSOs lack capacity. DFID&#039;s Civil Society Fund (CSF), a two year programme with a budget of &#163;5 million, seeks to strengthen the capacity of Iraqi CSOs to better address the needs of poor, vulnerable and socially excluded groups, especially women and young people. Much of the fund is aimed at building links between Iraqi and international CSOs. However, direct funding for Iraqi CSOs is also available.

 At the Global Partners&#039; Forum on orphans and vulnerable children in Washington DC in December 2004, my hon. Friend, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, announced how DFID would be meeting its spending target of at least &#163;150 million on orphans and vulnerable children over the next three years. This included &#163;38 million to be delivered through UNICEF for work in Africa.
</p>


<p>

DFID plans to work very closely with UNICEF to support elements of the Rapid Assessment Analysis Action Planning Process (RAAAP) plans in some of the countries in Africa which are most affected by AIDS&#151;this includes six Southern African countries: Angola, Botswana, Swaziland, Namibia, Lesotho and South Africa under a regional programme estimated at &#163;18 million over three years, and in a separate programme of support in Zimbabwe.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50131w02.html_para2">
The support DFID provides will be based upon the UNICEF Framework for the protection, care and support of orphans and vulnerable children living in a world with HIV/AIDS, which aims to: strengthen families&#039; ability to cope, through such things as financial credits, child care and developing skills; start and support community-based responses, largely through involving local leaders; ensure that vulnerable children have access to essential services, such as education and health care; ensure that governments protect the children that are the most vulnerable; and, finally, raise awareness to create an environment that understands and supports those children.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50131w02.html_para3">
DFID is also planning to work with UNICEF and provide assistance to strengthen the capacity and competence of UNICEF&#039;s Eastern and Southern Africa Regional Office (ESARO). This is in order that RAAAP plans can be built into wider planning and implementation processes and interventions are based on firm evidence about their effectiveness. We are also developing a programme of support to UNICEF in New York so that they can provide global oversight and develop country commitment and the means to monitor and track the international response to meeting the needs of vulnerable children.

We are working though our bilateral programmes in DFID&#039;s target countries in Africa, with Government, and civil society organisations to address the needs of vulnerable children.

 The Department for International Development&#039;s humanitarian response to the tsunami disaster in Sri Lanka has been channelled through United Nations agencies, the Red Cross movement, and non-governmental organisations and in direct in kind interventions aimed at addressing immediate needs.

We are also considering proposals from 12 other NGOs regarding transitional shelter, water and sanitation and livelihoods support. The assistance that DFID has provided, and is supporting, is geographically spread throughout the country. This includes substantial support to Tamil communities in proportion to needs across the country.

DFID&#039;s focus for longer-term reconstruction in Sri Lanka is likely to be on providing support to the rebuilding of livelihoods and services for poor people in affected regions.

Non-governmental organisations have commented that the WFP has done a very good job at short notice in distributing food but are concerned about medium-term implications of distributing large quantities of food. DFID will remain in contact with the WFP on discussions about potential longer-term food aid requirements to ensure these are both appropriate and cost effective.

It has produced guidance on domestic oil storage in collaboration with the Federation of Petroleum Suppliers and OFTEC and strongly recommends that these guidelines are followed at all times, and that domestic oil storage facilities are installed and maintained by qualified technicians to ensure compliance with relevant British Standards.

In order to combat the problem of cloning and preventing people obtaining number plates to which they are not entitled, the Government have introduced measures to tighten up the supply of plates. Since 1 January 2003 all suppliers of number plates have been required to register with DVLA and to keep records of sales. Purchasers of plates are required to produce evidence of their identity as well as the vehicle registration document. Number plate suppliers who fail to comply with these requirements can be fined up to 5,000 and suspended from the register for up to five years. The Road Safety Bill currently before Parliament will extend the register of number plate suppliers to Scotland and Northern Ireland.

<p>
<a name="50131w10.html_para0">
The European Commission&#039;s annual &quot;Fight Against Fraud&quot; report publishes the amounts of irregularities reported each year by member states. The most recent report covered 2003. The figures published were:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">Own Resources total irregularities declined from &#8364;342 million in 2002 to &#8364;270 million in 2003&#151;down 21 per cent.;</p>

<p class="tabletext">Structural Funds went down from &#8364;614 million to &#8364;482 million&#151;down 22 per cent.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50131w10.html_para1">
When added together, the total irregularities reported in 2003 were &#8364;921 million&#151;a reduction of 20 per cent. from the &#8364;1,154 million reported in 2002.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50131w10.html_para2">
The Commission&#039;s report deliberately does not provide a breakdown between cases of irregularity and fraud, fraud is defined and treated differently in each member state. Past estimates made by OLAF (the EU Anti-Fraud office) have suggested that around 20 per cent. of reported irregularities may turn out to be fraud. Applying this to the 2003 figure would suggest that the amount of fraud could be around &#8364;185 million. This would represent around 0.2 per cent. of total EC Budget expenditure in 2003.

Forecasts from 2002 suggested that costs would reach around &#8364;1.5 billion by 2015 but then stabilise in real terms. The Commission reforms of 2003 helped to reduce this future burden by increasing the retirement age to 63, abolishing correction co-efficients and increasing contributions from ED officials.

Similarly families with severely disabled 3 and 4 year old children who are unable, or virtually unable to walk will have benefited from the Government&#039;s decision to lower the minimum age entitlement to the higher rate mobility component of disability living allowance from April 2001, while older and less well off carers have gained extra help through the provisions within the National Carers Strategy.

Significant progress has been made in eradicating child poverty and the latest figures for 2002&#150;03 show that, in the UK, there were over half a million fewer children in relative low income than there were in 1996&#150;97.

In April 2005 the child allowance rate in income support for a child up to 18 years old will have been increased by 40 per cent. since 2001&#150;02.

<i>Letter from David Anderson to Dr. Vincent Cable, dated 31 January 2005:</i>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your question concerning the response times on telephone calls. You asked specifically about the response times before telephone numbers which are advertised to the public are answered, the percentage of time in a working day when lines are not engaged and what the most recent figures are for the performance against these standards. This is something which falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">Jobcentre Plus has a Customers&#039; Charter which sets out the level of service that customers can expect when dealing with us, including the standards we aim for when answering telephone calls. The current standard states &quot;when you phone us or use a textphone we aim to answer your call within 30 seconds&quot;. The Charter is available from our local offices or can be printed from the internet through the Jobcentre Plus website. I have placed a copy of the latest version of the Charter in the Library.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">This standard has been in place since the introduction of Jobcentre Plus and applies equally to all areas of the business&#151;whether delivered through our local offices or through the network of modern contact centres that we are putting in place.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">In the Jobcentre Plus National Customer Satisfaction Survey 2003, a copy of which is available in the Library, we asked our customers if this standard still met their expectations. Of those respondents who normally contacted us by telephone 69 per cent. felt that it was reasonable to wait at least 30 seconds and nearly two thirds of those people considered it reasonable to wait over a minute.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">However, although the length of time taken is considered reasonable by many of our customers we endeavour to answer all incoming calls as quickly as possible for the people who need our services.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">You asked for our most recent figures for performance in two separate areas. The performance of the 30 second response time is measured in two ways: through a Mystery Shopping Programme which measures performance against a range of service standards as defined in our Customer Service Target; and by Management Information from our contact centre network. I have provided that information. However, our telephony systems do not measure the percentage of time in a working day when lines are not engaged and I am therefore unable to respond to that part of your question.</p>

We therefore use the Mystery Shopping programme to undertake telephone calls on a sampled basis at a level that will provide us with robust information for the network as a whole.</p>

The National Institute for Economic and Social Research (NIESR) undertook a detailed macro-economic analysis of NDYP until March 2000 <sup>1</sup> . NIESR calculated the net budgetary cost per job was &#163;7,000 per annum (excluding the Environmental Task Force and Voluntary Sector options) or &#163;4,000 per annum when these two options are included. The National Audit Office report <sup>2</sup> suggested that the average annual cost per additional person of any age in employment through new deal for young people is within the range of &#163;5,000-&#163;8,000.

<p>
<a name="50131w14.html_para6">

Evidence on the cost-effectiveness of new deal for lone parents (NDLP) comes from the provisional cost benefit analysis of NDLP carried out by departmental economists. The findings were published in the NDLP Evaluation Synthesis Report in June 2003 <sup>3</sup> . The unit costs of NDLP in 2000&#150;01 were &#163;400 per participant. The gross cost per job was around &#163;860.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50131w14.html_para9">
A calculation of cost-effectiveness takes into account the additional earnings from movements into work and the costs of running the programme in 2000&#150;01. NDLP provided a significant net economic gain to society, with a net benefit of over &#163;4,400 from each additional job, and a total net gain of &#163;115 million.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50131w14.html_para10">
The net impact on public finance was also calculated. This included the cost of in-work credits and benefits such as the working families&#039; tax credit. NDLP in 2001&#150;02 resulted in a net exchequer saving of &#163;1,600 for each additional job entry; a total saving of &#163;41.5 million.

 Employers running occupational pension schemes are subject to their individual scheme rules.

 The Government works with the police and industry to tackle fraud and other online crime through a number of initiatives. A key factor in dealing with online fraud is prevention and education and the Government take an active role in educating computer users about the risks of fraud committed through the internet. The Home Office website provides advice on avoiding internet fraud and the Home Office has also created, and maintains the &#039;e-tailing mini site&#039;, which forms part of the crime reduction website. The mini site provides information to help both businesses and consumers protect themselves specifically when using the internet.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50131w17.html_para8">
The Consumer Protection (Distance Selling) Regulations 2000 protect consumers against payment card fraud including credit cards. The Regulations apply to contracts made at a distance including online ones. The Card issuer is required to reimburse consumers the full amount in the event of fraudulent use of the consumer&#039;s card.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50131w17.html_para9">
In addition, the Consumer Credit Act 1974 also allows consumers to recover the cost of a purchase made by credit card from either the supplier or the credit card provider. This provides additional protection should a consumer be unable to trace the company they were dealing with over the internet. The Banking Code stipulates the consumers&#039; liability for misuse of a card will be limited unless there is evidence that they have acted fraudulently or without reasonable care.

The Consumer Protection (Distance Selling) Regulations 2000 are included in a list of EC Directives, which is part of the Injunctions Directive. The Injunctions Directive requires all member states to have in place arrangements, which will allow certain unlawful actions harmful to consumers to be stopped in good time. The Injunctions Directive allows consumer protection bodies designated by the member states to apply to the courts or competent administrative authorities for orders to require traders to cease conduct that constitutes a breach of any of the consumer protection directives specified. Part 8 of the Enterprise Act 2002 implements the Injunctions Directive in the UK.

Co-operation arrangements exist to ensure we can tackle scams that cross borders. In Europe member states have just agreed a Regulation (Consumer Protection Co-operation) to ensure that all consumer protection enforcement agencies are working closely together to combat cross border scams, and 30 OECD countries have all signed up to a co-operation agreement to tackle cross border fraud that affects consumers. The International Consumer Protection Enforcement Network (ICPEN) is a network of consumer protection enforcement agencies in over 30 countries that exists to facilitate cross border co-operation on cross border scams and consumer fraud.

The Home Office has published, jointly with the Association for Payment Clearing Services (APACS) a leaflet on card safety, which includes a section on using cards safely over the internet. The leaflet has been sent to all police forces in England and Wales, and to Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships. It is also available on the Home Office website and the e-tailing mini site, and APACS members (banks) will be sending a version of the leaflet to their cardholders.

The Home Office is represented on an industry-led Steering Group, which aims to tackle &#039;Card Not Present&#039; (CNP) fraud (which includes fraud over the internet). We support practical measures being introduced by the industry to increase levels of security for internet transactions. These include Address Verification Services (AVS) and Card Security Code (CSC), along with Mastercard Secure Code and Verified by Visa which require password verification for internet transactions. These initiatives are already making a significant impact on CNP Fraud. The work of the CNP Steering Group has also led to the production of a manual (Spot and Stop Card Fraud Retailer Pack), which aims to educate merchants on the dangers of CNP fraud and the steps which can be taken to prevent it.

We have changed the licensing laws to allow people to hold and attend commercial dances on Sunday, to make it easier for restaurants to open an hour later, and to relax the alcohol licensing hours from 11 pm on New Year&#039;s Eve to 11 am on New Year&#039;s Day in all future years; and we have given the police greater powers to take action against under-age drinking and disorderly and noisy licensed premises. The Licensing Act 2003, when fully implemented, will introduce a streamlined, consistent and fair licensing regime for the provision of alcohol, public entertainment and late night refreshment It will provide greater choice for consumers, bring regeneration and increased employment opportunities and protect local residents whose lives have been blighted by disturbance and antisocial behaviour.

The Licensing Act 2003 (Commencement) Order 2003 repealed those parts of the Licensing Act 1964 which allowed the local government electorate in the counties and county boroughs of Wales to requisition polls to decide whether licensed premises should be allowed to open on Sundays. This has removed the uncertainty which businesses in Wales, including those in Preseli Pembrokeshire, faced, allowing them to exercise long-term planning. It also removes a costly administrative burden on local authorities and an artificial difference in licensing controls between Wales and England, which prevented businesses and customers exercising freedom of choice.

Because the rating list does not distinguish between those occupied by large companies with many small hereditaments from those occupied by businesses occupying a single hereditament, the Government conducted research in early 2004 on the likely eligibility for the relief.

 To ask the Deputy Prime Minister how many departmental files have been destroyed in each of the past five years.  [203387]</p>




<p><a name="50131w23.html_spnew7"><b> Yvette Cooper: </b> 
 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister was created in May 2002. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister also provides a records management service to the Department for Transport. Actual numbers of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister&#039;s files destroyed each year prior to 2004 could be provided only at disproportionate cost but an informed estimate for the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and Department for Transport combined is as follows.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50131w23.html_para7">
2002&#151;23,500; 2003&#151;20,800; 2004 (to 6 December) 53,252. A further 23,400 files are awaiting destruction.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50131w23.html_para8">
Files continue to be destroyed in accordance with well established procedures. Files which are not viewed as having permanent historical value are marked out for destruction after a specified period. At the end of this period files are destroyed by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister&#039;s contractors, once confirmation has been received that there is no business reason for, or historical value in, retaining them. In 2002 and 2003 a backlog of files awaiting destruction developed due to machinery of Government changes and the closure of the Hayes Records Repository. The higher figure for files destroyed in 2004 reflects work to clear that backlog, although this still stands at 23,400 files.

 The fuel prices used in the Standard Assessment Procedure are reviewed at intervals of between three and five years.

 We recognise the importance of ensuring that children and families are protected from the perpetrators of domestic violence or child abuse.

In framing the regulations and guidance we will take care to address the issue of protection from the perpetrators of domestic violence or abuse.

Where information on a child is held on the index, and a parent makes a request to access that information, their rights to access that information are balanced by the rights of the child. For children of sufficient maturity (which for the vast majority of children is taken to mean aged 12 or over), the right under the Data Protection Act to access data held about the child on the index will belong to the child rather than to the parent. So there will be no obligation on the person with responsibility for managing and operating the index (the data controller) to disclose information to a parent in such cases.

<p><a name="50131w27.html_spnew5"><b> Margaret Hodge: </b> 
 One of the Sure Start principles is that parents and children have access to services that are tailored flexibly according to their needs and circumstances. We issued children&#039;s centre start up guidance to local authorities in February 2003. This said that children&#039;s centres must not only consult parents and carers, including fathers, on what services to offer, but must also actively involve them by setting up systems to get their feedback on services and having on-going arrangements to ensure parents have a voice. There must also be mechanisms in place to enable parents to self-refer to services. Children&#039;s centres should implement specific strategies to include fathers. Family support and health advice must be available at times suitable for working parents. There should also be opportunities for family learning to take place at the centre or in settings linked to the centre such as FE colleges.

Notes:<br>

1. Price base: Cash.<br>

2. Figures reflect relevant sub-blocks of education EPS settlements and include the pensions transfer to EPS and LSC. EPS is paid to authorities as a combination of central Government grant and council tax raised locally.<br>

3. Total funding also includes all revenue grants in DfES Departmental Expenditure Limits relevant to pupils aged 3&#150;10 and excludes EMAs and grants not allocated at LEA level. For those LEAs in receipt of advance of grant under the transitional support arrangements for 2004&#150;05, advance grant funding is included in the year of payment (2004&#150;05). There will be a consequential reduction in DfES grant for these LEAs in future years (either 2006&#150;07 and 2007&#150;08 or 2006&#150;07 to 2008&#150;09) depending on the terms which the advance was given to the LEA.<br>

4. The pupil numbers used to convert &#163;m figures to &#163; per pupil are those underlying the EPS settlement calculations.<br>

5. Rounding: Figures are rounded to the nearest 10.<br>

6. Status: 2004&#150;05 figures are provisional as some grants have not yet been finalised/audited.<br>

 The Government are committed to supporting the development of extended schools, to offer enrichment activities and child care to parents and children. By 2010 all parents with children aged 5&#150;11 will be offered the guarantee of affordable child care between the hours of 8 am to 6 pm, all year round. Provision could be available in a local school, in a neighbouring school or on a different site, provided by the school or in partnership with voluntary and private sector providers, including local childminders. Half of all parents will be able to enjoy this service by 2008. For secondary school aged children, all secondary schools will, by 2010, be open 8 am to 6 pm all year round offering a range of interesting activities. By 2008 we want at least a third of all secondary schools making this offer.

 The Secretary of State has not had any direct discussions with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. However, as announced in the House on 12 February 2004, Sir Alan Langlands has been commissioned to produce a report on the gateways to the professions, which will examine how the public sector and the professions can sustain and improve recruitment opportunities for graduates, especially those who do not qualify for the full &#163;3,000 support. One of the areas which he has been looking at is veterinary science. In addition my officials are in touch with officials in Defra. We expect that Sir Alan will make recommendations on entry to the professions, which will include veterinary science, when he reports in the summer.

<p><a name="50131w33.html_spnew3"><b> Ms Blears: </b> 
 The death of any young person in custody (or elsewhere) is a terrible tragedy. I send my deepest sympathy for the family of Gareth Price, who died on 20 January after being found hanging while on remand at Lancaster Farms Young Offender Institution. The Government take very seriously the issue of self-harm and suicide in the juvenile custodial estate and have taken a range of steps to try to prevent it. We are currently looking at what further measures may be needed.

 The Drug Interventions Programme (formerly Criminal Justice Interventions Programme) is a critical part of the Government&#039;s national strategy for tackling drugs. The programme aims to make the most of opportunities provided by the criminal justice system to get drug misusing offenders out of crime and into treatment.

The UN High Commissioner for Refugees has based its recommendations on a broad assessment of conditions in Zimbabwe generally. Asylum and human rights decisions are not based on general conditions in a country, they are made case by case according to the risk that the individual applicant would face. Asylum and human rights claims by Zimbabwean nationals are considered on their individual merits in accordance with our obligations under the 1951 UN Refugee Convention and the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR).

Each application is considered against the background of the latest available country information from a wide range of reliable sources including the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, other international organisations, non-governmental organisations, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the media. Decisions are based on the specific circumstances of the individual concerned. It is clear that there are Zimbabweans in need of international protection, but if an asylum and human rights claim is refused, and any appeal to the independent appellate authorities is unsuccessful, that means that it would be safe for that particular individual to return to Zimbabwe.

Prior to military action in Iraq there were no functioning meters in the Iraqi oil system. At the handover of authority on 28 June 2004 the issue remained outstanding.

The Iraqi Ministry of Oil is responsible for ensuring meters are installed on Iraq&#039;s oil wellheads. The Ministry has established a committee to develop and install a metering system for the entire Iraqi oil industry. However a comprehensive system to measure crude oil output is a complex task beginning in the oil fields themselves. This involves conducting a design study that will identify the type of meters and their locations required for measuring crude oil.

<p><a name="50131w39.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Alexander: </b> 
 In December 2004 the Lahore High Court annulled the Juvenile Justice System Ordinance 2000 which, if implemented, would effectively reinstate the possibility of the death sentence for juvenile offenders in Punjab province of Pakistan. On 17 December 2004 the EU made a demarche to the Pakistan authorities to raise their concerns on this and other human rights concerns. Officials from our high commission in Islamabad have also raised this bilaterally with Pakistani officials. The UK is entirely opposed to the death penalty, which it considers to be a cruel and inhuman punishment, and notes that the imposition of the death penalty on those under 18 at the time of the crime is contrary to the Convention on the Rights of the Child to which Pakistan is a signatory. We hope that steps can be taken by the relevant Pakistani authorities to ensure that the death penalty for juvenile offenders is not reinstated as a result of this recent annulment by the Lahore High Court.

 There are a wide range of measures and programmes which both directly and indirectly tackle fuel poverty.

<p><a name="50131w44.html_spnew7"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 During the QinetiQ Vesting process, the potential for such conflicts of interest was considered. To ensure any such conflicts were properly addressed the Ministry of Defence ownership interest in QinetiQ was kept completely separate from the Department&#039;s competitive contract placement activities. Compliance processes were also implemented to ensure the advice QinetiQ provides to MOD is independent of commercial contracts that could give rise to a potential conflict of interest.

 The only restriction that has been placed on the ability of QinetiQ to compete for the Ministry of Defence contracts is the compliance regime which was put in place when QinetiQ was created in 2001. This regime prevents QinetiQ from entering into commercial relationships which would create an unmanageable conflict of interest and prejudice the company&#039;s ability to provide impartial advice to MOD.

Notes:<br>

1. East Sussex Hospitals NHS Trust (RXC) was formed in 2002&#150;03 by merging Eastbourne Hospitals (RDL) and part of Hastings and Rother (RDM).<br>

2. A finished in-year admission is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider, excluding admissions beginning before 1 April at the start of the datayear. Please note that admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>

3. Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (ie the data are ungrossed).<br>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health pursuant to his answer of 16 December 2004, <i>Official Report</i>, column 1319W, if he will estimate what savings have been made by <i>(a)</i> increasing the generic prescribing rate for all practices in England and <i>(b)</i> moving at least half of those practices with a generic prescribing rate below 40 per cent. to above that level.

 Specific generic targets were set to maintain the momentum to increase rational and cost-effective prescribing and were achieved in 2002, when the generic prescribing rate across all practices in England reached an average of 72 per cent.

<p>
<a name="50131w47.html_para8">
We do not estimate potential savings that might accrue from incremental changes to overall generic prescribing rates or components within the overall rate. However, we estimate that current levels of generic prescribing and dispensing mean that the national health service spends around &#163;750 million a year less than if only branded medicines were prescribed.

<p><a name="50131w48.html_spnew0"><b> Miss Melanie Johnson: </b> 
 Nutrition is a key component of a healthy start in life and schools, alongside parents and carers, have a role in shaping the habits and eating behaviours of children. As set out in the Government White Paper, &quot;Choosing Health: Making healthier choices easier&quot;, we want to see all schools deliver clear and consistent messages about nutrition and healthy eating, provide opportunities to learn about diet, nutrition, food safety and hygiene, good preparation and cooking as well as where food comes from and actively promote healthy food as part of an enjoyable balanced diet. This message is supported by a number of activities and White Paper commitments regarding nutrition in schools, including:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">Funding of &#163;77 million is being provided over 2004&#150;06 to enable over two million children (all four to six-year-old children in local education authority- maintained infant, primary and special schools throughout England) to receive a free piece of fruit or vegetable every school day.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">The Government aim is that half of all schools will be part of the healthy schools programme by 2006, with the rest working towards healthy school status by 2009. From April 2005, a healthy school will provide a supportive environment, including policies on healthy and nutritious food.</p>

<p><a name="50131w48.html_spnew2"><b> Miss Melanie Johnson: </b> 
 I am advised by the Food Standards Agency, which has responsibility for food safety matters, that the regulatory controls in respect of imports from non-European Union countries are comprehensive, and for the most part are EU based and operate EU wide. Controls for the import of products not of animal origin will be EU harmonised from January 2006.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50131w48.html_para0">
Imported food from non-EU countries is subject to checks at ports of entry by local authorities under imported food legislation. Also, food products, whether from outside or within the EU, are subject to the same checks by local authorities as United Kingdom produced food.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50131w48.html_para1">
The Agency works closely with a number of other Government departments on imported food enforcement matters. Statutory guidance on imported food was issued by the Agency to local authorities in June 2004.

<br>&nbsp;<br><i>31 Jan 2005 : Column 750W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>



<p><a name="50131w48.html_spnew3"><b> Miss Melanie Johnson  </b> 
<i>[holding answer 10 January 2005]</i>: Specific training programmes will be determined and implemented locally according to the requirements of the staff and the local area. This information is not collected centrally but recommendations on training are included in the guidelines on Prevention of healthcare&#151;associated infections in primary and community care produced by the National Institute of Clinical Excellence.

<p><a name="50131w48.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 The Department does not provide direction on the content of undergraduate medical courses, as higher education institutions (HEIs) are autonomous bodies. Individual medical schools determine their own curriculum in the light of recommendations from the General Medical Council&#039;s (CMC&#039;s) education committee.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50131w48.html_para3">
Medical schools organise practice placements for medical students through strategic health authority workforce directorates in a variety of hospital, community and primary care settings.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50131w48.html_para4">
We do not hold data on practice placements and have no plans to commission specific research. However, we do share a commitment with the GMC, the Council of Heads of Medical Schools and other relevant bodies that all health professionals are trained so that they have the skills and knowledge to deliver a high quality health service to all groups of the population with whom they deal. I am aware of the British Medical Association&#039;s recent publication, &quot;Healthcare in a rural setting&quot;, which recommends a greater accent on placements in such settings. I will draw this report to the attention of the relevant bodies.

<a name="50131w48.html_sbhd5"><h3 align=center>Multiple Sclerosis</h3>


<p><a name="50131w48.html_wqn5"><b> Mr. Gray: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Health (1) for what percentage of people with multiple sclerosis the timeframe laid down in the National Institute for Clinical Excellence Clinical Guidelines for the Management of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) of 12 weeks between general practitioner referral and completion of investigations was met in the last period for which figures are available;  [208843]

Information on waiting times for in-patient and out-patient treatment in England is collected by consultant speciality rather than for specific conditions.

<p><a name="50131w49.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 The Government have made no proposals to change the existing pension assessment arrangements for scheme members whose pensions are currently assessed on a final salary basis. The NHS Confederation consultation document on the review of the national health service pensions scheme, produced jointly with the NHS staff side, seeks views on the merits of final salary and career average assessment but makes no recommendation. The Government will consider the responses to the consultation when complete.

<p><a name="50131w49.html_spnew6"><b> Miss Melanie Johnson: </b> 
 The Government are committed to halting the rise in childhood obesity and have outlined their strategy for doing so in &quot;Choosing Health: making healthy choices easier&quot;. This includes a new cross-Government campaign to raise awareness of the health risks of obesity and the steps people can take through diet and physical activity to prevent obesity. We have already taken a number of steps to increase awareness of issues relating to obesity during the &quot;Choosing Health&quot; consultation last year, including staging a conference on obesity and publishing separate consultation papers, &quot;Choosing a Better Diet&quot; and &quot;Choosing Activity&quot;. Ministers and senior officials have presented at a wide range of conferences and seminars on obesity throughout the year and continue to do so.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50131w49.html_para0">
This builds on the five-a-day programme, which includes a number of initiatives to inform consumers of the benefits of eating a variety of at least five portions of fruit and vegetables a day as part of a healthy balanced diet, which can help to maintain a healthy weight. Last summer, Sport England also piloted a social marketing campaign to increase exercise in the north east of England. The &quot;Everyday Sport&quot; campaign focused on opportunities for people to include more physical activity in their daily routine and will contribute to the evidence base for an obesity awareness campaign. The Department also funds a range of non-governmental organisations to increase awareness of the benefits of healthy diet and active lifestyles.
