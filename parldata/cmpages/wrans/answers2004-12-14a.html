<p><a name="qn_0"><a name="41214w01.html_wqn0"><b> Vera Baird: </b> 
 To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Department for Constitutional Affairs, what <i>(a)</i> advice and <i>(b)</i> training is given to judges to help them to deal with family cases in which there is an application by a party who faces an allegation of (i) domestic violence and (ii) sexual abuse to cross-examine the other party about those allegations.  [204001]</p>








<p><a name="st_0"><a name="41214w01.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Leslie: </b> 
 Judicial training is the responsibility of the Judicial Studies Board, an independent body chaired by Lord Justice Keene. In the Family Jurisdiction, where the alleged victim of domestic violence or sexual abuse is an adult, the alleged perpetrator who disputes the allegation is entitled to cross-examine the alleged victim. This is either in person if they are not legally represented, or by their advocate. The entitlement arises in the interests of justice and a fair trial. Where the alleged perpetrator exercises their entitlement to cross-examine, judges are taught of the need to balance the needs of justice with the needs of the alleged victims. Those needs of the alleged victim include not being subjected to any oppressive, insensitive, or unnecessarily prolonged questioning. If the alleged victim is a child, the child hardly ever gives evidence. His or her account is obtained earlier in an interview which is videoed.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41214w01.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_0">All judges trying cases of this gravity will have been trained among other things in the need for that sensitivity, as well as advised about the impact of domestic violence and sexual abuse on their victims.

 Many items of correspondence are returned to Defra, often because of incorrect or poor addressing by the senders in the first place. We endeavour to keep returned mail to a minimum. That is why an internal memo was issued recently to all Defra staff drawing attention to the need to address envelopes correctly. All Defra staff would have seen the memo in our weekly Office Notice. Drafting and circulating the memo took a couple of minutes and involved significantly less time than answering the hon. Gentleman&#039;s questions. Records of incorrectly addressed envelopes are not maintained because of disproportionate costs. As the memo was intended for internal use, there is no reason to place a copy in the House Library, but the text of the note was as follows:

 The whole point of the incorporation of the European Charter on Human Rights into domestic law was to allow human rights considerations to be considered fully at every level of the legal system as a matter of course rather than having to be considered separately and laboriously as a single issue.

 The regional climate change partnerships are stakeholder-led groups which determine their own work programmes on the impacts of climate change and adaptation. The Department funds the UK Climate Impacts Programme (UKCIP) to help UK organisations assess and prepare for the impacts of climate change. UKCIP works with the regional climate change partnerships, but the partnerships do not receive direct funding from this source. However, many other national, regional and local level public sector organisations are represented in the partnerships, providing varying amounts of both financial and in-kind resource. Private sector organisations are also represented.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland whether it is his policy that the Capital Formula Review should redistribute resources in line with population changes; and when the new formula will be applied.  [204115]</p>









<p><a name="st_47"><a name="41214w06.html_spnew4"><b> Angela Smith: </b> 
 The capitation formula has always taken account of population changes. The impact of such changes has to be considered alongside the changes in the other factors in the formula in determining the speed of implementation of shifts in the resource allocation pattern. The public consultation period for the new formula finished on 30 November 2004. My officials are currently considering the responses, and I intend to make a decision on the implementation of a revised formula in the New Year.

 Following consultation with Northern Ireland Departments, the Public Record Office of Northern Ireland issued the Northern Ireland Records Management Standard (NIRMS) in 2002 as records management guidance for those Departments. It was augmented in 2003 with &#039;Guidelines on Information Audits and Disposal Schedules&#039;. The guidance supports the carrying out of Departmental and PRONI responsibilities under the Public Records Act (NI) 1923.

As a Whitehall Department coming under the Public Records Act 1958, the Northern Ireland Office receives its formal records management advice from The National Archives (formerly the Public Record Office). The National Archives is developing on an on-going basis a range of guidance for Whitehall Departments. Therefore the NIRMS guidance does not apply to that Department.

Figures are inclusive of non-recoverable VAT and presented in &#163; millions.

The Net Cash Requirement (NCR) is the actual money that MOD requests from the Government in order to fund its activities.

 All good procurement and contract management should be rooted in a very clear understanding of the skills that the contractor needs to demonstrate to deliver the contract outcome we seek. To support this approach, guidance was developed by my Department in November 2003, with the assistance of the Treasury and Office of Government Commerce, to outline how Government Departments working within the scope of the procurement policy and legal framework can consider the literacy, language and numeracy skills required to deliver contracts, and how they can work with prospective and existing contractors to ensure that their staff have, or are able to develop relevant skills.

1. Figures are rounded to the nearest hundred.<br>

2. Totals may not sum due to rounding.<br>

3. Income support replaced supplementary benefit in April 1988.<br>

4. Up to and including 1987, pensioners are defined as claimants of pensionable age. From 1988 pensioners are defined as benefit units where either the claimant and/or partner are aged 60 or over.<br>

5. Unemployed claimants are included in the figures up to and including August 1996. Income support for the unemployed was replaced by income-based jobseeker&#039;s allowance in October 1996.<br>

6. Figures are based on sample data and are therefore subject to a degree of sampling error.<br>

7. All figures relate to a point in time. For 1979 the month of the enquiry was November, for 1980 to 1984 the month was December, for 1986 the month was February and for 1987 to 2004 the month was May.<br>

8. From 1999 income support for pensioners became the minimum income guarantee.<br>

5. Individual recipients include claimants and partners only and may contain a small number of partners aged under 60.<br>

6. Pension credit average amounts are lower than minimum income guarantee average amounts for three main reasons:<br>

(a) Some recipients of pension credit receive the savings element only, for which there was no equivalent in minimum income guarantee. The maximum award of the savings element is &#163;15.51 for single pensioners and &#163;20.22 for couples.<br>

(b) Funding of child allowances was transferred to the child tax credit on 6 October 2003.<br>

(c) Residential allowance funding was transferred to local authorities on 6 October 2003.<br>

 Draft Minerals Policy Statement 1 &quot;Planning and Minerals&quot; (MPS1), is the most recent advice the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has sent to local planning authorities about minerals extraction and special landscape areas. It states that one of the Government&#039;s key objectives for minerals planning is to protect nationally designated areas of landscape from minerals development (that is National Parks and Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty), other than in exceptional circumstances. It also indicates that Mineral Planning Authorities should have regard generally to the need to protect the wider undeveloped countryside and seek to minimise the impact of minerals development on its quality and character. Mineral planning authorities will have to take into account MPS1, as they prepare their development plans and consider the selection of any sites for minerals development. In respect of landscape protection, proposed policies in MPS1 are not materially different from existing policy in Minerals Planning Guidance Notes 1 and 6.

 First-time buyers who purchased property within the Greater London area during 2003 faced mortgage repayments equivalent to an estimated 22.6 per cent. of their income. The equivalent figure for first-time buyers for the whole of the United Kingdom was 19.9 per cent.

</ul>
<p>

1. The incomes of first-time buyers are as recorded on their mortgage application forms and will include single or combined incomes depending on whether they were single or joint buyers. The information is derived from mortgage completions data obtained through the Survey of Mortgage Lenders.
2. The basis for the calculation is that all mortgages applied for were repayment mortgages (as opposed to an interest-only mortgages). For buyers who actually opted for an interest-only mortgage, their repayments as a percent of their income would have been slightly lower.

 The Department is currently investigating the benefits that identity cards would bring for the national health service and for patients. We anticipate that ID cards will make the existing eligibility checks easier for staff and more robust. We therefore expect extra income from charging chargeable patients, reduced inappropriate use of free NHS services and efficiency gains from quicker processing of patients, This will also bring benefits to patients, as they will be able to demonstrate their eligibility speedily through

 No. The European Health Insurance Card (EHIC), which replaces the E111, serves an entirely different function from the ID card. The EHIC is used when travelling in other European Economic Area member states to access free or reduced cost healthcare, the need for which becomes medically necessary during the trip, on the same basis as residents of that country. The EHIC will be voluntary and people who do not travel outside the United Kingdom will not need one. The ID card will have a range of domestic uses.

Notes:<br>

Ungrossed data<br>

Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data, i.e. that data are ungrossed.<br>

Time waited<br>

Time waited statistics from HES are not the same as the published waiting list statistics. HES provides counts and time waited for all patients admitted to hospital within a given period, whereas the published waiting list statistics count those waiting for treatment on a specific date and how long they have been on the waiting list. Also, HES calculates the time waited as the difference between the admission and decision to admit dates. Unlike published waiting list statistics, this is not adjusted for self-deferrals or periods of medical/social suspension.<br>

Finished in-year admissions<br>

A finished in-year admission is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider, excluding admissions beginning before 1 April at the start of the data year. Please note that admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>
