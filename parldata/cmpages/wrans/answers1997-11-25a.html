 The Prison Service must satisfy itself that bidders are capable of building the prison to the required standards, opening it by the required date and operating it safely and securely with the required level of service in terms of prisoner regime or, in the case of management-only contracts, of operating it safely, securely and with the specified prisoner regime. Bids which satisfy these criteria are assessed on the basis of value for money. The methodology for evaluating bids

<a name="71125w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 The extent to which police forces develop links with trading standards officers for law enforcement purposes is an operational matter for individual chief officers. There are no plans to issue any specific Home office guidance on the subject. However, a good level of co-operation exists across the country as a whole. Trading standards officers assist the police and other agencies at multi-agency vehicle checks, for example by checking wheel and axle weights and looking for goods with counterfeit trade marks. They are also frequently involved, in conjunction with the police, in examining cars and other vehicles of uncertain origin and condition, with the aim of detecting offences under the Trades Descriptions Act 1968.

 The Home Office operates a small grant scheme to cover the additional costs incurred when local Cadet Forces provide activities for children thought to be at risk of becoming involved in youth crime or who have already been involved in offending. This scheme was set up in 1995 to provide a variety of activities including providing positive alternatives to offending. I will shortly meet colleagues from the Ministry of Defence and the Department for Education and Employment to discuss the scheme and the role of the Cadet Forces in tackling youth crime.

 Where the consent of a water undertaker is required to any such plan or project, they should, as competent authorities under the Conservation (Natural Habitats, etc.) Regulations 1994, apply the provisions of Article 6(3) of the Directive. This requires an appropriate assessment to be undertaken in view of the site's conservation objectives.

Improvements will also result from completion of the remaining schemes in the bathing water improvement programme and implementation of the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive. Priorities for additional investment by water companies on environmental improvements, including improved bathing water quality, will be considered next year as part of the current periodic review of water prices.

<a name="71125w04.html_para0">The development of the strategy was an internal matter for the Coastguard Agency. The Chief Coastguard consulted with his Regional Controllers in drawing up the details. The first closures of rescue centres are not scheduled to take place for more than 2 years which allows time to discuss fully the implications and implementation with staff and trade unions. Any personnel disruption will be kept to a minimum and it is intended to reduce staff through natural wastage and voluntary retirement.

 On October 20 1997, the Coastguard Agency issued an information pack to provide journalists with background on the work of the Agency. Design consultants employed to advise the Agency on all its publications had some input into the provision of this press information pack, which did not contain any reference to the five year strategy. The cost of consultant advice on the press pack was around &#163;140. The press information pack went to the printers on 7 October and the print order was returned on 15 October.

These were photocopied separately from the rest of the pack on 14 November at the Agency's office and added to the press information pack for issue on the day of the announcement. The contents of the added pages were approved by Ministers when we approved the announcement.

<P>
<a name="71125w04.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Burstow: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will list the reasons for the Government's intention not to provide a choice between options in the referendum on the government of London. [17813]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71125w04.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The Government are providing Londoners with a clear choice about the future government of their city. The Government were elected on a manifesto commitment that, following a referendum to confirm popular demand, they would establish a new Greater London Authority comprising an assembly and a mayor, each directly elected.
<P>

<a name="71125w04.html_para2">In accordance with that commitment, we will present the detail of our proposals to the people of London in a White Paper to be published in March next year. Londoners will then be given the opportunity to vote in a referendum on whether or not they consent to us implementing these proposals. In the event that they vote yes, the Government intend that legislation should be introduced next session to implement the White Paper proposals.
<P>

<a name="71125w04.html_para3">The Government are unconvinced by arguments for more than one question. The Mayor and the Assembly are not separable within the context of the Government's proposals. An authority without a directly elected Mayor would be a very different type of organisation. We do not believe that such an organisation would be capable of giving London the leadership it needs. A Mayor without an elected Assembly to hold him or her to account would be too powerful and unaccountable. Neither proposal would be in keeping with the clear manifesto commitment on which the Government were elected. It would not be responsible government to put unworkable options to the people of London.
<P>

<a name="71125w04.html_para4">The Government believe that the referendum should present clear and comprehensible proposition to the people of London. The result of the referendum should be capable of delivering an unambiguous mandate. Despite the time available to proponents of more than one question, no single alternative second question has been devised which meets the concerns of all parties. Additional questions so far proposed have been numerous and contradictory. None would provide a clear mandate.
<P>

<a name="71125w04.html_para5">The Government believe a single question on a well thought out package is the only fair and honest option. Voters will be able to study detailed proposals in the White Paper, make a considered judgment about the whole package on offer, and cast their vote. They will know exactly what they are voting for and what they will get. If they do not like it they can vote 'no.'

<P>
<P><I>25 Nov 1997 : Column: 466</I><P>
have been granted for the experimental release of GMOs since the regulations came into force in March 1993. Previous research by both the Department and industry has shown that the frequency of horizontal transfer of any genes to wild species is very low. Monitoring is often a statutory condition of consents for experimental releases. However, no formal arrangement exists to monitor gene transfer because the consequences of horizonal gene transfer occurring are evaluated in advance when considering all applications for consent. Consent is granted only if the consequences of gene transfer would be negligible. The Department is continuing to fund research to monitor releases of GM oilseed rape carried out under a marketing consent. This includes monitoring for evidence of gene transfer to confirm that the risk assessment remains valid.

<P>
<a name="71125w05.html_spnew3"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 On the assumption that the &#163;200 million underspend took place entirely in the UK, and all other things being equal, our abatement would increase by around &#163;110 million in the year following the underspend. This is however a hypothetical calculation. In practice numerous other factors would influence the outcome of the abatement.

<a name="71125w07.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson: </B> 
 Under Article F of the Treaty on European Union, the Union is already obliged to respect fundamental rights, as guaranteed by the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). The Amsterdam Treaty, by an amendment to Article L, confirms the European Court of Justice (ECJ) jurisdiction to ensure that acts of EU institutions are consistent with these rights. New Article F.1 allows for sanctions against a Member State found in "serious and persistent" breach of fundamental rights. The EU's role, therefore, complements--and does not replace--that of the European Court of Human Rights.

 Responsibility for the subject of the question has been delegated to the Employment Service agency under its Chief Executive. I have asked him to arrange for a reply to be given.

<a name="71125w11.html_para0"><i>Letter from Leigh Lewis to Mr. David Kidney, dated 25 November 1997:</i>

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your question asking what exceptions there are to the policy of retiring employees of the Employment Service at 60 years of age. This is something which falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Age retirement policy is common across the whole of the Department for Education and Employment, including the Employment Service. The background to the policy is that, following the merger of the former Departments for Employment and Education in 1995, there was a need to ensure a common retirement policy across the new Department.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>There had, for a number of years, been a policy that staff working in the former Employment Department Group, including the Employment Service, were retained beyond their 60th birthday only where there was an operational need and the person concerned was fully fit and efficient. This same policy was adopted across the Department for Education and Employment and is a common policy across most Civil Service departments.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>If, when an individual reaches age 60, there is no ongoing need for their service they will be retired. Where, however, there is an operational need for the individual to remain in employment they are invited to do so. The criteria for retaining individuals beyond their 60th birthday are that:
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a clear operational need exists;
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the individual is carrying out their duties effectively;
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>they have no known health problems;
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>their retention will not lead to serious promotion blockages;
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>there are no suitable surplus staff in the individual's grade/pay band or location who could be redeployed into that post.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In addition, where there are temporary employees filling posts which could instead be filled by retaining permanent staff beyond age 60, the contracts of temporary employees will be terminated in favour of retaining permanent members of staff.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>These criteria are published in the "ES and You", the Employment Service's staff terms and conditions handbook. Since December 1996, the Employment Service has in fact retained more staff beyond age 60 than were retired at that age.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I hope this information clarifies the circumstances in which people are invited to remain in employment beyond their 60th birthday within the Employment Service.</FONT></UL>

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what criteria were used for choosing West Lancashire as an area where the lead role in delivery of the New Deal would be offered to the private sector. [16864]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71125w11.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Andrew Smith: </B> 
 We have invited the private sector to lead the organisation and delivery of New Deal in a total of ten locations. The competition to identify private sector lead organisations in the two pathfinder areas of Hackney and City and South Humber is complete. The additional eight areas were selected on the basis of a judgment as to where a private sector led partnership would have most to contribute.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment (1) if he will list for each employment district in <i>(a)</i> Wales and <i>(b)</i> England in which he intends to contract out the management of the

<P><I>25 Nov 1997 : Column: 489</I><P>
welfare to work programme those contracts which will be the subject of public tender or invitation to tender; and which companies have been invited to tender; [16951]
<P>
<UL>(2) if he will list those employment districts in <i>(a)</i> Wales and <i>(b)</i> England in which he proposes to contract out the management of the welfare to work programmes; and what is the estimated value of each contract. [16950]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71125w11.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Andrew Smith </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 20 November 1997]:</i> The essence of New Deal delivery is partnership between a wide range of public and private sector organisations to provide opportunities to meet the needs of the local client group. Effective local partnerships have an invaluable contribution to make, whatever the lead responsibilities for delivery. Detailed delivery plans for each New Deal unit of delivery will be available in the public domain once approved. Plans for 12 pathfinder districts are in the process of being made available now, and those for the bulk of remaining districts will be available during December.
<P>

<a name="71125w11.html_para1">We have specifically invited the private sector to lead the organisation and delivery of New Deal in a total of 10 locations. The competition in the first two pathfinder areas (Hackney and City and South Humber) is now complete. Advertisements seeking expressions of interest have been published for the other eight, with a view to announcing the remaining lead organisations to work with the Employment Service by the end of February 1998. In Wales, the private sector will lead in Bridgend and Glamorgan Valleys. In England, the locations are West Lancashire, Leicestershire, Solihull, Colchester, Tyneside North and Exeter and East Devon.
<P>

<a name="71125w11.html_para2">We cannot say at this stage which specific organisations will compete for contracts or their potential value because these depend on responses to the various competitions, the delivery arrangements proposed and the number of young people who will participate within the New Deal.
<P>
<P>
<a name="71125w11.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Alasdair Morgan: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment (1) for what reasons bidding for the contract to lead the organisation and delivery of New Deal to 18 to 24 year olds in Scotland, England and Wales is restricted to private sector organisations; [17349]
<P>
<UL>(2) if the bidding process will allow for the management of New Deal in Scotland to be carried out separately, and by a different organisation, from that in England and Wales. [17350]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71125w11.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Andrew Smith: </B> 
 New Deal will be organised through a wide variety of arrangements, designed to reflect the diversity of local circumstances and the expertise of those who can help in its delivery. This means different options for the management of New Deal are welcome.
<P>

<a name="71125w11.html_para3">The private sector has offered an impressive range of innovative proposals for helping young people back to work. The Government are keen to harness this creativity to provide quality opportunities through which young people can improve their employability. We have therefore invited bids from the private sector, under contract to the Employment Service (ES), to lead the delivery of New Deal in a total of 10 locations where it 



<P>
<P><I>25 Nov 1997 : Column: 490</I><P>
is judged that a private sector led partnership would have most to contribute. I would expect the private sector organisations selected to work closely with local public and private sector bodies to make a success of the New Deal.
<P>

<a name="71125w11.html_para4">The bidding process allows for the management arrangements to be separated, and for separate organisations to be involved, in each of the private sector lead locations, including in Scotland. It does not, however, require it as the bids for each area will be assessed on their merits.
<P>

<a name="71125w11.html_para5">In other areas, private sector or public sector consortia may also emerge as a result of discussions amongst prospective partners at a local level. In these cases, responsibility for the overall management of New Deal in that locality may rest with any member/members of the consortium under contract to the ES. A third option is that the ES directly manages New Deal Delivery.
<P>

<a name="71125w11.html_para6">In all cases, the ES remains accountable for the delivery of New Deal.

 The Department does not hold comprehensive information on partially selective schools or those which band their intake. Information is available only on those schools which since 1989 have had statutory proposals approved to introduce partial selection and those grant maintained schools which received approval to select up to 10 per cent. of their pupils on the basis of ability or aptitude in certain specified subjects between January 1989 and August 1996.

<a name="71125w12.html_spnew9"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 Since May 1997, aid from my Department's budget to Sierra Leone has been suspended, although we continue to assist the elected government which is now in exile. Aid also remains suspended through the governments of countries such as Burma, Nigeria and Sudan. In these cases, the regimes' records on human rights were one of the factors taken into account in our decisions. I have announced the outcome of my review of aid to Indonesia. In Belarus, in accordance with EU policy, we will not work through state organisations in future and will provide only humanitarian or regional support or support which directly promotes the process of democratisation. In countries where aid through central official channels has been suspended, we retain our aim of helping to eliminate poverty and will pursue this by working through NGOs and local government. We thereby also show our solidarity with oppressed peoples.
<P>

<a name="71125w12.html_para7">Where we retain official aid, we may also wish to modify the pattern of aid, including possibly curtailing aid, in response to a number of short or longer term factors, including human rights. This is a continuous and general process and it is often difficult to draw out any one factor as critical to the outcome.

<a name="71125w16.html_para3">The Council agreed conclusions on the management of FP5 which I warmly welcome. Besides outlining the role and functions of programme management committees through which Member States oversee the implementation fo the programme, the conclusions provide for the establishment of advisory groups users of research who will advise on the detailed content of the programme and monitor it strategically as it progresses. It has been a high UK priority to involve users in order to improve the targeting and responsiveness of the programme. The conclusions also welcome the Commission's intention to set time targets for the various steps in the management process, notably proposed evaluation, contract negotiations and payments, which should provide a valuable stimulus to more efficient and streamlined administration.

To ask the President of the Board of Trade if she will make a statement on the outline arrangements for the fifth round of bidding for electricity from renewable sources of energy. [18055]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71125w16.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 Following consultation earlier this year with the renewable energy trade bodies, and, through the Renewables Working Group, the Office of Electricity Regulation (OFFER) and the Regional Electricity 



<P>
<P><I>25 Nov 1997 : Column: 508</I><P>
Companies (RECs), I can now announce my outline policy proposals for the fifth Non-Fossil Fuel Obligation for renewables in England and Wales, NFFO-5.
<P>

<a name="71125w16.html_para9">Government policy is to secure additional generating capacity from renewables in order to help them enter the commercial generating market. I am currently carrying out a review of what would be necessary and practicable to achieve 10 per cent. of the UK's electricity needs from renewables by the year 2010. NFFO-5 will therefore become the first step in our new and strong drive for renewables and I expect NFFO-5 will contribute substantially to reducing greenhouse gases and encouraging internationally competitive industries.
<P>

<a name="71125w16.html_para10">I have considered the representations made to my Department on the proposed fifth Order, NFFO-5. Renewable Energy Bulletin No. 7 summarises the submissions which have been made. In the light of these representations, I propose to make a fifth renewables Order (NFFO-5) in the late 1998 in respect of the 12 RECs in England and Wales in their capacity as Public Electricity Supply Licencees. I understand that the RECs expect to initiate the competitive tendering process for NFFO-5 shortly.
<P>

<a name="71125w16.html_para11">For the NFFO-5 Order, I am considering separate bands for new generating capacity from:

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Landfill Gas from existing licensed sites where tipping was being carried out prior to 25 November 1997;
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Municipal and Industrial Waste, including the use of non-gaseous sewage matter (up to 10 per cent. on a dry-weight basis);
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Municipal and Industrial Waste using combined heat and power (CHP), including the use of non-gaseous sewage matter (up to 10 per cent. on a dry-weight basis);
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Small Scale Hydro from stations with a total capacity of less than 5 MW DNC;</FONT></UL>
<P>

<a name="71125w16.html_para12">On-shore Wind Energy, which may be split into separate bands for:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) small-clusters/single-machines, with the split-point at 1.0 MW DNC or less, and,
<P>
<BR>
(b) other windfarms not included above.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="71125w16.html_para13">In setting the size of the Order I will take into account the cost and quality of the proposals received. This new competition is expected to stimulate further reductions in the electricity prices contracted under NFFO but I do not expect such a rapid rate of fall in prices as has happened to date. However, I may decide to omit a band if the cost or quality of proposals received does not justify its inclusion.
<P>

<a name="71125w16.html_para14">I expect projects to demonstrate high standards of environmental performance. This will require developers to consult widely on their project proposals so that their projects meet the concerns of the community likely to be affected.
<P>

<a name="71125w16.html_para15">For example, I expect energy from waste projects to encourage an integrated approach to waste management and so demonstrate that they provide environmental benefits beyond those available from alternative methods of waste management. Award of a NFFO contract does not confer any special privilege in the planning approval process which must be carried out in the normal way.




<P>
<P><I>25 Nov 1997 : Column: 509</I><P>

<P>

<a name="71125w16.html_para16">In order to promote diversity among developers of renewable energy projects, I reserve the right to limit the number of projects or the total capacity for which any particular developer can gain contracts in this round of bidding or limit the capacity of individual projects or adopt a combination of these measures.
<P>

<a name="71125w16.html_para17">My intention is that the Order should run for 15-20 years. This would enable the RECs to offer generators contracts for premium payments for up to 15 years. The difference between the NFFO contract price and the pool price is financed through the Fossil Fuel Levy paid by licensed electricity suppliers and reflected in electricity bills. I understand that the RECs expect to select projects through a competitive tendering process and that contracts will be offered to successful bidders at their bid price.
<P>

<a name="71125w16.html_para18">I have discussed prospective arrangements with the Director General of Electricity Supply and the RECs, to whom I am providing further guidance about my proposals in respect of the proposed NFFO-5 Order. The details of that further guidance will be published in 'Renewable Energy Bulletin No. 7' (REB-7).

<P>

<a name="71125w16.html_para23">The Government are currently reviewing their policy for new and renewable sources of energy. From work undertaken so far, it seems that the achievement of 10 per cent. of the UK's electricity from renewables by 2010 would almost certainly require bringing forward technologies in addition to those proposed to be supported under NFFO-5, including offshore wind energy and energy crops. Whilst I cannot anticipate the outcome of the renewables review, I expect to announce the outcome next year.

<P>
<a name="71125w18.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 The Commission's proposal for a Directive on legal protection of biotechnological inventions seeks to harmonise certain aspects of the national patent laws of the Member States. It is an Internal Market measure and seeks to eliminate current uncertainties as to what can attract patent rights in the biotechnological field, which may be acting as a deterrent to investment in the industry in Europe. Since the proposal concerns only the EU Member States' laws, and patent rights are valid only on a national basis, there is no direct read across for countries outside the Community. Other countries, including those of the developing world, remain free to determine their own national patent regimes, and to deal with conservation of genetic resources and the position of farmers as they see fit.

 The purpose of the proposed Directive is to establish a clear legal framework for the protection of biotechnological inventions through national patent law. Although the texts of Member States' patent laws are currently closely aligned with that of the European Patent Convention (an international governmental agreement dating from 1978), there have been differences in interpretation between Member states. Although no assessment has been made as to the direct effect this proposed Directive may have on enhancing competitiveness, the clarification arising from it will reduce current uncertainty in this area of law and its possible deterrent to investment in this industry.

 Our commitment to promoting a fair and equitable health service is set out in 1998-99 Priorities and Planning Guidance for the National Health Service. Whatever the age of the patient, there are no exceptions to the fundamental principle that the NHS is there to provide service for everyone on the basis of clinical need.

 On 6 October 1997 it was announced that, from April 1998, BA staff will be undertaking some CSA activity (the issue and completion of Maintenance Application Forms (MAF)) on their home visits to lone parents.
<P>

<a name="71125w21.html_para3">Child Support legislation has provisions, known as "good cause", which allow Parents with Care (PWCs) not to co-operate if the CSA finds that they have good cause not to co-operate. This may be because they believe there is a risk of harm or undue distress to the PWC or any children living with them which may arise from the CSA contacting the absent parent. It is therefore important that staff receive training to deal sensitively with such issues when they arise and are aware of when such problems may be an issue.
<P>

<a name="71125w21.html_para4">CSA staff receive awareness training on the "requirement to co-operate" provisions of child support legislation which includes the "good cause" provisions. All CSA staff who are required to interview PWCs about an absent parent receive further training on how to manage sensitive issues, such as domestic violence, and how to deal with such cases for child support purposes.
<P>

<a name="71125w21.html_para5">The BA has arranged for staff to receive the equivalent training given to CSA staff where they are dealing with similar situations at interviews. Although the completion of MAFs does not involve in-depth interviewing about good cause, BA staff need to be aware of possible sensitivities where a PWC does not wish to complete a MAF. All front-line BA staff i.e., receptionists, visiting officers, will receive the CSA MAF completion training customised for BA. BA staff who will carry out good cause interviews will receive further training similar to that given to CSA staff.
<P>

<a name="71125w21.html_para6">Training courses for BA staff have been piloted and, following further quality assurance, training will begin in January 1998.

 Our aims for welfare reform are to modernise the structure and delivery of Social Security to encourage financial independence, while simultaneously promoting social cohesion and well-being; to develop an active welfare system which supports work, savings and honesty; and to help tackle effectively unjustifiable social and economic inequalities. To that end we are reviewing all major components of the Social Security system.

<a name="71125w22.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The Government believe that work is the best form of welfare for people of working age. For too long, disabled people have been defined by their disabilities rather than their abilities, their incapacity rather than their capacity. We therefore wish to develop ways to give sick and disabled people the advice, help and support they need to achieve their aspirations and to move towards financial independence, as part of an overall aim of social inclusion. Up to &#163;195 million, set aside from the Windfall Tax, will be used to test a range of options to find out what are the most effective ways to help people with disabilities and long-term health problems to move into work, to encourage employers both to employ and retain disabled people and to avoid people becoming dependent on long-term incapacity benefits in the first place. In parallel with the welfare to work proposals for sick and disabled people, we are also considering what changes might be made to the benefit system to improve work incentives and reduce disincentives.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>From its inception in April 1993 to the end of October 1997, the Agency has taken on over 2.2 million cases.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>During the same period, the number of written complaints received by Child Support Agency Centres (or, in a few instances, field offices) amounted to just over 109,000. This represents the vast majority of complaints sent to the Agency. Correspondence received by Ministers and the Chief Executive is not categorised, and it is not possible to say what proportion of that correspondence relates to complaints. Full figures are not available for the first year of operation, but since April 1994, all such correspondence has totalled over 37,000.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I am very conscious that there are still far too many justified complaints about the standards of basic customer contact and the service we provide. It is a key priority of the Agency to improve the way in which complaints are handled; we have revised our training for all staff who deal with complaints and introduced a new Complaints Guide. The Guide sets out our policy and procedures for swift, effective complaints handling.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Although the number of complaints reduced in 1996/97 (by around 20%), we are aware that as we tackle our backlog of cases, there is the potential for the volume of complaints to rise in the short term and we recognise that doing things right first time is the key to preventing complaints.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In addition, from April 1997 the Office of the Independent Case Examiner has provided an independent complaints investigation service for those customers who consider that the Agency's internal review process has not satisfactorily resolved their grievances. At the end of September 1997, the number of cases accepted for investigation by this service was 148.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>

 There is no universally accepted benchmark for measuring the solvency of private pension funds. Actuaries use a number of valuation methods and assumptions when advising trustees about the funding level of their pension schemes.

<a name="71125w24.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 This Department has no plans to set up pensions forums in each local authority area, but we want everyone with an interest in pensions to participate in the Pensions Review announced by my hon. Friend the Secretary of State on 17 July 1997, <i>Official Report</i>, columns <i>239-41</i>. We particularly welcome contributions from today's pensioners. That is why we were extremely pleased that Jack Jones and the National Pensioners' Convention (NPC) agreed to take on a central and specific role within the Review so that pensioners' voices can be heard at the heart of the Review process. It is open to the NPC to make representations on the further involvement of pensioners in local and central Government. The NPC is an organisation with a large number of affiliated local pensioners' organisations and over 1.5 million members across the country. To date we have received and are considering over 1,800 replies to the public consultation exercise which ended on 31 October many of which are from local pensioners' organisations.

 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Health has the lead responsibility for the implications of the Gloucestershire judgment. The judgment does not have any effect on DSS provisions.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security if changes brought into effect following the Government reviews on pensions will affect only those starting new pension schemes. [17621]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71125w25.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 A key objective of the review is to ensure that pensioners should have an adequate income in retirement; that they should share fairly in rising national prosperity; and that public finances should be both sustainable and affordable.
<P>

<a name="71125w25.html_para1">No decision on changes to the pension system have been made. The Government intend to publish an initial framework for change in the first half of 1998. There will then be a period of further consultation before final, detailed proposals are developed and laid before Parliament.

 Compulsion is not the issue. The real issue is effective help to get lone parents back to work. We are making significant steps to help lone parents back to work in the New Deal for Lone Parents, and by developing a National Childcare Strategy. With these policies, we are offering:
