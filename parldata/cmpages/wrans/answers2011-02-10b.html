 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs pursuant to the answer of 14 December 2010, <i> Official Report,</i> column 704W, on common land, if she will assess the effects on the voluntary dedication of town or village greens of provisions in administrative law that prevent administrations acting in a way which is motivated by the desire to bind its successors; and if she will assess the merits of bringing forward legislative proposals to enable local authorities to designate town or village greens.

 In our view, a local authority may apply under section 15(8) of the Commons Act 2006 to voluntarily register land in its ownership as a town or village green, but may not register land which it manages but does not own. In our view, registration under section 15(8) would be a disposal of land for the purposes of section 123 or 127 (as the case may be) of the Local Government Act 1972, and the authority must comply with the requirements of those provisions. We expect that most local authority proposals for voluntary registration are likely to fall within the terms of the General Disposal Consent 2003, set out in ODPM circular 6/03. However, an authority will also need to comply with the special requirements of section 123(2A) or 127(3), as regards the disposal of open space.</p>

 Many of the provisions of Directive 210/63/EU are similar to current United Kingdom requirements; some are new and go further; and a few are potentially less stringent. For example, unlike the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, the directive does not provide special protection for cats, dogs and equids. In addition, some of the mandatory standards of care and accommodation set out in Annex III to the directive are lower such as cage height for rats, hamsters and gerbils; minimum floor areas for sheep, goats, dogs, rabbits, guinea pigs, pigs, mini-pigs and equids.

<i> [holding answer 9 February 2011]:</i> The Government support the work of the National Centre for the Replacement, Refinement and Reduction of Animals in Research (NC3Rs) which promotes the replacement, reduction and refinement of animals (the 3Rs) in research and testing. Over the last six years, the NC3Rs has developed a model that enables pharmaceutical and chemical companies and contract research organisations that engage in animal testing to share data and expertise. An example of the success of this approach is the removal from the international regulatory guidelines of single dose acute toxicity testing for pharmaceuticals. In 2010, the NC3Rs has continued to facilitate this cooperation by co-ordinating data sharing between 23 companies in a wide range of areas related to the development of new medicines. Further information on these activities is published on the NC3Rs website.</p>

 We believe that future franchises should generally be for around 15 years but that shorter contracts may be necessary in some circumstances, for example, where major works like Thameslink, will involve significant changes in the configuration of services.

 At up to £6,500 per person the future jobs fund (FJF) is expensive; creates temporary, short term posts; and the grants do not include any incentives to move people into permanent jobs. As part of the evaluation of the FJF we will be conducting an impact assessment to estimate the difference that the policy has made to participants' employment and benefit receipt outcomes. To enable participants' outcomes to be tracked for a sufficient period analysis will be undertaken from autumn 2011 This will inform a cost-benefit assessment based on benefit, fiscal and economic savings. However it is not possible to reliably identify the potential impact on economic growth.</p>

 The Department laid amendments to Housing Benefit legislation on 30 November 2010. Following advice from the Social Security Advisory Committee and key stakeholders in relation to the implementation of these measures and to ensure a smooth transition, the measure to set local housing allowance rates at the 30<sup>(th)</sup> percentile and the overall weekly caps will both come into force for new customers from 1 April 2011. This means all measures that will adjust local housing allowance rates in 2011 will come into force on the same date.

Small differences should be treated with caution as these will be affected by sampling error and variability in non-response.  4. The analysis provided is for pensioner units. A pensioner unit is defined to be either a single pensioner over state pension age (i.e. a man aged 65+ or a woman aged 60+ in 2008-09) or a pensioner couple, either married or cohabiting, where one or more are over state pension age. The analysis does not reflect income from others in a household. So, for example, if a pensioner lives with their adult children, the children's income is not reflected in this analysis.  5. Gross income is income from all sources received by the pensioner unit including income from social security benefits (including housing benefit), earnings from employment, or self-employment, any private pension and tax credits.  6. State pension income consists of basic state pension, additional state pension, widow's pension and widowed parent's allowance.  7. Non state pension benefit income consists of pension credit, housing benefit, council tax benefit, social fund grants, carer's allowance, disability living allowance and attendance allowance.  8. Average incomes have been rounded to the nearest pound.<br>

 Through the North Seas Offshore Grid Initiative the Government are working with nine other countries to explore how we might better co-ordinate offshore grid development in the North, Irish and Baltic seas so that we can make the most of our renewable energy resources. The aim is to address the planning, market, regulatory and technical challenges presented by such offshore grid development and create the right framework for industry to invest in future projects. This initiative will not only pave the way for delivery of the North Seas Offshore Grid, but could also help remove the barriers to the other large-scale cross-border infrastructure projects across the EU which together will form the EU supergrid of the future. The Government are also discussing with fellow members of the British Irish Council the possibility of an 'All Islands Approach' to maximising the renewable energy potential around the British Isles, which could involve working together to assess the opportunity for joint renewables projects, better co-ordinating network development and tackling any barriers to greater co-operation.</p>
