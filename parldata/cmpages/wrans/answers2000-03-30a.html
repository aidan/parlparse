<P>
<P>
<a name="00330w01.html_wqn0"><B> Angela Smith: </B> 
To ask the Minister for the Cabinet Office what changes she intends to make to the Modernising Government Action Plan targets for delivery of Government services electronically.  [117046]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00330w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Ian McCartney: </B> 
 In October 1997, the Prime Minister announced that within five years a member of the public would be able to carry out a quarter of dealings with Government electronically through their telephone, television, or computer. Further, in March 1999, in our Modernising Government White Paper we proposed that all Government services should be available online by 2008.
<P>

<a name="00330w01.html_para0">We have been making good progress. Already, we offer online tax returns and online advice in areas such as health, overseas travel and consumer protection. Businesses can make online returns to Companies House, and soon they will be able to make VAT returns online. Next week the Small Business Service will launch a website offering small and medium businesses tailored advice based on their size, location, and sector.
<P>

<a name="00330w01.html_para1">But we want to increase the pace of change in Government so that we can offer our businesses and citizens more efficient and effective services. I am pleased to announce that the Prime Minister has today decided to bring forward the date by which all Government services should be available online from 2008 to 2005. Also, in line with the outcome agreed at the Lisbon summit, Government Departments will be expected to prioritise their proposals for offering all services online by 2005 so as to ensure online access to main basic public services by 2003.
<P>

<a name="00330w01.html_para2">We are also introducing an improved monitoring regime. Progress towards the target will no longer be based on the number of individual transactions with Departments. Instead we will monitor progress on the basis of the number of services that we deliver online. The monitoring regime for UK based services will as far as possible be aligned with public service agreements and service delivery agreements.

<P>

<a name="00330w01.html_para3">All regulatory proposals likely to impact on business are subject to Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA). RIAs are published and placed in the Libraries of the House. In addition a series of Command Papers list RIAs for each six month period, the most recent being Cm 4664.

<P>
<a name="00330w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Stringer: </B> 
 I refer the right hon. Member to the answer given to the right hon. Member for Wells (Mr. Heathcoat-Amory), on 9 December 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column 634W. We are considering carefully the recommendations made in the sixth Report of the Committee on Standards in Public Life and will respond in due course.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00330w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Berry: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment when the Government will respond to the final report of the disability rights taskforce.  [117387]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00330w01.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Hodge: </B> 
 The final report of the Disability Rights Taskforce, "From Exclusion to Inclusion", was published on 13 December 1999. The Government have already announced that they intend to legislate to address the Taskforce's recommendations on education, introducing significant new civil rights for disabled children and students in school, further, higher and adult education. We issued a public consultation paper on the measures to be included in the legislation on 17 March 2000.
<P>

<a name="00330w01.html_para5">Further to the response to the education recommendations, the Government have issued today an interim response to the Taskforce's report, which is available on the Government's Disability website at www.disability.gov.uk or from the DDA Helpline on 0345 622 633. Copies have been placed in the House Libraries. The interim response covers a range of the Taskforce's recommendations in the areas of local government, health and social services, housing and the environment and participation in public life.
<P>

<a name="00330w01.html_para6">The Taskforce made a number of recommendations that require changes to the Disability Discrimination Act and the Government are still considering these. A final response to the report will be made in due course.

<a name="00330w01.html_sbhd4"><H4><center>Teachers' Pension Scheme</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="00330w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Campbell-Savours: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment if he will make a statement about the outcome of the latest valuation of the teachers' pension scheme.  [117306]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00330w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Wicks: </B> 
 I have today laid formally before both Houses; the Report and Supplementary Report of the Government Actuary on the Teachers' Pension Scheme 



<P>
<P><I>30 Mar 2000 : Column: 205W</I><P>
for the period 1991-96. As a result of the Supplementary Report, the rate of contribution payable by employers will be increased by 0.95 per cent. from 1 April 2002.
<P>

<a name="00330w01.html_para7">In the Government Actuary's initial report on the valuation of the scheme he recommended that the employer contribution rate should be increased from April 2000 to remove the balance of liability over the next 40 years as required under the pension regulations. The Government Actuary was subsequently asked to advise on the consequences of an alternative approach which would enable the increase in the employer contribution rate to come into effect in 2002, but with the deficit still being removed within 40 years from 2000. We have decided to adopt the alternative approach with the result that some &#163;90 million will be available in each of the next two years for the direct benefit of schools. Teachers can be assured that this approach does not in any way affect the security of the Teachers' Pension Scheme or the level of benefits payable to its members.

<a name="00330w01.html_sbhd5"><H4><center>Education Spending</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="00330w01.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Matthew Taylor: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what amounts are projected to be spent from public funds in <i>(a)</i> the United Kingdom, <i>(b)</i> England, <i>(c)</i> Wales, <i>(d)</i> Scotland and <i>(e)</i> Northern Ireland (i) in cash terms and (ii) as a proportion of GDP for financial years 1999-2000, 2000-01 and 2001-02 on education; and if he will make a statement.  [116645]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00330w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Blunkett: </B> 
 Next year, the proportion of GDP spent on UK education and training will be around 5.0 per cent., not including education and training supported under the New Deal.
<P>

<a name="00330w01.html_para8">UK education spending will increase from &#163;41.1 billion in 1999-2000 to &#163;45.8 billion in 2000-01, using the narrower definition of education in "Budget 2000", and, subject to spending review decisions to be announced in the summer, &#163;48.0 billion in 2001-02.
<P>

<a name="00330w01.html_para9">The Manifesto commitment was to increase the share of national income spent on education. We shall meet that commitment: spending will be higher as a proportion of GDP by 2001-02 than it was in 1996-97, and over 16 per cent. higher in real terms.
<P>

<a name="00330w01.html_para10">Details of spending in England will be published shortly in the DfEE Departmental Report. Spending in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland is the responsibility of the National Assembly, Scottish Executive and Northern Ireland Office.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00330w01.html_wqn6"><B> Dr. Cable: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what impact there has been on <i>(a)</i> the timetable for and <i>(b)</i> the cost of providing internet access to schools as a result of delays caused by the Competition Commission's review of the proposed acquisition by NTL of Cable and Wireless Communications' cable interests.  [116960]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00330w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Wills: </B> 
 The Government do not anticipate any delays in the programme for connecting all schools to the internet by 2002. The cost of providing internet access for schools is subject to a number of factors, including 



<P>
<P><I>30 Mar 2000 : Column: 206W</I><P>
the availability of relevant services and competition in the market. It is not yet clear what effect, if any, the proposed merger will have on the cost of such services.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00330w01.html_wqn7"><B> Ms Buck: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what was the permanent exclusion rate <i>(a)</i> per 1,000 pupils, <i>(b)</i> per 1,000 white pupils and <i>(c)</i> per 1,000 black pupils in each local education authority in (i) 1996-97, (ii) 1997-98 and (iii) 1998-99.  [116075]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00330w01.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 The information requested is available in tables, copies of which have been placed in the Library. Information on permanent exclusions for the academic year 1998-99 is currently being collected and national estimates are expected to be published in a Statistical First Release in May.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment if he will list by unit of delivery <i>(a)</i> how many people joined the full-time education and employment option of the New Deal for 18 to 24-year-olds between January 1998 and the end of September 1999 and <i>(b)</i> how many people were on this option at the end of each month between January 1998 and the end of September 1999.  [113677]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00330w01.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Jowell </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 9 March 2000]:</i> There are four separate New Deal options--full-time education and training, employment, voluntary sector and environment task force. There is no full-time education and employment option.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00330w02.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Clappison: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what factors he took into account in setting recruitment targets for 1999-2000 for recruitment into initial teacher training for secondary school teachers of <i>(a)</i> mathematics, <i>(b)</i> science, <i>(c)</i> languages and <i>(d)</i> technology.  [112978]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00330w02.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 Targets for recruitment to initial teacher training use teacher supply models which take into consideration: future demand for teachers; projected flows of teachers into and out of the maintained nursery, primary and secondary sectors, split by age and gender.
<P>

<a name="00330w02.html_para0">Further details of assumptions used in the Teacher Supply Models can be found in 'Teacher Supply and Demand Modelling: A technical description', published in July 1998, copies of which are available in the Library.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00330w02.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The UK's chemical protection programme is designed to protect against the use of chemical weapons. Such a programme is permitted by the Chemical Weapons Convention, with which the United Kingdom is fully compliant. Under the terms of the 



<P>
<P><I>30 Mar 2000 : Column: 207W</I><P>
Convention, we are required to provide information annually to the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. In accordance with the Government's commitment to openness, I am placing in the House of Commons Library a copy of the summary which has been provided to the Organisation outlining the UK's chemical protection programme for 1999.

<a name="00330w02.html_spnew3"><B> Dr. Moonie </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 27 March 2000]:</i> Our current requirement for a Primary Casualty Receiving ship capability was identified in the Strategic Defence Review and is based on the provision of two ships at different states of readiness each capable of carrying a 200 bed hospital.

 <i>[holding answer 27 March 2000]:</i> The existing Royal Navy Hydrographic Survey Squadron includes HMS Herald, HMS Bulldog, HMS Beagle, and HMS Roebuck (HMS Hecla was taken out of service in December 1996). The first three of these vessels are planned to leave service between mid 2001 and early 2002 with HMS Roebuck being maintained into 2003.
<P>

<a name="00330w02.html_para2">To meet our future requirements, we plan to replace these ships with new, more capable, multi-role survey vessels, backed by a long-term in-service support contract. These new vessels will provide both hydrographic and oceanographic military surveying data, as well as a combat survey and mine warfare support capability. Balance of investment considerations, including the number of vessels to be acquired, are ongoing, as are contractual negotiations with the preferred bidder, Vosper Thornycroft.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The total programme cost for the twelve currently planned Type 45 warships including their missiles is approximately &#163;6Bn. This includes approximately &#163;1.2Bn for the development, design and build of the first of class ship and &#163;1Bn for the development and initial production of the Principal Anti Air Missile System (PAAMS). The balance contains funding for further missile procurement and allows for the incremental acquisition of the combat system. As a result, the platform design will incorporate significant growth margins. The actual cost per individual ship is thus difficult to assess but the average is expected to be within a target cost of about &#163;270M excluding missiles.</FONT></UL>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>MOD is currently proposing to meet its strategic sealift requirement through Private Finance Initiative arrangements, with the objective of maximising value for money and affordability. Rather than procuring ships ourselves we plan, instead, to procure sealift capability in the form of a service. This will comprise a number of vessels (with crews) at differing readiness periods designed to meet our needs, including those of the Joint Rapid Reaction Force. This approach will afford the ship-owner the opportunity to use the vessels for commercial trading when they are not required by MOD. The extent of such commercial use of any underused capacity will depend upon the service provider. Selection of a preferred bidder will be made in late Spring.</FONT></UL>

 My Department has one website which contains information about the purpose and structure of my office, together with all our press notices. It was built "in house" at no extra cost to the Welsh Office, our predecessor Department. It is operated on our behalf by NISS (National Information Systems and Services) based at Bath University. Their charges--now and in the future--are a matter of commercial confidentiality but are well within the expenditure budgeted for them. At the present time we are averaging 4,000 (mainly document) hits per month.

<a name="00330w03.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Dismore: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make a statement on the progress towards implementing the change to the boundaries of the Metropolitan Police District to make them coterminous with the boundaries of the London boroughs.  [117309]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00330w03.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 The change to the boundaries takes effect on 1 April, as planned. The responsibility for policing those parts of Essex, Hertfordshire and Surrey which are currently within the Metropolitan Police District will pass from the Metropolitan Police to the respective county forces.
<P>

<a name="00330w03.html_para5">Essex Police, Hertfordshire Constabulary, Surrey Police, their Police Authorities, and the Metropolitan Police have prepared for the changeover in a thorough and professional manner. A great deal of detailed work has been put in since I announced the change in June 1998. I commend them for their close co-operation, and I am confident that there will be a smooth transfer of responsibilities. People in the transferring areas need have no concerns about disruption to their local policing service.
<P>

<a name="00330w03.html_para6">The funding for the three county Police Authorities will be increased from April to reflect their enlarged areas. In addition, we are making special payments out of the police grant totalling &#163;10 million to go towards costs arising out of the transfer.
<P>

<a name="00330w03.html_para7">I am confident that the benefits of the boundaries change will soon show through. I decided to change the boundaries for three main reasons.
<P>

<a name="00330w03.html_para8">First, it makes it easier for the criminal justice agencies in the area to work together in the fight to reduce crime. Local councils and other agencies will no longer have to work with two different police forces when discharging their responsibilities under the Crime and Disorder Act 



<P>
<P><I>30 Mar 2000 : Column: 212W</I><P>
1998. This is an important step towards aligning boundaries in the criminal justice system, thereby improving efficiency and effectiveness.
<P>

<a name="00330w03.html_para9">Secondly, the change supports democratic accountability. It gives local people a say, through their county Police Authority, in the way their area is policed. People in the transferring areas will not have a vote in the forthcoming election for London's Assembly members, who will be in the majority on the new Metropolitan Police Authority. It is right that these areas be policed by county forces whose Police Authorities, with councillor members in the majority, already provide local democratic accountability.
<P>

<a name="00330w03.html_para10">Thirdly, the change allows the Metropolitan Police to focus its efforts on the huge task of policing the nation's capital.
<P>

<a name="00330w03.html_para11">The Metropolitan Police have policed the transferring areas since the time of Sir Robert Peel. I would like to pay tribute to the efforts of all the officers and civil staff of the Metropolitan Police who have worked in these areas over the years. They deserve the Government's thanks, and the thanks of the local communities.

<P>

<a name="00330w03.html_para12">Advertisements have also been placed in the London press summarising key performance data and targets set out in the Plan.
<P>

<a name="00330w03.html_para13">Some of the performance data for 1999-2000 are provisional. Audited data will be included in a hard copy version of the Plan to be published in June.
<P>

<a name="00330w03.html_para14">The Policing and Performance Plan combines the requirements of an annual Policing Plan, an annual Efficiency Plan and, for the first time, an annual Best Value Performance Plan.
<P>

<a name="00330w03.html_para15">The Plan sets out the Metropolitan police's two key priorities for 2000-01: reducing crime and disorder and diversity. The Plan sets out the Metropolitan police's crime reduction targets--a two per cent. reduction in burglary, stopping the increasing level of street crime and an eight per cent. reduction in vehicle crime--together with key activities for delivery. It also contains a suite of Best Value Performance Indicators (BVPIs) with a summary of the Metropolitan police's performance against those BVPIs for which historical data is available and targets for future performance. The Plan also sets out a five year plan of Best Value reviews. The areas selected for review in the coming year are; investigating and detecting crime; combating bureaucracy and managing information; and consultation.
<P>

<a name="00330w03.html_para16">The Plan also sets out the means by which the Metropolitan police aims to exceed the two per cent. efficiency gains required by the Government from all police forces.




<P>
<P><I>30 Mar 2000 : Column: 213W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="00330w03.html_para17">The Commissioner will report on performance against the Plan to me, in my capacity as the Metropolitan police's police authority, and to the Metropolitan Police Committee, until 3 July, when the Metropolitan Police Authority (MPA) is established.
<P>

<a name="00330w03.html_para18">I believe that the Commissioner's Plan will enable the MPA to make an effective start by providing a solid basis for monitoring and interrogating the Metropolitan police's performance as the foundation for the Plan the MPA will develop for 2001-02.

<a name="00330w04.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The Animal Procedures Committee was established by the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. The Act requires the Secretary of State, who appoints members, to have regard to the desirability of ensuring that the interests of animal welfare are adequately represented. There is also a requirement that the committee shall have regard both to the legitimate requirements of science and industry and to the protection of animals. The key consideration in making appointments to the committee is the need to maintain a breadth of professional experience and a proper balance of views among the membership.
<P>

<a name="00330w04.html_para0">In 1998, the committee adopted a Code of Conduct for Members. This requires members at all times to act in good faith and observe the highest standards of impartiality, integrity and objectivity in relation to the conduct of the Committee's business; to declare any personal or business interest which may influence their judgment: not to participate in discussion of matters in which they have a personal or business interest; and to understand that they are appointed as individuals and not as representatives of organisations with which they have significant contacts.

<a name="00330w05.html_para5">These reforms build on a review led by Professor Michael Clarke on behalf of the Central R&D Committee for the NHS. We are today making his report available on the Department of Health's website. As well as the management and funding of R&D in the NHS, Professor Clarke's review considered NHS priorities for R&D related to cancer, the elderly, heart disease and stroke, mental health, and primary care and took account of a review of research priorities for accidental injury. We are placing these reports on the Department's website. We intend to make early progress with the R&D priorities for cancer, heart disease and stroke, and mental health.

<a name="00330w05.html_spnew5"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 The United Kingdom National Screening Committee advises the Government on all aspects of screening policy. It considers the aim of all antenatal screening to be informed choice for parents. The NSC would rarely recommend the introduction of a blanket test such as a blood test for chromosomal disorders for all or most pregnant women, but rather a specific test for a known disorder. At present, individual women who have already had an affected pregnancy or have a family history of a genetic disorder should be offered specific genetic testing and counselling. We are currently considering the Committee's recommendation to offer all pregnant women second trimester serum screening for Down's Syndrome.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00330w05.html_spnew8"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 The campaign to immunise all children and young people under the age of 18 with the new meningococcal Group C conjugate vaccine is being undertaken by the National Health Service. Any child eligible to receive this vaccine can do so via the NHS. Any individual in the country may approach a general practitioner for NHS treatment, including immunisation if appropriate. Treatment is conditional on the GP's acceptance of the patient for NHS services.
<P>

<a name="00330w05.html_para6">The meningococcal Group C conjugate vaccine is new and manufacturers held no stockpiles in advance of the launch. We have distributed every batch of vaccine as fast as it has been released. Distribution has been in line with the implementation schedule with the vaccine being targeted specifically at those groups at highest risk first.




<P>

<P>

<a name="00330w05.html_para7">The only way to guarantee a successful roll-out of the new vaccine, which is in limited supply, has been to ensure it is available through the NHS. The Department of Health has therefore bought all the vaccine available for the NHS. Once the NHS programme to immunise every child under-18 has been completed, sometime later this year, the vaccine will then be available to others outside of this group.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00330w05.html_spnew9"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 The meningococcal Group C conjugate vaccine is a brand new vaccine. The Department has calculated the amount of vaccine needed to immunise those covered by the immunisation programme and has contracted with vaccine manufacturers to ensure sufficient vaccine is available to implement the programme. The Department continues to liaise closely with manufacturers and the National Institute for Biological Standards and Controls, which tests every batch of vaccine for safety and potency, to ensure vaccine is made available to the NHS as soon as it becomes available. The Department will continue to seek to ensure adequate supply through close liaison with vaccine manufacturers. The NHS is the first healthcare system in the world to protect people with this new vaccine.

 London Transport awaits bids for the two deep tube infrastructure service contracts tomorrow. These will be very detailed, weighty proposals. It will take several weeks to analyse and clarify them properly. When this process is completed, the bids will be tested for best value against the public sector comparator.
<P>

<a name="00330w07.html_para7">I have today placed in the Library of the House a detailed note which describes how London Transport have constructed the public sector comparator against which bids for infrastructure improvement and maintenance contracts under the Public Private Partnership (PPP) can be tested.
<P>

<a name="00330w07.html_para8">The methodology on which the comparator has been built is designed to offer a fair and reliable estimate of how much it would cost London Underground itself to carry out all the work needed to upgrade and maintain the Underground network over the next 30 years, to the standard required under the PPP contracts. The comparator will show the cost for each of the three infrastructure companies separately, so that each bid can be directly assessed against its public sector alternative.
<P>

<a name="00330w07.html_para9">The comparator will also explicitly establish how much it would cost to deliver the required contract outputs if London Underground were to raise the necessary finance through the issuance of public sector bonds. The bids will also be tested against this means of raising finance.
<P>

<a name="00330w07.html_para10">The methodology which London Underground is using, and which is described in the note that I have placed in the Library, has been reviewed by KPMG as London Underground's independent, external auditors. KPMG were asked to consider whether the note accorded with the relevant Treasury guidance and was appropriate to the circumstances of the PPP. KPMG will also be asked to review the actual comparator and the bond-financed variant before they are used to test bids for best value.
<P>

<a name="00330w07.html_para11">The actual values produced by the comparator can be released only once negotiations with bidders have been completed, so as not to expose the taxpayer's negotiating position, and thus jeopardise the chances of securing best value.
<P>

<a name="00330w07.html_para12">As well as the external audit undertaken by KPMG, the design, construction and use of the comparator will be made available for scrutiny by the National Audit Office (NAO). The NAO has made clear that while it is always available to give guidance to the bodies whom it audits on areas of risk and uncertainty, and to draw attention to relevant financial experience in NAO and Public Accounts Committee reports--my Department has accordingly received such guidance--it could not go further and become involved in the decision-making process. This would inevitably lead to questions about its ability subsequently to carry out an independent examination for Parliament, once the key decisions on the PPP have been taken.
<P>

<a name="00330w07.html_para13">The NAO, however, notes that as part of the decision-making process, London Transport is having its work on building and using the public sector comparator reviewed by KPMG. The NAO regards it as being in line with good practice for such comparators to receive scrutiny external to the project.

an EU agency, as the December Council had requested. The Presidency said that the Transport Council should aim to take a decision in June on the best legal form for the EASA.
<P>

<a name="00330w08.html_para15">The Presidency tabled a revised text of the draft directive on the interoperability of conventional rail systems, which had been presented by the Commission to the December Council, and which the UK broadly supports. The Presidency noted that substantial progress had been made in the Working Group. The Commission agreed that progress had been made and felt that a common position on the draft directive should be possible in June.
<P>

<a name="00330w08.html_para16">The Commission presented to the Council its Communication on road safety. Key proposals for action were: further development of the European new vehicles crash testing programme (ENCAP), use of speed limiters on larger vehicles, higher levels of seatbelt and child restraint usage, safer car fronts, and targeting of accident blackspots. Legislative proposals would follow in these areas. My right hon. and noble Friend welcomed the general approach of the Communication, which fitted in well with the recently announced UK road safety strategy. The Communication also refers to the Commission's intention to bring forward a recommendation for a maximum blood alcohol level of 0.5 milligrams per millilitre. The Presidency concluded that further work should be done on the Communication, in preparation for discussion at the June Council.
<P>

<a name="00330w08.html_para17">The Commission introduced new proposals on maritime safety, stressing that it was important to make progress in preventing future accidents like that involving the Erika. Action was proposed in two stages. The first stage would involve measures tightening the regulation on port state control of ship standards, improving control of classification societies, and phasing out single-hulled tankers, the last in line with the US timetable. In the short-term, oil companies would be asked to avoid voluntarily the use of tankers more than 15 years old. The second stage of the Commission's proposals involves a change in the information system for all ships, building on the new EQUASIS international database, better monitoring of sea movements of freighters, setting up a European Maritime Safety Agency, and examination of the liability and compensation aspects of oil pollution accidents. Member states supported the proposals for directives on port state control and classification societies, but, more generally, the need for the International Maritime Organisation to be involved was widely stressed. The UK was among member states which stressed the importance of a proper prior assessment of the economic impact of a rapid phase-out of single hulled tankers. My right hon. and noble Friend also noted the UK's recent proposals to increase the ceiling for payments from the International Oil Pollution Compensation Fund (IOPCF), and suggested that wider reform should be pursued through the IMO. The Commissioner felt that global action alone was not enough and argued for her proposal on single hulls. The Presidency, however, asked for more work to be done in preparation for the June Council. They urged member states to work together to increase compensation levels in the IOPCF.

<a name="00330w09.html_para0">In June 1998, during the UK Presidency, the Council mandated the Commission to develop, on behalf of the European Community and the member states, a treaty for a new international organisation to be known as the European Aviation Safety Authority, involving both EU and non-EU member states, as well as the Community itself. The mandate required the Commission first to submit a draft outline text of the founding treaty to a Special Committee of member states representatives.
<P>

<a name="00330w09.html_para1">The draft treaty agreed by the Special Committee assumes that the most effective way of achieving uniformly applied, high safety standards was to provide that all EASA rules should be directly applicable in Contracting Parties' law. The draft also provides for extensive judicial control mechanisms. Member states and the Commission have been unable to agree this draft treaty in its entirety and the Commission has suggested an alternative option, based on a community agency. The Council on 28 March agreed that further analysis should be undertaken of the best legal form for EASA.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what encouragement he gives to research into ways of reducing the hazards associated with the transport of air cargo.  [116849]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00330w09.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 Certain types of cargo are known to present specific hazards when transported by air and these are categorised as dangerous goods. The carriage of dangerous goods by air is governed by the Air Navigation (Dangerous Goods) Regulations 1994 which implement the requirements of Annex 18 to the Chicago Convention. This requires that all dangerous goods transported by air must be carried in accordance with the International Civil Aviation Organisation's Technical Instructions for the Safe Transport of Dangerous Goods by Air. The Technical Instructions themselves are based upon the UN Recommendations on the Transport of Dangerous Goods.
<P>

<a name="00330w09.html_para2">The Technical Instructions are reviewed regularly by an ICAO panel of experts on dangerous goods.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00330w09.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 The Government have not opposed the EU Galileo project. They have adopted a prudent approach to the project as they consider that key issues such as cost, funding (including arrangements for a public-private partnership), user benefits, security and management arrangements need to be properly evaluated. Such views are shared by other EU member states. Hence, the Transport Council, at its meeting in June 1999, adopted a Resolution that invited the European Commission to proceed only with the Definition Phase of Galileo in conjunction with member states and the European Space Agency. This phase has begun and includes detailed work on the issues of concern to the UK and other EU states. Based on the results of this work and negotiations with the US and the Russian Federation, the Commission is required, by the end of this year, to put forward proposals to the Council on the best way to proceed with the project either independently or in co-operation with international partners.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00330w10.html_spnew13"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 For British business, the greatest of all benefits of our membership of the EU is being part of the European single market. This gives all UK manufacturers access to the largest single market in the world--a market of nearly 380 million consumers.
<P>

<a name="00330w10.html_para4">Almost 60 per cent. of the UK's trade, worth nearly &#163;120 billion a year, is with the EU. In addition we attract a huge amount of inward investment as a gateway to the single market, for countries outside the EU.

 The Prime Minister recently announced the Government's goal of universal internet access by 2005. People in rural areas can already get such access via a PC and a telephone line. The Government are also making sure that there are public internet access points widely spread across the country, including in rural areas.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00330w11.html_spnew1"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 Competitiveness depends on a wide range of factors as discussed in the Government's Competitiveness White Paper. Following on from the White Paper, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry published, in December 1999, a set of indicators which provided a systematic assessment of the UK's competitiveness against the world's leading economies, including its major European rivals.




<P>
<P><I>30 Mar 2000 : Column: 239W</I><P>

<a name="00330w11.html_para0">The overall message from the Indicators is that the UK is beginning to succeed as a knowledge driven economy, but in many areas has some way to go to match the standards of the best.

 When seeking to buy products or services many consumers will be influenced by logos or membership of trade associations. Consumers need to know that these provide effective redress and are properly enforced. The Government propose to change the law to give the Director General of Fair Trading a power to give a seal of approval to effective codes. This will enable the consumer to choose a supplier with confidence, knowing that if something does go wrong, redress is available.

 I have today issued a consultation document outlining proposals to implement those aspects of the Gas Directive which apply to upstream pipeline networks.

<P>

<a name="00330w12.html_para1">The consultation document outlines proposals to amend the Pipelines Act 1962 and the Petroleum Act 1998 in order to give effect to Article 23 of the Gas Directive by placing a duty on upstream pipeline owners to consider applications for access to their pipelines against certain criteria and placing certain new duties and powers on the Secretary of State to settle disputes between pipeline owners and applicants for access.
<P>

<a name="00330w12.html_para2">As many upstream pipelines carry a complex mix of hydrocarbons from which gas and oil may be extracted at a processing facility, the consultation document proposes applying the provisions of Article 23 of the Directive to certain upstream pipelines which carry either gas or oil or both. It proposes a definition of "upstream pipeline network" which would include offshore and onshore pipelines of any length carrying gas or oil from an oil or gas production field to processing terminals in the United Kingdom or carrying gas to terminals in another country. The definition would also include pipelines carrying gas directly from a production field to a power station or industrial plant.
<P>

<a name="00330w12.html_para3">The consultation document seeks views on all of these proposals and, in particular, on how the interconnecting pipeline between the United Kingdom and Belgium should be regarded for the purposes of the Directive.
<P>

<a name="00330w12.html_para4">The proposals clarify certain aspects of the Pipelines Act 1962 and the Petroleum Act 1998, in particular the Secretary of State's role as the dispute settlement authority, and reflect current practice in the offshore industry under the Offshore Infrastructure Code of Practice. The material impact on business is expected to be negligible.

<P>
<a name="00330w14.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Forest of Bowland was one of two areas selected in 1999 for a two-year, experimental project to test an integrated approach to environmental and rural economy issues in the uplands. A review of the project (and the experiment in the other areas--Bodmin Moor in Cornwall) will be carried out after an economic evaluation has taken place next year.
<P>

<a name="00330w14.html_para1">The Ministry already operates agri-environment schemes which help to address the needs of areas in England that contain sites of international importance for wildlife. We announced on 7 December 1999 that the funding for these schemes will be increased significantly. By 2007 it is expected to be double its present level.

<P>

<a name="00330w14.html_para2">Consultation last year on the European Commission's Agenda 2000 reforms revealed numerous suggestions of additional environmental conditions which might be attached to agricultural support payments. These need to be considered very carefully with regard to whether they would be easily understood, their ease of enforcement, the environmental benefits and the cost to farmers. Further work is being done on this. If possible measures are identified, a further round of consultation on detailed proposals would be needed before introducing them.

The number of applications to the Organic Farming Scheme that passed the initial validity checks is currently 1,185. A small number of these were either withdrawn or were not accepted onto the Scheme. As at November 1999 in England there were 34,534 hectares of land converted to organic farming and 94,144 hectares in conversion.

<a name="00330w14.html_para3">Under the new Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance (FIFG), which came into force on 1 January 2000, aid is available for vessel owners and fishermen whose activities are temporarily ended due to the non-renewal of a fisheries agreement. If offered, this aid would count against the allocation for Spain under the new FIFG.

[116092]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00330w14.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Following representations from inshore fishermen and my hon. Friend for Hastings and Rye (Mr. Foster), the Ministry identified more than 20 vessels, licensed as 10 m and under vessels, whose overall length appeared to have been extended by adding structures (removable or otherwise) and which were effectively operating as over 10 m vessels.
<P>

<a name="00330w14.html_para4">The owners concerned have been advised that they must reduce the overall length of their vessel to 10 m or under, or acquire over 10 m licences by 30 June 2000. If they fail to do so their fishing vessel licences will not be renewed from 1 July 2000. A number of owners have already taken appropriate action and others are planning to do so.

 <i>[holding answer 23 March 2000]:</i> The National Insurance Contributions Office applies the policy set out in the Inland Revenue's code of practice 1 when paying interest on the late payment of age-related rebates to contracted-out money purchase schemes. However, special arrangements were made for the 1997-98 tax year where payments were made at 0.5 per cent. of the rebate cumulatively for each month of delay after October 1998. The objective was to replace any State Earnings Related Pension benefits foregone at an annual rate of 6 per cent. (the prevailing gilt interest rate).

To date no compensation has been paid to contracted-out money purchase schemes for the 1998-99 tax year and as we have not yet commenced the processing of 1999-2000 employers end of year returns compensation is not yet an issue for this tax year.

 The Government welcome the report and will act on its recommendations to improve competition in banking and services to customers. On 20 March, the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry referred the provision of banking services to small and medium enterprises to the Competition Commission for examination under the complex monopoly provisions of the Fair Trading Act 1973. The Chancellor announced in the Budget on 21 March that the Government would legislate to open up access to payments systems and to oversee access charges; and that he had asked the Financial Services Authority to consider the recommendations in the Report concerning consumer information and to report to him within three months, consulting widely, on how they propose to respond. The Government will respond to the other recommendations in the report shortly.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>As Director of the Office for National Statistics (ONS), I have been asked to reply to your recent question about the estimated migration between London and other parts of the United Kingdom for each of the last five years.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The enclosed table presents the information that you require. The latest year for which estimates are available is 1998. The estimates of internal migration within the United Kingdom are based on the movement of NHS doctor's patients between the former Family Health Service Authorities. They should not be regarded as a perfect measure of migration as there is variation in the delay between a person moving and registering with a new doctor. Additionally some moves may not result in a re-registration: for example, individuals may migrate again before registering with a doctor. Conversely, there may be others who move and re-register several times a year.</FONT></UL>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Moves between the individual Government Office Regions (GOR's) and the rest of the United Kingdom are published in <i>Key Population and Vital Statistics</i>, which is available in the House of Commons Library.</FONT></UL>

<a name="00330w18.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 We have a Civil Contingency Plan for Zimbabwe, as we do for many other countries. The Contingency Plan is designed to help the British community in a crisis, and in a worst case scenario, to provide for their evacuation. The Contingency Plan comes into effect if there is a breakdown in law and order leading to a significant risk to the safety of British nationals. We do not believe this is the case in Zimbabwe and our travel advice reflects that view. Our travel advice, and the safety of British nationals, is kept under constant review.

<a name="00330w18.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Vaz: </B> 
 A total of 526 work permits were approved by the Overseas Labour Service for Zimbabwean nationals in 1998 and 905 in 1999.
<P>

<a name="00330w18.html_para0">Our High Commission in Harare issued 389 working holiday-maker visas in 1998 and 303 in 1999. However, since visa statistics are not collected on the basis of the nationality of applicants, these figures may include applications made in Harare by non-Zimbabwean nationals. Figures for the number of Zimbabweans applying for working holiday-maker visas at entry clearance posts worldwide are not available and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost.

 We cannot provide exact figures because British nationals are not obliged to register with the High Commission in Harare. Our High Commission currently have 6,700 British nationals and some 5,000 dual British/Zimbabwe nationals registered. Actual numbers will be higher.

<a name="00330w18.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Vaz: </B> 
 Zimbabweans do not normally require visas before travelling to the United Kingdom though some in certain categories may do so. However, statistics on visa applications received worldwide are not collected on the basis of the nationality of applicants. We do not therefore have figures for the number of Zimbabweans applying at entry clearance posts worldwide. This could be obtained only at disproportionate cost.

 The Department and its agencies use the internet as one of a variety of methods to communicate with the public. The DSS website is updated regularly and includes separate webpages for the individual agencies and others. The website covers numerous topics and contains over 3,000 pages providing a range of information on benefits, complaints procedures and corporate documentation such as press releases, Ministerial speeches and Agency business plans.

<P>
<a name="00330w20.html_spnew3"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 The Appeals Service agency will be established with effect from Monday 3 April 2000. This new executive agency will be responsible for administration of appeals, and its Chief Executive will be accountable to Parliament for performance. Appeal tribunals will remain independent of the Department with the President, who remains head of the tribunal Non Departmental Public Body, and panel members being appointed by the Lord Chancellor. The new structure will bring greater accountability, but will also retain and support the independence and impartiality of tribunals.
<P>

<a name="00330w20.html_para4">In the past year, following the introduction of the new decision making and appeals arrangements, the Appeals Service under its Chief Executive designate has achieved both substantial reductions in the backlog of older cases and reduced waiting times for appeals to be heard. Full agency status, and the fact that the Chief Executive will be accountable to Parliament for the agency's performance for the first time, will provide the scope to consolidate these gains and wherever possible improve upon them over the coming year.
<P>

<a name="00330w20.html_para5">A Framework Document for the agency will set out its aims and objectives, together with lines of accountability and details of planning, reporting, personnel and finance arrangements. A Service First statement will set out the standards of service appellants can expect from the agency. A Business Plan has also been published, together with Secretary of State targets for the forthcoming year. Copies of these documents are being placed in the Library.
