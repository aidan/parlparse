To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how many military personnel have left the Army since 1 May; how many have been recruited since that date; and how many vacancies existed at the end of October. [16926]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71127w01.html_spnew0"><B> Dr. Reid: </B> 
 A total of around 5,000 personnel left the Army between 1 May and 1 October 1997. More than 6,000 personnel entered the Army from civilian life during the same period. At 1 October the Army was undermanned by around 4,500 trained personnel. The figures to 1 October are provisional, and include trained Gurkha personnel but exclude the Royal Irish (Home Service). The figures to the end of October 1997 are not yet available.

<a name="71127w01.html_spmin4"><B>The Prime Minister</B> 
 <i>[holding answer 26 November 1997]:</i> As I told the hon. Gentleman in my earlier reply, the Government receives advice from the Honorary Advisory Panel on Driving and Diabetes, one of a number of such panels comprising experts in their field. At a recent meeting they confirmed that in their view there was no new evidence to support a change in the policy with regard to granting licences to drive the heavier vehicles to diabetes sufferers treated by insulin. Their advice draws on their experience and assessment of the scientific literature. There is therefore no scientific advice as such from the Panel which could be published.

 I am today placing in the Library of the House the Report of a Working Group on the Government Information Service. The Report is about modernising the Government's communications with the media to make them more effective and authoritative--an integral part of a democratic Government's duty to govern with consent. Its main proposals are:

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>to improve co-ordination with and from the centre, so as to get across consistently the Government's key policy themes and messages, through a new strategic communications unit serving the whole Government; a reformed Cab-E-Net system; and clearer rules on attribution;
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>to improve co-ordination within each Government Department so that Ministers, their special advisers, their press offices and their policy civil servants all play their part in the coherent formulation and communication of policy;
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>to bring the practice and procedures of all Government press offices up to the standards of the best, geared to quick response round the clock with help from a new central media monitoring unit;
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>to retain a politically impartial service and to sustain the trusted values of the service embodied in its rules of guidance;
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>on the basis that communication is an integral part of policy formulation, to develop closer and better working relations between policy civil servants and press offices;
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>to offer high quality management and leadership, staffing and training and development tailored to meet the needs of the 24-hour media world.</FONT></UL>

<P>

<a name="71127w01.html_para3">I have accepted the recommendations of the Report. The costs of the two new Units will be contained within the Department's running costs. Together, these proposals will produce a service, renamed the Government Information Service and Communication Service, which is fit for its purpose and fit for the future.

To ask the Attorney-General, pursuant to the statement of the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Northern Ireland of 18 November 1997, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 215-16, what factors led him to conclude it would appear invidious for him to deny a person a jury trial in some scheduled offences; and for what reasons he assesses it not to be invidious for him to deny jury trials in other scheduled offences. [17570]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71127w02.html_spmin2"><B>The Attorney-General:</B> 
 It is the legislation itself, the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act 1996, which provides that the scheduled offences are tried by a judge without a jury. The Schedule permits the Attorney-General, in respect of certain offences, to certify that a particular offence is not to be treated as a scheduled offence. My certificate therefore operates to confer the right to be tried by jury in the normal way. The right to trial by jury is currently removed only by Parliament and it would be invidious for a Minister to have that power. The Attorney-General's function is purely to reduce the severity of the law in favour of individuals where appropriate.

<a name="71127w02.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. McNamara: </B> 
To ask the Attorney-General what would be <i>(a)</i> the extra cost and <i>(b)</i> the necessary increase in personnel of the certifying in procedure for scheduled offences coming under the terms of the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Bill. [17571]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71127w02.html_spmin3"><B>The Attorney-General:</B> 
 Under the current legislation the Attorney-General may "certify out" certain scheduled offences with the effect that such an offence will not be treated as a scheduled offence. It is impossible to quantify the extra cost and the necessary increase in personnel which would be required were offences to be subject to a "certifying in" procedure, whereby they would be certified in to the Schedule by the Attorney-General, since the amount of work involved is entirely dependent on the number of offences committed. Under the provisions contained in the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Bill it is anticipated that there will be an increase in the work

To ask the Attorney-General (1) what percentage of cases of alleged sexual offences against children investigated by the Police in 1995-96 and 1996-97 and referred to the Crown Prosecution Service <i>(a)</i> were judged to have passed the evidential test, <i>(b)</i> proceeded to prosecution in court and <i>(c)</i> resulted in a conviction; [17660]
<P>
<UL>(2) what percentage of cases <i>(a)</i> proceeded to prosecution in court and <i>(b)</i> resulted in a conviction, in cases involving alleged sexual offences against children in 1995-96 and 1996-97 when the only evidence was the testimony of the child or children; [17662]
<P>
(3) what were the reasons for the decisions not to proceed to prosecution in respect of those alleged sexual offences against children investigated by the Police in 1995-96 and 1996-97, in which the Crown Prosecution Service decided not to prosecute. [17663]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71127w02.html_spmin4"><B>The Attorney-General:</B> 
 The Crown Prosecution Service holds no central records on the outcome of proceedings in respect of particular offences. The information is held in Branch offices on individual case files and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost.

<P>
<P>
<a name="71127w02.html_spmin5"><B>The Attorney-General:</B> 
 Each case is unique and must be considered on its own merit but, generally, a principle of fairness is applied to the evidence of children. This means that the evidence of a child is considered no less reliable than that of an adult simply because it comes from a child. As in all cases, prosecutors will consider whether the evidence can be used in court and whether it is reliable in deciding if there is a realistic prospect of conviction. Prosecutors are urged to use all the procedures available to assist child witnesses to give evidence.

<P>
<a name="71127w02.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 The Asylum Protocol to the Amsterdam Treaty will require that member states treat asylum applications from European Union nationals as either inadmissible or against a presumption that they are manifestly unfounded. Belgium has made a declaratory statement to the effect that it will apply the latter approach. This is not an exemption from the Protocol. There was no need for the United Kingdom to make a similar declaration. In accordance with United Kingdom asylum law, we will continue to give individual consideration to asylum applications from European Union nationals.

 In my reply to the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Mr. Beith) on 23 June 1997, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>360</i>. I indicated that the Government strongly support the aims of the Fire Safety Bill which my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham, East (Mr. Heppell) introduced in the last Parliament. Since then. I have received advice from the Central Fire Brigades Advisory Council on the main principles incorporated in that Bill and officials have held discussions with a number of key stakeholders.<i></i><i></i>
<P>

<a name="71127w03.html_para2">On 28 November, the Government intend to publish a consultation document entitled "Fire Safety Legislation for the Future" and copies will be placed in the Library. The consultation document sets out proposals for a new fire safety regime based on the main principles included in the Fire Safety Bill which in turn picked up many of the recommendations of the June 1994 Inter-Departmental Review of Fire Safety Legislation and Enforcement.
<P>

<a name="71127w03.html_para3">The proposed new regime should enable rationalisation and consolidation of existing legislation. It would be based on a new universal duty of fire safety care on the occupiers and owners of almost all premises (except single private dwellings) to provide and maintain fire precautions. There would be additional requirements for high risk premises and enforcement would generally be by fire authorities. To combat the deaths and casualties in people's homes, we are attracted to the possibility of a new statutory duty on fire authorities to undertake community fire safety.
<P>

<a name="71127w03.html_para4">The consultation document generally covers fire safety in England and Wales and in Scotland. But where there are differences in the situation or proposals for Scotland these have been stated in a separate chapter.
<P>

<a name="71127w03.html_para5">We intend that this consultation document should be a first step towards a legislative regime which will serve to meet the fire safety challenges of the future. The proposals also form one strand of the Home Office Comprehensive Spending Review and are interrelated to other aspects of that review on the funding and structure of the fire service and the potential for more flexible standards of fire cover.
<P>

<a name="71127w03.html_para6">The consultation period lasts until the end of February 1998. The proposals at this stage are cast in broad terms. We will consider carefully the responses to them and, if we then seek to proceed with new legislation, there will be further consultation on detailed and costed proposals.

<P>
<P>
<a name="71127w03.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 There is considerable research within the Home Office and elsewhere which indicates those influences which are strongest on young people, particularly in relation to commencement of offending. One of the strongest of these is poor parental supervision. This was dealt with in some detail in the 1995 Home Office Research Paper 145 "Young people and crime". The need for more responsible parenting is supported in a survey which was carried out for the Audit Commission in 1996 for its report "Streetwise Effective Police Patrol". Similar surveys for that report also revealed that there was a public concern about the need to deal with issues of juvenile nuisance and anti-social behaviour.
<P>

<a name="71127w03.html_para7">The objectives of the Government's youth justice reform programme seek, amongst other things, to address these concerns. That is why one of the measures in the reform programme is the proposal to give local authorities the power, following consultation with the police and local community, to introduce local child curfews for unsupervised children under 10 who are out on the streets late at night. The aim of such curfews is two-fold. Not only will they address the need to protect young children from being drawn into anti-social or criminal behaviour, but they will protect communities from the misery and distress which can be so often caused by groups of unsupervised children acting in this way.

 Development carried out by a telecommunications code system operator under the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995 is subject to the condition that apparatus shall be removed as soon as reasonably practicable after it is no longer required for telecommunications purposes. Where telecommunications development requires a planning application to the local planning authority, it is open to the authority to impose a similar condition on any planning permission granted. It is for the local planning authority to take any necessary enforcement action where they consider that planning conditions have not been observed. In addition, the provisions of the Telecommunications Act 1984 allow occupiers of land to require the removal of redundant apparatus from their land where access for the purposes of installing that apparatus was originally

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what measures he is taking to improve the markets for waste-derived compost. [18127]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71127w06.html_spnew6"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 I am today announcing the publication of two guides which are aimed at improving the markets for waste-derived compost. The first contains practical guidance for large-scale producers of waste-derived compost, such as local authorities and the waste industry, setting out how they can design and market their product effectively to a variety of end users, particularly those in the horticulture and landscaping industries. The second guide is aimed at potential users, such as landscape architects and contractors, and explains the benefits of using waste-derived compost in their operations.
<P>

<a name="71127w06.html_para0">One of our major environmental objectives is to promote sustainable waste management across the country. Every nine months we produce enough waste in the United Kingdom to fill lake Windermere. And of the estimated 26 million tonnes of municipal solid waste produced in 1995-96, around 85 per cent. was landfilled. It is therefore vital that, in future, we choose waste management options which preserve and enhance our environment and safeguard human health. We are therefore committed to increasing the quality and quantity of organic waste which is composted. This means a greater degree of centralised composting by local authorities and the waste management industry. But to make such schemes viable, we also need to expand the markets for waste-derived compost and thereby increase the demand for the product.
<P>

<a name="71127w06.html_para1">We hope that these guides will make a valuable contribution to this by providing practical advice to compost producers and specifiers. They will be widely distributed free of charge to local authorities in England, waste management companies, composting organisations, landscaping architectural practices and selected landscaping contractors.
<P>

<a name="71127w06.html_para2">Copies of the guides have been placed in the house Libraries.

 Part B of Schedule 1 to the Building Regulations 1991 makes requirements with regard to fire safety when building work is undertaken with regard to all buildings, including homes. Guidance on ways of meeting these requirements is given in Approved Document B. This Document is currently being revised and changes will be proposed that will improve fire safety in the home. The draft Approved Document will be issued for public consultation in the near future. Most relevant to homes there will be additional guidance on the siting and installation of smoke alarms, including in loft conversions to two storey houses, and on means of escape, in particular the provision of suitable windows in habitable rooms.

 An annex which is classed as a separate dwelling for council tax purposes is exempt from council tax if a resident is a dependent relative. A relative is regarded as dependent if they are aged 65 or over, if they have a severe mental impairment, or if they are substantially and permanently disabled. In addition, there are exemptions for dwellings occupied only by those under the age of 18 or only by students.

This estimate was provided to the House in this Department's Compliance Cost Assessment under cover of Explanatory Memorandum 7208/95 in September 1996.

<P>
<P>
<a name="71127w07.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Hinchliffe: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what action he plans to take to support local authorities wishing to convert derelict land, vacant offices and difficult-to-let shops, in town and city centre areas, into housing units. [17240]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71127w07.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 Local authorities are responsible for drawing up housing strategies that set out how they intend to meet local housing needs. In drawing up these strategies, they have to assess the need for additional housing as well as other housing needs. They then have to consider how to use the resources available to them, both financial and other, to meet those needs. It is for the local authority to decide the best way of using available resources to the benefit of their residents and tenants while achieving the best value for money.
<P>

<a name="71127w07.html_para1">To assist local authorities meet housing needs we have recently made available additional resources through the Capital Receipts Initiative to assist with housing and housing related regeneration. Over &#163;600 million will be available in England in 1998-99.
<P>

<a name="71127w07.html_para2">More specifically, as far as local authority assets are concerned, in April this year the capital finance system was relaxed so that if an authority disposes of certain assets, more of the capital receipt can be recycled into regeneration schemes in deprived areas rather than being set aside for debt redemption. Assets covered by the concession are unoccupied council dwellings (except those sold under right-to-buy or large scale voluntary transfer), occupied industrial estates, docks and harbours, leisure facilities, shops and offices and land for development. Receipts from the sale of these assets can be applied to regeneration schemes in listed wards and wards adjacent to listed wards.
<P>

<a name="71127w07.html_para3">In addition, planning policy guidance notes, both on housing (PPG3) and on town centres and retail developments (PPG6), advise local planning authorities, where appropriate, to reallocate land allocated for other uses to housing, and to encourage conversions of vacant offices and vacant accommodation over shops by taking a flexible approach to residential car parking and other standards.

<P>
<P>
<a name="71127w07.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The CAA carried out an economic analysis on behalf of the Department before the recent negotiations with Pakistan. It was made available to all members of the UK delegation before the talks, including representatives of Manchester Airport, and taken into account when Ministers agreed the strategy for the negotiations. It is not our policy to publish such analyses, given their bearing on the UK negotiating position in air services negotiations.

<P>
<a name="71127w07.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The Government welcomes increased international services to regional airports. As the economic impact of a new air service is dependent on the characteristics of an individual route the Department considers it a more effective use of resources to ask the CAA to carry out a specific economic analysis before air services negotiations with bilateral partners.

To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland what arrangements he intends to put in place to increase the level of pre-school provision once the pre-school education voucher scheme is withdrawn in June 1998. [18474]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71127w08.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 We believe that every child should have the chance of good pre-school education. That means a major expansion of services. We have pledged, first, to make a good-quality, part-time education place available, without charge, to every child in the pre-school year; and we aim to achieve this by the winter of next year. After that, and as new resources are found, we will set staged targets for three-year-olds. This is an ambitious and exciting programme.
<P>

<a name="71127w08.html_para3">For too long in some areas, pre-school education was neglected and ignored. Then it was subjected to the experiment of vouchers. Pre-school education needs a fresh start. It needs clear national priorities and targets, a fair and stable funding system, strong support for quality, and a framework for consultation and planning that will strengthen co-operation amongst providers.
<P>

<a name="71127w08.html_para4">I am delighted today to announce the launching of a major consultation paper, <i>Education in Early Childhood: The Pre-school Years.</i><i></i> Through this paper, I am initiating a national debate about the future of pre-school education in Scotland. The paper sets out our policy priorities; it discusses how services should be planned and funded, how providers, parents and others can work together in mutually rewarding ways, and how high standards of service can be assured. It also asks questions about the educational needs of three-year-olds and the kind of provision that parents want for them; and how best we should plan to offer learning to these very young children. The consultation paper also lays the foundations for more integrated early years services linking education to daycare and other services for children.

<P>
<a name="71127w08.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. McLeish: </B> 
 The police in Scotland are represented on the World Cup Co-ordinating Group, set up by my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary, to co-ordinate arrangements at UK level. In addition, a committee consisting of officials from The Scottish Office, senior police officers and representatives from the Scottish Football Association has been established to draw up a strategy for the safety and security of Scottish fans travelling to France. The committee will liaise with the French authorities after the draw on 4 December when venues for matches will be known. The Scottish Football Association will then deal directly with FIFA. The police plan to contact their counterparts in France where the Scotland team will play to exchange intelligence and invite representatives to attend matches in Scotland to gain first-hand experience of Scottish supporters who have a world wide reputation for good behaviour.

 In 1996, 46 written complaints were received by the Welsh Office about anti-social behaviour by neighbours. To date, in 1997, 50 have been received. We have no information on the number of complaints received by social landlords.
<P>

<a name="71127w11.html_para1">We are determined to take and support measures which protect the majority of citizens who respect the law and the rights of others. The proposed Crime and Disorder Bill will contain a number of measures to reduce petty crime and neighbourhood disorder. These include such measures as community safety orders to restrain the behaviour of individuals; and a new responsibility on local authorities to develop statutory partnerships to help prevent crime and enhance community safety.
<P>

<a name="71127w11.html_para2">There are a number of legal measures, including eviction, which landlords can use against tenants guilty of anti-social behaviour. The Welsh Office has issued good practice guidance (entitled 'Getting the Best Out of the Court System in Possession Cases') to all local authorities in Wales to help them make more effective and speedier use of these measures. In addition, the Housing Act 1996 contains provisions to improve the legal processes and strengthen the powers available to landlords to deal with anti-social behaviour by tenants and their visitors.
<P>

<a name="71127w11.html_para3">Guidance on these provisions was issued to local authorities earlier this year in Welsh Office circulars 2/97 'Conduct of Tenants--Introductory Tenancies and Repossession for Secure Tenancies' and 38/97 'Conduct of Tenants--Injunctions Against Anti-Social Behaviour'. Guidance on anti-social behaviour for housing association landlords is contained in paragraph 8.4 of 'The Regulatory Requirements' issued by Tai Cymru.

Every effort is being made to have the export ban lifted and that should see a further improvement in prospects for the industry. Nevertheless, the beef sector remains in long term structural surplus and reform of the CAP beef regime is essential.

<a name="71127w12.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The Codex Committee on Nutrition and Foods for Special Dietary Uses is in the process of drawing up guidelines on supplements containing vitamins and minerals. The current draft, which addresses a number of issues, including the setting of maximum vitamin and mineral content of supplements, is due to be discussed again in September 1998. Codex standards and guidelines are advisory and it is for individual Governments to decide what use, if any, they wish to make of them.
<P>

<a name="71127w12.html_para0">In June of this year, the EU Commission issued a discussion document on the possible harmonisation of national controls on vitamin and mineral supplements and foods with added vitamins and minerals. This reviewed the current situation and presented for consideration various issues relating to the control of these products, including the question of the need for establishing maximum limits on their vitamin and mineral content. It made no proposals for action on this or on any of the other issues covered. Nor did it commit the Commission to bringing forward proposals for legislation. A copy of the UK's response has been deposited in the Library.
<P>

<a name="71127w12.html_para1">The Committee on Toxicity of Chemical in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment (COT) have not considered dietary supplements as a class of products but have provided advice on the safety of supplements containing vitamin B6. After reviewing the data from scientific literature, the COT advised that the level of vitamin B6 in dietary supplements sold under food law should be limited to a maximum of 10 mg per daily dose. The Government has accepted this recommendation. A copy of the statement issued by the COT is already available in the Library.
<P>

<a name="71127w12.html_para2">In each case, the products being considered are those sold as foods: products classified as medicines are not affected.

<P>
<a name="71127w12.html_spnew9"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The rates for student awards and loans, and the associated contribution scales, for academic year 1998-99 have not yet been determined.
<P>

<a name="71127w12.html_para11">It is therefore not possible at this stage to give precise figures about contributions to tuition fees in the 1998-99 academic year. However, had tuition fee contributions been in effect in academic year 1997-98, English students with a residual (ie net) parental income after allowable deductions of about &#163;26,500 would have been assessed as due to pay the full &#163;1,000.
<P>

<a name="71127w12.html_para12">It is not practicable to give precise individual figures for the equivalent gross income at which the full &#163;1,000 fee will become payable in 1998-99, as this will depend on the circumstances of the family concerned. However, because it may not be immediately clear to prospective students and their parents what is meant by "residual income," we have illustrated the sort of gross family income above which the full &#163;1,000 will be payable. In 1998-99 it will be about &#163;35,000 a year.

<P>
<a name="71127w14.html_spnew9"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 The current drugs strategy "Tackling Drugs Together" makes young people a priority. On 25 November three new documents about young people were launched by the Standing Conference on Drug Abuse following consultation with the Department and service providers. My hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State was present and endorsed the documents. They outline the need for services which are appropriate for children and young people, which take a holistic approach, and which have staff with appropriate training for working with young people. They also provide detailed information about good practice, models of services and information about critical success factors. All three documents emphasise the necessity of inter-agency partnerships to deal with the problems of young people who misuse drugs.

<P>
<a name="71127w14.html_spnew10"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 A wide range of treatment services is available through the National Health Service ranging from substitute prescribing to intensive residential rehabilitation. The Department of Heath does not have a central record of services provided. It is for health authorities to determine what services to commission from the NHS and voluntary agencies according to their assessment of local needs and priorities.

 Information in the form requested is not available centrally. Between June and September 1997, approximately 640,000 people were receiving care from specialist mental health services but there is no breakdown centrally of the type of care provided to these patients. Data are available on specific services but these will involve an element of double counting since some patients will have received more than one service or, in the case of hospital in-patient episodes, have had more than one episode in hospital.

Within the United Kingdom we will allow clinical trials involving humans to take place only if and when we are satisfied that the risks associated with such procedures are acceptable.

<P>
<a name="71127w16.html_spnew9"><B> Mrs. Liddell </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 13 November 1997]:</i> My right hon. Friend the Chancellor's pre-Budget Report describes a range of measures designed to promote economic stability and achieve high levels of growth and employment. The policies set out there will contribute to the settled period of stability which is needed in order that Britain will be in a position to join the single currency, should we wish to, early in the next Parliament.

[15925]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71127w16.html_spnew10"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 It is currently possible to use foreign currencies for an extensive range of activities in the United Kingdom. After 1 January 1999, this facility will also apply to the euro. My right hon. Friend the Chancellor has announced publicly that, as with the dollar today, firms will be able to file company accounts, issue shares, have bank accounts and pay taxes in euro.
<P>

<a name="71127w16.html_para4">However, the Government consider that use of the euro is likely to be more widespread than with other major foreign currencies. We are considering steps that the Government might take to ensure that British firms are able to use the euro as effortlessly as possible where it makes commercial sense and they choose to do so. This includes, for example, developing with the banking sector a "seal of approval" so that firms and individuals can recognise those banks which offer reliable information and allow customers to bank in euro without paying high charges.

<P>
<P>
<a name="71127w16.html_spnew11"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 The Treasury has not carried out research aimed specifically at the ease with which the euro currency symbol is distinguishable from the pound sterling symbol.

<P>
<P>

<a name="71127w16.html_spnew14"><B> Mr. Gordon Brown: </B> 
 Since May, interest rates have been increased by 1&#188; per cent. to 7&#188; per cent. In the new framework for monetary policy, the Bank of England has the operational responsibility for setting interest rates to meet the Government's inflation target.

 In the new framework for monetary policy the responsibilities are absolutely clear. The Government's role is to set the economic objectives and, in particular, the inflation target.

 To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what assessment he has made of the impact on those shareholders who have no liability for income tax of his decision to end their eligibility for dividend tax credits from April 1999.[16622]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71127w17.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Geoffrey Robinson: </B> 
 All relevant factors were considered when deciding whether shareholders should continue to receive payment of tax credits on their dividend income, including the position of those individual shareholders who are not liable to tax. Given that pension providers and most UK companies are no longer entitled to payment of tax credits on dividends paid on or after 2 July, it would not have been sensible to leave part of the incentive for companies to distribute profits through a payable tax credit to other investors. Nevertheless, tax credits will continue to be paid to non-liable individual shareholders until 1999, when they will have the opportunity to switch into Individual Savings Accounts, which will provide a tax-favoured environment for savings.

<a name="71127w17.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Geoffrey Robinson: </B> 
 The Government are committed to a tax system that encourages employment opportunities and work incentives for all; promotes savings and investment; is fair and is seen to be fair. This is good for the UK and for UK business. The level of taxation on business in the UK is the lowest of any major EU economy and lower than the OECD average.

<a name="71127w17.html_para2">The Pre-Budget Report presented to Parliament on Tuesday launched a pre-Budget debate on the policies needed to deliver high and stable levels of growth and employment. My right hon. Friend the Chancellor announced further reform of corporation tax including another 1p cut in the main corporation tax rate and the abolition of advance corporation tax in 1999 together with a move to quarterly payments by larger companies. The spring Budget will include measures to reform capital gains tax to promote long-term investment.

 The Government are examining the tax implications of international trading on the Internet in close consultation with other Governments, at OECD and in other forums, and with the business community. The Government's objective, shared with our trading partners, is to ensure that tax revenues are protected without inhibiting the growth of trading on the Internet.

 The Tax Law Rewrite project aims to bring clarity to our direct tax legislation, making the tax system more accessible to taxpayers and their advisers. The project is continuing to make good progress, and the publication today of a Technical Discussion Document testing how well the rewrite techniques work on complex legislation is a further step towards a clearer and more user friendly tax system. Copies of the document have been placed in the Libraries of the House.
<P>

<a name="71127w18.html_para0">I am keen that anyone with an interest takes this opportunity to comment on the rewrite techniques being used. Consultation with all those involved in taxation is the key to successfully producing a clear and logical structure for tax legislation.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security how many of the lone parents who received initial letters as part of the New Deal pilots were in receipt of income support three months later. [14736]<P>

<P>
<a name="71127w18.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Keith Bradley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 7 November 1997]:</i> The New Deal for Lone Parents will fulfil the Government's commitment to help lone parents to get off benefit and into work. The programme is currently running in eight areas in England, Scotland and Wales. The New Deal for lone parents will be rolled out nationally from October next year.
<P>

<a name="71127w18.html_para1">The programme was launched on 21 July. In the period to the 10 August, 2,672 lone parents had been invited to participate in the programme. Of these, at the 10 November, 2,421 were in receipt of income support.
<P>
<P>
<a name="71127w18.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Webb: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security if she will set out, in respect of the calculation that lone parents are on average &#163;50 per week better off in work than on benefit, <i>(a)</i> the sample size, <i>(b)</i> the proportion of lone parents in the sample with zero child care costs, <i>(c)</i> the proportion with positive receipt of child maintenance, <i>(d)</i> their average ages and <i>(e)</i> their average travel-to-work costs. [18053]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71127w18.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Keith Bradley: </B> 
 The average &#163;50 a week "better off" figure refers to the additional income in work lone parents currently on Family Credit are likely to receive over and above the corresponding estimate of their out of work incomes.
<P>

<a name="71127w18.html_para2">The figure is based on the 1994 PSI survey of lone parents, updated to take into account recent benefit changes.
<P>

<a name="71127w18.html_para3">The sample size was 375, of which 79 per cent. were not paying for child care. 37.5 per cent. received child maintenance and their average age was 35. The average travel-to-work costs were &#163;4.93 per week.
<P>
<P>
<a name="71127w18.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Webb: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security for how many of the 433 lone parents who were helped to obtain jobs by the New Deal pilot scheme she currently has information on the amount by which they were better off in work; and what was the average gain for these people. [18097]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71127w18.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Keith Bradley: </B> 
 Up to the end of October, 542 lone parents had been helped into work in the first eight areas of the New Deal for Lone Parents. Lone parents can ask for in-work "better off" calculations obtained by New Deal Advisers from the Integrated Benefit Information System (IBIS). This system provides estimates of the likely entitlements to in-work benefits such as Family Credit, but we do not know the amount by which they are actually better off in work. The evaluation of the programme includes a quantitative survey of a sample of participants in all eight areas of the scheme which will collect systematic information from lone parents on how much better off they will actually be in work.
<P>

<a name="71127w18.html_para4">Research has shown that most lone parents want to work and the New Deal will provide the opportunities to do so. The advantages of work for lone parents are in terms of not only financial gain but improving self-esteem for the parent and providing a more positive role model for the children.
