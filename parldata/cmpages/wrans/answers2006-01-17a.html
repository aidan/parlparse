 The Department continues to support the work of the police, local authorities and transport operators to tackle crime on public transport. We are developing, evaluating and disseminating good practice on reducing crime and the fear of crime wherever it occurs in the transport system. We have also introduced the Secure Stations Scheme and launched the Safer Travel on Buses and Coaches Panel. As Sponsor Department for the British Transport police we have encouraged and assisted the force, through implementation of legislation and increased funding, to fulfil its responsibilities for policing the railways.

<p><a name="st_51"><a name="60117w05.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 Civil Contingency Reaction Forces (CCRFs) are based on the 14 TA Infantry battalions spread across the country. Each CCRF comprises a pool of around 500 personnel drawn from the Volunteer Reserve Forces, who have volunteered for the CCRF commitment in addition to their normal role. CCRF membership is dynamic and details of individual availability, including where volunteers have been deployed as part of their normal Reserve role, are not held centrally. It is, however, the case that when a CCRF member is mobilised to meet other commitments we aim to replace that individual immediately by another volunteer.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117w05.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_27">There are no specific recruitment schemes in place, nor are such schemes necessary given that the pool of potential volunteers consists of existing members of the Volunteer Reserves. The future size of the CCRFs is being considered as part of a wider review of the TA.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117w05.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_28">CCRFs would not be deployed in a situation which required the use of force so no question of rules of engagement would arise. Volunteers are not held at permanent readiness, although we aim to be able to deploy a CCRF within 24 hours. There are no specific criteria which would lead to a decision to mobilise a CCRF; they form part of the pool of resources upon which we could draw in the event of a request for military assistance.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60117w05.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_29">While the supporting infrastructure is based on the army&#039;s regional structure, it is not the case that a CCRF would only be mobilised to undertake operations within its &quot;home&quot; region. Consequently, all CCRFs are available to undertake operations anywhere in the UK over an extended period, including in London.

<p>
<a name="60117w05.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_30">No CCRF members were mobilised in response to the terrorist attacks in London on 7 and 21 July 2005.

Macro-economic stability, active labour market policies such as the new deal, policies to make work pay such as the national minimum wage and the working tax credit, and financial support for families, have all contributed to reducing child poverty since 1998&#150;99. On an after housing cost basis, this approach has lifted 600,000 children out of relative poverty (60 per cent. of less of contemporary median income), and 1.8 million children out of absolute poverty (60 per cent. or less of median income in 1996&#150;97, uprated by prices), between 1998&#150;99 and 2003&#150;04. Since 2000&#150;01, 300,000 children have been lifted out of relative poverty and 800,000 children have been lifted out of absolute poverty.

<p>
<a name="60117w07.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_43">Financial support for families has been based on the principle of progressive universalism, with support for all families and additional support for those who need it most. Child benefit provides universal support, and the Government have increased the rate of child benefit for the first child by more than 25 per cent. in real terms since 1997. The child tax credit (CTC) was introduced in April 2003, and targets additional financial support based on the needs and circumstances of the whole household. As a result of the Government&#039;s reforms to the tax and benefit system since 1997, by October 2007, in real terms, families with children will be, on average, &#163;1,550 a year better off, while those in the poorest fifth of the income distribution will be, on average, &#163;3,350 per year better off.

<a name="stpa_44">The Government have set out its spending plans to 2007&#150;08, including a commitment to increase the child element of CTC in line with earnings. While it is possible to model the immediate effect of further changes, there are uncertainties in projecting the numbers of children in relative low income poverty. A further increase of &#163;5 per week in the rate of child benefit would initially lift around 350,000 children out of poverty, at a cost of around &#163;3.4 billion. A further increase of &#163;500 per week in the child element of CTC would initially lift around 750,000 children out of poverty, at a cost of around &#163;3.5 billion. Increasing the rate of child benefit for all children to the rate for the first child would lift around 250,000 children out of poverty, at a cost of around &#163;1.7 billion.

<p>
<a name="60117w07.html_para7">
<a name="stpa_45">The Family Resources Survey does not enable the Government to make an estimate of the cost or effect of reducing the rate of child benefit when a child reaches the age of 12. The Government have not made an estimate of the cost of eradicating child poverty by 2007&#150;08, which would depend on the definition used, and would be subject to large uncertainties around future income growth, changes in the income distribution, and individual changes in behaviour in response to policy changes.

Notes:<br>

1. The public expenditure figures are taken from Public Expenditure Statistical Analyses 2005.<br>

2. Private spending is calculated in a similar way as for ONS health accounts. From 2004&#150;05, it is assumed to carry forward as a constant share of GDP.<br>

3. The EU averages are simple averages of the figures for each country; they are not weighted by country population. For seven countries where 2003 figures were not available, 2002 figures were used instead.<br>

4. The 19 members of the OECD within the EU-25 are the EU-15 plus the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and the Slovak Republic.<br>

 DFID, along with all Government Departments, is committed to see reform of developed country agriculture policies, including trade policies, which distort international markets, and which if reformed, could deliver real development gains to the world&#039;s poorest countries. In the assistance we provide to developing countries, we do not start from the premise that their agriculture trade policies specifically must be reformed. The assistance that DFID provides to developing countries under our trade related capacity building programme is designed to support their own priorities and development needs, as identified by the countries themselves, and falls into three broad categories; helping developing countries to determine their own trade policies; helping them to negotiate their priorities in both bilateral and multilateral fora; and helping them to capture the potential benefits from trade. Since 1998, we have committed &#163;181 million to trade related capacity building, and are set to increase this Aid for Trade to &#163;100 million per annum by 2010.

A Diagnostic Trade Integration Study (DTIS) is carried out for each LDC participating in the IF which identifies constraints to the trading performance of LDCs, policies, infrastructure, institutional and private sector capacity. It also provides technical advice on how to address these constraints. Agriculture trade policies will be considered in participating LDCs with agricultural export sectors.

 A preliminary analysis of the barrier&#039;s route, published by the UN&#039;s Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) in March 2005, identified that some 142,640 acres (10 per cent.) of West Bank land will lie between the completed barrier and the Green Line. This is some of the most fertile land in the West Bank and is currently home to 49,400 Palestinians. Where the Barrier has been constructed, Palestinians face economic hardship from being restricted from or not being able to reach their land to harvest crops, graze animals or earn a living. Residents have also been cut off from schools, universities and specialized medical care by the constructed Barrier.

The Bill also provides for a reformed and simplified regulatory framework for early years and childcare to reduce bureaucracy and raise quality.

<a name="stpa_109">Local authorities receive support on early education through the Foundation Stage strand of the Primary National Strategy (PNS). That support includes disseminating effective practice; supporting the transition from Foundation Stage to Key Stage 1; supporting integrated provision; ICT development in the early years; working with parents as partners; and helping to embed the Foundation Stage Profile.

Of this Lancashire local authority will receive &#163;3,531,061 in 2006&#150;07 and &#163;4,515,291 in 2007&#150;08. The funding is to &#039;kick start&#039; extended services and can be used flexibly, for example, to support the development of childcare including the training of childcare workers.

 Graduates with an honours degree undertaking a second undergraduate degree in medicine, or other subjects, will not be entitled to a government tuition fee loan when introduced in 2006/07. The Department of Health does pay the fees of undergraduate medical students, including those with a previous graduate qualification, in years 5 and 6. Medical students on four year fast track courses do not pay tuition fee contributions, except in their first year, because the Department of Health pays the fees in years 2 to 4.

Notes:<br>

1. Figures separately identifying undergraduates are not available; students on postgraduate initial teacher training courses can be eligible for loans.<br>

2. There may be delays between borrowers becoming bankrupt and notifying the Student Loans Company, therefore figures could increase in future.<br>

<a name="stpa_123">There are several possible reasons for the rise in bankruptcy figures. Media coverage of the issue of student loan borrowers declaring themselves bankrupt during the passage of the Enterprise Act 2002 may have contributed to the rise in bankruptcies in 2003 and 2004. In addition, one of the effects of the Enterprise Act itself was to reduce the period of discharge from bankruptcy from three years to one. As a result provisions were included in the Higher Education Act 2004 to prevent student loans being written off on discharge from bankruptcy.

<p>
<a name="60117w17.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_124">Bankrupt student loan borrowers, though, continue to benefit from the same non-commercial terms as other borrowers, including income thresholds and repayment in line with income. Income-contingent loan borrowers are not required to repay if their annual income is below &#163;15,000.

<i>[holding answer 9 January 2006]:</i> The Secretary of State, I, and our predecessors have regular discussions, formal and informal, with Higher Education institutions, including Russell Group Universities, on a wide range of issues, including tuition fee levels. We have had no formal representations on the adequacy of tuition fee levels since the levels were set in regulations following the Higher Education Act 2004.
