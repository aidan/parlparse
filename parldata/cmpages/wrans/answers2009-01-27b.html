 Ministers and Officials from the Home Office and the Department for Transport have had several discussions concerning the use of &#147;registered traveller&#148; and automated border controls and the contribution they can make to border and passenger security. Both Departments are committed to working together, with airport operators, to introduce new technology to ensure that travel to and from the UK, and the crossing of the border, is quick and safe for all passengers.</p>

It does not require pre-enrolment&#151;passengers simply present their e-Passport as evidence of identity and entitlement to entry. The aim of both schemes is to help low-risk passengers cross the UK Border more quickly. While they are not a formal component of aviation or maritime security policy, both schemes ensure that only passengers who are entitled to cross our border are able to do so.</p>

 The United Kingdom is a signatory to the 1951 United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees ("Refugee Convention"). Each claim for asylum is considered on its individual merits by specially trained caseworkers to determine whether the applicant has demonstrated a well-founded fear of persecution in his or her country of nationality or habitual residence for one of the reasons set out in the Refugee Convention. These are reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion.</p>

Individuals whom the asylum decision-making process, and the independent appeal process where a suspensive appeal right exists, have found not to need international protection and who do not have the right to remain in the United Kingdom are expected to leave the UK voluntarily.

In addition, the United Kingdom is signatory to a number of bilateral and European Community Readmission Agreements. In certain circumstances these agreements can be utilised to affect the removal of an illegal migrant to a signatory state that a person can be proven to have transited directly en route to the UK, rather than their country of origin. The United Kingdom would, however, be obliged to consider any claim for international protection under the Refugee Convention before that person could be removed to the transit country, except in cases where they qualified to be removed under the Dublin Convention.</p>

<i>  [holding answer 22 January 2009]:</i> We are delivering the biggest shake-up of Britain&#146;s border security and immigration system in a generation.</p>

With a combined budget of &#163;2 billion, a staffing complement of 25,000 and a presence in 135 countries world-wide, Britain&#146;s border security is now among the toughest in the world.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_423"><a name="90127w0005.htm_para3"><a name="09012749001085">Since the launch of the UKBA our officers have seized over 800 million cigarettes, representing a potential loss of over &#163;149 million in tax revenue, &#163;260 million worth of illegal drugs and have taken 4,800 dangerous weapons, including firearms, stun guns and hundreds of knives, off the streets. For the same period, over 809,000 freight vehicles have been searched at our juxtaposed controls and we stopped over 21,000 attempts to cross the Channel illegally.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_424"><a name="90127w0005.htm_para4"><a name="09012749001086">The new points based system and the continuing ban on non-EU low skilled migrants we are controlling migration to ensure that only those the UK needs can come to work and study. This allows us to attract and keep people with the skills our economy needs; maximizing the benefits to Britain.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_425"><a name="90127w0005.htm_para5"><a name="09012749001087">Anyone applying for a visa&#151;three quarters of the world&#146;s population&#151;now has their fingerprints checked against UK databases.

 If the photograph sent with a passport application does not meet the requirements of the standards agreed through the International Civil Aviation Organisation, the applicant is asked to send new photographs but because of the way in which data on this is stored it is not possible to provide an annual breakdown of reasons for rejection without incurring disproportionate cost. A check of manual records in July 2007 showed that in 17.5 per cent. of applications in which photographs were rejected, the reason was that the eyes were obscured for various reasons, including wearing glasses and glare.</p>

It is necessary for the eyes to be visible in passport photographs in order for facial recognition technology to work.

 Yes. Research into people&#146;s willingness-to-pay for travel time savings suggests that, on average, commuters value travel time at a rate of &#163;5.04 per hour. This value is ordinarily used to aid decision making on infrastructure investments because many of the benefits reflect reduced delays for commuters.

<i> [holding answer 26 January 2009]:</i> The Ministry of Defence has been working on alternative energy sources for several years. The RAF has led on examining fuel efficiency and alternative fuel sources, including the wider application of biofuels across the land, sea and air environments. In 1999, RAF aircraft were among the first in the world certified to fly on up to 50 per cent. non-crude oil derived synthetic fuel. Since 2008, RAF aircraft, excluding the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight and a few small training aircraft have been certified to use 100 per cent. synthetic fuel.</p>

 The consultation on a Renewable Energy Strategy, published in June 2008, set out a variety of ways in which biomass could be used as fuel. In terms of the pollutants mentioned, those uses which are subject to regulation by the Environment Agency and others, such as large scale electricity generation, are not thought likely to contribute significantly to any emissions increase. However, research by the Government and others has shown that the uptake of biomass for heating purposes, specifically the use of wood as a heating fuel, could under certain circumstances have significant impacts on air quality.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_498"><a name="90127w0010.htm_para16"><a name="09012749001513">DEFRA has undertaken an analysis of the likely impacts on air quality of achieving the levels of biomass uptake set out in the consultation. This analysis used a number of assumptions about the locations and types of units likely to be used, and about the effect this has on the use of other fuels, including coal, oil and natural gas. Given that the UK is starting from a very low level of biomass use, it has been assumed that the growth in biomass heat will be achieved by the use of modem equipment, whose emissions are relatively much lower than those of existing plant.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_499"><a name="90127w0010.htm_para17"><a name="09012749001514">The evidence base used to inform this analysis suggests that, for modern, efficient units, the emission of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAH) is minimal.

<p><a name="stpa_500"><a name="90127w0010.htm_para18"><a name="09012749001515">In terms of particles, analysis of the "baseline" scenario, i.e. the emissions we would expect with no change in biomass heat uptake but assuming all other policies operate as expected, shows that the emissions of particulate matter (as PM10) drop from 18.3 ktonnes in 2006 to 13.2 in 2020. Under the most likely uptake scenario for biomass heat, emissions fall to 14.5 ktonnes in 2020, a difference of 1.3 ktonnes. This analysis is very sensitive to the type of plant used and its location. In particular, the analysis assumed that the majority of uptake, especially in the early phase, is off the gas grid, and that the fuels it displaces are mainly coal and oil used for heating purposes.</p>

 In May, the Government announced a plan to take advantage of market opportunities to bring private sector developer stock into the affordable housing sector by providing &#163;200 million of funding through the Housing Corporation's national affordable housing programme (AHP) for the purchase of homes from house builders.

 Between 2005-06 and 2007-08 the Taking Part survey was primarily designed to yield a representative annual sample of around 28,000 adults aged 16 and over who are normally resident in England. For practical purposes, residents of institutional accommodation (armed forces barracks, student halls of residence, hospitals, care homes, prisons etc.) were excluded.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_593"><a name="90127w0019.htm_para7"><a name="09012764001247">The survey contractor used the small-user postal address file (PAF) as the sample frame. This provides a list of almost all private residential addresses in the UK and is the most comprehensive frame available. Because it lists addresses, not individuals, interviewers were required to randomly select one respondent from among those eligible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_594"><a name="90127w0019.htm_para8"><a name="09012764001248">Primary sampling units (PSUs) were designed to be equal to postal sectors except where these contained fewer than 500 delivery points (addresses) on the small-user postal address file (PAF). These sectors were combined with their nearest neighbour to form a &#145;super-sector&#146;. Before use, the list of PSUs was stratified using the following factors:</p>

 The term &#145;standard error&#146; refers to the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of a statistic&#151;that is, it indicates how well a statistic reflects the population from which the sample was drawn.

 Guidance published in 2006 encouraged burial ground managers to explore the local demand for out-of-hours working, especially where required for religious reasons, and to ensure that every effort was made to deal with individual applications.</p>

Each authority should have local arrangements in place to cater for the needs of their particular community. We will, however, consult the representative bodies and members of our faith forum on whether it would be helpful to issue general guidance on this issue.</p>

 Our assessment is that the new court fees have had no effect on local authorities fulfilling their statutory obligations to protect children at risk. There was a reduction in the number of applications for care orders issued by local authorities following introduction of the new statutory guidance to local authorities and Public Law Outline introduced on 1 April 2008, a month before the new fees were implemented. Since the initial drop in April and May 08, volumes have been increasing. We will continue to monitor the number of applications being issued.</p>

 We are aware that there is some interest in the disposal of bodies by promession, as an alternative to cremation. The process does not involve  the burning of human remains, however, so falls outside the Cremation Act 1902. Making it lawful would thus need either a new Act or an amendment to the 1902 Act. There are no plans to amend the law at present.</p>

The Youth Crime Action Plan, published in July 2008 details the cross Government approach to reducing youth crime, including youth reoffending. It sets out a &#145;triple track&#146; approach of enforcement and punishment where behaviour is unacceptable, non-negotiable support and challenge where it is most needed, and better and earlier prevention. The Youth Justice Board leads on the target of a 10 per cent. reduction by 2011 of the frequency rate of youth reoffending against the 2005 baseline, and is working, with Departments, to influence the key services to ensure young people have access to mainstream, and specialist services before, during and after justice.</p>

However, regular discussions take place at official level, and the EU fully shares the UK's concerns about the human rights situation in Iran, as can be seen by the large number of EU representations and declarations on this issue. The most recent EU declaration, made on 13 January 2009, condemned the stonings which took place in Mashhad on 21 December 2008, and urged the Iranian authorities to end the practice of execution by stoning and remove stoning from the Iranian penal code. On 19 December 2008, the EU made a declaration expressing concern about a mass execution on 26 November 2008, pressure on women&#146;s rights activists including Esha Momeni, and the situations of Hussein Derakhshan, an Iranian blogger, and the trade unionist Mansour Ossanlou.</p>

 We have not had discussions with any international organisations on direct intervention in Zimbabwe to remove Robert Mugabe from power. Those working for change and reform in Zimbabwe are not calling for military intervention. Their, and our, focus is foremost on the humanitarian situation and doing what can be done to alleviate suffering. We do, however, regularly discuss with the UN and EU non-military options for encouraging a resolution to the crisis. On 26 January 2009, my right hon.

2. Small numbers: To protect patient confidentiality, figures between one and five have been suppressed and replaced with "*" (an asterisk). Where it was possible to identify numbers from the total due to a single suppressed number in a row or column, an additional number (the next smallest) has been suppressed.<br>
3. Alcohol-related admissions: The number of alcohol-related admissions is based on the methodology developed by the North West Public Health Observatory (NWPHO). Following international best practice, the NWPHO methodology includes a wide range of diseases and injuries in which alcohol plays a part and estimates the proportion of cases that are attributable to the consumption of alcohol. Details of the conditions and associated proportions can be found in the report Jones et al. (2008) &#145;Alcohol-attributable fractions for England: Alcohol-attributable mortality and hospital admissions&#146;.<br>
4. Figures for under 16s only include admissions where one or more alcohol-specific conditions were listed. This is because the research on which the attributable fractions are based does not cover under 16s. Alcohol-specific conditions are those that are wholly attributed to alcohol - that is, those with an attributable fraction of one. They are:<br>
Alcoholic cardiomyopathy (142.6)<br>
Alcoholic gastritis (K29.2)<br>
Alcoholic myopathy (G72.1)<br>
Alcoholic polyneuropathy (G62.1)<br>
Alcohol-induced pseudo-Cushing's syndrome (E24.4)<br>
Degeneration of nervous system due to alcohol (G31.2)<br>
Mental and behavioural disorders due to use of alcohol (F10)<br>
Accidental poisoning by and exposure to alcohol (X45)<br>
Ethanol poisoning (T51.0)<br>
Methanol poisoning (T51.1)<br>
Toxic effect of alcohol, unspecified (T51.9)<br>
5. Number of episodes in which the patient had an alcohol-related primary or secondary diagnosis: These figures represent the number of episodes where an alcohol-related diagnosis was recorded in any of the 14 (7 prior to 2002-03) primary and secondary diagnosis fields in a Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) record. Each episode is only counted once in each count, even if an alcohol-related diagnosis is recorded in more than one diagnosis field of the record.<br>
6. Finished admission episodes: A finished admission episode is the first period of inpatient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. Finished admission episodes are counted against the year in which the admission episode finishes. Admissions do not represent the number of inpatients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>
7. Emergency admissions: Includes all types of emergency admission (Method of admission codes 21-28).<br>
8. Primary diagnosis: The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 14 (7 prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in the HES data set and provides the main reason why the patient was in hospital.<br>
9. Secondary diagnoses: As well as the primary diagnosis, there are up to 13 (six prior to 2002-03) secondary diagnosis fields in HES that show other diagnoses relevant to the episode of care.<br>
10. Data Quality: HES are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts in England. Data are also received from a number of independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br>

 The National Service Framework for Coronary Heart Disease (March 2000) sets a 10-year framework for action to prevent disease, tackle inequalities, save more lives, and improve the quality of life for people with heart disease. Chapter 4 of the CHD NSF covers stable angina. This chapter sets out how primary care teams and specialists can best help people with angina or suspected angina to relieve their symptoms and reduce their risk of suffering a major cardiovascular event.</p>

This is known as the National Refractory Angina Centre (NRAC).

 The White Paper &#147;Pharmacy in England: Building on strengths&#151;delivering the future&#148; highlighted that primary care trust pharmaceutical needs assessments should contribute to joint strategic needs assessments, which all primary care trusts (PCTs) and upper tier local authorities have a duty to undertake. The support programme on pharmaceutical needs assessment being devised for primary care trusts, led by NHS Employers, is expected to include guidance on linking joint strategic needs assessment and pharmaceutical needs assessment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_726"><a name="90127w0031.htm_para6"><a name="09012778000959">Following publication of the White Paper, the Department asked NHS Employers to set up a short-term working group to review requirements for pharmaceutical needs assessments and to develop a support programme for primary care trusts. The first element of this programme&#151;&#147;Pharmaceutical Needs Assessments (PNAs) as part of world class commissioning&#151;Guidance for primary care trusts&#148;, was published on 7 January 2009.

However, our White Paper stated that while many PCTs have reviewed these assessments or plan to do so, not all PCTs had yet considered the need to either update or review their assessments. The Health Bill 2009 introduced on 15 January 2009 contains proposals to require primary care trusts to assess pharmaceutical needs in their area and to publish a statement of those needs. Subject to parliamentary approval, new regulations, to be derived from powers in the Bill, will set out the requirements for how and when these assessments should be carried out.</p>

Hemiarthroplasty, unicondylar or unicompartmental knee replacements<br>
(These codes are included because they are for replacement of part of the knee joint.)<br>
For the following codes (W52-W54) a site code is required in the secondary position. Both codes must be included in the search. The site codes are also listed as follows.<br>
<i> OPCS-4.2, 4.3</i><br>
W52&#151;Prosthetic replacement of articulation of other bone using cement<br>
W53&#151;Prosthetic replacement of articulation of other bone not using cement<br>
W54&#151;Other prosthetic replacement of articulation of other bone<br>
The possible site codes, which would occur in a secondary procedure position (see footnote), are as follows:<br>
Z76.5&#151;Lower end of femur NEC<br>
Z77.4&#151;Upper end of tibia NEC<br>
Z84.4&#151;Patellofemoral joint<br>
Z84.5&#151;Tibiofemoral joint<br>
Z84.6&#151;Knee joint<br>
<i> Secondary procedure</i><br>
As well as the main operative procedure, there are up to 11 and 3 prior to 2002-03 secondary operative procedure fields in HES that show secondary or additional procedures performed on the patient during the episode of care.<br>
<i> Data quality</i><br>
HES are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England. Data is also received from a number of independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br>
<i> Ungrossed data</i><br>
Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in the data, i.e. the data are ungrossed.<br>
<i> Time waited (days)</i><br>
Time waited statistics from HES are not the same as the published waiting list statistics. HES provides counts and time waited for all patients admitted to hospital within a given period, whereas the published waiting list statistics count those waiting for treatment on a specific date and how long they have been on the waiting list. Also, HES calculates the time waited as the difference between the admission and decision to admit dates. Unlike published waiting list statistics, this is not adjusted for self-deferrals or periods of medical/social suspension.<br>
<i> PCT/strategic health authority (SHA) data quality</i><br>
PCT and SHA data was added to historic data years in the HES database using 2002-03 boundaries, as a one-off exercise in 2004. The quality of the data on  PCT of treatment and SHA of treatment is poor in 1996-97, 1997-98 and 1998-99, with over a third of all finished episodes having missing values in these  years. Data quality of PCT of general practitioner (GP) practice and SHA of GP practice in 1997-98 and 1998-99 is also poor, with a high proportion missing  values where practices changed or ceased to exist. There is less change in completeness of the residence-based fields over time, where the majority of unknown  values are due to missing postcodes on birth episodes. Users of time series analysis including these years need to be aware of these issues in their interpretation of the data.<br>
The PCTs used are as follows:<br>
5P3&#151;West Hertfordshire PCT<br>
5P4&#151;East and North Hertfordshire PCT<br>
<i> Method of admission</i><br>
The method of admission is how the patient was admitted to hospital. When calculating time waited, admissions are elective so the following methods  are used:<br>
11 Elective&#151;from waiting list<br>
12 Elective&#151;booked<br>
Code &#145;13 Elective&#151;planned&#146; is not included as it has been the patients choice to defer.<br>

</ul><a name="90127w0034.htm_brev25"><a name="09012778003644"><ul><p class="tabletext">It may be helpful if I explain that it is the Commission's position that child maintenance arrears should be paid immediately. Where this is not possible the Child Support Agency will attempt to negotiate the payment of a lump sum, by reference to the available information about the non-resident parent's current financial commitments to support them in negotiating the maximum amount possible. The Agency may also enter an agreement with the non-resident parent to recover all arrears as quickly as possible. In the absence of any exceptional circumstances this will normally be within two years.</p>
</ul><a name="90127w0034.htm_brev26"><a name="09012778003645"><ul><p class="tabletext">The Agency has been given the power under regulation 11 of the Child Support (Collection and Enforcement) Regulations 1992 to impose a deduction from earnings order to collect an amount of money which does not exceed 40% of a liable person's net earnings. Similarly, sections 35, 36 39a and 40 of the Child Support Act 1991 set out the other main enforcement powers the Agency can employ when seeking the payment of child maintenance arrears. The commitment set out in the Operational Improvement Plan was to consistently and effectively apply these powers to ensure that maintenance flows to children when they need it most.</p>
</ul><a name="90127w0034.htm_brev27"><a name="09012778003646"><ul><p class="tabletext">As a result, the Agency is collecting more child maintenance arrears than it has ever done before and in September 2008 collected &#163;14.6 million in maintenance arrears alone, more than twice the average amount collected each month before the introduction of the Operational Improvement Plan. Between 1 April and 30 September 2008, the Agency has collected &#163;80.3 million in arrears, bringing to almost &#163;297 million the total collected in maintenance arrears since April 2006.</p>

 1. The information in tables 1 and 2 is based on the numbers of employees recorded on the DWP payroll systems as having received a qualifying performance mark. These are headcount.<br>
 2. Some individuals may have received more than one type of bonus payment in the year, which is why the information has been presented separately and not as an aggregated total.<br>
 3. The performance bonus is paid in the financial year following the performance year of 1 April to 31 March.<br>
 4. The total amount paid includes Employers National Insurance Contribution (ERNIC).<br>
 5. In-year cash bonus data was previously held on a separate IT system. Data from this system can be obtained only from a third party and there would be a cost ascribed to this provision. This would bring the cost of answering this PQ to above the threshold considered proportionate.<br>

Apprenticeships provisions will be taken forward as part of the forthcoming Children, Skills and Learning Bill, including provisions to ensure that an apprenticeship place is available for all suitably qualified young people by 2013.

However, under the terms of the national multi-agency public protection arrangements (MAPPA) guidance, the police, and other MAPPA agencies, are required to consider whether to disclose information to third parties (including schools and colleges) in all MAPPA eligible cases.

 The UK Commission for Employment and Skills has undertaken mapping work on the coverage of National Occupational Standards (NOS) and qualifications development by Sector Skills Councils (SSCs) and Standard Setting Bodies (SSBs). This recognises the need for a co-ordinated approach for national occupational standards that are commonly found across all sectors of the workforce. The UK Commission will progress arrangements for ensuring consistency across SSCs and SSBs on cross sector standards. Proposals were put to the UK Vocational Qualification Reform Programme Board in November setting out how the UK Commission intends to ensure comprehensive occupational coverage. The proposals recognise the expertise and importance of cross-sector standard setting bodies, and are currently the subject of consultation in the Devolved Administrations. In the meantime funding and management of cross-sector standard setting bodies will continue in line with current arrangements.</p>

<i> Notes</i>:<br>
1. Data for ACL, Further Education and UFI is based on learner enrolments. One learner may enrol on more than one course e.g. 2 A levels and will be counted for each learning aim they are recorded on.<br>
2. Data for Work-based learning and Train to Gain is based on learner starts, by year in which the programme of learning was started.<br>
3. Data for Work-based learning includes apprenticeships (all levels) and Entry to Employment.<br>
4. Data does not exist on a comparable basis prior to 2004/05.<br>
5. Figures may not sum to totals due to rounding.<br>
7. Train to gain was launched in April 2006, so comparable data does not exist for 2004/05.<br>

 Local authorities already have substantial funding to support children with special educational needs (SEN), including SLCN. Local authorities planned expenditure to support children with SEN - including speech, language and communication needs (SLCN)&#151;is approximately &#163;5.1 billion in 2008-09 (up from &#163;2.1 billion in 2001-02). The pathfinder programme announced in &#147;Better Communication&#148;, the SLCN action plan published in December 2008, will demonstrate how local authorities and primary care trusts can prioritise and commission services for children with SLCN more efficiently and effectively within existing overall resources.</p>

 The requested information is not collected centrally by the Department. However, during the 2008-09 financial year local authorities in England budgeted net expenditure of over &#163;5.1 billion for the provision of education for children with special educational needs. It is not possible to identify how much of this &#163;5.1 billion was for the total cost of residential school placements for children with statements of special educational needs as the data is not collected in that way.</p>

 Inspection reports on individual Young Offender Institutions (YOIs) are public documents and available on-line and contain specific assessments of the education provision. The annual report of Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Education, Children's Services and Skills 2007/08 reported that the range of vocational provision for children and young people in secure settings is often too narrow. However, the current re-tendering process for the Offender Learning and Skills Service contracts for the provision of education and training in YOIs has set clear requirements for the core curriculum in YOIs. We also published our plans to improve education and training in custody within the Youth Crime Action Plan (July 2008). This included a commitment to place local authorities in the lead for securing education in juvenile custody, and this is scheduled to form part of the forthcoming Children, Skills and Learning Bill. The aim is to ensure education in custody meets young peoples&#146; personal needs and so far as is practical matches that available for children and young people in the mainstream education system.</p>
