 The information requested is not held centrally. The arrests collection undertaken by the Ministry of Justice provides data on persons arrested for recorded crime (notifiable offences), by age group, gender, ethnicity, and main offence group, for example violence against the person, sexual offences, robbery, burglary, etc. However, from these data we are not able to identify specific offences related to alcohol.</p>

 In 2002-03, 21 per cent. of people responding to the British Crime Survey perceived high levels of antisocial behaviour (ASB) compared with 17 per cent. in the year up to September 2007. The Local Government User Satisfaction Survey which asked similar questions to the British Crime Survey in 2003-04 and again in 2006-07 showed a reduction in perception in 94 per cent. of areas. This reduction in perception has contributed to the Home Office meeting its PSA target on confidence and reassurance for 2005-08.</p>

<i> [holding answer 19 February 2008]:</i> From 1 December 2003 using a hand-held mobile phone while driving became a specific, non-endorsable, fixed penalty offence. The fixed penalty was &#163;30. If the case went to court, the maximum fine was &#163;1,000. The Road Safety Act 2006, with effect from 27 February 2007, made the offence endorsable, with three penalty points and a &#163;60 fixed penalty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_280"><a name="80221w0001.htm_para6"><a name="080221135000146">The Department for Transport (DfT) has publicised the offence since its introduction, to emphasise that it is dangerous and that offenders will be punished.

In addition DfT provides printed materials to local authority road safety officers who mount their own campaigns .</p>

 I can confirm that a fire destroyed Tristan da Cunha&#146;s fish-processing factory on 13 February 2008. The generators that provided the island's power were also destroyed. The cause of the fire has not been identified. Power is now being supplied from a back-up generator, until a new generator can be delivered to the island in March 2008.

But the island&#146;s Administrator is working with Ovenstone, the company that runs the lobster fishing concession, supplies the island&#146;s electricity and owns the factory, to minimise the economic impact of the fire. The main concern is to maintain the revenue that the industry generates for the island and to minimise potential loss of earnings for those employed in the sector. Ovenstone are preparing contingency plans for the next fishing season, which begins in July 2008. Ovenstone has insurance cover in the event of fire and is already making plans to replace the island&#146;s power plant and build a new lobster-processing factory.</p>

Recruitment and retention of children's centre staff is a matter for local management by children's centres, local authorities and their partner agencies. By 2010 Sure Start children's centres will be serving all communities across the country providing universal, mainstream, permanent services for children under five and their families. Last summer we advised local authorities of their children's centres funding allocations for the next three financial years (2008 to 2011) to encourage longer-term planning and to increase stability in recruitment and retention of staff.</p>

The councils themselves decide within their respective budget allocations how much of their funding they spend on each of their programmes, and that determines which universities benefit from their expenditure. As announced in Budget 2006, the Government have designated the Science and Technology Facility Council&#146;s Daresbury Laboratory as a Science and Innovation Campus. The broader strategic role for Daresbury and its importance to the North West and its relationship with NW universities will be addressed as part of the Manchester Independent Economic Review to be chaired by Sir Tom McKillop which will specifically include Daresbury&#146;s contribution to the NW&#146;s scientific and economic base.

<i> [holding answer 11 December 2007]:</i> The Government do not make projections about the number of students graduating from higher education. But increasing and widening participation in HE is a priority for social and economic reasons. To achieve a world-class skills profile for the UK, we will need to deliver higher-level skills training to adults already in the workforce, as well as continuing to take action to meet our existing commitment to make progress towards a 50 per cent. HE participation rate for people aged 18-30. We will aim for at least 36% of adults to be qualified to at least Level 4 by 2014, up from 29 per cent. in 2005 and 40 per cent. by 2020. We are on target to achieve this.</p>

 The January 2008 Grant Letter to HEFCE set out our expectations for growth in student numbers. As a result of the 2 per cent. real terms increase in funding for HE we are making available over the next three years, and our decision to redistribute grant away from students doing second degrees or other HE qualifications at an equivalent or lower level in order to fund more first degree students, there is scope overall to fund significant growth. We expect a growth in core-fundable students of 20,000 new places in 2008-09, 35,000 new places in 2009-10 and about 60,000 new places in 2010-11 (on a full-time equivalent basis). The exact number of places to be filled by part-time first degree students will depend on student demand and the mixture of provision that institutions deliver, but our plans allow for a significant increase in employer co-funded provision where many students will want to study on a part-time basis.</p>

 The responsibility for recruiting staff lies with higher education institutions (HEIs), as the employers.

The Race Relations Act 1976 (as amended by the Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000) places a duty on higher education institutions to promote equality of opportunity. Through the Rewarding and Developing Staff initiative, we have supported HEIs in developing their human resource capability&#151;recruitment and retention, and equal opportunities were two of the six priority areas.</p>

<i> [</i><i> holding answer </i><i> 7 January 2008]: </i>The progressive re-distribution of institutional funding away from students doing equivalent or lower level qualifications (ELQs) to ones they already hold will enable us to widen Higher Education participation and support more of the millions of people of all ages without a first Higher Education qualification. Nobody has challenged that priority as a matter of principle or on grounds of fairness or social justice. In addition, the analysis in the Lord Leitch&#146;s report and comparative data from the OECD all support the conclusion that we are not producing enough graduates for our economic well-being. The ELQ policy sharpens the incentives in the system for HEIs to produce more of them to match our economic competitors. An extra 5 million people will need to go through university by 2020 if we are to be even on the edge of the premier league for world-class skills, with 40 per cent. of the  <br>

work force with a first HE qualification. All of the &#163;100 million affected by this policy will be redistributed to support this goal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_366"><a name="80221w0010.htm_para4"><a name="080221135001925">However, there will be transitional protection for existing ELQ students until they complete their courses and there will also be opportunities in future for students to pursue such qualifications through foundation degrees and employer co-funded provision. There will also be a review mechanism each year starting in December 2008 to look at individual subjects of particular economic or social importance. We are sure it would be wrong for us to rush into making special arrangements for any subjects, other than those which had already been identified, before any changes to ELQs, as requiring support in the public interest (such as medicine, initial teacher training teaching, science, technology, engineering and maths subjects, area-based studies, and modern foreign languages). But we are asking the Funding Council each year to look at levels of demand both for exempt or protected subjects and at any other subjects which might in future be regarded as key because of their economic or social significance and advise us on the best way forward.</p>

 We define &#147;functionally literate&#148; as having literacy skills at Level 1 or above and our public service agreement target for adult literacy from the comprehensive spending review contains a performance indicator for 597,000 people of working age to achieve a first Level 1 or above literacy qualification by 2011 towards our ambition of ensuring 95 per cent. of adults have a minimum of entry Level 3 numeracy and Level 1 literacy by 2020. Since the launch of the Skills for Life strategy in 2001, 1.759 million adults have improved their literacy, language or numeracy skills. The Skills for Life Survey in 2003 found that 19 per cent. of adults aged 16 to 65 in London region were below Level 1 literacy (approximately 190,000 people), compared to an average of 16 per cent. for England. We are currently planning to update the survey.</p>

 The progressive re-distribution of institutional funding away from students doing equivalent or lower level qualifications will enable us to widen Higher Education participation and support more of the millions of people of all ages without a first Higher Education qualification, some of whom may wish to train as ordinands.

 Sector Skills Councils (SSCs) receive public money from a range of sources. This normally takes the form of grant funding for the delivery of specific projects, mainly relating to occupational standards and qualification reform delivery. The schedule shows the forecast amount contracted with SSCs by the Sector Skills Development Agency (SSDA) during 2005/06 and 2007/08 financial years (1 April to 31 March). Information about other public money paid to SSCs is not available centrally.</p>

Core funding contracts are normally of three years duration and most SSCs are now on their second contract. The overall contract values range between &#163;4 million and &#163;7.2 million for the three year period and the payment profiles vary, by individual agreement with each SSC. Such grant funding is tied to the delivery of agreed contractual outputs and outcomes. The SSDA does not loan money to SSCs.</p>

 The Government are committed to improving the skills of the work force, and to delivering the world class skills ambition recommended by Lord Leitch in his independent review of our nation&#146;s skills. In &#145;World Class Skills: Implementing the Leitch Review of Skills in England&#146;, published in July last year, the Government set out how it will work employers, trade unions and individuals to deliver its world class skills ambition. As World Class Skills makes clear, this will require a significant increase in the number of people already in the work force who improve their skills, re-skill and gain new qualifications each year. 70 per cent. of the 2020 work force is already beyond the age of compulsory education.</p>

Through the measures set out in &#145;World Class Skills&#146;, the Government are giving employers the opportunity to exert real leverage and decision making over both the content and delivery of skills and employment programmes. The new UK Commission for Employment and Skills will strengthen the employer voice at the heart of the system. Reformed and re-licensed sector skills councils will be sharply focussed on raising employer investment, articulating the future skills needs of their sector and ensuring that the supply of skills and qualifications is driven by employers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_371"><a name="80221w0011.htm_para2"><a name="080221135002223">The Skills Pledge offers employers the opportunity to publicly demonstrate their commitment to investing in the skills of their employees and over 850 employers, covering over 2.3 million employees have already done this. To help employers of all sizes and in all sectors to identify and address their skills needs, the Government are expanding and improving the Train to Gain service, and expect to increase their investment through Train to Gain to over &#163;1 billion by 2010-11.</p>

 The Government&#146;s student finance package is designed to ensure that finance should not be a barrier to a higher education course. Student loans from the Government are not like commercial loans: interest is paid at the rate of inflation, so in real terms students only pay back what they borrowed. For income contingent loans available since 1998, repayment is linked to earnings and borrowers only repay if their earnings are over &#163;15,000; from April 2012 they will be able to take up to five years&#146; &#145;Repayment Holiday&#146; and those taking out a student loan from 2006 have their debt cancelled after 25 years.</p>

There was a rise in the number of bankruptcies/Individual Voluntary Agreements (IVAs) notified in 2003.

 The exact information requested could not be derived as a time series. Instead, the Labour Force Survey (LFS) was used to produce a time series with a slightly different qualification categories to those requested. The following table shows the estimates of unemployment rates by qualification held for adults aged 18-24 in England, using the LFS spring quarter (March to May) results between 1995 and 2005 and Quarter 2 results (April to June) for 2006 and 2007. The fact that there was a change in the reporting period of the LFS results means that the figures for 2006 and 2007 and not strictly comparable with those for earlier years as these estimates are subject to seasonality. However, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) does publish on its website a seasonally adjusted time series of the unemployment rate for 18 to 24-year-olds in the UK. This shows for example, that the rate fell from 13.1 per cent. in spring 1997 to 12.0 per cent. in the last quarter of 2007.</p>

 I refer the hon. Member to my answer on 17 January 2008, <i> Official Report</i>, columns 1412-13W, to the question from the hon. Member for Putney (Justine Greening). This described the approach we have adopted for distributing the &#145;Adding Capacity at Heathrow Airport&#146; consultation documents. In view of the number of ways in which consultation documents have been made available, it is not possible to determine precisely the split between documents sent to businesses and residents and the number sent to wards in each London borough.</p>

 The armed forces are one of the UK's largest employers of apprentices. Training is delivered &#145;in-house&#146;, with specific apprenticeship requirements being interwoven with the training needs of the operational environment. In the vast majority of cases, apprenticeship programmes directly relate to specific service professions and have significant portability when personnel return to civilian life. In the last financial year the armed forces recorded over 7,300 funded apprentice completions. In order to meet their business needs, the armed forces continue to expand the variety of apprenticeship schemes available to their personnel. No changes are planned to apprenticeship schemes that are currently in place.</p>

<i> [holding answer 20 February 2008]:</i> Many records did not survive due to the destruction of the Army Records Centre during the Blitz. If they have survived, attestation papers for non-commissioned ranks whose service ended before circa 1 Jan 1921 will be found at The National Archives, in classes WO 363 and WO 364 or in earlier-dated classes if discharged prior to the outbreak of the first world war. For those whose service ended in 1921 or later and whose attestation papers have survived, the papers will be among the British Army service records now held by TNT Archive Services on behalf of MOD.</p>

 The MOD introduced the Central Health and Safety project (CHASP) database in 1997 to collect health and safety incident data in the Department, mostly on duty or on MOD property. Although 65 parachute-related incidents have been recorded for the 10-year period 1997 to 2006 (data for 2007 is not currently available), difficulties with CHASP data collection suggest these are likely to represent an undercount of the true figure and details are unreliable.

 Planning Policy Guidance note 13: Transport sets out the Government's overall policy on planning for transport. Its objectives are to integrate planning and transport at the national, regional, strategic and local level and to promote more sustainable transport choices both for carrying people and for moving freight. Planning Pollution Statement 23: Planning and Pollution Control, and its Annex 1: Pollution Control, Air and Water Quality set out how the planning system can contribute to improvements in water quality. The policy expects local planning authorities to take into account the diffuse pollution that could be created by a proposed development and any measures the developer proposes to mitigate the impact. Neither documents provide specific advice on vehicle washing and cleaning.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_454"><a name="80221w0020.htm_para12"><a name="0802225001645">The Environment Agency issued a revised Pollution Prevention Guideline 13 on vehicle washing and cleaning in October 2007. This is good practice guidance for all landowners and tenants to help prevent pollution from vehicle washing and cleaning using automatic wash systems, high pressure or steam cleaners and washing by hand. Local authorities should be aware of pollution prevention guidelines and implement them where it is appropriate to do so. The principal enforcement agencies for pollution prevention guidelines are the Environment Agency, Scottish Environment Protection Agency, the Heritage Service for Northern Ireland and the water companies for pollution and trade effluent respectively. DEFRA is working with the Environment Agency to tackle non-agricultural diffuse water pollution as part of its work under both the water framework directive and &#145;Future Water&#146;, DEFRA's recently published Water strategy. In particular, DEFRA is considering the introduction of simple general binding rules, which will provide a new approach to regulating such activities along with proportionate forms of enforcement, such as fixed penalty notices. A DEFRA consultation on this issue is anticipated later this year.</p>

 The endemic nature of exotic diseases in many countries around the world results in a continuous but low risk of infected meat reaching the country through illegal routes.

The caimant is challenging DEFRA's decision not to re-test (using the tuberculin skin test) cattle within their herd that have had a positive reaction to the gamma interferon test. DEFRA has been put on notice that three other farm businesses are intending to issue proceedings on the same basis, but has agreed with those farmers that their animals will not be slaughtered pending the outcome of the judicial review. It is expected that this case will determine the issues in respect of all four complaints.</p>

It stresses the importance of working in partnership to provide early warning and rapid detection of disease threats facing the UK. In putting the strategy into practice, the aim is to ensure that surveillance activities are prioritised openly and that a clear, well-defined international evidence base exists for all surveillance reports and recommendations. A further aim is to make best use of the surveillance information that we collect.</p>

 DEFRA&#146;s Internal Audit Division have not conducted any audits specifically focusing on personal data or IT equipment during the period. As departmental policy does not require business areas to undertake audits, information on any they may have carried out could not be collected without incurring disproportionate costs, but a thorough &#145;wall-to-wall&#146; audit of IT equipment was carried out by IBM in October 2004 when ownership of DEFRA&#146;s IT equipment was transferred under the terms of the IT outsourcing contract.</p>

 The derogation from double tagging of sheep was lost because of a high rate of non-compliance with the derogated rules by livestock keepers. Had we not acted quickly to introduce double tagging, sheep keepers throughout the UK could have faced disallowance for failure to comply with the rules set out in EU legislation. The consultation period given was therefore the maximum that could reasonably have been permitted in the circumstances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_486"><a name="80221w0029.htm_para0"><a name="0802225004849">The following should be noted:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_487"><a name="80221w0029.htm_para1"><a name="0802225004850">(a) The aforementioned table shows by specific region the number, weight and volume of seizures of meat made from non-EU countries by Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs (HMRC) at British points of entry (and by staff funded by DEFRA until 11 April 2003), those made by the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development for Northern Ireland (DARDNI) at points of entry in Northern Ireland and those made by inland local/port health authorities where they were able to establish that the illegal products came from non-EU countries. HMRC have been responsible for anti-smuggling controls on products of animal origin (POAO) into Britain since 11 April 2003.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_488"><a name="80221w0029.htm_para2"><a name="0802225004851">On occasions more than one POAO product at a time will be seized (for example, meat, fish, dairy and honey). This is referred to as a &#145;multiple seizure&#146;. Up until 31 March 2006, this was only recorded as one seizure against the product of highest weight although the weight of the other products seized was included in the weight recorded for that product. However, the number of seizures by product for the period 1 April 2006 to 31 March 2007 reflect the number of times each product was seized including those from a &#145;multiple seizure&#146;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_489"><a name="80221w0029.htm_para3"><a name="0802225004852">(b) Seizures of illegal meat imported into the United Kingdom (UK) are recorded by region rather than specific country. This is because in some cases it can be difficult to determine the precise country of origin for a particular product and people can often travel to the UK via another country (for example to catch a direct connecting flight to the UK). What is clear is that illegal imports of meat (and other products of animal origin) enter the UK from all over the world.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_490"><a name="80221w0029.htm_para4"><a name="0802225004853">(c) Seizure figures are not recorded at the level of detail to determine the type of product (for example, chicken, pork etc.).</p>

2. Figures for 2005-06 and April to June 2006 differ slightly from those published. Arrowe Park Hospital&#146;s laboratory data was submitted with the quarter and the annual data the wrong way round.<br>
3. The latest data on cervical screening is available in the Information Centre&#146;s publication &#147;Cervical Screening Programme, England 2006-07&#148;.<br>
 4. Low grade includes the results; inadequate (cat 1), borderline (cat 8) and mild dyskaryosis (cat 3)<br>
High grade includes the results; moderate dyskaryosis (cat 7), severe dyskariosis (cat 4), severe dyskariosis/?invasive carcinoma (cat 5) and ?glandular neoplasia (cat 6)<br>
5. CIN (cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia) is an indicator of the depth of abnormal cells within the cervix<br>
CIN3 is where the full thickness of the surface layer is affected (also known as carcinoma in situ)<br>

<i> FAE</i><br>
A FAE is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one health care provider. Admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>
<i> Data quality</i><br>
HES are compiled from data sent by over 300 national health service trusts and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England. The Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br>
<i> Assessing growth through time</i><br>
HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. During the years that these records have been collected by the NHS, there have been ongoing improvements in quality and coverage. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example a number of procedures may now be undertaken in out-patient settings and may no longer be included in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.<br>
<i> Ungrossed Data</i><br>
Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).<br>
<i> All operations count of mentions</i><br>
These figures represent a count of all mentions of an operation in any of the 12 operation fields in the HES data set. Therefore, if an operation is mentioned in more than one operation field during an episode, all operations are counted.<br>

The fixed penalty notice is intended to be a quick and simple system in giving an offender the opportunity to resolve the matter without attending court. However, failing to pay the amount due within the specified time will result in the non-endorsable &#163;30 fine becoming &#163;45 and being registered as a fine at a local magistrates court. The tables do not include fixed penalty notices but do include cases where fixed penalty notices were originally issued but not paid and subsequently referred to court.</p>

<i> Notes:</i><br>
1. It is known that for some police force areas, the reporting of court proceedings in particular those relating to summary motoring offences, may be less than complete.<br>
2. Every effort is made to ensure that the figures presented are accurate and complete. However, it is important to note that these data have been extracted from large administrative data systems generated by the courts and police forces. As a consequence, care should be taken to ensure data collection processes and their inevitable limitations are taken into account when those data are used.<br>

1. It is known that for some police force areas, the reporting of court proceedings in particular those relating to summary motoring offences, may be less than complete.<br>
2. Every effort is made to ensure that the figures presented are accurate and complete. However, it is important to note that these data have been extracted from large administrative data systems generated by the courts and police forces. As a consequence, care should be taken to ensure data collection processes and their inevitable limitations are taken into account when those data are used.<br>

 Figures covering the whole of 2007 will not be available until after the end of the current financial year. However, 5,584 legally aided clinical negligence cases were closed in 2006-07. In 160 of these cases, the solicitors reported that the outcome was unknown, as the client had ceased to give instructions or was proceeding under other funding or as a litigant in person. Of the remaining cases, 300 resulted in an award of damages, and 1,708 in a settlement involving an agreement to pay damages or compensation.</p>

 The identification of prisoners with dyslexia and the provision of additional support is an important theme in the Learning and Skills Council's recent publication, "Developing the Offender Learning and Skills Service: The Prospectus". The LSC publication incorporates the findings of the Prison Reform Trust research on learning disabilities, "No-one Knows", published last year. Appropriate assessments and the provision of additional support is an important part of increasing prisoners' employability on release which in turn is a key factor in reducing re-offending.</p>

 Many African countries have made specific commitments on HIV prevention that are articulated in their National AIDS plans. For example, the new South African National Strategic Plan (2007-11) for HIV and AIDS identifies HIV prevention as one of its four priorities. The plan includes the following targets: 80 per cent. on anti-retroviral therapy (ART) by 2011; 50 per cent. reduction of new HIV infections by 2011; 70 per cent. of the adult population to be tested; and a target to reduce mother to child transmission to 5 per cent.</p>

Therefore very little evidence exists to suggest that non-resident parents are exploiting the current rules on pension contributions in a way which unreasonably reduces their child support liability. If such a case were to arise, the Child Support Agency is able to adjust liabilities in specified exceptional circumstances where the usual rules may not operate fairly. For example, in either child support scheme, it is possible to adjust the child support liability where the net income of the non-resident parent used in the calculation is inconsistent with their lifestyle. In such cases, this action will be considered by the agency following an application by the parent with care.</p>

Figures refer to the number of benefit accounts live and in payment on the specified date, and not the number of benefit claims, customers, or POCA accounts. People in receipt of more than one benefit/pension are counted for each separate benefit/pension in payment. People who have their benefit/pension combined and paid at the same time are only counted through the paying benefit. The figures shown for 2003 and 2004 reflect the fact that customers were gradually being migrated from order books during this period.<br>

2. Figures are rounded to the nearest 100.<br>
3. Figures are based on the live caseload as at March each year where any basic state pension is in payment.<br>
4. Geographical breakdowns by parliamentary constituency, local authority and Government office region are not available prior to September 1999<br>
5. Electronic data is only held from 1995 therefore basic state pension cases cannot be separately identified prior to this.<br>
