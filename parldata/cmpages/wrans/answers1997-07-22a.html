<P>
<a name="70722w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 Legislation is currently before Parliament to enable referendums to be held on the Government's proposals for devolution to Scotland and Wales.
<P>

<a name="70722w01.html_para1">We have also indicated that referendums will be held on the proposed strategic authority for London, on the voting system for elections to the House of Commons and in the regions on the questions of whether regional government should be established.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what procedural changes in respect of appeals concerning right of abode he plans following the European Court ruling in the Abbas Radiom case; and if he will make a statement. [10212]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70722w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The Special Immigration Appeals Commission Bill, which is currently before Parliament, would give a right of appeal to European Economic Area nationals in the small number of cases where the Secretary of State has decided that their exclusion, removal or departure from the United Kingdom would be conducive to the public good. There is currently no right of appeal in such cases.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70722w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Cohen: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, pursuant to his answer of 4 June, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>175</i>, how many of the project licences issued under the Animal (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 to experiment on non-purpose-bred dogs in 1995 covered procedures classified as being of <i>(a) </i>mild, <i>(b)</i> moderate and <i>(c)</i> substantial severity; at what kind of establishments these procedures were carried out; what was the nature of the research; and if these dogs were obtained directly from individual owners who had kept them as pets. [9005]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70722w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 The 66 non-purpose-bred dogs which were acquired from non-designated sources in the United Kingdom were used under four different project licences; three were of mild severity and one of moderate. In all cases, the work was carried out in veterinary schools.
<P>

<a name="70722w01.html_para4">A variety of breeds was used for studies relevant to the specific breed or type of dog involved. Two of the projects involved research into reproductive hormone levels in dogs. The third was a study of inherited diseases in dogs and the last was an animal welfare study to improve post-operative care of dogs undergoing clinical veterinary surgery.
<P>

<a name="70722w01.html_para5">The majority of procedures involved taking blood samples for subsequent analysis. The remainder involved administration of analgesia. In all cases, the owner's consent to use the dogs was obtained. The dogs were later certified as fit to be discharged from the controls of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 and were returned to their owners.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70722w01.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. McDonnell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will introduce measures to protect residents in the private housing sector from intimidation, harassment and nuisance from their neighbours. [9172]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70722w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 We intend to introduce community safety orders in the Crime and Disorder Bill. Under our proposals, courts will be given the power to grant such orders on the application of a local authority or the police. The order will apply to a named individual or individuals and would require that person or persons to desist from specified anti-social behaviour. A breach of the order will be a criminal offence which would carry stiff penalties--including the possibility of imprisonment. An order will be able to protect the residents of private houses from anti-social behaviour by their neighbours in the same way that it will protect other people.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how often since 1992 his Department has been responsible for employment advertisements which contained age restrictions upon those who could apply. [9502]

<P>
<a name="70722w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 Recruitment advertisements for assistant immigration officers include a minimum age limit of 18 and advertisements for Prison Officers include minimum and maximum age limits of 20 and 50 respectively. In addition, advertisements for psychological assistants in the Prison Service and for candidates for the prison officer accelerated promotion scheme included age restrictions until 1995.
<P>

<a name="70722w01.html_para6">Apart from these exceptions, it is not Home Office policy for employment advertisements to include age restrictions. It is possible that a small number of individual advertisements since 1992 may have contained age restrictions, but this could be checked only at disproportionate cost.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70722w01.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Cox: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many motorists were convicted of offences associated with road rage in the greater London area during the last 12 months. [9294]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70722w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 The information requested is not available. "Road Rage" is not an offence covered by separate statute and motorists involved in criminal behaviour are likely to be charged with an offence appropriate to the circumstances in each case. None of these can be separately identified, as the statistics do not include details of the circumstances.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many times employers have been investigated under section 8 of the Asylum and Immigration Act 1996; in how many cases employers have been prosecuted under this act; and what level of fines were imposed in these cases. [9490]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70722w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The approach of the Immigration Service towards section 8 of the 1996 Asylum and Immigration Act is that if, during the course of normal operational activity, an employer is found to have breached section 8 they will be advised of its provisions and issued with a warning letter. The warning letter informs them that if they continue to offend consideration will be given to prosecution. There is no central record of the number of warning letters issued and there have been no prosecutions under section 8 to date.

<P>
<a name="70722w02.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 I have not yet discussed the special constabulary with the Police Federation. I am aware that the working group on the special constabulary could not find a satisfactory answer to the question of representation and suggested that the Home Office meet the relevant bodies and representatives of the special constabulary to explore whether some form of formal representation for specials would be possible. This will be included in our work following the working group's report. I have an open mind on the issue and will seek the views of the Police Federation and other groups in due course.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will assess the advantages of providing special constables with a retainer as an incentive to remain on the force. [9846] <P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70722w02.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 A pilot scheme, whereby special constables could qualify for a bounty payment of &#163;200 on completion of 125 hours in a six-month period, was conducted in Dorset between 1991 and 1993. The results were inconclusive. While the number of hours performed by the specials increased slightly, the scheme had no effect on recruitment or retention. There is therefore no evidence to confirm that a retainer would have a marked effect on the wastage rate.
<P>

<a name="70722w02.html_para0">Nevertheless, we will be considering the question of a bounty payment following the report of the working group on the special constabulary. The working group was against such a payment, but the Audit Commission, in its "Streetwise" report of last year, was in favour of retainers. These views will be taken into account and the police staff and local authority associations consulted before decisions are made.
<P>

<a name="70722w02.html_para1">Police forces are tackling the wastage rate in other ways with the support of the working group's recommendations and over &#163;9 million of Government grant has been

provided during the past two years to improve the training, equipment, and terms and conditions of specials. This is already having an effect as the number of specials leaving the service in 1996-97 is down by 319 on the previous year.

 The technical options by which court results could be entered directly onto the police national computer are being investigated by the committee for the co-ordination of the criminal justice system, under the direction of the cross-departmental trials issues group. It is too early yet to arrive at any conclusions.

To ask the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire, representing the House of Commons Commission, how often since 1992 the Commission has been responsible for employment advertisements which contained age restrictions upon those who could apply. [9562]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70722w02.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Kirkwood: </B> 
 It is not the policy of the House of Commons to include age restrictions on eligibility in employment advertisements. The Establishments Office of the House, which is responsible for advising Departments on the content of employment advertisements, is not aware of any instance of age restrictions appearing in an advertisement since 1992.

 The Government's capital receipts Initiative will make additional resources available to local authorities to help meet housing need. In some London boroughs this might entail support for the building of new houses in partnership with registered social landlords. The Government are currently consulting on its proposals and we look forward to receiving local authorities comments.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what support his Department has given to the development and commercialisation of the technology described in FP50 over the last 10 years. [8984]<P>

<P>
<a name="70722w02.html_spnew9"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 Higher efficiency motors have been available for a number of years and my Department recommended their use. However, sales were very low because they were about 25 per cent. more expensive than an equivalent standard motor.
<P>

<a name="70722w02.html_para2">To overcome this cost barrier my Department supported, through the energy efficiency best practice programme, a club research project that lead to the development of a higher efficiency motor that did not carry a premium price. The project, managed by motor manufacturer Brook Hansen, cost &#163;12 million and the Government's contribution was &#163;4 million. More recently, further support has been provided to disseminate the results of the project via a range of publications and promotional events. We are also supporting the European Commission's work to promote the use of higher efficiency motors.
<P>

<a name="70722w02.html_para3">The new motors are currently saving industry around &#163;2 million per year in reduced electricity costs. It is estimated that these savings will eventually reach about &#163;120 million per year, when there is a much greater range of models available and other manufacturers catch up. In terms of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, savings of &#163;120 million wold equate to a reduction of some 3 million tonnes of carbon dioxide per year.

 Development proposals for on-site residential accommodation for wardens are considered within the framework of Government policy as set out in planning policy guidance notes. PPG7 on "The Countryside--Environmental Quality and Economic and Social Development" restricts the provision of new dwellings in the open countryside in order to protect rural landscapes and the character of the countryside. There is scope for local planning authorities to grant permission for isolated dwellings in the countryside in exceptional circumstances, for example where these are essential for agricultural or forestry workers. The Government have not been persuaded that exceptions should be made to existing policy other than in certain exceptional cases provided for in existing guidance PPG7.

 We have been looking at the implications of a recent High Court judgment for the evidence that is required to prove that vehicular rights of way have been established through regular use. We have concluded that vehicular rights cannot be claimed through 20 years' use, under section 31 of the Highways Act 1980, if access to the route in question was prohibited by the Road Traffic Acts during any of those 20 years. The fact that people have driven along a footpath or bridleway does not mean that it has ceased to be a footpath or bridleway. Vehicle users will not be able to claim new rights of way on the basis of past use unless the landowner has dedicated a way for their use.

 The Civil Aviation Authority has set minimum requirements relating to the spacing of passenger seats for aircraft on the UK register as it is one of a number of factors which can have an effect on the evacuation of an aircraft in an emergency. These standards were the results of a thorough assessment by the CAA. In addition to other tests, demonstration evacuations were carried out on two aircraft types before the standard was adopted.
<P>

<a name="70722w03.html_para2">Compliance with these standards on individual aircraft is initially checked by the CAA when it approves the aircraft's passenger cabin layout.

 A consideration in selecting design, build, finance and operate projects for competition is potential commercial viability.

If this refinement of remuneration arrangements is successful it could be applied elsewhere, and we would announce its introduction when we are able to apply it to a particular project.

 <i>[holding answer 21 July 1997]:</i> It is a long standing principle that certain of the UK's national vehicle regulations do not apply to vehicles registered abroad which are temporarily visiting this country. Similar arrangements apply when British vehicles travel to other EU countries. We do not require visiting foreign coaches to comply with our domestic regulations by fitting seat belts for children, and I do not believe it would be realistic to alter this. However, we expect that more foreign coaches will be fitted with seat belts in future as an amended seat belt directive starts to take effect that will allow member states to require the fitting of seat belts to all new coaches.

This requirement will extend to older coaches in February next year. While such vehicles will often continue to be used for the journey outside Britain, we do not have any jurisdiction over the domestic transport arrangements for children within other countries if they use a local vehicle.

</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>You asked for a list of the feasibility schemes which Northumberland County Council have put to the Highways Agency in respect of the route of the A1 in Northumberland.
</FONT></UL><P>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The County Council submitted a report on the feasibility of dualling sections of the A1 at the end of March 1997. The recommendations are being studied, but it would be inappropriate to list them at this stage because it could cause unnecessary Blight on long sections of the A1. A decision on the schemes may of course also be affected by the reviews announced recently by the Minister.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions has asked me to reply to your recent question concerning a possible review of the sight distance standards for non-signalised junction designs to take account of the perception-reaction characteristics of older drivers.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The standards issued by the Highways Agency for non-signalled cross-road junctions were reviewed and updated in 1995 and for roundabouts in 1993. UK standards are similar in this respect to most European standards. The sight distance standards in the documents take account of a range of perception-reaction characteristics which includes that of older drivers.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Perception-reaction characteristics comprise the time taken to see a sign, feature or hazard, decide what action is necessary, and take action: our standards assume two seconds perception-reaction time. Experience and judgement are important to perceiving and avoiding any potential hazard, though perception-reaction processes slow with advancing age, experience and judgement improve.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In 1995 the Highways Agency reviewed whether road design standards should be amended to allow for demographic changes. Our study concluded that at present sight distance standards are appropriate for drivers with the range of perception-reaction characteristics prevalent in the driving population.</FONT></UL>

<P>
<P>
<a name="70722w04.html_spnew9"><B> Ms Jackson: </B> 
 The Department has not made any formal assessment of the Devon county council's roadfit scheme, but is taking a close interest in this and similar schemes directed at older drivers.

<P>
<a name="70722w04.html_wqn10"><B> Mr. Chidgey: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what measures his Department takes to make drivers aware of declining sensory and cognitive abilities as they get older. [9300]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70722w04.html_spnew10"><B> Ms Jackson: </B> 
 The present driver licensing system recognises that aging may affect driving ability, although this varies from person to person. Drivers must renew their licences at 70 years of age, at which point they are required to make a declaration about their health. A licence is then issued for up to three years only, subject to a further health declaration at each renewal.
<P>

<a name="70722w04.html_para0">The Department's leaflet, "Advice to Older Drivers", provides advice on driving skills, legal requirements and guidance on when to consider giving up driving. I will arrange for copies to be deposited in the House Libraries.

 There are no current initiatives at European level to develop a common approach towards older drivers.
<P>

<a name="70722w04.html_para2">The report on the safety of older car drivers in the European Union recently published by the European Road Safety Federation is a useful contribution to the international understanding of this issue.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will investigate the use of directional arrows at traffic signals with the objective of simplifying decision making for older drivers. [9296]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70722w04.html_spnew12"><B> Ms Jackson: </B> 
 Work is being done to increase the conspicuity of traffic signals, including those with directional arrows, particularly in adverse viewing conditions. Some trials are under way to assess improvements that can be made to directional arrow signalling at more complicated junctions. Such improvements would help all drivers.
<P>
<P>
<a name="70722w04.html_wqn13"><B> Mr. Chidgey: </B>

[9298]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70722w04.html_spnew13"><B> Ms Jackson: </B> 
 Guidance on giving advice to older drivers, including advice on preparing to give up driving when this becomes necessary is included within the publication "Medical Aspects of Fitness to Drive", which is published by the medical commission on accident prevention and endorsed by the Secretary of State's honorary medical advisory panels on driving. This publication is distributed widely to medical practitioners, who may also consult doctors at the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency by means of a dedicated telephone line.

<P>

<a name="70722w05.html_para0">The speed of development has been largely determined by the increasingly stringent emissions standards which have been set in recent years. Emissions standards recently agreed at the EU Environment Council for passenger cars, for 2000 and 2005, together with proposals in the pipeline for other vehicles, will provide a further stimulus to technological development in this area. Meanwhile, the Government's decision to provide fiscal incentives for heavy vehicles meeting more stringent emissions standards should also stimulate development of new technologies.

 The Government see the advantages of a wider social partnership, bringing employers' and trade union representatives into local European structural funds partnerships. We will expect the social partners to make a real contribution to the programmes, as existing partners do. The precise way in which they participate will be for each monitoring committee to determine locally.

To ask the President of the Board of Trade if he will make a statement on the experience that the members of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission's committee investigating Scottish Residential Estate Agency Services have in respect of <i>(a)</i> Scots law and <i>(b)</i> the Scottish property market.

 The role of the members of an inquiry group investigating a reference made to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission is to bring to that investigation a mixture of expertise in legal, economic, industrial, financial and other relevant disciplines. It has not been their function to have detailed expertise and knowledge of a particular market under investigation. In carrying out the investigation, the MMC obtains information from a wide range of experts in relevant fields as required and often retains consultants to provide expert advice.

To ask the President of the Board of Trade if she will make a statement on the Government's policy on the regulation of the private health insurance sector. [8180]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70722w06.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Nigel Griffiths: </B> 
 The private health insurance sector is regulated through a combination of statutory legislation and industry best practice. Underwrites of health insurance are subject to prudential supervision under the Insurance Companies Act 1982; insurance intermediaries active in this field are subject to regulation under the Insurance Brokers (Registration) Act 1977 or industry-regulation under the Association of British Insurers general business code of practice. The Government continue to keep this under review.

To ask the President of the Board of Trade in what way she plans to implement the product safety directive concerning the mixing of unwrapped non-food articles with food products; what is the purpose of this legislation; what representations she has received from the food industry on this issue; what food products will be exempted; and if she will make a statement.

<P>
<a name="70722w06.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Nigel Griffiths: </B> 
 The general product Ssfety directive lays down general rules for assessing the safety of consumer products. There is concern that if unwrapped non-food items are sold mixed in with food products there would be a possibility that consumers could accidentally ingest them with consequent risk of injury. It has been agreed that European member states will ascertain whether such products are on sale within their national territories and inform the European Commission accordingly. My Department is investigating the position in the UK. I have received no representations from the food industry on this subject.

 We have always advocated closer EU-Australia relations. This Department together with other Whitehall Departments has worked hard to ensure a good EU-Australia joint declaration. We therefore warmly welcome the signature of the joint declaration as a foundation for strengthened EU-Australia co-operation into the next century. The joint declaration is unlikely to have any direct effect on our Commonwealth links with Australia, but as the prime proponent of the declaration the UK has reinforced its role as Australia's partner of choice in the EU, building on an already excellent bilateral relationship.

 The text placed in the Libraries of the House is a provisional version of the draft treaty of Amsterdam.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what is his Department's assessment of the advantages of <i>(a)</i> including the number of pupils on the roll in September of year 11 in the performance tables for GCSE results and <i>(b)</i> including only those pupils who take GCSE exams. [9011]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70722w11.html_spnew9"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 The 1997 secondary school performance tables will be based on the achievements of all pupils of the relevant age on roll at the time of the schools census in January. The tables will not therefore be influenced by different school policies on the entry of pupils for GCSE examinations, but will allow comparisons to be made on the basis of the achievements of all pupils by the end of compulsory schooling. Schools are, however, already able to provide for publication the GCSE achievements of all pupils in year 11, regardless of age, and value added measures will soon help give a fuller picture of school performance.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70722w12.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Ron Davies </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 21 July 1997]:</i> The Welsh Assembly would be the credible voice of the Welsh people. The White Paper, "A Voice for Wales", makes it clear that the Government expect the Welsh Assembly to work in partnership with the Westminster Parliament and the Government of the day. Any attempt to override the clearly expressed views of the Assembly would put that partnership in jeopardy.
<P>

<a name="70722w12.html_para6">Implementation of the poll tax depended upon the exercise by the Secretary of State of a multiplicity of order--and regulation-making powers. If a Government wished to impose on Wales legislation which the Assembly opposed and which related to matters such as education or health that would normally be dealt with by the Assembly, it would either have to put all the detail in the new primary legislation or have to give all the powers in that legislation to the Secretary of State.

The radioactive substances used at DNBCC are: tritium(H-3), cobalt-60, caesium-137, radium-226, chlorine-36, strontium-90 and nickel-63. <i></i>

 <i>[holding answer 16 July 1997]:</i> Research is currently under way to try to determine the effects of low-level exposure to organophosphate pesticides on human health in the context of ill health claimed by some farm workers. This work is sponsored jointly by the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the Department of Health and the Health and Safety Executive and is due to report in 1999. This will be an important step towards understanding the possible effects of potential exposures to organophosphorous-based products of British troops during the Gulf war. However, pending the outcome of this and other work, there is no firm evidence to support a link between low level exposure to OPs and adverse health effects.

The college will provide young people aged between 16 and 17 destined for the Royal Armoured Corps, the Royal Artillery and the infantry, with vocational, adventurous leadership and basic military training and will also give them a good grounding in six NCVQ key skills. On graduation from the college, they will go on to trade training before joining the Field Army. The intention is that the college will be funded through the private finance initiative. Until this process is complete, we cannot therefore be certain of the college's location, although the successful contractor will be offered the site of the former Apprentices' college in Harrogate.

 <i>[holding answer Monday 21 July 1997]:</i> Information about diagnosed HIV infections in Scotland is held in the transmission categories and age groups shown in table 1. Individuals often do not seek testing unless they believe themselves to be at risk or develop symptoms and hence reported HIV infections underestimate the true number of cases. In addition, these figures may be subject to under-reporting.
<P>

<a name="70722w16.html_para1">The figures are given on an all-Scotland basis because presenting data by health boards may threaten confidentiality in low prevalence areas. Table 2 shows the year on year change in each group in percentage terms.
<P>

<a name="70722w16.html_para2">The Government's targeting of HIV-AIDS prevention materials is in line with the UK health Departments' Strategy, "HIV and AIDS Health Promotion: An Evolving Strategy", November 1995. This emphasised the need for better targeting of vulnerable groups such as gay men, as well as the need to inform the general population about the continuing potential risks from HIV.
<P>

<a name="70722w16.html_para3">In Scotland, recent data indicate that new infections among gay men remain the highest of all transmission categories. In line with the strategy, The Scottish Office Department of Health is funding a project involving prevention work for gay men in Scotland. In addition to work aimed at the general population, The Health Education Authority carry out a limited amount of prevention work UK-wide targeted at gay and bisexual men. HIV-AIDS is one of the priority areas for the Health Education Board for Scotland; and its work at national level is complemented by the local activities of health boards.

To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland what steps his Department is taking to encourage the use of timber from sustainably managed forests. [9536]<P>

<P>
<a name="70722w17.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Chisholm </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 21 July 1997]:</i> My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister announced at the recent UN General Assembly special session that the Government are preparing a new forest standard to provide a benchmark for the management of our forests. The Forestry Commission will monitor achievement against that standard. This initiative will help assure consumers that timber grown in Britain comes from sustainably managed forests. In addition, we are working to promote sustainable forestry abroad through our development assistance programme.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland on what dates the central community relations unit received the outline design for the Killyleagh community hall from Down district council; on what dates the CCRU decided to appoint independent consultants to prepare an economic appraisal of the project; when the consultants were advised of their appointments by the CCRU; and when the CCRU received the economic appraisals from the consultants.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70722w17.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Worthington: </B> 
 The central community relations unit received the outline design for Killyleagh community hall on 21 February 1996; CCRU decided to appoint independent consultants to assess the proposal as a stand-alone project on 16 December 1996; the consultants were given written confirmation of their appointment on 21 March 1997; and the economic appraisal was received on 17 June 1997.
<P>

<a name="70722w17.html_para0">This application was unusual as a separate application for a capital project with a cross community dimension in the same area was also received in 1996. It was important to consider the relationship between both projects and to avoid duplication. Consequent on the economic appraisal, CCRU will recommend grant aid for the community hall and has informed Down district council accordingly.

<P>

<a name="70722w17.html_para1">These figures show a significant rise in the numbers of absent votes in Northern Ireland over the last two general elections. Due to boundary changes which increased the number of Northern Ireland constituencies by one in 1995, there is no strict comparison between the two elections.
<P>

<a name="70722w17.html_para2">However, in just under a third of Northern Ireland parliamentary constituencies the number of absent votes issued was greater in 1992 than at the 1997 general election. In those constituencies which did see an increase in the absent votes issued, in a quarter of these cases the percentage increase was less than 5 per cent. It is the case that in just under half of the 17 constituencies there has been an increase of more than 30 per cent. in the numbers of absent votes issued.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70722w17.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 It has been stated in a European Commission report, and is widely acknowledged, that transporters commonly flout the rules on welfare in transit when transporting livestock over long distances on the continent. The Department has undertaken no research on this, but has arrangements in place with certain other member states to undertake spot checks on compliance with route plans declared in advance when animals are sent from Great Britain. These arrangements will continue, in support of the activities of local authorities in pursuit of their statutory responsibility to enforce the tougher controls we have now introduced in the Welfare of Animals (Transport) Order 1997.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70722w17.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 There is no requirement in the Welfare of Animals (Transport) Order 1997 for exports of animals to be licensed. However, the order does require that, from 1 October 1997, anyone transporting cattle, sheep, pigs, goats or horses on a journey over eight hours must have a specific authorisation to engage in this activity. The process of receiving and processing applications for these authorisations is at an early stage: we have received 67 applications to date.

 Selective breeding for rapid growth of broiler chickens is not, of itself, a cause for concern. It is, however, important to consider the implications for the welfare of the birds.

I look forward to receiving the council's recommendations as to the direction of any future controls.

 Responsibility for the welfare of the exported sheep now rests with the Italian authorities We have pressed them to fulfil this responsibility, and understand that the Italian authorities are regularly checking the animals and the conditions in which they are being kept. We have made it clear to the Italian authorities that the certification that they are demanding has no basis in Community law and that we cannot provide it. We have also drawn the position to the attention of the European Commission. As we have stressed to the Italian authorities, it is vital, in the absence of an immediate solution to this problem, that what is to happen to the sheep is quickly resolved.

Action was to be taken against France, Germany, Portugal, Sweden, Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Spain, Finland and Italy.

<a name="70722w18.html_para4">These measures were to be taken as a result of the report of Commission inspections which were shown by the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee at its meeting on 23 May. On the basis of this, SEAC issued advice to Government which was published on 5 June and which resulted in the reply the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food gave to the House on that day, <i>Official Report</i>, columns <i>227-28</i>.

 Under the UK's restrictive licensing arrangements for fishing vessels, no new licences are issued. Licences may be transferred from one UK registered fishing vessel to another at the discretion of Ministers. We have no information readily available about the number of such transfers which may take place in the future. However, we estimate that currently there are some 160 UK-registered and licensed fishing vessels which have significant foreign interests in their ownership.

 Health and identification marks have been partly or wholly removed from beef which has been seized in another country on suspicion that it has been illegally exported from the UK. Without those marks, it is not possible to confirm either that it met hygiene standards at the time of slaughter or its origin. Standards for the production of beef in the UK are, nevertheless, as high as anywhere in Europe. There are stringent safeguards to ensure that carcases from BSE suspects cannot enter the human food chain and UK controls to prevent specified bovine material from entering the human food chain are the toughest in Europe.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70722w20.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 Substantial inequalities in health and life expectancy exist between different regions in England. For example, in the early 1990s, there were regional variations in life expectancy at birth of more than three years for males and two and a half years for females. In 1992 East Anglia had the longest life expectation at 75.4 years for men and 80.3 years for women, while North Western had the worst at 72.3 years for men and 



<P>
<P><I>22 Jul 1997 : Column: 556</I><P>
77.6 years for women. Regional variations in certain measures of health are even greater. On the basis of the 1991 census question on limiting long standing illness, it has been estimated that the expected number of years of life in good health varies between the best and the worst region by six and a half years for men and five years for women.

<P>
<a name="70722w20.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 Information on health in certain ethnic groups is available from various surveys and the 1991 census included specific questions on health and ethnicity. A collation of key information, "Ethnicity and Health: a guide for the NHS" was published in 1993 by the Department of Health and a new edition is in preparation.
<P>

<a name="70722w20.html_para0">The fourth national survey of ethnic minorities, which was co-ordinated by the Policy Studies Institute, was the largest study of ethnic minorities ever carried out in Britain. An initial report which included a chapter on health was published earlier this year. More detailed reports on the physical and mental health of ethnic minorities are due out shortly.
<P>

<a name="70722w20.html_para1">Although there are currently no data readily available on life expectancy in different ethnic groups the Acheson inquiry will be looking at inequalities in health, including those related to ethnicity, since this is a topic of considerable importance. Furthermore, detailed studies of mortality by country of birth have been performed which indicate marked differences from the national average in specific sub groups. For example, there are high rates of stroke mortality in people under 65 years among those born on the Indian subcontinent and in the Caribbean and African Commonwealth.

Our new health strategy will be wider and focus on determinants in health. Want will be tackled through the minimum wage. Idleness through the Welfare to work programme. Squalor through improved housing through the phased release of council house sale receipts; and through policies to improve the environment. Ignorance through education, by encouraging schools to promote health and well-being. Disease through rescuing the NHS banning tobacco advertising, establishing the food standards agency and a &#163;1,000,000 programme of research into the effects of air pollutants commonly found in the home.

<P>
<a name="70722w20.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 As announced in my speech on 7 July, improving the health of our nation and tackling the legacy of inequality are matters not just for the Department of Health but are jobs to be confronted across Government. We aim to tackle poverty and inequality through our commitment to helping people move from welfare to work, to ending poverty pay by introducing a national minimum wage, and to improve housing conditions by the phased release of local authority capital receipts.
<P>

<a name="70722w20.html_para2">Of all the important aspects of public health, none exacts a heavier toll in terms of disease and death than smoking. And smoking is a clear proxy for inequalities. There are more poor smokers, and as a result, poor people suffer disproportionately from preventable illness and premature death. That is why the Government have given an undertaking to ban tobacco advertising and promotion, and why we are determined to tackle smoking with the seriousness it deserves. On 14 July, we held an international anti-smoking summit to galvanise concerted action across society, and to learn from the experience of experts from around the world on how best to proceed. We will use the knowledge gained at the summit to inform the development of a White Paper which will be published later this year. The White Paper will set out in full our plans for measures to curb smoking, including our proposals for legislation to ban tobacco advertising.

 Information about numbers of patients waiting for admission to national health service trusts in England is published quarterly in "Hospital Waiting List Statistics: England", copies of which are available in the Library. The latest information available gives the position on 31 March 1997. This shows that the numbers of patients waiting for admission on either an in-patient or day case basis to the two major trusts in Stretford and Urmston have increased by 20 per cent. since 31 March 1996. In Greater Manchester the numbers waiting have increased at nine of the 12 major trusts serving the area, by 10 per cent. overall. The latter is in line with the increase nationally over the period.

 We are under no illusions about the legacy we inherited. We know that the national health service is under considerable pressure this year.

We are also actively taking steps to ensure full co-operation between local social services and the health service to help cope with winter pressures.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70722w21.html_spnew10"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 It is not possible to identify expenditure on measles, mumps and rubella immunisation separately within the childhood immunisation programme.
<P>

<a name="70722w21.html_para3">Immunisation expenditure is made up of three components: the cost of buying the vaccines; the cost of giving the vaccines; and the cost of the accompanying information materials. Only vaccine purchase expenditure can be identified for each vaccine, and is shown in the table.
<P>

<a name="70722w21.html_para4">Expenditure on giving measles, mumps and rubella immunisations cannot be separately identified since general practitioners receive a target payment for immunisation based on the percentage of children on their list who are immunised against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio, haemophilus influenzae type B, and measles, mumps and rubella. Similarly information expenditure, through the Health Education Authority and the Department of Health's own immunisation materials for parents, covers the whole immunisation programme: as such it is not possible to identify expenditure which might be attributable to measles, mumps and rubella immunisation.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70722w22.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 Wiltshire social services department has informed the Department of Health that it will first assess the needs of the person. If it decides that the person requires to be placed in a residential home, it encourages the person to consider at least three homes, two of which it would expect to be within the independent sector.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70722w22.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The Department does not specifically collect this information. However, registration authorities should return to the Department details of those home owners whose registration they refuse or cancel. This is compiled on the national list of refused and cancelled registrations which is then circulated to all local authorities in England. For Wiltshire in this period we have been notified of only one cancellation. In addition, for this period, the registration of one further home owner in Wiltshire was cancelled following appeal to the registered homes tribunal.

<P>
<P>

The following breakdown of the statistics has been obtained specially from the authority but the figures are of total expenditure rather than the usual gross expenditure and so take no account of any income received by the authority from other local authorities in respect of residential provision in Wiltshire of clients normally resident outside the county boundary.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what cost is incurred by the NHS through the failure of patients to turn up for scheduled operations; how this figure is calculated; and if he will make a statement. [8740]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70722w23.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Milburn: </B> 
 Information is not available on the costs incurred by the national health service for patients who miss their operations. Hospitals may be able to redirect resources, for example for the treatment of emergency cases that need to be fitted in during the day. In 1996-97 223,000 patients failed to turn-up for in-patient treatment. The average cost for a finished consultant episode in 1995-96--the latest figure available--was &#163;1,103.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70722w23.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Milburn: </B> 
 Guidance has been prepared by the Royal College of Psychiatrists and endorsed by the standing medical advisory committee. We are currently considering whether to issue management guidance to the NHS, together with the clinical guidance on the prescribing of Aricept. Many health authorities and hospitals are still in the process of determining their local policy on the use of this drug.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health (1) what was the NHS expenditure on the treatment of asthma in the latest year for which figures are available; and what proportion of the total NHS budget this represents; [8863]
<P>
<UL>(2) what was the cost to the NHS of providing acute care to adults suffering from occupational asthma attacks in the last five financial years; [8859]

<P>
<P>
<a name="70722w23.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The bulk of the costs of asthma to the national health service is attributable to prescriptions. Information on the cost of other NHS services is for individual conditions and is only available locally. However, the Department of Health's "Burdens of Disease<i></i>" analysis estimated that the cost of services for asthma was &#163;150 million in 1993. On this basis, asthma 



<P>
<P><I>22 Jul 1997 : Column: 567</I><P>
accounted for under 2 per cent. of NHS net expenditure--including drugs--in 1992-93. The net ingredient cost of national health service prescriptions for asthma medication in 1996 was &#163;438 million, which is 11 per cent. of the total net ingredient cost of prescriptions in that year. It is not possible to separate out the costs to the NHS of occupational asthma.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70722w23.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Milburn: </B> 
 Waste strategy in hospitals should reflect the policies of "Making Waste Work--a strategy for sustainable waste management in England and Wales" published by the Department of the Environment in December 1995. However, in view of the inherent nature of health care provision, the reuse and recycling elements of the waste hierarchy have to be considered particularly carefully to avoid any risk of cross-infection. National Health Service Estates, an executive agency of the Department of Health, is preparing health technical memorandum 2065 "Waste Guidance", due for publication in September, dealing with the minimisation and segregation of clinical waste.

 The report of the efficiency scrutiny into prescription fraud, published last month, estimated levels of prescription fraud in England and Wales as &#163;85 million-&#163;115 million per year. Based on the six-monthly exemption checking exercise carried out by family health services authorities, it is estimated that in 1995-96 the loss of revenue from patient charge evasion was about &#163;0.4 million in Staffordshire family health services authority and about &#163;5 million in West Midlands regional health authority. The total loss of revenue from patient charge evasion for that year, calculated on a different basis to that used by the efficiency scrutiny, was an estimated &#163;34.5 million. It is not possible to estimate the loss in Tamworth alone.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70722w24.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 The Government are aware of the valuable work of hospices and specialist palliative care units in this country. The development of palliative care has done much to change our attitude to death and the process of dying, demonstrating the positive aspects of good management of the patient up to the point of death. With appropriate palliative care, pain and other distressing symptoms can be greatly reduced and people helped to cope. We are committed to expanding palliative care for the dying in all settings. It is our policy that specialist palliative care should be available to all those in need of it, wherever they may live, as is recognised in the report "A Policy Framework for commissioning cancer services"--the "Calman/Hine" report--and the associated guidance in Executive Letter EL(96)85 "A Policy Framework for Commissioning Cancer Services: Palliative Care Services". Copies of both these documents are available in the Library. We look to all health authorities to ensure that they have a strategy in place to achieve this and we are encouraging increasing provision throughout the national health service.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70722w24.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 There have been a number of departmental initiatives to review the foster care service. The Social Services Inspectorate recently carried out a national inspection to review foster care services. This included interviewing children in foster care and their carers. Their report, "Inspection of Local Authority Fostering 1995-96, National Summary Report", was published in December 1996. In addition, the Department has funded three other research reports. They were: a study undertaken by the National Foster Care Association into "The Organisation of Fostering Services," published in March 1997; "Foster Care, A Research Review", published in March 1997; and "Private Fostering: Development of Policy and Practice", published in March 1997 by the Save the Children Fund. Copies of all these reports were placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="70722w24.html_para1">The review of safeguards for children living away from home, currently being conducted by Sir William Utting, has also looked at children in foster care. Consultation with young people formed part of the review process.
<P>

<a name="70722w24.html_para2">In 1995, the Department launched the "Looking After Children: Good Parenting, Good Outcomes" materials. They provide the opportunity to engage children, wherever they are placed, in their own care plans and encourage communications between all those involved in the care of the child. In the light of this, we do not consider a further review is necessary.

 The figures requested are not routinely collected. 
<P>

<a name="70722w24.html_para3">The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990 regulates, among other things, the storage of embryos. The Act requires embryos to be removed from storage and allowed to perish if the consent of the patients whose eggs and sperm created the embryos is withdrawn, or if the period of storage permitted under the Act comes to an end. For embryos stored on or before 1 August 1991, when the Act came into force, the maximum period for storage was five years, that is, until 31 July 1996.




<P>
<P><I>22 Jul 1997 : Column: 573</I><P>

<P>

<a name="70722w24.html_para4">Regulations came into effect on 1 May 1996 which extended the maximum storage period for embryos from five to 10 years, or longer in particular circumstances, if certain conditions were met. Effective consent under the Act for the extended storage period must be obtained in all cases.
<P>

<a name="70722w24.html_para5">Embryos stored on or before 31 July 1991 for which the required consent for extended storage was not given had, under the terms of the 1990 Act, to be allowed to perish on 1 August 1996. Information provided by licensed clinics to the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority shows that 4,402 embryos were removed from storage on or about that date.

proposed for family credit will come into effect; and if <i>(a)</i> new and <i>(b)</i> existing claimants, will have access to the higher level of disregard from that date. [9560]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70722w26.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Keith Bradley: </B> 
 This measure forms part of the Government's commitment to develop a national child care strategy. Within that strategy, the Government will plan provision to match requirements of the modern labour market and provide the help needed by parents to balance the demands of family and working life.
<P>

<a name="70722w26.html_para0">The proposed improvements to the child care disregard will be brought in at the earliest opportunity, in the summer of 1998. Following the date of introduction, all new awards, for both new and existing claimants, will take account of the new level of disregard. Family credit is awarded at a fixed rate for 26 weeks and existing recipients will be eligible from the first renewal claim following the date of introduction.

 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="70722w26.html_para1">I refer the hon. Gentleman to my answer of 24 June, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>454</i>, in which I repeated the Government's challenge to the 24 firms which are together responsible for nearly three-quarters of the cases requiring review, that they should better the targets set by the Securities and Investments Board and the Personal Investment Authority. It is the Government's view that all firms should endeavour to meet, if not better, the targets set by their regulators. The costs of conducting the review are a matter for the firms.
