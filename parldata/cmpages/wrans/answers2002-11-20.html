To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what basic training is given to <i>(a)</i> soldiers, <i>(b)</i> sailors and <i>(c)</i> airmen in firefighting in the normal course of their training.  [82012]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21120w01.html_spnew4"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The degree of firefighting training given to Service personnel depends upon the role that they are expected to perform during normal military duties. All service personnel are given basic fire awareness training including use of fire extinguishers, raising the alarm, means of escape and general fire precautions. Inaddition, more comprehensive training is given to those personnel who work in an environment where there may be a requirement to deal with fire.
<P>

<a name="21120w01.html_para1">Navy personnel, as part of the Basic Sea Survival Course, are trained in the procedural teamwork of shipboard firefighting. On board ship, theoretical training is given on Naval Battle Control of Damage together with Intermediate Sea Survival techniques.

 The Corporate Headquarters Office Technology System (CHOTS), first introduced in the Ministry of Defence in the early 1990s and rolled out progressively since, is MOD's workhorse computing platform for office automation within the Head Office of the Department, and is installed in or linked to major Commands and HQ locations, at 23 main sites and 128 minor sites both in the United Kingdom and overseas. It comprises some 13,000 workstations and supports over 25,000 user accounts, and is used predominantly for the preparation of documents, spreadsheets and presentation material, for e-mail preparation, transmission and reception, and for internal web site hosting and browsing. The system enjoys a high level of usage by MOD staff, running at typically 80per cent. of capacity. Typical average e-mail traffic within the system is presently in the region of 2.25 million per month.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21120w02.html_spnew4"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The Retired Officer Scheme has served us well for more than four decades, but a continuing manning deficit coupled with the emergence of increasingly stringent employment legislation has caused us to examine alternative means of capitalising on the valuable experience of those retiring from the Armed Forces. In addition to this source of expertise we would also like to attract people with suitable experience from industry, the Civil Service, and from the wider Defenceenvironment. After full consultation it has been decided that there will be no further recruitment into the Retired Officer Scheme. Instead, people will be recruited both internally and externally into Military Support posts within the mainstream Civil Service. Some former RO posts that may require a uniquely military background, or a specific military qualification, will become the responsibility of the respective Service Secretaries. Serving Retired Officers will be invited to assimilate into the new arrangements, although they will be free to remain as established Retired Officers should they wish to do so.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21120w03.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The costs of establishing elected regional assemblies will vary from region to region, mainly due to the different sizes of their electorates, but we expect them all to fall into a range of around #15million to #30 million a region, including the costs of a referendum and of the first assembly elections. The North West is likely to fall towards the upper end of this range.

The command and operational structure for emergency fire cover has been designed to enable maximum flexibility and use of available resources, whether from within a county or from assets deployed nearby in neighbouring counties. The deployment of 



firefighters will be based on the assessment of how best to respond to an emergency in the quickest time possible. The deployment will be kept under review.<P>

 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="21120w04.html_para0">New forests reduce the atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases, because the trees remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and, despite an initial loss of soil carbon due to disturbance during planting, the input of organic matter from trees via litter on the forest floor increases the amount of carbon in the soil over time. We estimate that new forests planted in the UK since 1990 will remove about 0.6 million tonnes of carbon per year (MtC/yr) during the first commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol, contributing about 0.3 per cent. towards our 12.5 per cent. emissions reduction commitment. Taking into account the possible contribution from the Clean Development Mechanism as well as new forests planted in other developed countries, new forests could contribute the equivalent of a reduction of about 1.5 per cent. of base year emissions towards the commitments averaged over all countries which ratify the Kyoto Protocol. However the actual outcome will depend on how the countries choose to meet their commitments, on actual rates of planting, and on detailed application of the rules for sinks accounting agreed in Marakkesh.

 We will announce the new system for distributing Formula Grant, including detailed grant allocations for individual authorities, at the time of the provisional local government finance settlement which we expect to be around the start of December. Once the Government has allocated its grant, decisions about budgets and services are primarily for local councils to make. However, we have already guaranteed that no authority will face a cut in grant next year on a like for like basis, and we hope to do better than that when we announce the actual floors and ceilings scheme as part of the provisional settlement.

 It is an offence to facilitate the entry of an illegal entrant; or to harbour one and to employ one who does not have permission to work. The Police Service for Northern Ireland (PSNI) is primarily responsible for dealing with such offences. There has been one conviction for facilitation in the past 18 months. United Kingdom Immigration Service works closely with PSNI and also with the Irish immigration authorities to gather evidence, and where appropriate, prosecutions will be brought.
<P>

<a name="21120w05.html_para3">I am aware of a recent BBC documentary highlighting cases of illegal workers in Northern Ireland and of the method by which they are brought to the province. The issues raised in that programme are not unique to Northern Ireland. Where reliable information exists indicating immigration offenders are at a particular address, United Kingdom Immigration Service staff in Northern Ireland take action against illegal workers there, as they do elsewhere in the United Kingdom. 



<P>
<P><I>20 Nov 2002 : Column 129W</I><P>
During the past 12 months 68 illegal workers have been removed from Northern Ireland. Further enforcement visits to identify other illegal workers are planned.

<a name="21120w06.html_para0">Forming an accurate estimate of the levels of trafficking in people is problematic due to the hidden nature of the act.

A Home Office research study 'Stopping Traffic' published in 2000, indicated that the number of women and children trafficked into the United Kingdom for the purposes of sexual exploitation, was likely to be in the range of 140 to 1,400 per year.

 The Immigration Service is committed to maintaining secure borders throughout the United Kingdom and countering evasion of the immigration control. A close watch is kept on the situation in East Sussex to assess regularly the risk of persons entering the United Kingdom illegally and to ensure that any necessary action is taken. Ports in East Sussex are not currently considered to be at high risk from illegal immigration. The Immigration Service deal with illegal entrants and, in consultation with the Police and other control Authorities, will assist in the identification and prosecution of those who facilitate illegal entrants.

 As I announced in the House of Commons on 5 November 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, column 150W we remain committed to developing large, self-contained, out of town facilities in order to thoroughly test the on-site provision of services at accommodation centres. However, in order to test an alternative model, one of the trial centres will be smaller than 750 places and for single men only and may be located in or on the edge of an urban area. We have also made clear that our minds are not closed to other models and, in particular that we will continue to work with the Refugee Council on their Xcore and cluster" proposal. This would involve a series of hostels clustered around

a central services core. No decisions have yet been made on the Refugee Council proposals. We will undertake a thorough evaluation of the accommodation centre trial. It will include a combination of management information, consultation with relevant people and more formal research carried out by independent researchers under contract to the Home Office. The evaluation conclusions will be publicly available, and provided to Parliament.

 Providing opportunities for the welfare and development of children and young people is a priority for Government. We have introduced a range of programmes which include legislation to support children and young people. These are delivered by a number of Ministers across Government. For example, Sure Start and the children's fund in the Department for Education and Skills, children's trusts in the Department for Health, and a range of Home Office initiatives to prevent offending, which include support to parents and families. The Treasury and Department for Work and Pensions also have significant responsibilities affecting children and young people including child support and the children's tax credit.

<P>
<a name="21120w09.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 None. Guidance for the 2003&#150;04 Basic Need round, to support the provision of new pupil places, was issued at the end of July. It invited local education authorities to make bids by 30 September. Neither the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead nor Wokingham district made applications. The Department will be announcing Basic Need allocations to LEAs in December.

[81758]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21120w09.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 It is for local education authorities to plan and keep under review the supply of school places in the light of proposed housing development, so as to ensure that there is sufficient provision to meet demand. The regional planning guidance for the South East assists local education authorities in the region to do this. Where an LEA can demonstrate overall growth in the need for school places it may apply to my Department for capital funding.

<a name="21120w10.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 Physical Education (PE) is compulsory within the National Curriculum in England at all Key Stages for all pupils. Schools must provide physical education (PE) in accordance with the subject's programme of study. Guidance on curriculum planning, including for PE, published by the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority and the Department for Education and Skills, recommends that the programmes of study require a minimum of 75 minutes per week at Key Stages 1 and 2, and 90 minutes per week at Key Stage 3.
<P>

<a name="21120w10.html_para0">The Government are committed to all children in England having at least two hours of high quality PE and school sport a week, within and outside of the curriculum. A joint Department for Education and Skills and Department for Culture, Media and Sport Public Service Agreement target&#151;published 15 July&#151;seeks to enhance the take-up of sporting opportunities by 5 to 16-year-olds by increasing the percentage of schoolchildren who spend a minimum of two hours each week on PE and school sport within and beyond the curriculum from 25 per cent. in 2002 to 75 per cent. by 2006. #459 million will be invested over the next three years to deliver this target. Spearheading action will be a significant expansion of the specialist sports college and school sport co-ordinator programmes.
<P>

<a name="21120w10.html_para1">Evidence from the Youth Sport Trust, Sport England and the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority indicates that a quarter of schools in England&#151;those within school sport co-ordinator partnerships&#151;are offering children aged 5 to 16 access to at least two hours' PE and school sport. All these partnerships will complete an annual data collection exercise this month. This will provide robust, comprehensive and in-depth information on the number of pupils with access to two hours' PE and school sport. Early messages from this will be available before the end of the year. The House will be informed of the results.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what training provision is planned for teachers regarding sexual relationship education; and if he will make a statement.  [80545]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21120w10.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 In April 2003, we will roll out a professional development programme for teachers of Personal, Social and Health Education (PSHE). The programme will recognise effective teaching of the generic skills of PSHE, with Sex and Relationship Education (SRE) being addressed as a specialist module based on knowledge and understanding. The development of the programme supports our view that effective SRE is essential if young people are to make responsible and well-informed decisions about their lives. We expect up to 500 teachers to participate in the first year of the programme.
<P>

<a name="21120w10.html_para2">From September 2002, those awarded qualified teacher status must demonstrate that they are familiar with the national curriculum framework for PSHE, including sex and relationship education, for the age range they are trained to teach. The new standards for initial teacher training also open up opportunities for trainees to have PSHE as a specialism.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what progress is being made to increase access to higher bandwidth broadband in rural areas.  [81361]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21120w10.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Timms </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 19 November 2002]:</i> Satellite services make broadband available across the country. Added to this some 67 per cent. of the 



<P>
<P><I>20 Nov 2002 : Column 150W</I><P>
households in the UK now have access to a mass-market terrestrial broadband service. This is ahead of countries such as France and Italy.
<P>

<a name="21120w10.html_para9">The market continues to make progress in extending the availability of affordable broadband through such initiatives as the demand registration schemes run by BT and by Liberty Broadband. We believe that the market-led progress will continue as new technologies including additional wireless services become available and satellite services become more affordable.
<P>

<a name="21120w10.html_para10">We believe, however, that in some areas Government may have a role to play. Some schemes including European structural funds have already made an impact on the availability of broadband (e.g. the ACTNOW project in Cornwall).
<P>

<a name="21120w10.html_para11">The Government has also committed #30 million for pilot projects to help regional development agencies and devolved administrations learn what will work in extending availability and take-up. These funds are starting to make an impact in rural communities such as Buckfastleigh in Devon and Alston in Cumbria.
<P>

<a name="21120w10.html_para12">There is scope for further impact to be made in increasing private sector investment and the availability of broadband by the use of public sector demand. My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister announced yesterday that the outcome of the Spending Review 2002 shows that a total of approximately #6 billion will be invested in electronic government&#151;including #1 billion towards high-speed broadband connectivity. Existing funds for regional economic development (and RDAs will have #1.8 billion in 2003&#150;04 for this purpose) can also make a contribution where lack of broadband is a barrier to economic development. That is why I announced in June the intention to establish a regional broadband unit to use the public sector's spending power to boost availability and take-up in rural areas.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry how and in what way SEEDA has allocated its broadband funds; and what SEEDA's criteria are in allocating funds for broadband provision in the poorest wards in Kent.  [81766]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21120w10.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Timms  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 19 November 2002</i>]: SEEDA programmes are targeted at both supply and demand side issues including direct touch involvement in mainstream technologies (Fibre, DSL, Wireless and Satellite), new technologies (powerline transmission, VDSL, third generation mobile and metro Ethernet), application pilot programmes and broadband promotion. In addition SEEDA is working with other national, regional and local stakeholders.
<P>

<a name="21120w10.html_para13">SEEDA's criteria for allocating funds are shaped by the Regional Economic strategy and its Corporate plan as agreed with partners. Both documents identify the 119 most deprived wards in the Region as priority areas, requiring special attention and investment. Of these, 48 are in Kent and 6 in Medway.

 <i>[holding answer 19 November 2002]:</i> My right hon. Friend, the Minister of State for the Environment, has overall responsibility for the EU Chemicals Strategy, including responsibility for the assessment of the regulatory impact of those proposals. The Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) is actively involved in the development of policy on this issue. In May 2001, the Government prepared a preliminary regulatory impact assessment of the proposals in the European Commission's White Paper XStrategy for a Future Chemicals Policy", COM(2001) 88. A further regulatory impact assessment will be required when proposals for the European Commission's legislation are available, and DTI will be fully involved in determining the scope and content of that assessment. It will include an assessment of the implications of the proposed legislation for the international competitiveness of the

UK chemicals industry and other manufacturing sectors that use chemicals in their processes and products. The Government has already consulted interested stakeholders about the specification for the regulatory impact assessment. In addition, the Government will consider what further analysis may be needed to ensure that the wider implications for competitiveness (for example, at the macro-economic level) are taken into account.

 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry has had no discussions with BAE Systems on this issue. However, this Government fully supports UK industry in its legitimate defence exports. In relation to the Kingdom of Thailand, HMG is supporting BAE Systems to work with the Government of the Kingdom of Thailand to assist with the modernisation of the Royal Thai Armed Forces. In this connection, I understand they have set in motion the negotiation on a major programme of offset, technology transfer and inward investment, collectively known as XEconomic Compensation", to be undertaken to provide Thailand with substantial and sustainable investment in areas such as agriculture, health, education and industrial participation.

<P>
<a name="21120w11.html_spnew5"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 We use local reference rents to ensure that the overriding principle that people receiving should not have their rent met in full if it exceeds the broad average for the area is adhered to. Local reference rents and the localities to which they apply are set by independent rent officers to reflect local housing market conditions. Requests for re-determinations are rare which indicates that local references rents do not cause widespread problems for benefit recipients.

<a name="21120w11.html_para1">The new standard local housing allowance will be based on local reference rents and will be piloted in up to 10 pathfinder local authorities selected to reflect a wide range of housing market conditions, including areas with high value rented properties. In consultation with independent researchers, we are drawing up a rigorous evaluation strategy to test the effectiveness of the allowance in enabling housing benefit recipients in the deregulated private rented sector to make informed choices over their accommodation.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions if he will introduce a de minimis rule in implementing the housing benefit changes due in April 2003, whereby a small charity, with less than 10 units, may continue to have its 'support' costs included in housing benefit payments.  [81563]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21120w11.html_spnew6"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 Housing benefit is intended to help people on low incomes to pay for rented accommodation. It is not intended to provide the full range of support services vulnerable people need to enable them to live independently in the community. The Supporting People arrangements to be introduced in April 2003 will bring together resources from several existing programmes, including housing benefit, to create a coherent funding and planning framework for housing-related support services, based on a grant to local councils. The new arrangements will promote greater choice and flexibility for service users.

 No assessment has been made of the impact of these maps on insurance costs. The Environment Agency have always made it clear that their maps show the indicative floodplain area, not flood risk or definitive flood boundaries, and are based on land topography taking no account of the defences which are in place. The insurance industry is aware of this, and of the need to use the maps with considerable caution.

This is intended to form a building block for an integrated standardised mammal-monitoring system that embraces the full range of important species, and will help assess long-term trends. Certain species, such as the fox, have been targeted for monitoring, but all other mammals signs encountered should be recorded. As yet no population comparisons have been undertaken of the species being monitored. The pilot scheme concludes in November 2003.

<a name="21120w14.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Since the Pet Travel Scheme began on 28 February 2000 we have continually assessed its operation. When necessary, we have provided additional clarification and guidance to overcome difficulties or confusion, in particular where this resulted in animals failing to comply with the scheme's requirements. I am pleased to say that as a result of this and our continuing evaluation of our PETS publicity, the number of animals that do not pass PETS checks has fallen significantly since the scheme began.
<P>

<a name="21120w14.html_para7">The Advisory Group on Quarantine, whose report was the basis for the introduction of the scheme, considered carefully the necessary means of identifying pets. It decided that electronic identification was the best way forward. This system has worked well and under the proposal for a harmonised system of pet movement in the community, may, in the future, be adopted as the sole means of identification.

 Exemptions from quarantine were not granted before 1999. With the impending introduction of the Pet Travel Scheme the Government was prepared to grant exemption from quarantine in exceptional situations. To qualify for consideration for exemption we require that the applicant, or his or her child, must have a life-threatening illness, which makes it a strong possibility that they will not survive for more than six months. Evidence of the life-threatening illness is subject to independent medical scrutiny. Exceptionally, we have also granted exemption on national security grounds.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21120w15.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 The Levy Board requires bookmakers to have their annual declaration for 2001/02 signed by a registered auditor where their horserace betting turnover exceeds #275,000. The Board relies upon the auditor's certification as confirmation of its accuracy. The turnover figure of #275,000 equates to approximately #5,300 per week, above which a betting shop business is deemed to be sufficiently substantial to require audit confirmation.

<a name="21120w17.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Last year the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) endorsed the development of an emissions trading system for international aviation that would involve trading with other sectors. It requested its Council as a matter of priority to develop guidelines for the structural and legal basis of such a system consistent with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) process. My Department has since discussed this at various meetings under ICAO's auspices. It has also discussed it with several UK stakeholders as part of meetings on wider issues. Representations made so far have all been broadly supportive. Further discussions of both kinds are expected. The ICAO work is still at a relatively early stage. The Department itself has not conducted research on this subject, nor is it planning to do so.

 The Government consider that providing for the effective management of the impacts of airport development will be a key element of a sustainable airports policy. Indeed, this is identified as one of three central issues in the current consultation document, XThe Future Development of Air Transport in the United Kingdom". The document includes proposals for a range of measures aimed at controlling or mitigating local impacts&#151;including the effects of noise from aircraft&#151;and, where that is not possible, providing adequate compensation. The Government are seeking consultees' views on those proposals and inviting other ideas for dealing with this issue.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21120w17.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Noise certification requirements are prescribed by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), under Annex 16 Volume I of the Chicago Convention. The Aeroplane Noise Regulations 1999 (SI 1999 No. 1452) and the Air Navigation (Environmental Standards) Order 2002 (SI 2002 No. 798) transpose these requirements, certain European aircraft noise Directives, and noise certification requirements for microlight aircraft developed by the Civil Aviation Authority, into UK legislation. Taken together, this legislation requires noise certification of most types of civil aircraft taking off or landing in the UK. Civil aircraft overflying UK airspace without taking off or landing in the UK are unlikely to cause significant noise nuisance.
<P>

<a name="21120w17.html_para4">EU Regulation 1592/2002 establishes with effect from 28 September 2003 the new European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). Article 15<i>(l)(h)</i> of that Regulation will confer on EASA a duty to issue environmental certificates, which currently is the responsibility of the Civil Aviation Authority for UK-registered aircraft. Future measures, such as those required to implement the ICAO Chapter 4 requirements for new types of jet aircraft from 2006, will be taken in this context. Detailed arrangements will be determined in due course.
<P>

<a name="21120w17.html_para5">In addition, departure noise limits are specified by Notice under s78 of the 1982 Act for Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted airports. Some other UK airports apply their own operational noise limits.

Estimates are based on a journey distance of 270 miles. In the case of air travel and rail travel, they make no allowance for travel to the airport or railway station. In the case of lorries, it is assumed that fuel consumption for an articulated lorry is 0.35 litres per km, and for a rigid lorry, 0.40 litres per km. Emissions per passenger for travel by car will depend on the size of the vehicle, and the number of passengers. Estimates above are based on an average car and average car occupancy over all journeys of 1.59 passengers per car derived from National Travel Survey in the period 1999&#150;2001.<P>

 These issues have been covered extensively in the Government's recent airport studies. In particular, the SERAS study included a report by the consultants Booz Alien on issues relating to hub airports. The economic, social and environmental costs and benefits of various airport options, including some which could be international hub airports, are set out in the consultation document XThe Future Development of Air Transport in the United Kingdom". The economic benefits set out there do not include any benefits to international transfer passengers (i.e. those who are not travelling to or from the UK), but do take account of the benefits to travellers to and from the UK from air services which are made viable by international transfer passengers. The role of hub airports in a long-term sustainable airports policy is one of the central issues on which the Government are seeking views through the consultation. Copies of the consultation document and the SERAS technical reports have been placed in the Libraries of the House.

 It proved impossible to agree terms for a 20-year franchise which both the SRA and Go Via found affordable and acceptable. The altered circumstances of Railtrack since the Hatfield derailment had a bearing. The uncertain impact of other rail projects, notably Thameslink 2000, was also relevant.

 The UK's White Paper on International Development, published in December 2000, highlighted the need for developing countries to have a more effective voice in international institutions. And at the Annual Meetings of the IMF and World bank, the Development Committee called on these institutions to prepare a joint paper on broadening and strengthening the participation of developing countries in International Financial Institution decision making for the spring meetings in April 2003. It is within the context of this broader discussion on increasing the voice of developing countries that we expect representation on the Executive Board to feature. The UK would welcome positive consideration of ways to increase the representation of developing countries on the Executive Board, and African countries in particular. We will be working with the IMF and World bank over the coming months to explore this further.

 Enhancing the transparency of the IMF and World bank is a critical part of our work on strengthening crisis prevention, improving economic cooperation and promoting global stability and growth.

Chairman's Concluding Remarks (and Summings Up) on discussions of Country Assistance Strategies, Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers/Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, Sector Strategy Papers and Heavily Indebted Poor Country documents are publicly available. Chairman's Concluding Remarks on discussions of other policy, strategy and topical issues can also be made publicly available&#151;though this requires the agreement of the Executive Board.

There has been a significant increase in the publication of Public Information Notices summarizing the surveillance (Article IV) discussions of the Board, of Article IV reports themselves, and of Chairman's statements, news briefs and press releases following Board discussions on the use of Fund resources and on policy issues. Nevertheless, the UK believes that the IMF can build on this progress and that there is considerable scope for further reform. The IMF's Transparency policy was discussed by the Executive Board in June 2002. At this

 Coffee processing involves the transformation of green coffee beans into a number of products including roast and ground, soluble (instant) coffee, decaffeinated coffee extracts and various speciality coffees. The decision to undertake coffee processing in the developing country of origin is a strictly commercial one. This decision is undoubtedly influenced by a number of considerations such as the domestic operating environment (e.g. reliability of supporting infrastructure), assurance of bean supply and quality requirements, transport costs, the buy-in strategies adopted by retailers, packaging and labelling

<a name="21120w22.html_para3">It is not easy to disaggregate this figure according to the categories listed, nor is it sensible. Where possible through provision of direct budgetary support, we support Governments' entire health systems.

 The formal reintegration of ex-soldiers has not yet started in Angola. The Government of Angola is in the process of developing its Angola Demobilisation and Reintegration Programme (ADRP), with assistance from the World bank. Until the ADRP has been agreed, little progress will be made on putting in place appropriate social structures to receive the ex-combatants. It is therefore essential that the ADRP is finalised as soon as possible, in close collaboration with the international community. This programme should be consistent with the Government's own Norms for Return and Resettlement. It should also be set in a broader framework encompassing the return of refugees and internally displaced people (IDPs).

With the help of the World bank, the Government of Angola is working on an immediate post-conflict recovery plan which the international community expects will be presented to donors at a conference organised by the Government of Angola in the first

<a name="21120w22.html_para4">Without national reconciliation, a fully inclusive national dialogue, and sustainable poverty reduction, the cease-fire is unlikely to be transformed into a lasting peace.

 My Department is extremely concerned about the situation in Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and the unacceptably high levels of violent crimes, including rape, committed against women. We maintain links with a number of human rights organisations including Human Rights Watch and local rights organisations based in eastern DRC, which are involved in the monitoring, and provision of support, to women victims of crime. The high rates of rape and sexual violence have mostly occurred in areas that are not under Government control where militias are operating and disorder is widespread.

We do not have contact with the ex-Far and Interahamwe and local Mai Mai groups. We also support a number of civil society organisations that are working in eastern DRC to monitor and raise rights abuses with authorities, as well as providing some limited support to women victims.

Human resources are central to functioning health systems and our work with partner countries includes support for locally appropriate strategies and plans to ensure health systems have the right staff. In some cases, such strategies include the training and deployment of various staff to perform basic treatments. Since 1997, we have committed over #1 billion, to help developing countries put in place and strengthen effective health care systems.

 In the case of overseas clinical teams working in the national health service, contracts are awarded on the basis of a number of criteria.

 No contracts have been signed between the United Kingdom Government and overseas health care providers, as all such contracts are set up between overseas providers and national health service trusts.

<i>[holding answer 19 November 2002]:</i> Patients wishing to access national health service dentistry are advised to contact NHS Direct where they will be informed of sources of treatment within locally agreed standards. During 2001 each health authority set its own standards for how far patients should have to travel for treatment depending on whether the requirement was for emergency or urgent treatment or routine access and whether the patient was based in a rural or urban area. These standards took into account local travel patterns. Primary care trusts have now

<a name="21120w25.html_para3">NHS Direct may also be able to inform patients of dental practitioners with whom they can register.
<P>

<a name="21120w25.html_para4">There is no maximum travel time or distance set for registering with a general practitioner, but patients are required to reside within the practice area of the GP with whom they wish to register. Most people prefer to register with a GP near to where they live and travel times and distances are generally short except in some remote or rural areas.
<P>

<a name="21120w25.html_para5">It is for health authorities and primary care trusts to plan the provision of local health services including the provision and location of emergency services. There is no maximum travel time or distance set for access to an accident and emergency unit.

A number of prosecutions have recently been initiated against producers, distributors and retailers of smokies. The FSA has also arranged a meeting with some of the local authorities involved with this issue and other stakeholders on 20 November 2002, to discuss the issue of smokies and the agency's co-ordinating role.
