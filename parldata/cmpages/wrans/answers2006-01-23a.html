 The Commissioners have been notified, by solicitors acting for a number of residents, of potential claims against them for damages arising from the improvements carried out by the Commissioners to premises in Ufford street, Mitre road and Webber street. This matter is the subject of potential litigation and it is therefore inappropriate for the Commissioners to make disclosure of documents outside the legal process.

 We have introduced &quot;accessibility planning&quot; into the local transport planning process to encourage local authorities and other agencies to assess more systematically whether people can access transport services in their areas. This process covers all forms of transport from buses, coaches and taxis to cycling and walking networks. Making provision for disabled people is a condition against which the resulting Local Transport Plans (LTPs) are assessed.

<a name="stpa_34">At a local level, we are supporting the continued introduction of low floor buses in Gravesham. The Kickstart project (services 495/498 between Kings Farm, Christianfields, Gravesend Town Centre, Pepper Hill and Bluewater), launched in March 2005, introduced low floor single deck buses to the route replacing minibuses which were inaccessible to wheelchair users. The introduction of the new vehicles was combined with a programme of work to introduce raised kerbs and bus boarders on this route.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60123w06.html_para13">
<a name="stpa_35">The Department continues to invest in accessibility improvements in Gravesham through LTP funding. Kent county council, Gravesham&#039;s local bus provider, Arriva and the Gravesham Access Group (which represents disabled people in the district) work in close partnership to identify priorities for funding. This includes identifying stops which require raised kerbing, dropped kerbs or hard standing.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60123w06.html_para14">
<a name="stpa_36">LTP funding has also resulted in a &#163;14.5 million investment in Fastrack, the new bus based transit system serving Gravesend, which will have fully accessible vehicles and roadside infrastructure designed in accordance with current best practice. Due to commence in March 2006, Fastrack will have bus boarders at all Gravesham stops to complement the fleet 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>23 Jan 2006 : Column 1726W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
of new low-floor vehicles, providing level access for all passengers. All Fastrack stops will also be fitted with real time information displays.

<a name="stpa_37">Arriva estimates that at present over 70 per cent. of their Gravesham buses are low floor. They also endeavour to ensure that all staff receive disability awareness training.

<p>
<a name="60123w06.html_para16">
<a name="stpa_38">Rail services in Gravesham are also generally accessible, a situation that will be enhanced with the completion of Ebbsfleet station. When opened, this station will offer high standards of accessibility and will be served by trains which meet the Rail Vehicle Accessibility Regulations 1998 (RVAR) operating on the Integrated Kent Franchise. This will provide fast access to Stratford International and London St. Pancras stations (both of which will be fully accessible) and also south to Ashford International together with access to &#039;Eurostar&#039; services to Belgium and France. The new station will have ample parking including convenient spaces reserved for disabled passengers.

<a name="stpa_39">More generally disabled people in Gravesham, as elsewhere in the country, will also benefit from the provisions in the Disability Discrimination Act 2005 (DDA 2005). We have already laid regulations which will, from 4 December 2006, lift the transport exemption in Part 3 of the for land-based public transport, vehicle hire, breakdown services and vehicles used on leisure and tourism transport services. We will also be consulting shortly on draft regulations to set an &quot;end date&quot; of no later than 1 January 2020 when all trains will have to meet RVAR and to apply those regulations to older trains when they are refurbished.

 The Department for International Development (DFID) recognises that the rapid depletion and mismanagement of water resources are a major threat to Yemen&#039;s development and future stability. Yemen receives relatively little aid in relation to its levels of poverty, and few donors are operating in Yemen. To improve the effectiveness of the aid which Yemen receives, DFID is helping the Government of Yemen and donors to improve the co-ordination of donor aid and persuade donors to support Government of Yemen policies rather than unco-ordinated projects. An important part of improving aid effectiveness is that donors focus their assistance in a few areas, and do not duplicate assistance from other donors.

DFID also encouraged the Government of Yemen to include the NWSSIP into its new plan for tackling overall development and poverty reduction, to help ensure that water management is considered in other areas of government policy.

 There have been several outbreaks of cholera across Zimbabwe in the past two months, which is not unusual at this time of year. In Harare, there have been five suspected cases with three deaths. There have been other outbreaks, including in the Chikomba district (219 suspected cases and seven deaths), and the Buhera district (51 suspected cases and three deaths). While the Harare figures remain low by comparison and do not yet constitute an epidemic, the danger of cholera spreading rapidly through urban areas with high population density remains high.

<a name="stpa_111">The Zimbabwean Ministry of Health and Child Welfare, supported by the World Health Organisation, has led investigations into suspected cases in Harare and notes that, although many cases have been presented with symptoms suggestive of cholera, only a few have been given a positive diagnosis following laboratory tests.

Should the problem escalate, DFID stands ready to offer additional assistance in the form of funds for procurement of commodities as well as provision of technical expertise according to need.

 The performance of the company responsible for security scanning is under constant review with regular meetings being held between representatives of the company and representatives of both Houses of Parliament. A number of teething problems occurred during the first weeks of the new contract last year; these appear to have abated and there has been no cause for complaint in the last two months. Some of the concerns raised were related to the interface between the screening and the mail processes, and both organisations involved have worked hard to improve these. No assessment has been made of the environmental consequences of the journeys required to process the mail, in view of the need for extensive off-site security screening in the current security climate.

Setting the threshold at &#8364;1,000 would allow a large number of UK artists to receive royalties.

 The Government take the recent increases in gas prices very seriously, and particularly their impact on the competitiveness of UK industry. We understand that this creates tough trading conditions, especially for energy intensive users, and we are aware of a few companies having reduced production in response to the very high prices since November. This will, of course, have a negative impact on UK industrial output, but in terms of overall GDP this will be relatively minor.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60123w18.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_142">The impact on UK businesses of increases in gas prices will depend on a variety of factors, including how much gas a particular company uses, the degree of their exposure to spot and forward prices and the duration of high prices. It will also be affected by the energy prices paid by their competitors. A further sector-specific issue is whether they are in a competitive market where international trade sets the price or in a sector where prices are determined more locally and rising energy costs could be passed on.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60123w18.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_143">Provisional data for October 2005 shows that UK retail gas prices for small, medium and large industrial users were below the EU15 median. However, individual companies will have agreed commercially confidential contract terms and prices that might differ from these averages. I am also aware, from my industry visits and meetings, that, there is some evidence that gas prices in the UK for some of our very large industrial users are above those on the Continent, and I recognise the risk that this presents to UK competitiveness. Officials are working closely with Industry and Ofgem, with a view to help, wherever possible, to mitigate the situation and reduce these impacts.

 Sections 1 to 4 of the Patents Act 2004 will bring UK patents legislation into line with the revised European Patent Convention (&quot;EPC&quot;). These provisions will be brought into force at the same time as the revised EPC itself takes effect. This is desirable in order to maintain consistency between the UK and European patents systems. It is uncertain exactly when this will be, because the revised EPC takes effect two years after the 15th state has ratified or acceded, or (if earlier) three months after the final state has ratified or acceded. At present I understand that 14 states have done so, and that includes the UK. The revised EPC, and the corresponding provisions in the 2004 Act, are therefore unlikely to take effect before mid-2008.

<p>
<a name="60123w24.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_183">More pro-active policing and increased police effectiveness may cause an increase in recorded crime. Use of CCTV, for example, may lead to recording and detection of assaults which would otherwise have gone unreported and unrecorded.
