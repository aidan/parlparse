<P>
<P>
<a name="00202w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Hancock: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will list the UK-based companies with potential to benefit from contracts if the Airbus Military Company's A400M proposals are accepted by his Department; and if he will estimate how many jobs the project would create in the United Kingdom.  [104420]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00202w01.html_spnew0"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 BAE Systems, as one of the Airbus partners, would expect to play a significant role in the A400M programme if the Government were to select this aircraft as a solution to the RAF's Future Transport Aircraft (FTA) requirement. Beyond that, there is potentially large scope for UK aerospace suppliers to participate in the A400M programme. However, it would not be possible for me to list specific companies at this stage as the selection of suppliers would be properly a matter for the commercial judgment of Airbus Military (as Prime Contractor) during the aircraft development programme.
<P>

<a name="00202w01.html_para0">We are taking account of employment forecasts for competing options for the FTA requirement. As the Minister for Competitiveness advised the hon. Gentleman, <i>Official Report</i>, 15 December 1999, column 208W, the FTA competition is as yet undecided and it would be inappropriate to publish information supplied by companies. I must therefore withhold commercially sensitive information under Exemption 13 (third party's commercial confidences) of the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We did not limit equipment and systems for the Type 45 to the three "CNGF" former partner contractors because there were elements in their design that were superfluous to UK requirements. For example, as I said in evidence to the House of Commons Defence Committee on 16 June 1999, the unit production cost of an electronic warfare system for a national warship is planned to be about one third of that envisaged for the Horizon frigate.</FONT></UL>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Nevertheless, as a consequence of GEC (Marconi)'s membership of the now disbanded Horizon International Joint Venture Company, BAE SYSTEMS is able to make maximum use of the work accomplished during the Horizon design definition phase and, as I said in my letter dated 10 January 2000, have indicated that they will make use of some 70% of the work done for the Horizon programme. It will be for BAE SYSTEMS, as the Prime Contractor for the Type 45 programme, to make many of the decisions on equipment selection for the Type 45. However, the Company will be required to demonstrate value for money through competitive procurement of equipment and systems for the ship and to show that the equipment selected provides the required capability. This will take account of competitions already undertaken for Horizon equipment whilst moving forward with the national programme at an affordable cost.</FONT></UL>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>With regard to your question concerning the continuing industrial difficulties with the Horizon Programme which underlay the decision not to use a single prime contractor, the information requested was given in the supplementary memorandum submitted by the MoD to the House of Commons Defence Committee (HCDC), Session 1998/99:</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The key difficulty in forming an effective industrial organisation centred on the selection of a Prime Contractor able to direct its subcontractors to the extent required to manage the overall risk. In essence, the very wide range of companies involved could not agree on one of them becoming an effective leader. This prevented the nomination of an empowered prime contractor taking full responsibility for the project, which is fundamental to best procurement principles."

It is too early to know how many staff will claim such payments or what the total cost will be but the numbers involved will only be a very small proportion of the Department's employees.

 There is a presumption of access to MOD land wherever this is consistent with military activities, the health and safety of the public, environmental and conservation considerations, and the interests of our tenants. There have been leaflets and publications available for some years, most notably the booklet "Walks on MOD Lands", giving information about access opportunities on the Defence Estate. A copy of this booklet will be placed in the Library of the House. My Department is working to improve both public access and the provision of information. The booklet is currently under review and a revision will be published later in the year. Work is also being undertaken to develop an access website.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if the decision no longer to employ full-time civilian adventure training instructors for the Army in Germany following the 1998 Review of Adventure Training was scored as an efficiency savings measure for budget purposes.  [107410]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00202w02.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The arrangements for Adventurous Training in Germany have recently been restructured. The training has been more closely focused on military requirements and the number of individuals trained reduced. The facilities are now paid for entirely from public funds, rather than from a mix of public and non-public funds as previously. No efficiency savings have been scored as a result of these changes.

 I am pleased to say that the principal "lessons learned" from the outcome of the Horizon programme covering procurement strategy, risk reduction, communication with industry at an early stage of the project, and affordability have already been built into the Smart Procurement Initiative, thus ensuring that they will be applied in all future circumstances. Other lessons included work share arrangements. The involvement of trans-national companies and OCCAR are likely to be helpful in dealing with work share issues. These types of issues will be taken into account as Smart Procurement Implementation progresses.

 <i>[holding answer 31 January 2000]:</i> There is no evidence of a successful incursion, from an external source, to any Departmental computer system during the past five years. There were two cases during 1999 of corruption of Websites holding Unclassified MOD information. Measures have been taken to secure both these sites. There are widespread and frequent probes of MOD firewalls connected to the Internet, which do not result in successful penetrations of MOD systems. There have, however, been 25 recorded instances during the past five years of internal incursions by MOD staff, none of which had any operational impact. Appropriate disciplinary measures were taken, as required, in each case.

These include significant improvements which have been made to the operational welfare package, a reduction in force deployments to both Bosnia and Kosovo, and the Learning Forces initiative. Welcome progress has also been made by the Services Families Task Force, which is addressing a variety of issues relating to military service that are of concern to Service personnel.

Maintenance in the Land environment is different from that in, for example, the Air environment where they use largely scheduled maintenance based on flying hours. Maintenance of Army tanks and vehicles is achieved through a mix of planned maintenance (servicing based on time and mileage) and reactive repair maintenance. The latter regime is the larger element.

<a name="00202w04.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 We have made no formal assessment of the effectiveness of the Protection of Animals Act 1911 with regard to circus animals. In 1998, there were 1,107 prosecutions made under the Act, but these figures do not show details of the animals involved or the profession of the defendants. The figures do, however, confirm that the Act--which covers all domestic and captive animals--is frequently used, and we have been given no reason to doubt its general effectiveness.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00202w04.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 I should make it clear that Irish people already receive the protection that current legislation provides. The Race Relations Act 1976 makes it unlawful for anyone to discriminate against another on ethnic grounds. Successful complaints in relation to discrimination against the Irish have been brought by the Commission for Racial Equality (CRE) resulting in compensation payments and agreements by organisations to change their practices. A Bill currently before Parliament will amend the 1976 Act by extending it to the functions of public authorities not currently covered by the Act. The Bill will also put a statutory duty on public authorities to promote racial equality.
<P>

<a name="00202w04.html_para1">It is also an offence to incite ethnic hatred against the Irish community by virtue of part III of the Public Order Act 1986. Racist violence and harassment towards members of the Irish community falls under the new racially aggravated offences in the Crime and Disorder Act 1998.
<P>

<a name="00202w04.html_para2">The Government are also addressing the specific issues of discrimination and disadvantage faced by some sections of the Irish community. These were highlighted in the CRE's Report, "Discrimination and the Irish Community in Britain" which has been the subject of a number of discussions which I and my colleagues across Whitehall have been having with the Irish Ambassador and representatives from Irish organisations.
<P>

<a name="00202w04.html_para3">One of the major issues was a recommendation that there should be a separate Irish category in the ethnic origin question in the next Census in 2001. The Draft Census Order for England and Wales was laid before Parliament on Monday 10 January. It includes an ethnicity question with a category for "Irish" cultural background in the "White" section.

 The invaluable support which the Women's Royal Voluntary Service (WRVS) offers to the Prison Service covers a large part of the prison estate with around a hundred prisons benefiting from the work of WRVS volunteers. The services provided by the WRVS include the provision of supervision for children's visits to parents in prisons; the running of prison visitors' centres and their tea bars; and the development of toy libraries for visiting children. In view of the differing needs of prisons, the development of partnerships with the WRVS is undertaken by individual establishments. Detailed information about the use of volunteers in prisons is not available centrally, however, a survey of all prisons is being undertaken with a view to establishing more specific information about their use of volunteers.

<P>

<a name="00202w04.html_para10">This breakdown has been prepared from information supplied by police forces and drawn from the police national computer. Further analysis of re-offending by those subject to home detention curfew is currently underway as part of a long term evaluation of the scheme, including the procedures for notification of further charges to the Prison Service by the police.
<P>

<a name="00202w04.html_para11">Overall, the Home Detention Curfew scheme has been a success, with 95 per cent. of curfewees completing their period of curfew licence. However, we are not complacent about any re-offending on curfew and the scheme is strictly enforced. Where a prisoner does commit a further offence while subject to curfew, he or she is in breach of their licence conditions, and may be recalled to prison, in addition to the possibility of additional sentence for the new offence.

 It is not our policy to refuse to accept recommendations made by adjudicators in dismissed or withdrawn appeals. We will act on such recommendations where the written determination discloses clear exceptional compassionate circumstances which have not previously been considered and which would merit an exercise of discretion outside the Immigration Rules. We have no plans to review this policy following the judgment in the case of R. <i>v.</i> Secretary of State for the Home Department ex-Parte Ali.

 The Government believe that most of these appeals could be determined very quickly on the basis of the papers by a single judge. However, they intend to give the judge the power to permit oral representations to be made to him by both the prosecution and defence if he considers it necessary in the interests of justice to do so. It is estimated that a paper based appeal to the Crown Court would cost &#163;90 and an oral appeal would cost an additional &#163;182. It is assumed that 3,900 or 25 per cent. of defendants would appeal.

Confiscation--published in November 1989--proposed a range of measures to tighten up the enforcement of criminal confiscation orders. Since the Working Group reported, the Government have been considering more widely whether some confiscation and forfeiture functions, including the enforcement of confiscation orders, might be operated more effectively by a national confiscation agency. In the autumn, the Prime Minister asked my right hon. Friend the Member for Makerfield, Minister of State at the Cabinet Office (Mr. McCartney), to act as sponsor Minister for a project in the Cabinet Office's Performance and Innovation Unit to consider the role that following the money trail and seizing criminal assets can play in the fight against crime and how to maximise the effective use of these tools. The Performance and Innovation Unit is expected to report in the spring and a White Paper proposing comprehensive action against financial crime to issue shortly thereafter.

 There are occasions when, at the request of the police, or other investigatory authority, approval is granted for an undercover operation to be conducted within a prison. There were eight such operations in 1998 and 16 in 1999. All these operations took place with approval from Prison Service headquarters and the prior knowledge of the local prison authorities. Two of the above operations related to the supply of drugs within the prisons concerned but the majority related to the large scale supply of illegal drugs outside prison. The outcome of these operations is not known to the prison authorities.
<P>

<a name="00202w06.html_para3">There will also have been a number of operations conducted locally to each prison involving co-operation between the local police and the prison in relation to the supplying of illegal drugs into that prison.

 The public and charitable funders of the international human genome project have agreed that they will release the gene sequence information they generate as quickly as possible; and they will not patent that information. The Government strongly support this approach as it allows maximum exploitation by public and private sector researchers of the data generated. Nonetheless, translating fundamental genome sequence information into new gene-based diagnostics and therapeutics will, in many circumstances, involve sufficient innovation to justify intellectual property protection.
<P>

<a name="00202w06.html_para4">The EU Directive on the Legal Protection of Biotechnological Inventions, which will come into force later this year, harmonises national patent laws within Europe. There are certain global norms, upon which the EU system is based, which are followed by other national authorities, including those of the United States. It is a matter solely for the national authorities to interpret these criteria in relation to applications for patents, including those concerning the human genome.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry by what amount, expressed in terms of megawatts, the generators of electricity would have to be reduced in order to reduce carbon dioxide emissions to the equivalent required by the climate change levy.  [107919]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00202w07.html_spnew7"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 The climate change levy is expected to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by at least 2MtC a year, before including the effect of negotiated agreements. If a 2MtC saving were to be brought about through reductions in electricity generation, this could be achieved either through a reduction of 21 terawatt hours in gas fired generation or 9 terawatt hours in coal fired generation. This would be broadly equivalent to the loss of all output from 3000MW of gas fired plant otherwise operating at a load factor of 80 per cent., or 2000MW of coal fired plant operating at just over 50 per cent. load factor.

 The Government do not believe that specific regulation is desirable to prevent those under sixteen years of age from entering into a contract for a mobile phone. It is very unlikely that a consumer credit agreement entered into by person under the age of eighteen, for the purposes of a mobile phone contract, would be enforceable against that person. This is no doubt the reason why operators require a person to be over 18 before they can sign up a mobile contract.

 It is the responsibility of local planning authorities to act in the general public interest when determining planning applications. They must determine applications in accordance with the development plan unless material considerations indicate otherwise. Such considerations can include views expressed by local residents and other third parties. The scope for third parties to participate fully in the development control process has been increased in recent years, through statutory requirements to consult on the preparation of the development plan and to publicise all planning applications. Local authorities' handling of

 Where the capital receipt which a local authority receives for the transfer of its entire housing stock is less than the debt attributed to the stock, the Government are prepared to make a one-off payment to assist the authority to repay the outstanding Public Works Loan Board debt principal. In such cases the local authority will be required to repay its attributable housing debt shortly after the transfer is completed. These new arrangements were announced to the House on 16 December 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column 250W, by my hon. Friend the Minister for Housing and Planning following consultation with local authorities and others last year.
<P>

<a name="00202w10.html_para4">Under these arrangements local authorities are required to meet from the capital receipt or their existing resources any premiums arising from the early repayment of debt. An authority with overhanging debt applying for a place on the housing transfer programme must, in addition to meeting the other published criteria, demonstrate that it can pay the premiums arising from the early repayment of debt before they can be allocated a place on the housing transfer programme.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he intends to make changes to the appeals system for non-domestic rates valuations from 1 April 2000; and if he will make a statement.  [108602]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00202w11.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Armstrong: </B> 
 In March 1999, as part of the Financial Management and Policy Review of the Valuation tribunal service, we consulted on possible changes to the appeals system for business rates. Appeals against a rating assessment can take some years to resolve because of the sheer numbers that are received. At present, businesses are too often in the dark about when their appeal will be considered. This is unacceptable. I believe it is important to businesses that they are given this information and an opportunity to make representations to appropriate bodies for earlier action if they believe this to be necessary.
<P>

<a name="00202w11.html_para2">Therefore we propose the following reforms to improve the business rates appeals system:
<P>

<a name="00202w11.html_para3"><P>
<BR>

<a name="00202w11.html_para9">We will also encourage early submissions of appeals, limiting the extent to which late appeals can be retrospective. Existing rating lists will close to any new appeals on 31 March 2001.

<P>

<a name="00202w11.html_para10">I believe that these and other initiatives will bring greater clarity to the appeals system and more certainty to businesses about when their appeals will be resolved. They will be achieved through a combination of regulation and best practice.
<P>

<a name="00202w11.html_para11">Priority will be given to the settlement of appeals relating to the 1995 rating list and previous lists. We intend to deal with these appeals as far as possible before work starts on new appeals against the 2000 list.

 In December 1999, the Royal Opera House cancelled six performances of a Ligeti production scheduled for December and a further five performances of other productions scheduled to take place between January and April. Technical rehearsal time for these productions, which had been planned for Autumn 1999, was spent commissioning the new stage equipment. The cancellation freed time in November and December to enable the Opening Celebration, Falstaff, A Celebration of International Choreography and The Nutcracker to open on schedule and be performed as planned.
<P>

<a name="00202w12.html_para1">The matinee performance of Gawain on 19 January was cancelled as the Royal Opera House management felt it was inappropriate to risk having to make last minute changes to the performance schedule because of unforeseen problems with the stage machinery that could have resulted in delays to the beginning of the performance, and therefore to the schools' return journeys.
<P>

<a name="00202w12.html_para2">The final ballet in a mixed programme of ballets was cancelled on 20 January because problems with the scene shifting equipment had been encountered earlier during the day which delayed the starting time of the performance, threatening the possibility of completing the full programme for the evening within a reasonable time.

 I understand that on the morning of 14 January, a Norwegian Church Aid mission looking at displacement and food shortages near Parajok, Eastern Equatoria, was attacked. Two Norwegian Church Aid, one African Inland Church, two Episcopal Church and three Sudan Relief and Rehabilitation Association workers were killed; three others survived.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00202w12.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 We are very concerned about UNICEF's preliminary report into Child and Maternal Mortality in Iraq and continue to support efforts to target the humanitarian effort there towards the most vulnerable. We are discussing with UNICEF how they propose to adjust their programme in Iraq in light of the survey and are considering opportunities for working with them.
<P>

<a name="00202w12.html_para4">Meanwhile, the comprehensive resolution on Iraq, SCR 1284, which was drafted and piloted through the Security Council by the UK, includes a raft of measures providing for a bigger and better "oil for food" programme. It also calls on the Government of Iraq at last to prioritise its spending under "oil for food" more effectively and address the needs of vulnerable groups.
<P>

<a name="00202w12.html_para5">In this respect we oppose the present plan prepared by Iraq which allocates just $10 million out of an available sum of $3.5 billion to targeted feeding programmes for malnourished children.
<P>

<a name="00202w12.html_para6">If the Iraqi Government had chosen to prioritise genuinely the humanitarian assistance which has been made available since the implementation of UNSCR 986 in 1996, the suffering of the Iraqi people would have been hugely reduced.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will set out total expenditure on the NHS <i>(a)</i> at 1999-2000 prices and <i>(b)</i> as a proportion of natural income for each financial year since 1978-79 and for the remainder of the period covered by the Comprehensive Spending Review; and if he will provide a breakdown between (i) current and (ii) capital expenditure.  [107661]<P>

<P>
<a name="00202w14.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The table shows for England, (a) gross National Health Service expenditure, (b) gross current NHS expenditure, (c) gross capital NHS expenditure. It is not possible to provide England NHS expenditure as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) as GDP relates to the United Kingdom as a whole rather than England. Column (d) therefore provides Gross UK NHS expenditure as percentage of GDP.

 <i>[holding answer 1 February 2000]:</i> Services for the diagnosis and treatment of leishmaniasis, as for other imported infections, are provided by and through the patient's general practitioner. If the patient has a mild form of the disease, this would be managed by the GP. If, however, the patient has a more severe form of the disease, the GP would refer the patient to a hospital specialist. Consultants in dermatology, infectious diseases or tropical diseases would be appropriate, depending on the clinical presentation and local circumstances.

 It is for banks in the first instance to resolve how they charge their customers for the use of ATM machines in a competitive environment. My right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer has commissioned a review of banking competition under Don Cruickshank.

 The Chancellor of the Exchequer and Secretary of State for International Development announced on 21 December 1999 that the UK will be providing 100 per cent. relief on the debts of all the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries, once the country qualifies for relief under the HIPC initiative. No extra conditions will apply.
<P>

<a name="00202w15.html_para5">Uganda will be one of the first countries that will benefit from the extra relief to be provided by the UK. In a meeting with the Chancellor and Secretary of State for International Development just before Christmas, the Ugandan Treasury Secretary told them that the extra money will go towards meeting his country's commitment to universal primary education and towards lowering the pupil:teacher ratio in schools from today's level of 100:1 to 50:1 in 2003.

<a name="00202w16.html_para4">The calculation of this entitlement involves the use of a rolling period of 26 weeks. Each week of the proposed break is assessed to see if it falls within a period of 26 weeks in which no more than four weeks' break will have occurred in total.

 My noble and learned Friend the Lord Chancellor wrote yesterday to Peter Birch CBE, Chairman-Designate of the Legal Services Commission, enclosing three directions about priorities for funding, the scope of the Community Legal Services Fund and particular budgets within the Fund. Copies of these directions have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses.

 I am pleased that offers of some &#163;2 million in marketing grants have been made under the Agriculture Development Scheme. Around 35 per cent. of the money will benefit the pig sector directly and some of the other projects directed at the livestock sector will also help pig producers. Overall, we are assisting a wide range of sectors and regions. The following organisations have been offered grant aid.

<P>
<a name="00202w18.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Stringer: </B> 
 It is the Government's policy to introduce regulation only when really necessary and to ensure that it imposes the minimum burden to achieve its objective. The Government also insists that a regulatory impact assessment is carried out whenever regulations are likely to have an impact on business, charities or voluntary organisations. The number of regulatory impact assessments is recorded in twice-yearly Command Papers which are placed in the Libraries of the House. Listing the absolute number of regulations made is meaningless. If one assumes that the term regulations means Statutory Instruments, the total would include all those with no impact on business, every deregulatory order, every routine air traffic and road closure order, as well as those that have lapsed and those laid in order to revoke existing Statutory Instruments.

 The estimated cost of Special Advisers in 1999-2000 is &#163;4.0 million. The increase in cost is the result of strengthening the centre to ensure a firm political focus and greater co-ordination in the work of this Administration.
