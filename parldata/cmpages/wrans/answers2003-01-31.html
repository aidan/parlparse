To ask the Minister for the Cabinet Office what preparations have been made outside large urban conurbations for responses to a terrorist attack; and what procedures are in place to cope and assist with the likely exodus of people from large cities in the event of an attack taking place there.  [93380]<P>

<P>
<a name="30131w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Alexander: </B> 
 The UK has robust plans in place for the protection of the public and of national security interests. The Government's preparations include a series of classified contingency plans for responding to a wide range of terrorist threats. These plans are regularly tested, reviewed and updated as circumstances change. Much of the response is based on generic, multi-agency, local emergency arrangements, developed within the clear guidelines set out by the Home Office.
<P>

<a name="30131w01.html_para0">Evacuation planning is currently undertaken at local level, by the police and local authority emergency planners. This includes ensuring routes to and from the site of the incident remain viable, and planning for the reception and re-housing of evacuees. We are also taking steps to strengthen the regional level of co-ordination, to ensure compatibility and cohesion of local evacuation and reception plans for large-scale incidents.

 Standard techniques and procedures have been developed in consultation with coalition partners and would be used by deployed forces to reduce the risk of friendly fire incidents. They include the management of friendly assets in both time and space and the widespread dissemination of orders, such as the Air Tasking Order, in order to ensure that all friendly assets are aware of the location and movement of own forces. As I stated in my answer to the hon Member on 18 December 2002 <i>Official Report</i>, column 807W, tactics, techniques and procedures complement situational awareness and target identification to form a triad of measures designed to achieve Combat Identification and minimise the risk of fratricide.

 Children involved in prostitution and other forms of commercial sexual exploitation are likely to be in need of welfare services and&#151;in many cases&#151;protection under the Children Act 1989.
<P>

<a name="30131w02.html_para2">Where there is a risk to the life of a child or a likelihood of serious harm, an agency with statutory child protection powers, for example, the police or councils with social services responsibilities, should act quickly to secure the immediate initial safety of the child. In some cases, it may be necessary to ensure either that the child remains in, or is removed to, a safe place. Under section 20 of the Children Act 1989, a local authority may provide accommodation for any child within their area if they consider that to do so would safeguard or promote the child's welfare.
<P>

<a name="30131w02.html_para3">When a child is identified as involved in prostitution or other commercial sexual exploitation, or at risk of being drawn into it, an assessment of the child's needs will be undertaken in accordance with &quot;Safeguarding Children Involved in Prostitution" (2000), &quot;Working Together to Safeguard Children" (1999), the Government's child protection guidance, and the &quot;Framework for the Assessment of Children in Need and their Families" (2000). This assessment should be followed by consideration of how best to address the identified needs of the child and development of a care plan for the child who is in need. The plan could include a range of services, for example, mentoring to assist a return to education or employment, and help to secure appropriate health services.

This scheme has many of the features of the national diagnostic treatment centre (DTC) programme as it seeks to create dedicated elective capacity for a modern, patient focused, high productivity clinical service. The trust is currently producing a business case for this development, which will require approval by local primary care trusts and the StHA before it proceeds.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30131w04.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 It is not possible to identify definitively the individual reactors in which specific batches of plutonium allocated to the ownership of specific customers might originally have been produced. Reprocessing customers receive back separated plutonium based on that contained in the fuel they originally supplied. This is assessed before the fuel is reprocessed. The nature of commercial reprocessing in large-scale bulk chemical processing facilities means that the plutonium contained in the fuel becomes blended with that contained in fuel from other reactors.
<P>

<a name="30131w04.html_para6">International safeguards arrangements for MO&quot; fuel assemblies include measurement of the nuclear material content of the fuel before its shipment from the fabrication plant and then the application of seals to the transport flasks into which the assemblies have been loaded. On receipt at a reactor facility seals are checked and removed before the fuel is placed in storage or loaded into the reactor. Such fuel storage and reactor loading is monitored by safeguards inspections combined with the use of containment and surveillance equipment (e.g. cameras and seals). Safeguards measures continue to be applied after MO&quot; fuel has been loaded in a reactor.

: To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry which international agreements cover the arrangements permitting the swapping of plutonium batches between that material owned by British Nuclear Fuels, British Energy or the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority and that owned by foreign customers as held at Sellafield.  [92305]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30131w04.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 In the European Union, the ownership of nuclear materials is governed by the Euratom provisions that deal with the supply of nuclear materials (essentially Chapter 6 of the Euratom Treaty). These provide that exchanges of material&#151;which are basically a commercial matter for the companies concerned&#151;require the approval of the Euratom Supply Agency on a case-by-case basis.
<P>

<a name="30131w04.html_para9">External obligations, for example limiting the use of such material to peaceful, non-explosive purposes are, however, a feature of some international nuclear co-operation agreements, such as those between, Euratom and the United States, Euratom and Australia and Euratom and Canada. In some cases where there are no Euratom agreements in place, there are bilateral agreements which contain comparable provisions. The owners of nuclear material can request that external obligations attached to one batch of material can be exchanged or swapped for different obligations on another equivalent batch of material. Each such request for a swap involving material that is subject to Euratom co-operation agreements must be approved by the Services of the European Commission, whose assessment takes account of the characteristics of the nuclear material concerned, (i.e. to ensure that the swap would not diminish the obligations involved) and the reasoning behind the request.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport for what reason his Department did not issue a definitive response to the inspector's report on the A63 Grade Separated Junction proposal from the Highways Agency.  [94426]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30131w05.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The Inspector's Report on the A63 Melton Public Inquiry contained conclusions that supported the Highways Agency's proposals in all respects apart from one element of the Side Roads Order. This related to an alternative proposal for a junction at Corby Park, submitted by East Riding of Yorkshire Council (ERYC). The Inspector concluded that further work should be carried out to check the feasibility of ERYC's alternative. That is why it was not possible for the Secretary of State to issue a definitive response on the outcome of the Public Inquiry.
<P>

<a name="30131w05.html_para2">The Highways Agency is currently working with ERYC to identify the optimum solution and reach agreement on the way forward. It is hoped that an announcement will be made soon.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30131w06.html_spnew4"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 We do not set a maximum value on training allowances paid by the Learning and Skills Council. The minimum training allowance is 40 per week, although even here, local Learning and Skills Councils have discretion to increase this minimum depending on local circumstances, such as wage rates for unskilled employment.

 We have not undertaken any specific research on the relationship between the level of the minimum training allowance and the numbers of young people entering full-time training.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs whether it is her Department's policy <i>(a)</i> to introduce manufacturer/importer declarations on products manufactured outside the European Union stating that an article does not contain and release chemicals restricted in the EU and <i>(b)</i> to increase the use of animal testing in order to produce the test information required by the European Union's chemicals management system REACH; and if she will make a statement.[Transferred]  [87024]<P>

<P>
<a name="30131w06.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The Government supports the overall aim and approach set out in the Commission's White Paper of February 2001 on a Strategy for a Future Chemicals Policy. As part of the process of developing its position in preparation for negotiations on the resultant legislation (expected in 2003) the Government published a Position Statement on 9 December, copies of which have been placed in the Library of the House. This is not a definitive statement of the Government's negotiating position, not least because the Commission has still to publish proposals for legislation. The Statement focuses on the main elements of the system itself and how it might function.




<P>
<P><I>31 Jan 2003 : Column 1069W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="30131w06.html_para1">In negotiating the legislation when it emerges, the Government will have three overarching objectives:
<P>

<a name="30131w06.html_para2">Creating a fast, efficient and workable process of testing, screening and assessing chemical substances to provide the information necessary to control those substances of concern, starting with the most harmful, because of their impacts on human health or the environment;
<P>

<a name="30131w06.html_para3">Keeping animal testing to the minimum necessary to protect human health and the environment; and
<P>

<a name="30131w06.html_para4">Maintaining or enhancing the competitiveness of the chemical industry.
<P>

<a name="30131w06.html_para5">In addition, we also want to see a system that is transparent to all interested parties in its operation and that provides consumers, workers and users of substances with the level of information they require about the substances with which they come into contact.
<P>

<a name="30131w06.html_para6">In practical terms we believe it would be difficult to enforce a requirement where every substance that had gone into the manufacture of an article was registered in accordance with the proposed new regulations. However, it may be possible to place a requirement on importers of articles to make a declaration that the imported article did not contain any labile substance of high concern which was likely to be released.
<P>

<a name="30131w06.html_para7">On animal testing, as stated above, the Government wishes to ensure that vertebrate animal testing is kept to the absolute minimum necessary to provide sufficient information for decision-making on health and environmental protection. For example, one early estimate of the number of extra animal tests necessary to meet the system described in the White Paper came to 12 million, whereas the ideas outlined in the Government's Position Statement would require far fewer (around 1.3 million).

<P>
<a name="30131w06.html_wqn8"><B> Tony Worthington: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what her policy is on the inclusion of a specific objective in the European Commission's Mid-Term Review that CAP reform should work in the interests of poverty reduction and food security.  [87567]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30131w06.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 We estimate that the Common Agricultural Policy costs the average family of four in the United Kingdom between 8 and 9 per week through higher food prices and taxes. We believe reform is necessary to reduce this cost and contribute towards our wider poverty reduction objectives. Similarly, reform of the CAP would assist objectives of poverty reduction in developing countries, by increasing access for their agricultural produce to EU and third country markets.
<P>

<a name="30131w06.html_para9">The CAP was originally introduced in 1962 to address a strategic need for food security in Europe. However, as production responded, surpluses became chronic and required increasingly heavy expenditure. Food security is now less of a policy driver, and we would prefer to see

producers rewarded for delivering public benefits focussed on the environment and wider rural economy, rather than over-production.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30131w06.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. James Wray: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what reform of the Common Agricultural Policy has taken place since 1997; what recent discussions have taken place with European colleagues on this matter; what proposals she has for future reform; and when they will be submitted to the EU.  [93577]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30131w06.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Agenda 2000 reform package, agreed at the March 1999 Berlin European Council, brought EU cereal, milk and beef prices closer to world levels, and gave member states some flexibility to use CAP money for environmental schemes. It represented a significant shift from price support to direct payments and it reduced some of the economic distortions of the CAP, enabling the formulation of an integrated EU rural development policy.
<P>

<a name="30131w06.html_para10">On 22 January 2003 the Commission issued its draft legislative proposals for the 'Mid-term Review' of Agenda 2000. The Government has welcomed these proposals, believing further reform of the CAP to be necessary for both domestic and international reasons. In particular, we were pleased to see formal proposals to break the link between subsidy and production ('decoupling'), which will give producers greater flexibility to exploit market opportunities. However, we also have concerns over some elements of the proposals. For example, the proposed mechanism for transferring funds to support rural development is complex, would be hard to administer and would unfairly impact on larger farms; and we are disappointed at the proposed extension of milk quotas.
<P>

<a name="30131w06.html_para11">The first formal discussion of these proposals took place at the Agriculture and Fisheries Council meeting on 27 and 28 January. Further Council discussions are planned for the coming months. In addition, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State regularly meets her EU counterparts bilaterally to discuss this issue. Since the start of this year she has met both the French and Greek Agriculture Ministers.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what measures are in place to prevent the flooding of properties along the Trent in Nottinghamshire; and what financial provision has been made for flood defence in Nottinghamshire in 2003&#150;04.  [92858]

<P>
<a name="30131w07.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 This Department provides grants for flood and coastal defence capital works, and associated studies, which meet essential technical, economic and environmental criteria and achieve an appropriate priority score Operational responsibility for flood management measures rests with the local operating authorities, normally the Environment Agency (EA) and local councils, who decide which projects to promote and their timing.
<P>

<a name="30131w07.html_para4">I understand that there are approximately 250 km of flood defences along the Trent and its tributaries which have been constructed by the Environment Agency and its predecessors. The Agency spends some &pound;1.5million per year on the maintenance of these flood defence systems.
<P>

<a name="30131w07.html_para5">Defra encourages operating authorities to take a strategic approach to flood and coastal defence problems and to consider the need for schemes and develop proposals within an overall strategy for catchment areas so as not to create problems elsewhere. The Agency has commissioned consultants to prepare a strategy which will inform flood defence options for the River Trent between Stoke-on-Trent and Newark. Defra is providing grant aid for related studies. It is expected that the strategy will be published this Autumn. The Agency then plan to prepare a strategy for the tidal reach of the River between Newark and the Number Estuary. Defra will consider any capital works emerging from these strategies against the criteria above.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30131w07.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 Agricultural waste is currently excluded from waste management controls in Great Britain by section 75(7)<i>(c)</i> of the Environmental Protection Act 1990. No data are therefore held centrally of either the total amount of agricultural waste produced annually in the UK or the amount recycled. The same position applies under Northern Ireland legislation.

 The Department controls the regulation of waste disposal and recovery sites through a licensing system that is set out in legislation.

</FONT></UL>
<a name="30131w08.html_para1">The total amount of grant for each of these groups is unaltered by the application of floors and ceilings. Therefore, lifting the ceiling would not direct more resources to this group. In order to pay for the increased level of the ceiling, either the level of the floor would need to be lowered, or the authorities between the floor and the ceiling would need to contribute more money to help pay for the floor via the scaling factor. The Office

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister if he will impose, as an additional requirement upon the City of London Corporation, as part of the local government grant allocation settlement, provision for the effective removal from forest and other open space land, for which it is responsible, rubbish which has been fly-tipped, obsolete tyres and refrigerators and abandoned cars, from its own resources; and if he will make a statement.  [94518]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30131w08.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 Under section 59 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990, the local authority (or the Environment Agency) has the power to remove fly-tipped waste from private land and to recover the costs of doing so from the perpetrators, where they can be traced. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs is responsible for the policy on fly-tipping. There are no plans to require local authorities to remove fly-tipped waste as such a requirement would provide an incentive for unscrupulous operators to fly-tip waste in the knowledge that it would be removed at no cost to them. Local authorities are already required to remove abandoned vehicles. It would therefore not be appropriate to impose additional requirements on the City.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30131w08.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 Ministers are aware of the difficulties caused by differential take-up rates and that, as a new scheme, the working families tax credit might be particularly affected. They considered, however, that the benefit to the education formula of broadening the measurement of social need considerably outweighed any drawbacks.

 The Foreign Office's travel advice for Saudi Arabia warns British nationals that &quot;Saudi Arabia is one of a number of countries where there is an increased threat to visible British institutions and organisations from global terrorism." It explains that &quot;given the heightened tension in the Middle East region and the increased threat from global terrorism, UK nationals in Saudi Arabia should be vigilant, particularly in public places frequented by foreigners such as hotels, restaurants and shopping malls. Visitors and residents should follow political developments in the region; and observe the British Embassy's advice on personal and vehicle security." The travel advice also alerts British nationals to the recent series of bombings in Riyadh and Al Khobar where British nationals were among the victims.
<P>

<a name="30131w10.html_para5">Our travel advice is kept constantly under review. It is available on the Foreign Office website www.fco.gov.uk and the website for the British Embassy, Riyadh www.ukm.org.sa. The British Embassy in Riyadh also provides regular advice to British residents in Saudi Arabia through its wardens' network.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30131w11.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The criteria for the Capital Modernisation Fund include innovation, the improvements to the efficiency and effectiveness of the service delivered to the end-user, and the need for additional funds to deliver the service above normal departmental allocations. However, as the Fund is limited and is generally considerably oversubscribed, it is necessary to judge bids not just on their own merits, but on their relative priority against other bids.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer pursuant to his answer of 21 January, Official Report, column 246W, how many applications from Scotland were made to the Capital Modernisation Fund in 2001; and how many of those applications were successful in obtaining funds from his Department.  [95161]<P>

 As explained in my Answer of 21 January, the devolved administrations automatically receive a share of allocations made from the Capital Modernisation Fund for devolved matters, calculated according to the Barnett formula.

 The Customs target to release posts from support to activities which directly contribute to PSA/SDA outcomes covers the three years of the SR2000 period. It therefore applies until 31 March 2004. The Spring 2002 Report was based on support activity remaining at around 17 per cent. of total activity, even though additional support posts had been added to baseline to begin implementation of the Department's e-Business programme. An update on the target was provided in the Department's &quot;Annual Report and Accounts" for 2001&#150;02 (Cm5671).

<P>
<P>
<a name="30131w11.html_spnew4"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 Information on past total public expenditure on HM Customs & Excise is in the Department's Annual Reports (specifically&#151;in the Financial Statements until 1998&#150;99, and from 1999&#150;00 in the Departmental Resource Accounts) covering each year 1990&#150;91 to 2001&#150;02. Copies are available in the Library. Planned out-turn for 2002&#150;03 and 2003&#150;04 was published in June 2002 in the Department's Spring Report. High level data for the period through to 2005&#150;06 was published in the 2002 Spending Review White Paper. Prices can be adjusted to 2000&#150;01 levels by applying the GDP deflator, which can be found on the Treasury's website under Economic Data and Tools.

<i>[holding answer 28 January 2003]:</i> Following the decision of the prosecution to offer no evidence in the London City Bond abuse of process hearing in November last year, the Commissioners of Customs & Excise and the Prosecution Group of Customs' Solicitors Office (who are now accountable to the Attorney General) commenced a review of the safety of the convictions in all LCB- connected cases. The decision of the prosecution not to oppose the appeal in the case of R v Grant and others (known as the 'Stockade' case) in the Court of Appeal was the outcome of part of that review.
<P>

<a name="30131w11.html_para0">As I explained to the House in my Statement of 23 January, twenty further cases are being reviewed, and there have been eight in which no evidence was offered against defendants, or in which convictions have been overturned by the Court of Appeal. The cost of instructing Prosecuting Counsel in these eight cases was 4.3m, out of the total prosecution legal costs in all the LCB cases of &pound;7.4million.

 <i>[holding answer 27 January 2003]:</i> The valuation of assets of a financial institution does not affect the level of compensation available under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS). The FSCS can pay compensation when an authorised financial institution is unable, or likely to be unable, to meet the claims against it and the valuation of the assets of the institution may be a relevant factor in the FSCS's decision.

<a name="30131w12.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what the change in real terms in spending on drug and alcohol addiction was over the three years to 2005&#150;06.  [94012]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30131w12.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Bob Ainsworth: </B> 
 Allowing for inflation, the Government's annual planned expenditure on proactively tackling drugs is:
<P>

<a name="30131w12.html_para3">2003&#150;04&#151;&pound;1,216 million: a 19 per cent. increase on the current year;
<P>

<a name="30131w12.html_para4">2004&#150;05&#151;&pound;1,281 million: a 25 per cent. increase on the current year; and
<P>

<a name="30131w12.html_para5">2005&#150;06&#151;&pound;1,383 million: a 35 per cent. increase on the current year.
<P>

<a name="30131w12.html_para6">The majority of the funding for alcohol treatment is spent via the general budgets of primary care trusts and local social service departments, which is consistent with provision being determined following a local consideration of need. This method of funding means that it is not possible to give details of spending on alcohol treatment, but latest estimates indicate that around &pound;95 million is spent each year on treatment in England, and that most of this funding is provided by the Government.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what assessment he has made of the relationship between the budget of individual prisons and the number of educational and vocational qualifications obtained by their inmates.  [94490]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30131w12.html_spnew5"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 From 2001, the core budget for prison education has been ring-fenced and is administered jointly by the Home Office and the Department for Education and Skills, through the Prisoners' Learning and Skills Unit. At the time of ring-fencing, education budgets were historically based, but from 2002&#150;03, part of the education budget has been linked to achievement of basic skills qualifications. We will develop further the links between funding and educational and vocational qualifications as we increase funding for prison education to &pound;125 million by 2005&#150;06. The recent review of prison education funding and procurement also identified opportunities for introducing other relevant achievement measures and we are considering these.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what assessment he has made of the <i>(a)</i> prevalence and <i>(b)</i> causes of occupational stress (i) among prison officers and (ii) in the police.  [93666]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30131w12.html_spnew7"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 The Prison Service carried out an audit into the causes and extent of stress among prison officers and other staff in 2001&#150;02. The audits were conducted at a number of representative prisons and at headquarters. The results suggest that stress is common among prison staff and is due to a wide range of causes. As a result of this work, the Prison Service is developing a policy for preventing stress together with a range of initiatives aimed at supporting those who may be suffering from stress.
<P>

<a name="30131w12.html_para7">Figures for police sickness absence showed an average loss of 11.5 working days per officer in 2001&#150;02 and an average of 12 working days per support staff member. Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary has not previously recorded exact figures on what proportion of that absence relates to stress, although stress and musculo-skeletal disorders are unofficially recognised as the two main contributors.
<P>

<a name="30131w12.html_para8">From April 2003, all forces will have begun measuring sickness absence according to new data collection arrangements. This was released in June last year by the Police Numbers Task Force and will ensure that sickness absence is broken down into categories, including stress-related illness. The new data collection arrangements will enable forces to target the types of sickness absence that have the most effect on them.
<P>

<a name="30131w12.html_para9">There has been much discussion by occupational health professionals both inside and outside the Police Service regarding the causes of stress. As yet there is no one prevailing view on the subject. Some forces have already conducted internal stress audits/and begun to target the causes of stress at local level.

<P>
<a name="30131w13.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Allen: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what recent representations he has received concerning <i>(a)</i> workloads and <i>(b)</i> resources in the Probation Service.  [94486]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30131w13.html_spnew0"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary, through the National Probation Directorate, has received representations as follows:
<P>

<a name="30131w13.html_para0"><i>(a)</i> In respect of workloads, representations were made by the Trade Unions and staff representative bodies which led in January 2001 to a Joint Agreement on Priorities and Employee Care between the Home 



<P>
<P><I>31 Jan 2003 : Column 1092W</I><P>
Office, probation employers, Trade Unions and staff representative bodies. This agreement identified the areas for concern raised by all signatories and a joint framework for improvement. The National Probation Directorate is leading the project to design and implement a Workload Measurement Tool, and has provided a Workload Prioritisation Framework.
<P>

<a name="30131w13.html_para1">The National Association of Probation Officers is undertaking a campaign in respect of workloads which has led to a formal dispute. Local agreements to settle this dispute have now been reached in 34 of the 42 areas of the National Probation Service for England and Wales, and negotiations continue in the remaining eight areas.
<P>

<a name="30131w13.html_para2"><i>(b)</i> In respect of resources, 16 Probation Boards have expressed views about their budget for 2003&#150;04.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30131w13.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Allen: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make a statement on the <i>(a)</i> pay and <i>(b)</i> career development rewards available to probation officers for personal success in reducing re-offending by offenders assigned to them; and what plans he has to change them.  [94492]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30131w13.html_spnew1"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 Probation officers are paid on a range in accordance with a nationally negotiated salary spine as part of the national agreement on pay and conditions of service.
<P>

<a name="30131w13.html_para3"><i>(a)</i> The current salary spine for probation officers is from a minimum of &pound;19,443 to a maximum of &pound;26,226.
<P>

<a name="30131w13.html_para4"><i>(b)</i> Probation officers are eligible for merit increases when they reach the maximum of the pay spine with a current maximum of &pound;28,686.
<P>

<a name="30131w13.html_para5">The National Probation Directorate, in conjunction with the Probation Boards Association and the trade unions representing staff in the National Probation Service (NPS), is currently reviewing the structure of pay and reward for staff in NPS, including probation officers. The objective of this re-evaluation of the current system is to see that the NPS has an appropriate pay and reward strategy that properly rewards staff for high performance and ensures the recruitment and retention of a highly skilled and motivated work force.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department (1) how many travel restriction orders have been made by the courts under the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001;  [91016]
<P>
<UL>(2) how many restraining orders for sexual offenders have been made by the courts pursuant to the provisions of the Criminal Justice and Court Services Act 2000.  [91017]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30131w13.html_spnew2"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 Restraining orders for sexual offenders were introduced on 1 June 2001, but none was reported to the Home Office Court Proceedings Database as having been made in the period to 31December 2001.
<P>

<a name="30131w13.html_para6">The orders were introduced alongside a wide range of other measures. We expect the number of orders to increase as the courts become more familiar with the orders and how they can be applied.




<P>
<P><I>31 Jan 2003 : Column 1093W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="30131w13.html_para7">Travel restriction orders were brought into force on 1 April 2002, and statistics for 2002 are not yet available.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30131w13.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Blunkett: </B> 
 We welcome plans being considered by the police service to strengthen special branch along regional lines. Even closer co-operation between neighbouring special branches will build on and improve effective working relationships.
<P>

<a name="30131w13.html_para9">The form that such re-organisation might take-including whether there is a need for a national co-ordinator of special branch-is currently the subject of discussions within the police service, and between my Department and the police service.
