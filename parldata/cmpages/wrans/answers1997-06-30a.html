To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what has been the expenditure by each police force in each of the last five years for which figures are available devoted to enforcing the Protection of Children Act 1978. [5449]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70630w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 This information is not collected centrally.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70630w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mrs. Ann Winterton: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what has been the expenditure of the National Criminal Intelligence Service in each of the last five years for which figures are available devoted to gathering information on child pornography. [5451]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70630w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 Gathering information on child pornography is only one area of the work of the National Criminal Intelligence Service (NCIS) Paedophile Section and it is not possible to separate expenditure for that purpose from the other activities of the Section. Figures for expenditure by the Paedophile Section, available for the last two years only, are as follows:

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>
<BR>
1995-96: &#163;53,027
<BR>
1996-97: &#163;61,672.

<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="70630w01.html_para0">These figures are based on staff costs and running expenses but exclude costs of accommodation and other central expenditure.
<P>

<a name="70630w01.html_para1">Other units in NCIS, such as Interpol and Europol, also conduct work to combat paedophilia and child pornography, but their expenditure on such activity is not separately recorded.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70630w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Jim Cunningham: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what factors underlie the proposed retention of the part of the primary purpose rules which requires the couple to prove that they intend to live together permanently as husband and wife. [5627]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70630w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The requirement in the Immigration Rules on marriage to which my hon. Friend refers is not part of the primary purpose rule. It is needed to prevent foreign nationals from using sham marriages as a means to obtain settlement here. The primary purpose rule affected genuine marriages.

<a name="70630w01.html_sbhd3"><H4><center>Victim Support</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="70630w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mrs. Brinton: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department (1) what plans he has to review the funding for victim support schemes; [5982]

<P>
<UL>(2) when he plans to make a decision on the provision and funding of a helpline service for all victims of crime.[5984]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70630w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 We regard support for victims of crime as a priority. We have therefore made available immediately an additional &#163;1 million a year for the work of Victim Support, taking their annual grant to &#163;12.7 million. The extra money will enable Victim Support to set up a national helpline for victims of crime, and to develop further the work of their court-based and local support schemes. We shall maintain a continuing dialogue with Victim Support about their programme of work and funding.
<P>
<P>
<a name="70630w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mrs. Brinton: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what representations he has received concerning the feasibility and cost of providing a nationwide victim support service for witnesses in magistrates courts. [5983]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70630w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 We have received a number of representations about the perceived need to improve services for victims, witnesses and other users of magistrates courts, although details have not been collated centrally. A draft final research consultancy report commissioned to assess those needs and to recommend realistic and affordable options for improving support is currently being considered by a standing group of officials from the Government departments and criminal justice agencies with an interest in improving the court/trials process. Victim Support is represented on that group. The group's deliberations should help us to determine priorities for improving services for users of magistrates' courts and how these might best be provided.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70630w01.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Sedgemore: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department in what circumstances plastic baton rounds are used by police in England and Wales. [6116]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70630w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 Police forces in England and Wales hold plastic baton rounds for use as a last resort in dealing with serious public disorder. They may be used where conventional methods of policing have been tried and failed or are unlikely to succeed if tried, and where the chief officer decides such action to be necessary because of the risk of loss of life or serious injury, or of widespread destruction of property where the damage may lead to serious risk of loss of life or serious personal injury. Plastic baton rounds have never been used operationally in England and Wales.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70630w01.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, pursuant to his answer of 25 June, <i>Official Report,</i> column <i>510,</i> on the case of Mr. Patrick Nicholls; what part Mr. Nicholls's insistence that he is innocent has played in the Parole Board's decision; and if he will make a statement. [6132]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70630w01.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Joyce Quin: </B> 
 The reasons given by the Parole Board for their latest decision in Mr. Nicholls's case do not refer to his insistence on his innocence.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70630w01.html_wqn7"><B> Mrs. Brinton: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what plans he has to implement the report of the 1991 working party recommendations to give local authorities a statutory duty to organise plans for community safety. [5985]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70630w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 We intend to place a new responsibility on local authorities and the police service jointly to develop statutory local partnerships for crime prevention and community safety and to agree, with the key partners, local community safety targets. Our proposals will be developed on the basis of full consultation with all interested parties. This will be included in the forthcoming Crime and Disorder Bill.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70630w01.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Green: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department when he will implement the provisions of the Sex Offenders Act 1997. [5974]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70630w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 We plan to implement the Sex Offenders Act 1997 later this year and we are currently working with the police and others on the systems necessary to achieve early implementation.

<a name="70630w01.html_sbhd8"><H4><center>Anti-social Behaviour</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="70630w01.html_wqn9"><B> Caroline Flint: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what measures he is proposing to tackle anti-social behaviour within neighbourhoods. [5492]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70630w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 We intend to introduce Community Safety Orders in the Crime and Disorder Bill.
<P>

<a name="70630w01.html_para2">Courts will be given the power to grant such orders on the application of a local authority or the police. The order will apply to a named individual or individuals and would prevent that person or persons from continuing with specified anti-social conduct.
<P>

<a name="70630w01.html_para3">A breach of the order will be a criminal offence which would carry stiff penalties--including the possibility of imprisonment.

<a name="70630w01.html_sbhd9"><H4><center>Traffic Police</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="70630w01.html_wqn10"><B> Mrs. Dunwoody: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what representations he has received from ACPO about <i>(a)</i> placing traffic duties within the core objectives for chief constables, <i>(b)</i> the establishment of specialised traffic units and <i>(c)</i> the training of traffic officers. [5432]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70630w01.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 In the current review of the key policing objectives for 1998-99, my Department has been advised that there is some support within the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) for a national objective on traffic policing, but I understand that this view is not supported by ACPO as a whole.
<P>

<a name="70630w01.html_para4">Issues concerning the organisation of traffic units within police forces and the training of traffic officers fall within the operational responsibilities of individual chief constables. My Department has not received representations from ACPO about those matters.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70630w01.html_wqn11"><B> Caroline Flint: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what measures he will take to ensure that convicted child sex offenders, during their prison sentence, are not placed on community work programmes which bring them into direct contact with children. [5491]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70630w01.html_spnew11"><B> Ms Joyce Quin: </B> 
 Procedures are already in place to identify prisoners convicted of current or previous offences, including sexual offences, against children and young persons under the age of eighteen. In considering applications for release on temporary licence for work outside the establishment, both the nature of the work and the prisoner's offences are taken into account as part of a mandatory rigorous risk assessment process, which includes consultation with the police and probation services in serious cases. These arrangements are designed to prevent the temporary release of any prisoner considered to pose an undue risk to public safety.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what proportion of the estimated cost savings attributed by his Department to privately managed prisons is accounted for by <i>(a)</i> lower pay and shorter pay scales, <i>(b)</i> longer working hours, <i>(c)</i> less generous pension provision and <i>(d)</i> less generous provision in respect of sick pay and holidays; and which of these policies he proposes to introduce to the publicly managed Prison Service.

 A research report published on 29 October 1996, a copy of which is in the Library, showed that on 1995-96 figures, prisons operated by the private sector are 11-17 per cent. cheaper than comparable prisons operated in the public sector. A further study is now under way, with the co-operation of contractors, to define in more detail how the private sector operators achieve lower operating costs. The work is not yet completed, and I will consider the implications of its findings when I receive the final report.

 The mandate of the Europol Drugs Unit to assist member states in tackling serious trans-national crime was extended to cover illicit trafficking in radioactive and nuclear substances in March 1995. Since then, the Unit has received only a small number of requests from member states for assistance in this area. The Unit has also undertaken strategic work on the threat to the European Union from this form of crime.
<P>

<a name="70630w03.html_para0">The assistance which the Unit will be able to offer member states will be augmented on entry into force of the Europol Convention. A key change will be Europol's ability to pool and analyse intelligence in central databases.

 <i>[holding answer 25 June 1997]:</i> The Government are committed to reducing crime through the enhancement of local partnership arrangements. That is why we intend to create a statutory duty for local authorities and the police service jointly to ensure that the vital work of all key agencies--voluntary and statutory--is brought together locally within a co-ordinated multi-agency framework.
<P>

<a name="70630w03.html_para1">The local community--which includes residents, voluntary organisations and the business community--will be involved in identifying local problems of crime and disorder and together will then draw up and implement plans to tackle those identified local problems.
<P>

<a name="70630w03.html_para2">In this way, everyone's effort will be complementary, mutually supportive and, above all, better focused on local problems.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment if he will list the balance held by each TEC at the end of 1996-97. [4290]<P>

<P>
<a name="70630w03.html_spnew5"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 A list of Training and Enterprise Councils (TECs), their surpluses and accumulated reserves, as shown in their audited annual statutory accounts, at the end of the financial year 1995-96 is shown in the following table. This is the most recent year for which information is available.
<P>

<a name="70630w03.html_para3">TECs are allowed to generate surpluses and create reserves by subcontracting training at a lower unit price than that negotiated with the Department. Surpluses are used by TECs on activities in support of their corporate and business plan objectives which are agreed with the Government.
<P>

<a name="70630w03.html_para4">TECs have provided further information which reports that the total reserves of almost &#163;260 million comprised &#163;51 million for investment in capital assets, &#163;86 million for working capital and &#163;123 million for discretionary expenditure. Of the sum available for discretionary expenditure, TECs report that &#163;102 million was earmarked for planned expenditure in 1996-97 and beyond, for training, enterprise and economic regeneration initiatives.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what criteria he will employ in considering proposed mergers of further education colleges; and if continuity, choice and accessibility of courses will be essential requirements. [5277] <P>

<P>
<a name="70630w04.html_spnew3"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend will normally consider proposed mergers on the basis of a formal proposal from the Further Education Funding Council for England. The Council assesses proposals against criteria which include the benefits to existing and future students in terms of access and choice. It is also a statutory requirement, contained in S.I. 1992 No. 2361, that public notices in respect of proposals shall include the educational provision to be made for those students who have not completed their courses at the time of the merger.

<a name="70630w04.html_spnew4"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend expects the further education sector to continue to be funded by the Further Education Funding Council for England and for colleges to continue to be governed as independent institutions. In areas served by a number of colleges, he would welcome greater collaboration between them.

Our aim is a high and stable level of employment, to be achieved by running a successful low inflation economy, with macro-economic stability as a platform for sustainable growth, and by enhancing skills and improving the operation of the labour market to open up job opportunities to all groups in society--men and women, young and old.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70630w05.html_spnew5"><B> Mrs. Beckett: </B> 
 I am announcing today an inter-departmental review of the regulation of the utility industries. My aim is for the review to report to Ministers by the end of the year.
<P>

<a name="70630w05.html_para2">The Government's objective for the review is to set a long-term stable framework for utility regulation which is seen as fair by all the interest groups involved, particularly by consumers. Without fairness, there can be no long-term stability. We want the regulatory framework to deliver value, quality and choice to consumers while providing incentives to managers to innovate and improve efficiency. The guiding principles must be transparency, consistency and predictability of regulation.
<P>

<a name="70630w05.html_para3">The terms of reference for the review are to consider whether changes are required to the system of regulation of the utility industries in order to ensure open and predictable regulation, fair to all consumers and to shareholders, and which promotes the Government's objectives for the environment and sustainable development, whilst providing sufficient incentives to managers to innovate, raise standards and improve efficiency.
<P>

<a name="70630w05.html_para4">The review will concentrate on the regulation of gas, electricity, telecommunications and water in the context of the development of competition in the regulated markets, and against the background of general competition law, where we will be legislating in the autumn. It will also consider whether there are lessons to 



<P>
<P><I>30 Jun 1997 : Column: 21</I><P>
be learnt from this and other regulatory experience, to inform the development of regulatory principles of general applicability.
<P>

<a name="70630w05.html_para5">In short it is time to take stock to see how the existing framework can be updated, modernised and refreshed.
<P>

<a name="70630w05.html_para6">Arms length independence of regulators will be preserved, although after 13 years we need to ensure that the balance between Ministers and regulators is correct. Also, while the review will be examining the formula for determining prices, it will not consider rate of return regulation.
<P>

<a name="70630w05.html_para7">There has been extensive consideration of utility regulation issues. The review will take this into account, together with the conclusions and recommendations recently made to the Public Accounts Committee, the Trade and Industry Select Committee, and the UK Round Table on Sustainable Development. This work has already identified many of the key issues, and provides a helpful and well developed starting point for the review. Any further representations to the review may be made in writing by 5 September.
<P>

<a name="70630w05.html_para8">Ministers will consider advice emerging from the review in the autumn. If changes are contemplated, the Government will consult fully then.

To ask the Prime Minister, pursuant to his oral statement of 24 June, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 671-73, concerning the main issues at the next G7 conference, if he will consider adding to the crime agenda the problems of child pornography and paedophile activity and their international dimension.

 During my statement on 24 June, <i>Official Report</i>, column 684, I said that we would look at the evidence that paedophilia and pornography was being organised across national boundaries. We will certainly consider the problem in that context in the preparations for the Birmingham Summit. It is important that we use every opportunity to co-operate in tackling international crime.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what plans he has to reform the GP fundholding arrangements. [4286]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70630w07.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Milburn: </B> 
 We mean to work with all in the National Health Service, including fundholders, to develop new arrangements for primary care led commissioning which best meet our objectives of providing equal access to high quality care to all, on the basis of need, cutting out inefficiency and bureaucracy.
<P>

<a name="70630w07.html_para1">To create time for this, entrance to fundholding has been made biennial, deferring entry to the 8th fundholding wave until July 1999. We have also taken steps to reduce bureaucracy and tackle the financial advantages of fundholders, ensuring that the patients of non-fundholders are no longer disadvantaged.
<P>

<a name="70630w07.html_para2">For the future, we shall wish to draw on good practice from the range of existing models of General Practitioner activity in this field. We are also mounting a programme of pilot projects for GP commissioning groups, to complement existing models and explore new approaches to meeting our objectives.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health how he plans to ensure <i>(a)</i> that GP fundholding budgets are spent, <i>(b)</i> that such expenditure is clearly focused on patient care and <i>(c)</i> that underspends are either properly planned and sanctioned or recouped. [5283]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70630w07.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Milburn: </B> 
 We have made it clear, in EL(97)33, that savings which arise from one-off windfalls or from random dips in demand should be returned to the Health Authority or held against future budget pressures. It is for fundholders and Health Authorities to work together to determine the underspend value which falls into these categories.
<P>

<a name="70630w07.html_para3">The application of fundholders' budgets is governed by regulations. These provide that budgets may be used in year only for patient care and the management of the practice; and that audited savings may be used for the same purposes or for a range of additional specified purposes, namely improvements or extensions to premises; material or equipment for healthcare, management or health education; clinical audit; research and development; and training.
<P>

<a name="70630w07.html_para4">Fundholders' proposals to use savings are set out in their annual practice plans, and those for the additional purposes are dependent on Health Authority agreement that they represent value for money and will benefit patients. Savings must be applied within 4 years or they revert to the Health Authority.

<P>
<a name="70630w08.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 The formula for distributing the Drug Misuse Special Allocation changed in April 1997. Prior to the current financial year the formula for central allocation was based on that used by the former regional health authorities. From this year, the formula is based on the health authority population aged 15-44, and a further element based on an indicator of need for drug misuse services. The new formula is being phased in over four years, with health authorities receiving their full target allocation from 2001.
<P>

<a name="70630w08.html_para3">The Special Allocation for drug misuse nationally has risen by over 9 per cent. in real terms in 1997-98, and the allocation to Salford and Trafford has increased by around 5 per cent. in real terms.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will lower the minimum value of Premium Bond purchases to facilitate regular purchases on behalf of children. [3739]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70630w08.html_spnew5"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 The Government regrets that it is not possible to lower the minimum values premium bond purchase. Small purchases of Premium Bonds are disproportionately expensive to administer. National Savings are not in a position to reduce the &#163;100 minimum purchase when, like other Agencies and departments, they must achieve economies in running costs as part of the process of controlling public expenditure.
<P>

<a name="70630w08.html_para5">Since the return on Premium Bonds takes account of management costs, the relatively higher cost of small purchases would also mean that any reduction in the minimum purchase would reduce the return to holders in general.
<P>

<a name="70630w08.html_para6">National Savings do recognise the need to offer savings opportunities for smaller investments and savings on behalf of children. These include tax-free Children's Bonus Bonds, which can be bought by anyone over the age of 16 for anyone under 16 in units of &#163;25, up to a maximum holding of &#163;1,000 for each issue of the bonds.

 Proceeds from the National Lottery are held in the National Lottery Distribution Fund (NLDF) and invested by the National Debt Commissioners until required by the eleven distributing bodies. The balance in the NLDF at 31 May 1997 was &#163;2,825,835,638. Investment returns received from the start of the National

Lottery to 31 May 1997 total &#163;239,291,980. This interest is split between the distributors in line with the proportion of the NLDF attributable to each of them.
<P>

<a name="70630w09.html_para2">At 31 May, &#163;3.47 billion had been raised by the Lottery for the good causes and this was matched by awards totalling &#163;3.46 billion. The funds in the NLDF are therefore committed to projects that will be developed over the next few years. The majority of these projects will be completed before 2000-2001, but a few will require funding beyond that date.
<P>

<a name="70630w09.html_para3">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State will be publishing a White Paper next month setting out the Government's proposals to deliver our commitments to widen access to the benefits of Lottery, introduce a more strategic and co-ordinated approach to distribution of proceeds and ensure that as much money as possible goes to the good causes.

Parliamentary Question No. 5141
<BR>
The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland has asked me as Chief Executive of the Training and Employment Agency to reply to your question regarding the costs of implementing proposals to deal with long-term unemployment.
<BR>
In the current financial year the Agency will be spending over &#163;37 million to assist people unemployed for at least a year, back to work through the Action for Community Employment programme, the pilot Community Work Programme and Enterprise Ulster. These three measures provide over 6,700 places for the long-term unemployed.

In order to ensure the most effective and efficient use of existing resources the Agency is currently engaged in a review of its measures. The results of the initial stages of the review, which involved a public consultation process, are currently being assessed. Our work is continuing within the wider context of the Government's Welfare to Work proposals and the priority attached to them.
<BR>
With regard to projected costs, we are of course currently committed to plan within the limits set by the 1996 Public Expenditure Survey.

Parliamentary Question No. 5139
<BR>
The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland has asked me, as Chief Executive of the Training and Employment Agency, to reply to your question about the measures available for unemployed people seeking training and retraining.
<BR>
The Agency administers a broad range of programmes to assist the unemployed who are seeking training or retraining. These are:
<BR>
<i>Jobskills Programme</i>
<BR>
Jobskills is an integrated programme which provides high quality NVQ based training to unemployed persons aged between 16 and 59. There are approximately 15,000 places available during 1997/98.
<BR>
Young people aged 16 and 17 are guaranteed a Jobskills training place. Places are available also for adults seeking training or retraining.




<P>
</UL></FONT><P><I>30 Jun 1997 : Column: 43</I><P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>
<BR>
<i>Training Centre Network</i>
<BR>
The Agency's network of Training Centres provides for young people and adults full-time training and re-training leading to NVQ level 2 in a chosen skill or trade. On completion of the training, which usually lasts for 12 months, trainees are normally placed with employers to continue their training towards the achievement of NVQ level 3 under the guidance of Training Centre staff. The Centre also provides tailored pre-employment training in connection with new inward investment projects, usually for a period of 6-10 weeks, to enable unemployed people to improve their prospects of getting a job.
<BR>
<i>Open Learning Centres</i>
<BR>
The Agency also supports the work of 12 Open Learning Access Centres which provide flexible job-related training for those for whom traditional forms of education and training are inappropriate. The main client groups for these Centres are the unemployed, women returning to the labour market and those with disabilities.
<BR>
<i>Enterprise Ulster</i>
<BR>
Enterprise Ulster is a statutory organisation which provides employment, training and work experience for adults, particularly 18-25 year olds, who have been unemployed for more than three months. Its programmes include training in projects of an environmental and amenity nature. Enterprise Ulster provides an average of 1,260 places each year.
<BR>
<i>Community Work Programme</i>
<BR>
The Community Work Programme offers long-term unemployed adults employment and training placements of up to three years duration in worthwhile and meaningful work of community benefit. It has been operated on a pilot basis since 1995 and provides 1,000 places which have been filled.
<BR>
<i>Action for Community Employment</i>
<BR>
The Action for Community Employment (ACE) programme provides temporary employment, with training, of up to one year's duration for long-term unemployed adults in projects of community benefit. The essential purpose of the scheme is to enable participants to complete more effectively for available jobs. ACE employees differ from participants on other Agency programmes in that they are treated as being in paid employment and receive a wage based on the local rate for the job. ACE is providing an average of 5,200 places during 1997/98.
<BR>
<i>Bridge to Employment Pilot</i>
<BR>
The Agency, with support from the EU Special Programme for Peace and Reconciliation, is piloting a Bridge to Employment programme under which long-term unemployed adults and those in

Typical training would be for a period of up to 13 weeks to a specification agreed with participating employers.
<BR>
<i>Management Development</i>
<BR>
The Agency provides programmes aimed at developing management skills and competencies in recently qualified graduates. Almost 400 places are available in 1997/98.
<BR>
<i>New Horizons</i>
<BR>
New Horizons provides retraining for experienced managers who have been made redundant. The programme provides 36 places.
<BR>
I hope you find this information helpful.

Nevertheless, during the course of his inspection he satisfied himself that all weapons are tested prior to being taken into use and in the event of a complaint being received as a result of an incident involving the use of a baton gun, the weapon is tested to assess the accuracy of its sighting system and to assess that it functions correctly.

 The results of the 1996 EHCS will be widely disseminated. We shall consider arrangements for consultation with those bodies which have an interest in housing conditions when these results are published.
<P>

<a name="70630w12.html_para1">The first report of the 1996 EHCS, to be published later this year, will show the number of dwellings that were, at the time of the survey, unfit under the current housing fitness standard, and those that were in other respects inadequate. The report will also identify the occupants of poor housing, in terms of their age, income, and other characteristics. Some information on the health of occupants was recorded during the course of the survey and the analysis of this information will be included in future reports.
<P>

<a name="70630w12.html_para2">There are no plans to include an estimate of the cost to the NHS of people living in unfit dwellings in any report of the 1996 EHCS.

 The reviews conducted by the Building Research Establishment of <i>Building regulation and health</i> and <i>Building regulation and safety</i>, published in 1995, and <i>Building regulation and fire safety</i>, to be published later this year, give an indication of the relative risks to health and safety of dampness, inadequate fire precautions, poor indoor air quality and radon, hazardous internal design features and cold homes.

<a name="70630w14.html_spnew0"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 Major changes to the scheme come into force on 1 July and I want to monitor their performance. Accordingly, I have set two targets for the current year: the payment of 400,000 grants, and, for each grant, the achievement of an average energy efficiency improvement of 5 points as measured by the mean Standard Assessment Procedure (SAP). The changes were made by the previous administration, and it is now not practicable to stop their coming into effect on 1 July. But I shall take an early opportunity to review the scheme in order to check that it is meeting the needs of customers.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70630w15.html_spnew9"><B> Dr. Reid: </B> 
 As my noble Friend the Minister of State for Defence Procurement has said in another place, what is now known about the use of organophosphate (OP) pesticides during the Gulf War was described in the organophosphate pesticides investigation team report which was published last December. Some of the tents used by British troops were sprayed whilst in theatre with organophosphate-based residual insecticide, which was applied to the outside surfaces. The investigation found no evidence that any clothing, bedding or personal kit was treated with organophosphate-based products, although there exists the possibility that some clothing was contaminated whilst being worn by those using such products for other purposes.
<P>

<a name="70630w15.html_para5">Many of the tents used by British troops during the Gulf war were subsequently burned or buried in theatre because it was generally thought not to be cost-effective to ship such material back to the UK or Germany. It is not now possible to identify those tents which were brought back from the Gulf; some of them are likely to have been retained by units or at depots, while some others will probably have since been sold as surplus stock.
<P>

<a name="70630w15.html_para6">The amount of OP pesticide remaining on a treated surface reduces over time, which is why regular re-application is normally necessary to maintain its effectiveness. Beyond this initial period of effectiveness, those traces of OP pesticide that remain break down naturally through exposure to air and water and normally disappear completely over a period of years. The break down process may be delayed if the compounds are used on material that has been treated with a wax finish, as was the case for tents which were used in the Gulf. However, any traces of OP pesticide that remain on a surface after the initial period of effectiveness would be in small and ever decreasing quantities, which would be unlikely to cause a risk to human health.
<P>

<a name="70630w15.html_para7">Nevertheless, the specific tents which were reported as being a source of illness have been identified by the Scout Association and, at their request, my Department has made arrangements for appropriate tests to be carried out by the Laboratory of the Government Chemist. The results of these tests will be made public as soon as possible.

The Secretary of State for Defence has asked me to reply to your Question about the supply of beef to the Armed Forces stationed in the United Kingdom.
<BR>
The task of procuring food for the Army, Royal Air Force and Royal Navy is contracted to the Navy, Army and Air Force Institutes (NAAFI). We do not specify the source of origin from which NAAFI should obtain beef (or any other meat), but expect them to seek the best market price for the product. British meat products are considered equally with all others available on the open market. A range of products including sirloin, forerib, minced and diced beef are normally sourced in the UK. However the Armed Forces' requirement is mainly for frozen products and the majority of beef joints are sourced, on cost grounds, from Brazil, Uruguay, Argentina, New Zealand and Australia.

<i>Letter from John Chisholm to Mr. Tam Dalyell, dated 30 June 1997</i>:<i></i>

<P>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>
<BR>
I have been asked to reply to your question about the exclusion of representatives of the UK Lockerbie Families group from the recent explosive tests at Bruntingthorpe since, as Chief Executive of the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency (DERA) which undertook the tests, this matter is my responsibility.
<BR>
The research being carried out by DERA is on behalf of the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) and the United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and is aimed at exploring what physical effects would result from an explosion in an aircraft at altitude and subsequently what measures might be introduced to contain those effects and limit the structural damage to the aircraft. It was those measures that were being tested in the trial.
<BR>
Although the media were allowed to cover the event, both DERA and its customers were concerned to ensure that the trial was reported factually as part of a disciplined and ongoing programme of scientific work. To that end DERA agreed to requests from its customers to make it a condition of entry to the site by media crews that they should not be accompanied by other parties who might seek to broaden the coverage into areas not directly concerned with the trial itself. This condition was enforced rigidly and therefore included representatives of the UK Lockerbie Families group. In fact, before the event, several television companies requested that Dr Jim Swire of the 'UK Families-Flight 103' group be allowed to accompany them to watch the trial and were informed that this would not be possible.
<BR>
The position taken over the trial does not indicate any lack of compassion for the victims and families involved in the Lockerbie disaster. Indeed it is precisely the scale of that tragedy that has prompted the research programme which culminated in the trial at Bruntingthorpe and which, we hope, will eventually bring real benefit to aircraft safety.
