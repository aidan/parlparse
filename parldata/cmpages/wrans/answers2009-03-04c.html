 The Scottish Parliament and the National Assembly for Wales operate systems of allowances and governance that differ from those that apply in the House of Commons. In the case of the provision of information, the Scottish Parliament is subject to separate access to information legislation and associated scrutiny. In reaching its own decisions in relation both to the administration of Members' allowances and publication of information about them the Members Estimate Committee has drawn on a range of sources including the other UK legislatures and Assemblies. For example the Committee drew extensively on the experience of the Scottish Parliament in its Review of Allowances (HC 578) published in June 2008.</p>

<i> [holding answer 27 January 2009]:</i> On 24 November 2008, the Chancellor announced in the pre-Budget report that because of the exceptional circumstances in the economy and the housing market, the Government would maintain, for six months, the level of support for mortgage interest based on a standard interest rate of 6.08 per cent.</p>

our IT systems that are used to assess and pay DWP benefits had started automatically to implement the 1.5 per cent. reduction in the base rate announced by the Bank of England on 6 November.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_351"><a name="90304w0007.htm_para5"><a name="09030483000506">We were able to re-adjust the rate back to 6.08 per cent. for people getting income-based jobseeker's allowance and income-related employment and support allowance. This amounted to 5 per cent. of the affected cases.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_352"><a name="90304w0007.htm_para6"><a name="09030483000507">We could not do so for those getting income support and pension credit without a high risk of disrupting the normal running of our IT systems, most critically the uprating of benefits, which would have affected many more people than just those getting support for mortgage interest.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_353"><a name="90304w0007.htm_para7"><a name="09030483000508">We estimate that 80,000 income support customers and 115,000 pension credit customers receive support for mortgage interest and these are currently being paid at 4.58 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_354"><a name="90304w0007.htm_para8"><a name="09030483000509">We are taking urgent action to ensure that these customers do not lose out, and that cases are corrected to reflect the Chancellor's commitment. I can assure the House that no one is being paid support for mortgage at an interest rate below 4.58 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_355"><a name="90304w0007.htm_para9"><a name="09030483000510">In total, departmental expenditure on support for mortgage interest is currently being underpaid at &#163;1.5 million per week. In the vast majority of cases, we transfer customers' support for mortgage interest direct to their lender, so the customer will not see a fall in the amount of money they themselves receive each week. However, we estimate that, on average, support for mortgage interest in respect of pension credit customers will have been underpaid by &#163;7 per week and in respect of income support customers by &#163;11 per week.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_356"><a name="90304w0007.htm_para10"><a name="09030483000511">We will make a corrective adjustment for a period of five weeks from 2 February to 8 March 2009. During this period, customers will receive an increase in their benefit to compensate them for the earlier reduction. Then, from 9 March benefit will be readjusted to the correct level with the standard interest rate set at 6.08 per cent.</p>

The 1961 and 1971 conventions form the basis of drug control in the UK and are given effect through the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971.

As a result of this a feasibility study on assessing the effectiveness of HDC was commissioned to the London School of Economics and research using existing administrative data has now been conducted. Publication of the report is expected by mid-2009.</p>

However this was not determined to prove that HDC reduced re-offending but that the risk assessment process was effective. The results of the most recent research mentioned above will provide an important contribution to our knowledge of the impact of HDC.</p>

<i>  [holding answer 3 March 2009]:</i> I welcome the additional technical assessment reports that have been commissioned by local councils in the locations of the shortlisted eco-towns, including Middle Quinton. Together with the consultation documents, which I published on 4 November 2008, and the financial viability study, which I expect to publish shortly, these reports and similar material in other localities will help to inform the responses of local councils, and others to the second stage consultation. This will provide us with a good base upon which to make our decisions on those locations with potential to be an eco-town and which should be included in the Eco-towns Planning Policy Statement. We have also extended the consultation deadline until 30 April to ensure that all parties, irrespective of their views, are given the full opportunity to have their say.</p>

 In June 2008 the UK Government launched &#147;Achieving Universal Access&#148; the UK&#146;s strategy for halting and reversing the spread of HIV in the developing world. This reaffirms the UK&#146;s global leadership on AIDS, including through a commitment to spend &#163;6 billion over seven years to 2015 to strengthen health systems and services. This is in addition to the UK Government&#146;s long-term commitments of &#163;1 billion (2007-15) to the Global Fund to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria.</p>

 Because the UK&#146;s gas consumption needs are met by domestic production, imports (net of exports) and changes in gas stocks it is not possible to identify the exact proportion of domestic production physically consumed in the UK. Given the complexities a simplified measure is shown in the following table. This shows the UK&#146;s dependence on imported gas over 15 years to 2008. A negative net import figure means the UK was a net exporter of gas. The final column shows that between the years 1996 and 2003 (inclusive) the UK was self-sufficient in gas.</p>

 Russia's decision to stem European gas supply had no direct impact on gas supply in the UK as the UK is estimated to receive less than 2 per cent. of its gas from Russia. However, the shortage of gas supplies to the continent was likely to have been the reason for the exports of gas from the UK to Europe through the Interconnector of, on average, 35 million cubic metres per day, in response to price signals. This was at a time of year when the UK would normally be importing through the Interconnector. The UK's diverse sources of gas supplies helped to ensure that gas supply in the UK continued to meet demand, which was high due to cold weather conditions prevailing at the time.</p>

 UK consumption of any gas sourced via the Ukraine (be it Russian or Ukrainian in origin) is negligible. Ukraine consumes its own domestic gas production with minute exports, but does act as a transit country for Russian gas entering the EU. There are only two routes to the UK for gas via the Ukraine. These are the Balgzand-Bacton pipeline from the Netherlands and the Bacton-Zeebrugge pipeline with Belgium. The physical origins of the gas through these pipelines are not available. It is possible that a very small amount of gas via the Ukraine finds its way across continental Europe to the UK, but given the gas pipeline infrastructure it is believed that most of the gas from the Netherlands is sourced from the Dutch sector of the North sea, and that most of the gas from Belgium is sourced from Norway via Zeepipe (which terminates at Zeebrugge).</p>

 The strategic siting assessment is a process for identifying and assessing sites which are strategically suitable for the deployment of new nuclear power stations by the end of 2025. The Government believes that it is important to focus on sites which can come on stream in good time to contribute to our goals on climate change and energy security. 2025 provides sufficient focus to facilitate the achievement of these goals whilst avoiding an unnecessarily long list of potential sites which may not come on stream for some years.

We also want to make sure that IRENA works closely with, and avoids overlap and duplication with, other international bodies and organisations, such as the International Energy Agency (IEA) and the renewable energy and energy efficiency partnership (REEEP). The IEA has a good understanding of the potential for renewable energy and its technology roadmaps published in its Energy Technologies Perspectives 2008 set out what needs to be done. The policy and analytical expertise of the IEA needs to be used by IRENA to accelerate deployment of renewable sources of energy.</p>

2. Between the financial years 2004-05 and 2006-07 Ofsted established a new regional structure, rationalising the support for inspections within three regional offices. These changes led to substantial reduction in the cost of inspection and regulation activity.<br>
3. Since April 2007, Ofsted has had responsibility for the inspection and regulation of care for children and young people, and the inspection of education and training for learners of all ages. Consequently, total funding and gross costs increased sharply.<br>

 The Government do not collect these data. Local authorities have a duty to secure access to positive activities for young people. Statutory guidance produced in relation to this duty sets out how local authorities and their partners should consider whether transport is a barrier to young people's access to positive activities, taking into account local circumstances. We also made a commitment in Aiming High for Young People: a 10-year strategy for positive activities (DCSF July 2007) to produce guidance for children's trusts and transport planners to encourage joined up planning and commissioning of local transport for young people. This guidance will be published in the spring and showcases a range of innovative transport solutions to accessing positive activities developed by local authorities and their partners.</p>

<i> [holding answer 2 March 2009]:</i> The Government are taking forward a package of measures to maintain the universal postal service and to secure the future of Royal Mail. These include Royal Mail entering into a strategic partnership with an experienced  postal or network operator. Partnership is not simply about giving Royal Mail access to capital. A partner will deliver corporate experience of major transformation of a network business at all levels of the business. This will reduce the current risks to a successful modernisation of the company and accelerate the company&#146;s response to changes in the communications market.</p>

The report highlighted the benefits of the scheme, such as the impact of PNDs on young people&#146;s behaviour and savings in police time. Some of the police forces involved in the pilots are continuing to use PNDs because they consider them an effective tool for dealing with certain offences by this age group. The evaluation report also suggests improvements that could be made to the administration of the scheme. We are discussing the learning from the report with key stakeholders.</p>

These standards require EROs to provide information on their use of the databases available to them.

To this end, we have recently tabled amendments to the Political Parties and Elections Bill that will allow the Secretary of State to pilot data matching schemes, under which public authorities will provide registration officers with information to assist them in maintaining an accurate and comprehensive register. In addition, we plan to introduce secondary legislation to enable EROs in areas where there are two-tiers of local government to access data held by the higher tier to help them identify individuals who are not registered to vote. This will mirror arrangements in place for EROs in single tier areas.</p>

 As my hon. Friend, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Justice (Bridget Prentice) explained in answer to a similar question from the hon. Member on 18 June 2008, (Official Report, columns 999-1000W), funding for electoral registration activities such as advertising is included in the local authority formula grant issued by central Government. Once these funds are allocated, decisions on how they are utilised are a matter for the local authorities concerned. It is not known how much was spent in total or per elector for electoral registration in each local authority area, as these figures are not collected, and therefore no rankings are available. There has been no recent UK-wide assessment of the trends in the annual expenditure of local authority electoral registration officers. However, as part of its work in developing Performance Standards for electoral services, the Electoral Commission launched a financial information survey across Great Britain on 10 September 2007. Electoral Registration Officers and Returning Officers were asked to complete the survey and return it by 31 July 2008. The Commission is currently analysing this information in conjunction with CIPFA (the Chartered Institute of Public Finance Accountants) and will publish results in due course.</p>
