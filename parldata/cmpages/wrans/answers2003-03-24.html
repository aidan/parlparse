To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs when officials from her Department last visited Happisburgh, Norfolk to assess the risks of coastal erosion.  [103776]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30324w01.html_spnew0"><B> Margaret Beckett: </B> 
 Responsibility for assessing the risks of coastal erosion at Happisburgh rests with North Norfolk district council. While DEFRA has provided funding for related studies, it has not been necessary or appropriate for officials to visit for this purpose.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30324w01.html_wqn2"><B> Norman Baker: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment she has made of the effectiveness of existing eco-labelling; and what her policy on it is.  [103827]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30324w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Meacher  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 19 March 2003]:</i> The Government asked the Advisory Committee on Consumer Products and the Environment (ACCPE) to look at environmental labelling as one of its first tasks when it was set up in 1999. Two studies were commissioned to look at the effectiveness of different labelling approaches&#151;these were "Environmental Labelling of Consumer Products: Lessons for the UK market from existing schemes" (carried out by Ernst & Young and Atlantic Consulting) and an in-depth study of the innovative "TerraChoice" scheme in Canada (carried out by the IEMA and BSI).
<P>

<a name="30324w01.html_para0">ACCPE's recommendations on this subject were included in its first report, "Choosing Green" (available on the Department's website). The Committee concluded that it would not be worthwhile setting up a national ecolabelling award scheme for the UK, alongside the existing EU ecolabelling scheme. They considered that the Government should focus its labelling "award" efforts on the EU scheme, but should also develop other approaches for improving the environmental information on products. The other approaches recommended included promoting awareness of the various good quality labelling schemes on the market; raising the standard of self-declared 'green claims' by business; and making full use of the internet. The 



<P>
<P><I>24 Mar 2003 : Column 2W</I><P>
Government accepted the advice of the Committee and have been following up the detail of these recommendations.
<P>

<a name="30324w01.html_para1">Our policy recognises that environmental labelling has a significant part to play in raising consumers' awareness of the environmental impacts of products and in helping them to make informed choices. We have actively supported the EU ecolabelling scheme (having invested over &#163;5 million to date in running and promoting it) and are committed to improving it as a market instrument. We have also actively supported the EU energy label and its extension to an increasing range of products in the single market, as well as looking at the scope for using it in other applications in the UK market, for example on cars and homes.
<P>

<a name="30324w01.html_para2">We are also keen to promote awareness of other reliable labelling schemes which target a specific issue or sector, such as the FSC label for sustainable timber and comparative labels for the VOC content of paints. Our consumer information leaflet "Hi I'm Green" contains information about these and other common labels, and a new pocket-sized "shopper's guide" to green labels will be published soon.
<P>

<a name="30324w01.html_para3">The Government are also working to improve the quality and quantity of self-declared environmental claims. These are a major source of information for consumers about the environmental impacts of products, so it is important that such claims are clear and helpful. We continue to promote the "Green Claims Code", which advises businesses on good practice in making green claims, and more detailed guidance is now being prepared in consultation with the relevant business sectors.
<P>

<a name="30324w01.html_para4">We are also exploring some more novel approaches to information for purchasers. One of ACCPE's recommendations was for a new Internet information service, perhaps targeted initially on public procurement, and proposals for this are being developed.

<a name="30324w01.html_sbhd3"><H3 align=center>Eggs (Compulsory Marking)</H3>


<P>
<P>
<a name="30324w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Lidington: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what her policy is on the penalties that should be applied to egg producers in breach of the EU's planned rules on compulsory marking.  [103761]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30324w01.html_spnew3"><B> Margaret Beckett: </B> 
 As far as possible, the relevant enforcement bodies seeks to encourage compliance with the egg marketing legislation through good communication and advice. In common with other aspects of the rules, where a minor discrepancy is discovered, producers will be given guidance on how to comply, and a reminder may be included on the inspection report. In more serious cases, Notices of Contravention will be served requiring compliance before the product can be marketed. Prosecution is normally only considered where serious breaches are found, or where there has been non co-operation in putting things right. In the event of a prosecution, the level of penalty is a matter for the court to decide but the maximum penalty for breaches of the egg marketing regulations is &#163;5,000 per offence.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30324w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Lidington: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs pursuant to her answer of 25 February 2003, <i>Official Report,</i> column 455W, on egg marking, what assessment she has made of the costs to small egg producers of complying with the new rules on marking.  [103740]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30324w01.html_spnew4"><B> Margaret Beckett: </B> 
 Compliance costs will vary considerably depending on producers' individual circumstances. For producers selling their own ungraded eggs direct to consumers, there will be no additional costs as they fall outside the scope of these rules. Similarly, producers selling eggs through larger registered packing stations will be unaffected as the marking will take place at the packing station. For those producers who package eggs on farm for subsequent marketing, the cost will depend on the size of throughput and the degree of sophistication of the stamping equipment. For very small producers, a hand stamp can be purchased for a few pounds, and the time costs should be minimal. For larger producers, the cost of automated stamping machinery starts at between &#163;2,000 and &#163;3,000.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30324w01.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Lidington: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs whether it is her policy to introduce the compulsory marking of eggs from birds other than hens.  [103759]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30324w01.html_spnew5"><B> Margaret Beckett: </B> 
 At present there are no plans at either EU or UK level to seek to introduce the compulsory marking of eggs from birds other than hens.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30324w01.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Chaytor: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (1) if she will place the issue of cetacean bycatch on the agenda of the next meeting of the Council of Fisheries Ministers; and if she will make a statement;  [102823]
<P>
<UL>(2) if she will make it her policy to secure international agreement to reduce incidental cetacean bycatch in European waters by the winter of 2004&#150;05; and if she will make a statement.  [102824]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30324w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 I am determined to make progress to reduce cetacean bycatch. However, effective action to address the problem needs to be taken on the part of all member states involved in the fisheries concerned and the Commission. This is why we raised the need for urgent action to address the issue of cetacean bycatch at the January Council of Ministers' meeting. I have also raised this issue with Commissioner Fischler on a number of occasions both in writing and in personal contacts. I have also recently written to the Commission to press for urgent action to widen observer coverage off the south west coast where a number of other member states' vessels fish. I was pleased that the Commission included a commitment to take action in this area in papers produced as part of the recent reform of the Common Fisheries Policy. I am now looking for positive action in advance of 2004&#150;05 in response to our recent approaches.
<P>

<a name="30324w01.html_para5">In the meantime, DERA has also committed some &#163;140,000 for trials into the use of exclusion devices developed by the Sea Mammal Research Unit (SMRU) to reduce the bycatch of cetaceans in the offshore bass fishery. I will also, along with the devolved 



<P>
<P><I>24 Mar 2003 : Column 4W</I><P>
administrations, shortly be issuing a consultation document outlining a UK bycatch response strategy. This will set out the extent of our knowledge of bycatch in UK waters and make proposals for action to address the bycatch problem. The document will be placed in the Library of the House and I will ensure that my hon. Friend receives a personal copy.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (1) what control the GM Debate Steering Board will have over the Food Standards Agency's GM public debate;  [100866]
<P>
<UL>(2) how the Food Standards Agency's GM public debate will contribute to the Government's GM public debate.  [100862]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30324w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The Food Standards Agency is organising a number of activities as a contribution to the wider GM Public Dialogue announced by the Secretary of State last July. The Agency is an independent body and has taken this action on its own initiative in coordination with the GM dialogue. The Agency will continue to update the Public Debate Steering Board on its activities and provide it with a copy of its findings, which will feed into the wider GM Public Debate.

<a name="30324w02.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Rosindell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what recent discussions she has had with horse welfare groups in the United Kingdom.  [104244]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30324w02.html_spnew0"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 I have regular contact, directly and through officials, with representatives of horse industry organisations. I have discussed horse welfare issues most recently with the RSPCA and with the British Horse Society which represents horse industry interests on the Rural Affairs Forum for England. In addition our officials have recently met horse welfare groups to discuss the proposed Animal Welfare Bill and the Defra Horse Industry Team has frequent contact with the British Horse Society, the British Horse Industry Confederation and the British Equestrian Federation.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30324w02.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Rosindell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will make a statement on horse welfare in the United Kingdom.  [104245]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30324w02.html_spnew1"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 The proposed Animal Welfare Bill provides an opportunity to improve welfare standards for horses. The possible improvements include allowing a prosecution to be brought where an animal is being maintained in a way that will lead to unnecessary suffering, the licensing of livery stables and controls to combat poor tethering.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will list the countries which, since 1997, have been identified as the original source of illegal imports of <i>(a)</i> meat, <i>(b)</i> fish and <i>(c)</i> other food products, by type.  [103643]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30324w02.html_spnew3"><B> Margaret Beckett  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 19 March 2003]:</i> Data on products seized have been held by the Illegal Animal Product Seizures (ILAPS) database since April 2001. It is analysed on a monthly basis and the results are circulated to the relevant enforcement authorities. These reports are not published documents since they contain sensitive information which is relevant to the targeting of enforcement activity. We shall shortly publish the report on the risk assessment of the import of meat and meat products contaminated with foot and mouth disease virus. That report includes analysis of the overall risk by world region of origin. A copy will be placed in the Libraries of both Houses.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what plans she has to transfer provision from her Department's budget to that of HM Customs and Excise when Customs takes over responsibility for controls on illegal imports of animal and plant products.  [103782]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30324w02.html_spnew4"><B> Margaret Beckett  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 18 March 2003]:</i> The Government have allocated &#163;25 million over the three years commencing 2003&#150;04 for work on illegal meat and plant imports. We expect to announce very shortly how much of the available budget will transfer to HM Customs and Excise in 2003&#150;04 to fund their new responsibilities for anti-smuggling controls on animal and plant products.

Main sources of offsetting income for DESO are three Government to Government project offices, where the customer country pays Ministry of Defence costs, and the Disposal Services Agency where costs are met from revenue.<P>

DESO raises other sources of income from charging industry for activities undertaken on their behalf where Government independence from industry is not essential and when costs can be directly identified, calculated and recovered from individual companies. On this basis charges are raised for a proportion of the costs of the following activities: demonstrations of defence equipment overseas, demonstrations of defence equipment in the United Kingdom, Market Research and Publications, DESO Symposium and Seminars, and charging for Inward Visits. Savings to the defence budget come from spreading the fixed overhead cost of equipment over the longer production runs generated by exports, from the sale of surplus military equipment to overseas governments and from Commercial Exploitation Levy receipts on exports of equipment developed using public money.<P>

 The cross-departmental Conflict Prevention Fund was established in the 2000 Spending Review.

In addition, over the past six months the Ministry of Defence has piloted on-line reverse auctions which are a means of buying items or services against a published specification where pre-selected industrial partners are invited to bid in an on-line auction. In the Defence Procurement Agency (DPA) the Battlefield Infrastructure Integrated Project Team has used this technique to purchase battlefield survey equipment and within in the Defence Logistics Organisation (DLO) the Non-Project Procurement Organisation has used the technique to purchase cleaning products, resilient mounts and anti-freeze. Both DPA and DLO are planning to run further reverse auctions over the coming months, and the Department's corporate requirement for utilising the technique is now being scoped with a view to introducing such a capability during the next financial year.<P>

The Disposal Services Agency will begin piloting an "e-Trade exchange" in April providing information to other Government departments on the availability of surplus MOD IT equipment which is available for purchase. The Disposal Services Agency website (www.disposalsservicesagency.mod.uk) aims to provide information to explain how to purchase Ministry of Defence surpluses either as a business or a member of the public as well as to explain the Agency's role in selling MOD surplus assets.<P>





<P>

The MOD has recently published "Defence e-Business: Understanding the Commercial Issues" in collaboration with the Defence Industries Council, and this publication provides guidance on the subject for both MOD staff and industry colleagues. The guide can be viewed online at www.contracts.uk. A hard copy version has also been produced and I am arranging for copies of this to be placed in the Libraries of both Houses.<P>

The MOD is keen to embrace the technological advantages provided by e-Business to support the full range of procurement activities. To this end we are investing substantial sums of money, as well as consulting with industry, to ensure that these new technologies realise mutual benefits to the MOD and Industry.<P>

 Operation Desert Fox was the name given to the December 1998 joint US-UK air operation against targets in Iraq. Information on the total cost of Operation Desert Fox cannot be reliably differentiated from the overall costs of military operations in the Gulf. The Ministry of Defence identifies the costs of operations in terms of the net additional costs it has incurred. The costs which the Ministry of Defence would have incurred had the operation not been undertaken for example&#151;expenditure on wages and salaries or on conducting training exercises&#151;are deducted from the total costs of the operation. The following table sets out the overall additional expenditure incurred by the Ministry of Defence as a direct result of operations in the Gulf in 1998&#150;99 and 1999&#150;2000, primarily enforcement of the No Fly Zones. Costs include operating costs for aircraft enforcing the No Fly Zones&#151;primarily fuel and maintenance, plus the cost of maintaining personnel in-theatre. In-theatre costs include accommodation and utilities, equipment, plant, machinery, vehicles and allowances.

The aims of Operation Desert Fox were to degrade Saddam Hussein's military capability and reduce the threat that he posed to his neighbours. These aims were achieved and Saddam Hussein's war machine was seriously weakened. Contemporary estimates indicated that 87 per cent. of targets were either destroyed or damaged. A report on the results of Operation Desert Fox was sent to all Members of the House on 18 January 1999 and a copy was placed in the Library of the House.<P>

The United Kingdom continues to work closely with France as one of its key European partners.<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="30324w05.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Ingram </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 13 January 2003]:</i> Fourteen of the liabilities shown in the Consolidated and National Loans Fund Accounts B14 statement for financial year 2001&#150;02 were assumed by the Ministry of Defence as part of a long-term public private partnership and remained extant at 30 November 2002. These relate to the Ministry of Defence's nuclear operations, the contactorisation of the Atomic Weapons Establishment, the privatisation of the Dockyards at Rosyth and Devonport, the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency and the sale of Service married quarters. As the B14 statement shows, the nature of some of these liabilities makes it impossible to quantify their individual value. Accordingly, it is not possible to cost the overall value of these liabilities. The total value of those liabilities which can be quantified, is &#163;16,855.5 million.

 All Crown Prosecution Service casework units across England and Wales are likely to receive cases for review and prosecution from a number of police sources, the British Transport Police being one such source. Crown Prosecution Service casework data are not disaggregated in a way that differentiates between various police sources. It would not be practicable, and would involve a disproportionate cost, now to survey all case files for the past four years to determine how many British Transport Police case files resulted in a successful prosecution.

Germany suggested that the Commission should consider making a legal assessment as to whether national authorities have correctly implemented EU law when it receives notification of this implementation. The Commission argued that they already do this, when they collate information for the biannual Single Market Scoreboard. They were though willing to engage in further dialogue with Germany to improve systems.

Government have followed a market-driven policy, rather than prescribing a specific focus for this research activity. The research and development projects supported have been the best proposals emanating from the renewable energy industry.<P>

Large-scale hydro and energy from waste are already commercially viable and well-established in the market. With the benefit of the Renewables Obligation, onshore wind also becomes commercially viable. Over the next four years, the Government plan to provide nearly &#163;350 million direct support, mainly in the form of capital grants, to help more forms of renewable energy achieve economic viability, but we cannot predict when this will be achieved. The Energy White Paper gives some broad indications about the possible timescale on page 55, "A Renewables Timeline."<P>

 We have received several representations from individuals and representative bodies on a number of higher education matters, including academic pay. While pay levels are a matter for negotiation between employers and staff, the Government are concerned that higher education institutions should be able to recruit, retain and reward the high quality staff they need. That is why we announced in the recent White Paper that spending on higher education will rise from a total of &#163;7.5 billion in 2002&#150;03 to almost &#163;10 billion in 2005&#150;06. This includes &#163;50 million in 2004&#150;05 and &#163;117 million in 2005&#150;06 in addition to the total of &#163;330 million for the three years up to 2003&#150;04 specifically to help with the recruitment, retention and reward of all staff and, in particular, to value and reward good teachers. It also includes 'golden hellos' for 1,000 new lecturers in shortage subjects worth &#163;9,000 over three years' service. We are also introducing a range of measures to raise the status of teaching in higher education. New professional standards will be agreed by 2004&#150;05 and from 2006 all new teaching staff will be expected to have a teaching competence which meets the standards. Centres of Excellence in teaching will be established to reward good teaching at departmental level and to promote best practice, and the current National Teaching Fellowships Scheme will be increased in size to offer substantial rewards to twice as many outstanding teachers. The Government also support the proposed new teaching quality Academy being set up by the HE sector and considers that the Academy will play a major role in supporting and developing the profession of teaching.

<P>
<a name="30324w10.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 We attach a high priority to helping schools prevent and combat bullying, and ensuring that the pupils report bullying when it happens. In 1999 we introduced a statutory requirement on schools to frame anti-bullying policies, in consultation with the school community. We supported that with a guidance pack for schools entitled 'Bullying: don't suffer in silence' with an accompanying video aimed at pupils, which was updated and relaunched in September 2002. We have developed a linked website at www.dfes.qov.uk/bullying, and funded the ChildLine programme of research into children and young people's views on bullying and how to tackle it.

 A school is required by law to have a written anti-bullying policy, which should be consistently implemented whenever bullying is reported. We have produced a guidance pack for schools to help them discharge this responsibility. Additional LEA support, guidance and training on behaviour and attendance issues, including bullying, will be available to all secondary schools from the autumn term. It is for schools to decide which individuals have the main responsibility for drawing up and managing the bullying policy, and for dealing with specific cases, and for ensuring that those concerned have the necessary knowledge and skills.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30324w10.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 Schools should work closely with parents in tackling bullying, both when updating the school's anti-bullying policy and when investigating specific complaints. This will enable parents to play their part, with school support, in tackling bullying outside school hours and outside school premises. Our anti-bullying pack 'Bullying: don't suffer in silence' offers practical advice on how schools should communicate both with the parents of victims and with the parents of alleged bullies. Additional support, guidance and training to be made available to all secondary schools from the autumn term will reinforce these messages.

<P>

<a name="30324w10.html_para2">However, many FE colleges have already developed effective business partnerships, most recently through the creation of Centres of Vocational Excellence (CoVE), which are focused on meeting the skills needs of employers. Currently 137 FE colleges in England have a CoVE, including three CoVEs in the Bedfordshire & Luton LSC area. By March 2006 we will have created 400 CoVEs nationally.

 The Government's long-term aim is that all children living in the 20 per cent. most disadvantaged wards have access to children's centre services. By March 2006 we plan to reach at least 650,000 of these children&#151;around two-thirds of those living in the 20 per cent. most disadvantaged wards&#151;and to create nearly 43,000 extra childcare places for them. We are investing some &#163;435 million over the next three years to meet these targets. In many cases children's centres will be developed from existing provision, such as Sure Start local programmes and Neighbourhood Nurseries, building on their success.

 Information on the number of pupils with special educational needs (SEN) is collected from schools in January each year, via the Pupil Level Annual Schools Census. However, the data collected are not broken down by different categories of SEN, such as dyslexia. Currently, therefore, it is not possible to offer a realistic estimate of the number of children with dyslexia.
<P>

<a name="30324w11.html_para0">In June 2001, the Department carried out a pilot study involving a sample of 200 mainstream and special schools to assess whether it would be possible to collect data from schools on a broad range of types of SEN. Following that study, it is proposed that from 2004, schools and local education authorities will be required to provide information on a range of SEN, including specific learning difficulties, such as dyslexia. It is expected that maintained nursery provision will be covered by the requirement as well as primary, secondary and special schools.
<P>

<a name="30324w11.html_para1">Based on information taken from the individualised student records, as collected by the Learning Skills Council for the academic year 2000&#150;01, the only year for which full data are available, there were 20,400 students in further education colleges in England indicating their main learning difficulty as dyslexia.

The amount of area cost adjustment received by Havering and other east London boroughs is substantially more than the cost of London Weighting payments to teachers and other staff.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland how much funding has been allocated in each of the last three years to each of the schools and colleges in the Western Education and Library Board for the provision of link courses; why such funding has been withdrawn; and if he will postpone the scrapping of link funding until the common formula for funding schools has been introduced.  [103333]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30324w13.html_spnew6"><B> Jane Kennedy: </B> 
 The Department of Education (DE) provides no separate funding to schools for the provision of link courses. Pupils on such provision are counted for each school's funding under the Local Management of Schools (LMS) arrangements.
<P>

<a name="30324w13.html_para4">Schools in the WELB area have been receiving all of their link course provision free while schools in all other ELB areas have paid a fee. The amount paid is a matter for agreement between colleges and schools. The inconsistency has arisen because a separate earmarked fund, resulting from a pre-FE Incorporation WELB initiative for link provision, was provided to colleges in the WELB.
<P>

<a name="30324w13.html_para5">In addition to this funding the Department for Employment and Learning (DEL) provides funding through the further education funding formula to assist all colleges to provide and develop suitable link courses. The DEL funding is not provided as a substitute or replacement for any element of DE funding and schools should, therefore, meet the appropriate costs of colleges running link courses for their pupils.
<P>

<a name="30324w13.html_para6">Making separate earmarked funding available to assist schools and colleges in one area of Northern Ireland is inconsistent with the key principle of equity. Consequently, in the interests of commonality and equity, I have decided to make the arrangements for link course provision the same across Northern Ireland and the separate funding for WELB colleges will be withdrawn from September 2003.

<P>

<a name="30324w15.html_para1">In March 2001, the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions designated 16 English local authorities, or groups of local authorities, as Centres of Excellence for Local Transport Planning. This followed a competitive process, in which the Department, with the help of independent experts, assessed bidders on the quality of their Local Transport Plans, their target-setting and monitoring abilities, and their willingness to share experience and good practice with others. All bidders were notified of the results at the same time. In a separate initiative, Cornwall county council was designated a Centre of Excellence for Rural Transport, also in March 2001. There were no additional Centre of Excellence designations during 2001 or 2002. The Department for Transport now has responsibility for both schemes.

The scheme awards Secure Stations status and certification to those stations that reach specified standards in crime management, station design, station management and passenger perceptions. The award is for a two year period, after which the station can apply for reaccreditation. During 2001, 60 stations were awarded either accreditation or reaccreditation; during 2002, the figure was 76. There are currently 170 stations (both mainline and underground) accredited under the Scheme.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30324w15.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 No formal review of the SACTRA report has been carried out. The Government accepted many of the recommendations of the SACTRA report as set out in the Government's Response to the SACTRA Report on "Transport and the Economy", May 2000 Cm 4711.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30324w15.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The electrification of the Crewe-Kidsgrove route was included in the Strategic Rail Authority's draft 'West Coast Strategy' consultation document as a possible enhancement element. The Authority's broad estimate is that the overhead line installation and signalling works to allow electric trains to operate would be in the region of &#163;12 million. The final Strategy will be published shortly.

<P>
<a name="30324w15.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Chope: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what his estimate is of the economic cost of delays which will be occasioned to traffic in 2003&#150;04 by means of having to pay tolls at the Dartford crossing on the M25.  [104615]




<P>
<P><I>24 Mar 2003 : Column 57W</I><P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30324w15.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The principal cause of delays at the Dartford crossing is the capacity of the crossing and the surrounding network. Research published in August 2001 suggested that use of the Dartford crossing would grow more rapidly if there were no charge to use the crossing. Using 1997 as a base year the forecast was that traffic would be 17.6 per cent. higher in 2003 if there was no charge, compared to the situation if charging was maintained at the same level.
<P>

<a name="30324w15.html_para6">A significant increase in the level of traffic could have an adverse impact on the local community and users of the crossing in terms of health, the economy and the environment.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30324w15.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Chope: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what the forecast gross toll revenue is from the Dartford crossing on the M25 for 2003&#150;04; and what the forecast cost is of collecting the tolls in 2003&#150;04.  [104616]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30324w15.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The forecast gross revenue from road user charging at the Dartford crossing for 2003&#150;04 is approximately &#163;66 million.
<P>

<a name="30324w15.html_para7">The management fee for 2003&#150;04 to be paid to 'Le Crossing', who have been appointed to operate and maintain the crossing including collection of the user charge, is forecast to be approximately &#163;16 million.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30324w15.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Drew: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what discussions he has had with First Great Western over its decision to declare void days regarding compensation because of poor performance.  [104028]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30324w15.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 None. Under the terms of their Passenger's Charters train operating companies are allowed to declare void days when performance is particularly poor. This results in the holders of monthly or longer duration season tickets, receiving compensation to the value of a day's travel.

<a name="30324w15.html_sbhd5"><H3 align=center>M6</H3>


<P>
<P>
<a name="30324w15.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. George Osborne: </B>

<P>
<P>
<a name="30324w15.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B>

<P>
<P>
<a name="30324w15.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The figures published by the Strategic Rail Authority on 12 March show that overall performance between October and December 2002 was

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport who the Strategic Rail Authority consulted on its recent decision to cut direct rail services between Liverpool and <i>(a)</i> Stansted Airport and <i>(b)</i> Portsmouth; and when this consultation took place.  [104602]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30324w15.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The Strategic Rail Authority's decision on the September 2003 timetable changes was made in partnership with Train Operating Companies and Network Rail. The Rail Passenger Committee and Passenger Transport Executive were made aware of the outline proposals before the announcement was made on 24 February.
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what guidance he has received from the Department of Culture, Media and Sport on plans by Network Rail to close the London Paddington to Reading line on the weekend of 22 to 25 August.  [103355]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30324w15.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The management of engineering possessions is a matter for Network Rail, overseen by the Rail Regulator. I understand that Network Rail is consulting with relevant parties, including the passenger and freight train operators, Reading council and the organisers of the Reading Festival, regarding any engineering possession of this line over that weekend.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport how many times he has visited Scotland on official duties each year since 2000; and what meetings were held on each occasion.  [103600]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30324w15.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The Department was formed on 29 May 2002. Since its formation and up until 31 December 2002 the Secretary of State has carried out official duties on four occasions. He has of course been in Scotland on many other occasions in that time. In accordance with exemptions 2 and 7 of the 'Code of Practice on Access to Government Information', it is not the normal practice of Governments to release details of specific meetings or their content, as some of these discussions may have taken place on a confidential basis.

 None directly. However, all local public transport schemes, including trams, proposed for Government funding are subject to comprehensive appraisal on criteria which include the likely impact of the scheme on the environment, safety, the economy, accessibility and integration. Evaluation of tram schemes is also carried out after their completion.

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what recent assessment she has made of the extent to which the food needs of developing nations can be met without using genetically modified food; and if she will make a statement.  [103865]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30324w18.html_spnew5"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 There are approximately 800 million hungry people in the world. In May 2001, we published our strategy in the paper "Eliminating Hunger". This outlines our approach for achieving the Millennium Development Goal on hunger to reduce the proportion of hungry people in the world by half by 2015.
<P>

<a name="30324w18.html_para1">It is important to increase recognition that poverty rather than a country's lack of self sufficiency in food is the principal cause of hunger. The performance of the agricultural sector is however key to improved livelihoods and sustained poverty reduction. Lack of technology is not the sole or major cause of poor productivity in the agricultural sector. In many countries, agricultural productivity has been declining while existing productivity increasing technologies remain unused. A poor policy environment and limited international market opportunities resulting from developed country trade and agricultural policies are significant factors. Improving agriculture's performance will require removing these fundamental policy impediments, in addition to technology and innovation.
<P>

<a name="30324w18.html_para2">There will always be a need for improved varieties of crops, livestock and fish with characteristics that meet the needs of the poor, and modern biotechnologies and conventional approaches to selection and improvement both have a role to play in developing these. Developing countries must have the opportunity to make their own informed decisions on whether or not to adopt modern biotechnologies based on an assessment of the risks and benefits from their safe development and use. Developed countries have a responsibility to help developing countries build the capacity to make these choices.

 60 per cent. of the people of Iraq&#151;around 16 million people&#151;are currently totally dependent on the UN Oil for Food Programme (OFF). 



<P>
<P><I>24 Mar 2003 : Column 68W</I><P>
We have had many discussions on the continuation of the OFF programme with the UN Secretariat, Security Council members and others. I discussed this with Kofi Annan and his senior officials during my visit to New York on 19 March. Preparations are in hand for a new Security Council Resolution to allow the UN Secretary General to take charge of the Oil for Food (OFF) programme. A draft resolution will be tabled very soon.
<P>

<a name="30324w18.html_para3">The UK has been in discussion with the UN humanitarian agencies, Red Cross/Red Crescent Movement and international NGOs to determine what resources they require to procure food to cover any temporary gap in the programme. We have committed &#163;20 million to support the contingency preparations of these partners (covering food and other relief). This includes &#163;8 million for the World Food Programme. We have set aside a further &#163;70 million for the immediate humanitarian response and are considering further assistance in line with emerging humanitarian needs.
<P>

<a name="30324w18.html_para4">DFID also provides 19 per cent. of EC funding for Iraq. The EC has committed 21 million euros to the immediate response, and the UK will support the Commission's request to the budgetary authorities for additional humanitarian assistance to Iraq.

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what progress the Government have made with the US Administration over a co-ordination of response to the humanitarian relief effort in the event of a major new humanitarian emergency in the area of the Gulf where their military forces are co-operating.  [103857]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30324w18.html_spnew7"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 DFID has been liaising with the UN and the US over the last few months to try to ensure that humanitarian considerations are fully taken into account in both the planning of military action and to ensure that humanitarian relief is available throughout the crisis and plans for reconstruction in place. I visited the UN, US Administration, IMF and World Bank on 19 and 20 March to help take this forward.
<P>

<a name="30324w18.html_para6">The immediate responsibility for humanitarian relief lies with the military and both the UK and the US have made preparation. The UN is ready to take forward its humanitarian operations as soon as this is possible. DFID has provided funding to the UN and relevant NGO's to enable them to make preparations. A flash appeal for funds will issue from the UN shortly. Work is also in hand to provide authority to the Secretary General to put in place an Iraqi transitional government so that the international community can come together to support reconstruction. Both the IMF and the World Bank are prepared to engage but need a legally competent government in place.
<P>

<a name="30324w18.html_para7">There is urgent need for a UN resolution to enable the Secretary General to keep the Oil for Food programme going. This provides $10 billion worth of relief annually. Work is in hand to secure such a resolution.

hunger and disease in the event of a breakdown of water supplies and food rations lasting longer than seven days.  [103947]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30324w18.html_spnew8"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 There are a number of possible humanitarian scenarios. The UN is currently planning on a 'medium case' scenario. This assumes severe disruption to critical infrastructure and the Iraqi Government's capacity to deliver basic food and relief. Shortages of fuel and power could shut down water and sewage treatment plants. Up to half the population could be without access to potable water and up to 10 million people may require food assistance during and immediately after conflict.
<P>

<a name="30324w18.html_para8">We have been fully engaged in recent months in trying to get the international community to face the humanitarian risks of military action in Iraq, and to make preparations. There has been close collaboration between DFID and the Ministry of Defence to minimise the humanitarian impact of any conflict. A key aim is to minimise damage to the infrastructure on which the Oil for Food distribution network depends, in order that it can be re-established as quickly as possible after any conflict. This is the key to the avoidance of a humanitarian crisis.

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development pursuant to her written statement of 13 March 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 21WS, on humanitarian contingency planning for Iraq, what the optimistic assumptions referred to are.  [103875]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30324w18.html_spnew10"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 The optimistic view is that military action will be short with very limited casualties and that the regime will crumble quickly, the Oil for Food programme will be quickly reinstated, UN authority put in place to install an Iraqi Government and the international community work together to support the Iraqi people in reconstructing their country. Progress in implementing the route map to Palestinian statehood would be taken forward at the same time that following military conflict in Iraq, UN agencies will be able to follow quickly behind advancing coalition troops to start addressing the humanitarian needs previously met by the Oil for Food programme, and new needs caused by conflict.

Friend the Foreign Secretary has regularly discussed North Korea with his counterparts in the United States, the European Union and with colleagues in the UN Security Council. I have also held discussions with the President of the Republic of Korea, and with counterparts from the United States, Japan, China, Russia and Australia. We have argued for a consistent message from the international community calling on North Korea to commit itself fully to international non-proliferation agreements, and to respond to the invitation to discuss in a multilateral forum the security concerns it has raised.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what measures he takes to combat torture; and what plans he has to change the means of combating torture.  [104328]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30324w20.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Rammell: </B> 
 International action against torture is a priority for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. An anti-torture initiative to tackle torture throughout the world was launched in October 1998. Phase three of the initiative was launched on 26 June 2002. As part of this initiative, which included diplomatic activity, support for regional organisations and practical projects, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office launched two rounds of worldwide lobbying for the universal ratification of the UN Convention against Torture. Since we began lobbying 25 states have ratified. We plan to launch a third round of lobbying this year focusing on implementation of obligations as well as ratification. Last year the UK Government also undertook a widespread lobbying campaign to support the Optional Protocol to the UN Convention against Torture. We believe the Protocol offers the best means available to establish an effective international mechanism to combat torture through mandatory visits by national and international independent monitoring committees to places of detention in signatory states. The Optional Protocol was adopted at the UN General Assembly in December 2002. The UK Government are now working to secure early ratification.

 Central Government provide funds for local authority emergency planning in England and Wales in the form of Civil Defence Grant. This is allocated to those authorities with a statutory duty for Civil Defence (all-purpose local authorities, county councils, Fire and Civil Defence Authorities and London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority) to enable them to carry out their emergency planning functions.
<P>

<a name="30324w20.html_para4">East Sussex County Council has been allocated &#163;208,288 for 2003&#150;04. As a shire district with no statutory duty for Civil Defence, Eastbourne Borough Council does not receive any direct funding from central Government.
<P>

<a name="30324w20.html_para5">The Civil Defence Grant is just part of central Government funding for planning for and responding to emergencies. Central Government provide substantial funds to other local responders, including the emergency services and health authorities.
<P>

<a name="30324w20.html_para6">Local authorities often supplement the central Government contribution from their general funds, recognising the importance of civil protection in their community. I understand that East Sussex County Council has budgeted to spend an additional &#163;45,000 from their own general funds in 2003&#150;04 and Eastbourne Borough Council &#163;11,000.

 During 2002&#150;03, Warrington Primary Care Trust provided &#163;100,000 in respect of the rapid respiratory team. The PCT also invests in drugs for the care and treatment of asthma. These drugs are also used for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and as such it is not possible to separate the drug costs for asthma from COPD. In addition, there will also be costs associated with hospital admissions, out-patient attendance and the asthma clinics which are organised by all general practitioner practices in Warrington. However, a breakdown of these costs is not available.
<P>

<a name="30324w20.html_para7">Data for the number of practice nurses trained in asthma management for the north-west area are not held centrally. A survey was undertaken by Warrington PCT in December 2002. 22 practices, or 73 per cent. responded and confirmed that between them there were 30 asthma trained nurses. This represents 0.15 nurses per 1,000 total population for the Warrington area based on the Warrington PCT December 2002 survey.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will make a statement on the conclusion of the NHS Ombudsman relating to the single assessment process (SAP) in the report "NHS funding for long-term care" that the associated guidance does not suggest whether or how the SAP could provide a basis for, or contribute to, the assessment of eligibility for continuing NHS care.  [103150]<P>

<P>
<a name="30324w21.html_spnew0"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 Guidance on the single assessment process already states that comprehensive assessments should be completed for people where the level of support and treatment likely to be offered is intensive or prolonged. We have indicated that, prior to the issue of a section 2 notice (notice from the national health service to say that a patient requires social services on discharge from hospital), the NHS must carry out an assessment, informed by the single assessment process for fully funded NHS continuing care.

<P>
<a name="30324w22.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 In the early 1990s, there was considerable concern about the use of confidentiality clauses in commercial leases. However, the University of Reading 2000 report for the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions on leasing flexibility found that use of confidentiality clauses in commercial leases was rare.
<P>

<a name="30324w22.html_para5">Banning confidentiality clauses in commercial leases would be a serious interference with freedom of contract, which the Government would not undertake lightly. Nevertheless the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister would be concerned at any re-emergence of this practice, under which landlords concealed concessionary terms given to tenants from the general market in order to sustain unrealistically high rents.

<P>
<a name="30324w22.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 The property industry's 2002 Code of Practice for Commercial Leases in England and Wales commits landlords and their funders to provide a choice of leasing terms whenever possible, including alternatives to upwards only rent review clauses.
<P>

<a name="30324w22.html_para7">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister awarded a contract last July to the University of Reading to gauge the impact of the Code. This will help the ODPM to assess, at the end of a two-year period, whether to continue relying on voluntary measures to produce more choice and flexibility in the property market or to introduce legislative controls.
<P>

<a name="30324w22.html_para8">The university will assess, over a two-year period, whether the Code has provided a more flexible commercial property market.

 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister was created on 29 May 2002. From 1 June 2002 to 31 January 2003, Ministers and the Permanent Secretary and their Private Offices spent an estimated &#163;3,350 on entertainment, working lunches, dinners and awaydays with stakeholders.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30324w22.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 The Government continue to support a number of schemes which help both local authority and housing association tenants to purchase their social rented home or which free up social housing for re-letting to others in housing need by assisting tenants to buy an alternative home. These are described as follows:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>As announced in "Sustainable Communities: building for the future" on 5 February, the Housing Corporation is heading a Task Force to look at all the programmes that support sustainable home ownership. An announcement on the Task Force and the terms of reference is being made today.
<P>
<BR>
Existing schemes include the Right to Buy which enables secure tenants of local authorities to purchase their rented home with a discount. Secure tenants who have transferred with their homes from local authorities to housing associations have a 'preserved' Right to Buy.
<P>
<BR>
Eligible housing association tenants of properties built or acquired with public funds since 1 April 1997 may purchase their rented home with a discount through the Right to Acquire scheme.
<P>
<BR>
Some housing associations offer the voluntary purchase grant scheme. This enables tenants of older housing association properties to purchase their home with a discount at the discretion of their landlord.
<P>
<BR>
In addition, tenants of both local authorities and housing associations can benefit from the Homebuy equity loan and shared ownership (part buy/part rent) schemes. Both schemes are offered by housing associations and funded by the Housing Corporation, although local authorities do fund a few of these schemes.
<P>
<BR>
Cash Incentive Schemes are currently operated by some local housing authorities so they can give grants to their tenants to assist them in buying a property in the private sector. These schemes have the effect of releasing local authority accommodation for letting to those in housing need.

Notes:<P>

1. Changes in the Retail Prices Index (RPI) between Q4 1996, Q4 2001 and Q4 2002 were used to convert cash prices to real (Q4 1996) prices. The relevant RPI figures were Q4 1996: 154.0, Q4 2001: 173.8, Q4 2002: 178.2.<P>

2. Transaction prices below &#163;1,000 have been excluded from the figures&#151;because they are deemed to be at below market values. One or two transactions above &#163;20 million have also been excluded so as not to distort the average prices within each category.<P>

3. Note that the average price of flats in Northern Ireland for Q4 1996 is based on the prices recorded not only in Q4 1996 but also in Q3 1996 and Q1 1997. This is because the sample for Q4 1996 alone was too small.<P>

 Tunbridge Wells borough council has not formed its own local strategic partnership to implement Government initiatives, however, in September 2001, it along with Tonbridge and Mailing and Sevenoaks Councils decided to work together to form an area partnership for the west Kent region, since many service providers and interest groups cover areas much larger than a single district.
<P>

<a name="30324w24.html_para0">Kent county council has developed a countywide strategic partnership as a forum to encourage cross tier partnership working. The county strategic partnership grew out of the Kent Association of Local Authorities.
<P>

<a name="30324w24.html_para1">Neither Tunbridge Wells borough council nor Kent county council are in receipt of Neighbourhood Renewal Funding&#151;the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's funding programme that supports the development of strategic partnerships. There are only 88 areas in England that qualify to receive this specific funding, by virtue of being especially deprived as ranked by ward on the Government's Indices of Deprivation. Those 88 areas contain 82 per cent. of the most deprived wards in England, none of which fall in the Kent county council area.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department if she will list IT contracts in the Department above &#163;50 million in each of the last 10 years; what the inception date for each system was; when it became fully functional; when it became fully debugged; and what the cost of over-runs has been.  [99004]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30324w25.html_spnew0"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 The information is as follows:
<P>

<a name="30324w25.html_para0">LOCCS (various court-based IT systems): The EDS (LOCCs) contract was awarded to EDS in September 1996, to provide IT systems to Crown and county courts. The lifetime cost of the contract is assessed at &#163;124 million, and expenditure in 2001&#150;02 totalled &#163;33 million.
<P>

<a name="30324w25.html_para1">The initial rollout of equipment to courts was completed in August 2001. The contract was fully functional from award. The contract includes 



<P>
<P><I>24 Mar 2003 : Column 96W</I><P>
provisions to test software prior to release, and to fix software 'bugs' which are attributable to supplier software.
<P>

<a name="30324w25.html_para2">The LOCCS rollout was completed to time, and subsequent major work programmes have been delivered to time.
<P>

<a name="30324w25.html_para3">ARAMIS (Resource Accounting and Management Information System): This is a PFI contract for the provision of accounting, financial, HR/payroll and management information services. It was awarded in December 1997 and runs until January 2007. Its current anticipated life-time cost is &#163;192 million, which includes enhancements to the service.
<P>

<a name="30324w25.html_para4">Most services have IT elements and are delivered across an IT infrastructure provided through the contract. However, the IT system elements of the contract are not separated out from the main business functions. All the services are being provided within the lifetime of the contract, and major work programmes 



<P>
<P><I>24 Mar 2003 : Column 97W</I><P>
have been delivered to time. Debugging of the IT system elements is a process which continues through the lifetime of the contract.
<P>

<a name="30324w25.html_para5">Libra (magistrates courts IT systems): The contract signed in July 2002 varied from the original contracts. It included the provision of Libra infrastructure and Office Automation only. These have been successfully rolled out to over 90 per cent. of the magistrates courts. Five (of 42) MCCs remain in the rollout programme and these will be completed by spring 2003. The Office Automation software consists of 'off-the-shelf' Microsoft Office software which does not require debugging.
<P>

<a name="30324w25.html_para6">The original contracts for Libra included provision for a bespoke case management software application for magistrates courts. This is now being sourced through two other contracts, the combined value of which is expected to be &#163;86 million. These contracts include provisions to test the software prior to release, and to fix software "bugs" which are attributable to supplier software.
<P>

<a name="30324w25.html_para7">The contract with Fujitsu Services for the delivery of Libra has been varied twice since initial completion in December 1998. This has resulted in changes to the baseline making it inappropriate to compare spend to date across an original and two variants of the contract. The actual spend against the contract can be summarised as follows:
<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="30324w25.html_spnew1"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 The costs of the Libra project are set out in the National Audit Office's report: "New IT systems for Magistrates Courts: The Libra project" published on 29 January 2003 as ISBN:0102920362. Officials gave evidence on this report to the Public Accounts Committee on 10 February 2003.
<P>

<a name="30324w25.html_para8">The headline costs are published in the report and show the original total project cost as at December 1998 to be &#163;194 million. The fully delivered project is expected to cost &#163;390 million. This &#163;390 million breaks down as:

Internal project costs: &#163;12 million

<a name="30324w25.html_para9">The project cost at December 1998 cannot be directly compared with the current proposal; since December 1998 the contracts underpinning the project have been subject to a number of changes in costs, timescales and scope, and these are described in the NAO Report. The project's current costs have been subject to independent, external, benchmark assessments providing assurance that they are in-line with other comparable projects in the public sector and private industry.

 As my right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State, set out in his written answer of 3 December 2002 to the hon. Member for Twickenham (Dr. Cable), <i>Official Report,</i> columns 735&#150;36W, the Government have decided to build up the number of benefit customers and pensioners that we pay through the Post Office card account gradually, starting from April 2003. This is to ensure that the systems supporting the Post Office card account are reliable and robust, and have proved themselves in live running, before we start to pay large numbers of customers through them. My Department's current plans for issuing Personal Invitation Documents meet our intention that, subject to acceptance of the card account service, we can start to pay some people through the Post Office card account from April 2003.

Once tax credit customers have received their Personal Invitation Documents they will then be able to complete the Post Office application form for a card account. Tax credit customers who have a Post Office card account for their DWP benefits can start to use it for their tax credits immediately.

<a name="30324w25.html_para12">None of this will affect people's choices, and in the intervening period until they receive their Personal Invitation Documents, tax credit customers opting for a Post Office card account will be paid by giro and DWP customers by order book or giro.

 Most of the Department's helpline staff do not follow rigid scripts.

I would be happy to arrange for the hon.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what proportion of housing benefit recipients in private regulated and deregulated tenancies were subject to reduced rent determinations in each region in England in each year since 1996 as consequence of <i>(a)</i> pre-1996 restrictions and <i>(b)</i> post-1996 restrictions.

<P>
<a name="30324w26.html_spnew4"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 Rents for tenancies in the regulated private rented sector are subject to regulatory controls through the Rent Service and Rent Assessment committees as well as subsidy controls within housing benefit. Decisions on restrictions on the amount of benefit paid in these cases are made by local authorities and no information is collected on the number of restrictions that are applied.
<P>

<a name="30324w26.html_para1">Claims from tenants in the deregulated private rented sector are generally referred to the rent officer for a determination. Housing Benefit Management Information System data provided by local authorities show the numbers of these tenants whose claims to housing benefit are assessed under the local reference rent and single room rent schemes. These data do not distinguish between cases where rent is restricted following a rent officer determination and those where it is not (for example because the actual rent is sufficiently low, or the person claiming has transitional protection).
<P>

<a name="30324w26.html_para2">However, using information from rent officer statistics, it is possible to e estimate the proportion of deregulated private rented sector cases referred by local authorities where housing benefit would be restricted if the overall claim was successful.

1. The data refer to households claiming Housing Benefit (HB), which may be a single person, a couple or a family. More than one benefit household can live in one property, for example two or more adults in a flat or house share arrangement.<P>

2. Pre-1996 reduced rent determinations apply to cases where the accommodation is deemed to be too large for the household or where the rent is exceptionally high for the accommodation.<P>

3. Post-1996 reduced rent determinations include restrictions under the local reference rent (LRR) and single room rent (SRR) schemes only. The LRR was introduced in January 1996 and a revised scheme introduced in October 1997. The SRR was introduced in October 1996.<P>

4. Cases subject to reduced rent determinations as a consequence of both pre-1996 and post-1996 restrictions have been included under the restriction that reduces the rent to the lowest amount.<P>

5. Estimates assume that all cases are subject to all determinations in place at the time. In practice, some cases will have transitional protection from the post-1996 restrictions, so will not have their actual rent restricted. This will be particularly likely in the early years when more cases would have transitional protection.<P>





6. The data relate to all referrals made over a year. They will differ from the HB caseload in that some claims will not be successful (for example, because the person's income is too high) and because some people may claim more often than others (for example, because they move house, or leave and then return to benefit). The figures will therefore over-rep resent short duration claims.<P>

2. Where a HB claim was first made before October 1997, or October 1996 for SRR cases, the case will have transitional protection from LRR and SRR restrictions. Rent officer data do not distinguish between these cases, and the estimates therefore represent the proportion of referrals where the rent would be restricted assuming that all referrals were liable to such restriction.<P>

3. The data relate to all referrals made over a year. They will differ from the HB case load in that some claims will not be successful (for example, because the person's income is too high) and because 



some people may claim more often than others, for example, because they move house, or leave and then return to benefit. The figures will therefore over-represent short duration claims.<P>

4. Percentages have been rounded to the nearest whole number.<P>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>As Jobcentre Plus is an Executive Agency, I have been asked to reply to your question concerning the placing of mystery shopping reports in the Library, and the use of mystery shoppers by Jobcentre Plus. This falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Acting Chief Executive of the Agency.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>It may be helpful if I explain how the mystery shopping programme is used within Jobcentre Plus, and how our performance is currently reported internally and externally.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Mystery Shopping is a recognised process used in both public and private sector organisations, as a method of providing an independent measure of the service received by customers.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Within Jobcentre Plus we have a Customers' Charter based not only on the 6 Whitehall Service standards, but also after consultation with our customers, includes elements of service that are important to them. We use a mystery shopping programme to measure how well we deliver service against the standards and commitments we have set, and results are used by my managers to direct improvements in their performance.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Jobcentre Plus programme is one of the biggest in the UK and all main parts of delivery are included. Each quarter every Jobcentre Plus location receives a number of different mystery shopping contacts. This means that nationally we produce in excess of 6,500 individual reports every quarter.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>These reports are then aggregated into individual site performance summaries and District and national reports. In accordance with Jobcentre Plus overall performance reporting arrangements, we publish details of District results on the Jobcentre Plus website each quarter (www.jobcentreplus.gov.uk) and a copy of this has been placed in the Library. The individual office reports provide detailed feedback from the shoppers that managers will use to identify areas for improvement. The content of the questionnaires used in the mystery shopping programme are commercial in confidence and I am therefore unable to place copies in the House of Commons Library.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I would also like to reassure you that while we use the Mystery Shopping programme to measure service delivery against defined standards, we regularly review those standards and seek the views of our customers and other stakeholders.</FONT></UL>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>As part of our drive for efficiency and this modernisation of our services, Jobcentre Plus is reducing staffing levels in line with agreed workforce planning targets.

 Because it was considered that some married women might wish to revoke their election to pay reduced rate contributions in order to benefit from Home Responsibilities Protection, a special insert was placed in child benefit order books to draw their attention to this.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30324w27.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. McCartney: </B> 
 In 1977, no letters were issued to married women who had a valid election to pay National Insurance contributions at the reduced rate. Women were targeted via their employers, and flyers were enclosed with their payslips alerting them to the changes.
<P>

<a name="30324w27.html_para4">In 1989, the publicity campaign was aimed at some 400,000 women. They were sent letters to inform them that they could be better off paying standard rate National Insurance contributions because of the proposed change to the National Insurance structure. The criteria used to select these women were that their National Insurance account showed an open reduced rate election, they had paid reduced rate National Insurance contributions in the 1986&#150;87 and/or 1987&#150;88 tax years and that they were generally low earners in which case the standard rate contributions would be less than the reduced rate.
<P>

<a name="30324w27.html_para5">In 2000, nearly 253,000 letters were issued. These women were identified by scanning the National Insurance Record System computer. All those who had a valid election to pay the reduced rate were sent a letter.

 To support the take-on of pension credit a marketing campaign has been developed that seeks to address the specific needs of pensioners and those who support them such as family and friends.
<P>

<a name="30324w28.html_para3">The core of the campaign involves contacting all pensioner households by direct mail and inviting them to make their applications by telephone. In this way we can support and complete the application form for them. The Pension Service will start writing to pensioner households to invite applications in April 2003 and plan to complete this activity in June 2004.

 The purpose of the combined pension forecast is to provide people with good information about their current and future retirement incomes in order to help them make better informed decisions about their needs in retirement and raise awareness of the importance of making adequate provision.
<P>

<a name="30324w28.html_para6">The pilot phase of the combined pension forecast initiative provided us with an indication of the potential impact of the statement on recipients.
