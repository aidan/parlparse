<a name="stpa_0">The Assembly Government are keen to exploit the potential of air transport within Wales. Following an extensive consultation exercise, it proposes to take forward a service from Swansea and Cardiff to Valley on Anglesey. This service would operate two flights a day in each direction. It would provide significant time savings for passengers and improve business links. The Assembly Government will be working with their partners to launch this service in 2006, subject to obtaining the necessary approvals and consents.

<p><a name="st_13"><a name="51115w01.html_spnew13"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 The last H5 avian influenza virus to be isolated in England was the H5N1 virus responsible for the outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza in turkeys in Norfolk in 1991&#150;92. This virus is genetically distinguishable from the H5N1 viruses currently causing the problems in East Asia and the virus isolated recently in quarantine birds in Essex.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51115w01.html_para12">
<a name="stpa_12">The genetic material (RNA) of influenza viruses is segmented into eight distinct genes, which code for 10 proteins. Because this viral RNA is segmented, genetic reassortment can occur in mixed infections with different strains of influenza A viruses. This means that when two viruses infect the same cell, progeny viruses may inherit sets of eight RNA segments made up of combinations of segments from either of the parent viruses. The epidemiological significance of this for humans is that in theory if, for example, an H5N1 virus and a human influenza virus infect the same animal and same cell a reassortant virus could emerge that possessed the virus genes that enabled it to be transmissible in humans, but with the H5 haemagglutinin gene, which would mean that humans had no immunity to this virus. This mechanism is thought to have been the way the H2N2 and the H3N2 pandemic viruses emerged in 1957 and 1968 respectively.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what steps she has taken since May to promote the export of British beef; and what recent assessment she has made of the prospects for beef exports.  [17482]</p>




<p><a name="st_14"><a name="51115w02.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 Promotion of beef exports is undertaken primarily by the Meat and Livestock Commission (MLC), their devolved bodies such as Hybu Cig Cymru in Wales and the beef industry itself. The Government recently fully supported their efforts to promote British beef at the International Food Fair, ANUGA, in Cologne in early October. On 14 October, Lord Bach held a high level meeting with the industry, agreeing to work together on opening up export markets for beef once the export ban is lifted.

<a name="stpa_13">The European Commission has acknowledged that the essential preconditions for lifting the EU export ban have been fulfilled. We are now awaiting proposals from the Commission for legislation to lift the ban. Such proposals would have to be submitted to EU member states to consider in the Standing Committee for the Food Chain and Animal Health (SCoFCAH). If the member states were to vote in favour of the proposals in SCoFCAH, they would be translated into all EU languages and presented to the College of Commissioners for formal adoption. We hope that these processes will be completed in early 2006. but this is a best case scenario. We will continue to argue for an early resumption of beef exports.

 Help is available to farmers to grow crops for use in the generation of biomass heat and electricity and transport biofuels. &#163;29 million was made available under the Energy Crops Scheme to support the planting of short rotation coppice (SRC) and miscanthus, and the setting up of producer groups to supply SRC to biomass heat and electricity end-users. The &#163;3.5 million Bio-energy Infrastructure Scheme, which is now closed for applications, provides grants to develop the supply chain for purpose-grown energy crops, straw and woodfuel from harvest through to delivery to biomass energy end-users. Defra-funded research projects on crops for biomass heat and electricity are looking to develop disease resistant varieties and increase yields. Best practice guidance is available for growing SRC and miscanthus. Farmers growing crops for biomass heat and electricity and transport biofuels can receive the Single Payment for certain crops grown on set-aside or where the 45/ha Energy Aid payment is claimed for crops on non set-aside land. It was announced on 10 November that the Government will introduce a Renewable Transport Fuels Obligation which will require 5 per cent. of transport fuel sold in the UK to come from a renewable source by 2010. This may open up opportunities for farmers to supply crops to be used to produce biofuels.

<i>[holding answer 11 November 2005]:</i> Previous discussions with the European Commission and other member states, following pressure from the UK, resulted in the adoption in April 2004 of Community measures to address cetacean by-catch (Council Regulation EC No. 812/2004). These measures include the mandatory use of observers to widen knowledge of where by-catch occurs and the use of pingers to deter porpoises from gill nets. A review of the effectiveness of these measures is due to take place in 2007&#150;08.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51115w02.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_17">More recently, pressure from the UK in relation to common dolphin by-catch in the Western Channel secured agreement at the Agriculture and Fisheries Council of Ministers&#039; meeting in March 2005 to an early review by the International Council for the Exploration of Sea (ICES) of the interaction of fisheries and common dolphins in the North East Atlantic. Following publication of this ICES advice, Commissioner Borg has written in September 2005 to all member states stressing the urgent need to provide timely reports to the Commission on the results from the observer schemes required under the council regulation to ensure that any future by-catch reduction measures can be targeted effectively.

 The Task Force&#039;s views on this subject are set out in its report which was published on 25 October and in the earlier emerging conclusions and draft recommendations report of August 2005. They considered a scheme whereby an obligation would be held by the suppliers of the fossil fuels from which heat is produced, and renewable heat certificates would be granted to heat producers and users who could demonstrate that they had substituted renewable heat for fossil-fired heat. However, they judged that such a scheme would be complex since most heat is not supplied by commercial companies but is produced by domestic and industrial/commercial end-users by using purchased fuel in boilers which they themselves own. They reported that a fundamental flaw in the proposal was that the obligation would rest with a supplier who had no control over the many, varied and often small users and producers of heat. In view of the complexities, they also noted that it would take considerable time to draw up a suitable scheme. They concluded that quicker progress would be achieved by offering capital grants to aid all biomass heating boilers and the heat element of combined heat and power (CHP) biomass-fuelled plants.

 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what account is taken of the level of public subsidy for agriculture in developing countries in deciding allocations of UK development aid.  [27302]</p>




<p><a name="st_69"><a name="51115w09.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Thomas: </b> 
 DFID operates an annual review of budgets that includes deciding how much money to allocate to each developing country. The process involves dialogue at all levels, starting with country offices and culminating in approval by DFID&#039;s management board and Ministers.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51115w09.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_86">To help inform the discussion, DFID uses a financial model to generate suggested allocations for bilateral country programmes. The model takes account of both the extent of a country&#039;s poverty and the likely effectiveness of aid in reducing its poverty. Vulnerability to economic shocks and the amount of aid which countries are likely to receive from other donors are also taken into account. In addition to the model&#039;s results, the regional divisions responsible for DFID&#039;s bilateral country programmes analyse a range of factors when considering allocations. These include the effectiveness of multilateral channels, conflict and reconstruction needs, inequality and social exclusion, our historical engagement and the political environment.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51115w09.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_87">The central process to allocate resources between developing countries and regions does not give specific consideration to levels of public subsidy for agriculture. However, at country level, DFID allocates its resources to support national strategies for growth and poverty reduction. DFID country programmes work with national governments to identify the most effective way for DFID to support these strategies. Discussions with governments on the allocation of DFID resources at country level are likely to take into account the broad range of policies and programmes set out in national strategies.

[26987]</p>




<p><a name="st_70"><a name="51115w09.html_spnew1"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 DFID has not held any discussions with the World Bank on water privatisation in Bolivia as DFID does not work and has not worked in the water or sanitation sector in Bolivia.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51115w09.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_88">DFID supports a World Bank managed facility called the Global Partnership for Output-Based Aid (GPOBA). GPOBA supports the design and piloting of performance based approaches for targeting public funding to subsidise the delivery of basic services to poor people. In early 2005, officials discussed with the managers of GPOBA, the possible involvement of GPOBA in piloting subsidies for water connections in El Alto, but this has not happened.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51115w09.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_89">The UK Government&#039;s position on water privatisation in general is made clear in our policy on conditionality, available on the DFID website at www.dfid.gov.uk/pubs/files/conditionality.pdf. The Government do not make its aid conditional on policy decisions by partner governments, or attempt to impose policy choices on them, including in the area of water privatisation. Where appropriate, DFID responds to requests from developing country governments for assistance to help improve the efficiency of water utilities. If a country has held an extensive public consultation exercise and has decided that it wishes to involve the private sector in the management of water, then DFID can provide them with the information to help them to do so.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51115w09.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_90">The UK Government also uses its position on the Board of the World Bank and IMF to influence their approach to conditionality in general, and conditionality in sensitive areas such as water privatisation in particular. The UK led calls for a review of the Bank&#039;s policy and practice on conditionality, and this has just concluded. New best practice principles have been endorsed, which accord well with the UK approach, and we will be monitoring their implementation carefully.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51115w09.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_91">The World Bank systematically considers the impacts of its operations on poor people in recipient countries. The Bank&#039;s mission is to reduce global poverty and all its operations are designed to improve the lives of the poor. The Bank also uses a range of tools to assess the likely impact of its operations on specific groups of poor people. When the Bank lends for specific projects, it uses safeguard policies which are designed to prevent and mitigate undue harm to people and their environment in the development process. When the Bank lends to support countries&#039; policy and institutional reforms, it conducts Poverty and Social Impact Analysis (PSIA) which assesses the likely impact of policy reforms on different groups, with a particular focus on the poor and vulnerable. Both safeguard policies and PSIA are used before projects are discussed at the Bank Board, and often result in changes to project design. More information on both can be found on the World Bank website, at www.worldbank.org/safeguards and www.worldbank.org/psia.

 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development if he will make it his policy not to spend UK aid money on water privatisation projects that result from <i>(a)</i> World Bank and IMF conditions and <i>(b)</i> conditions imposed by other Governments.  [20617]</p>




<p><a name="st_82"><a name="51115w11.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Thomas: </b> 
 DFID&#039;s policy on conditionality sets out how we intend to strike a balance between ensuring aid is used effectively for poverty reduction, strengthening countries leadership of their own development and making aid more predictable. It makes clear that we will use conditions to ensure aid is used effectively, but we will minimise any negative effects of these conditions on partner Government leadership and aid predictability. In particular we will not use conditionality to impose specific policy choices on partner Governments, including in sensitive areas such as privatisation.

<a name="stpa_106">The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) are also both committed to the principle of country ownership of reforms. The World Bank&#039;s 2005 review of its use of conditionality resulted in five good practice principles for conditionality, the first of which is country ownership. At the annual meetings of the World Bank in September 2005, we successfully pressed for agreement that the Bank would report back next year on the implementation of these principles.

<a name="stpa_107">The Paris Declaration re-affirmed donors&#039; views that countries must lead their own development process. DFID strongly supports this approach. Countries should lead their own policy making processes and are free to decide to implement market-based reforms in the water sector. In cases where Governments are committed to reform of the water sector and request our support, we would be ready to consider assistance to ensure policy options are thoroughly considered, and the appropriate regulation is put in place so that affordable services are delivered to poor people. In 2004, of the &#163;93 million DFID spent in country programmes on urban, rural and humanitarian water supply and sanitation services, 95 per cent. was spent through Governments, not for profit or humanitarian agencies. Rather than focussing on who delivers these services we concentrate on ensuring that services are delivered to the poor and that Governments can make informed choices between approaches.

 Stealth is a term used to describe techniques to reduce visual, infra-red and radar observability.

In addition, the UK continues to explore the underlying technologies contributing to low observability, to ensure that the technology base exists to meet any potential future capability requirement.

The Government are also considering further initiatives to support investment in biofuel processing plants. These measures may open up opportunities for farmers to supply crops to be used to produce biofuels. A number of biomass and biofuel projects are being established in the West Midlands area.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry for what reason vets will be prevented from charging for prescribing; and whether he plans to apply the same principles to other professional groups. [28113]</p>




<p><a name="st_176"><a name="51115w18.html_spnew10"><b> Mr. Sutcliffe </b> 
<i>[holding answer 14 November 2005]:</i> The Competition Commission found in their report in April 2003 that the market in prescription-only veterinary medicines was not working well for animal owners. They recommended a package of measures aimed at opening up the market to competition.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51115w18.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_142">A key element of the package of measures is to enable customers to take up prescriptions, so they can shop around for medicines rather than be forced to pay the prices charged by the veterinary surgeon treating their animal. The three-year moratorium on prescription charges is seen by both the Competition Commission and Government as essential to encouraging take-up and opening the market.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51115w18.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_143">This is not currently applied to other professional groups as it follows a detailed analysis by the Competition Commission in response to complaints specific to the market for veterinary medicines.

 There is nothing in the World Trade Organisation (WTO) General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) which requires WTO members to privatise water utilities.

 The Housing (Right-to-Buy) (Limits on Discount) (Amendment) Order 2003 came into force on 27 March 2003. It reduced to 16,000 the maximum right-to-buy discount available to tenants in 41 areas in London and the South of England that appeared to be under the greatest housing market pressure in terms of high levels of homelessness and high property prices. The Government is keeping the position on maximum right-to-buy discounts generally under review.

 The Government&#039;s approach is to ensure that infrastructure, including public services, is provided in step with growth, as plans for individual growth locations are developed. There are three elements to this: first, to ensure that main public expenditure programmes, such as health and education, are sufficiently flexible and responsive to the needs of growing communities; second, to secure an appropriate contribution from developers and private investors; and third, to provide additional support through growth areas funds, including the Community Infrastructure Fund.

 Banding systems can have the effect of reducing inequalities in school intakes, ensuring fair access to all and reducing the clustering of disadvantaged pupils in certain schools. Combined with our proposals to extend entitlement to free school transport for more disadvantaged families, the introduction of fair banding could enable more children to access schools to which they were previously unable to gain admission.

<a name="stpa_176">Research has suggested that pupils&#039; attainment at key stage 4 is affected by the characteristics of the school. Schools with a large proportion of disadvantaged pupils tend to have lower results, even after taking account of the prior attainment and other characteristics of the pupils measured in the pupil level annual schools census. Reducing the clustering of disadvantaged pupils in certain schools can benefit these pupils and give them a better chance of achieving their potential in secondary schools.

<p><a name="st_68"><a name="51115w31.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Byrne: </b> 
 The BS7799 part 1, recently updated and now known as ISO/IEC 17799, provides the foundation for the best practice security management of the national health service&#039;s information assets. Central arrangements have already been established that enable all NHS organisations to obtain a full reference copy of the standard for their own use. In addition, key requirements of the ISO/IEC17799 are included within the existing NHS Information Governance Framework, along with relevant topic guidance and illustrations. These are available to NHS organisations through the centrally provided and maintained NHS Information Governance Toolkit service.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51115w31.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_59">The NHS Information Governance Toolkit supports NHS organisations to meet information security requirements but also numerous other closely associated requirements including best practice in terms of records management, information quality, data protection and the confidential management of records. Bringing these requirements together in this way has eliminated considerable duplication of effort as each of these aspects of information governance are based on similar principles and working practices but in the past they were addressed separately. The Information Governance Toolkit is provided free of charge to NHS organisations and replaced a range of existing data collections and has generated significant savings in staff time and resources across a wide range of NHS organisations.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51115w31.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_60">Compliance assessment of NHS information security management, is based upon the ISO/IEC 17799 framework and is currently achieved on an annual basis through self-assessed organisational attainment reporting within the NHS Information Governance Toolkit. A review of these arrangements is currently under way and that will further refine and extend assurance criterion. These new arrangements should also in future form a significant part of formal NHS audit programmes at both local and national level.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51115w31.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_61">In addition to contractual obligations, it is also intended that equivalent information governance assurance reporting arrangements will shortly be developed and implemented for a range of non-NHS information partner organisations, including those private sector organisations treating NHS patients. These requirements already exist for commercial service provider organisations involved in the delivery of the NHS National Programme for Information Technology and whose security management performance is routinely monitored against the ISO/IEC 17799.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51115w31.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_62">Although there is no current requirement for NHS organisations to seek or maintain a formal BS7799 part 2:2002 registration, NHS organisations are able to do 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>15 Nov 2005 : Column 1165W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
so as a local decision. This part 2 of the original BS7799 standard has recently been replaced and is now known internationally as ISO/IEC 27001:2005. The Information Governance toolkit was developed, in part, to provide a cost effective alternative to individual NHS organisations requiring assistance from independent qualified lead accreditation consultants at commercial rates. As formal registration is not an NHS requirement, there are no central records of NHS organisations that may already have chosen to formally register or that may be considering doing so.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51115w31.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_63">On 18 October 2005, a departmental official met with two representatives of the British Standards Institute to outline and discuss the NHS approach to BS7799. The British Standards Institute are therefore now fully aware of the significant steps taken by the Department to both adopt and promote the values of this standard to NHS organisations and relevant others.

 It is not possible to calculate drug price inflation.

These factors can vary from year to year, from drug to drug, and vary in magnitude. This complexity prevents us from being able to calculate drug price inflation.

Therefore, radiotherapy appointments are outside of the current scope of the choose and book service.

 We continue to work with international partners, including in our role as presidency of the EU, in support of the African Union&#039;s (AU) efforts to resolve the crisis in Darfur. The EU has recently given political approval to provide a further &#8364;70 million from the African Peace Facility to support the AU Mission in Sudan (AMIS), bringing the total EU contribution to AMIS to &#8364;162 million. My noble Friend the Foreign and Commonwealth Office Minister for Africa (Lord Triesman of Tottenham), also discussed the matter with the EU&#039;s High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy, Javier Solana, during the EU Troika ministerial visit to Sudan in October. Funding for the AU mission was also discussed at a meeting for key international partners, including the European Commission and the Council Secretariat which we hosted in London on 1 November.

Notes:<br>

1. UKvisas does not have data about staff numbers previous to financial year 2004&#150;05.<br>

2. The above figures are based on the number of full time UK based entry clearance officers (ECOs) and entry clearance managers (ECMs) at each visa section. However, visa sections also rely on locally engaged staff and officers on temporary duty or short term duties to operate. Furthermore, some ECOs or ECMs also jointly hold other Foreign and Commonwealth Office positions and therefore entry clearance may only be a proportion of their work load.<br>

 The census of population provides information on the religious composition of each electoral ward. However, ward boundaries are reviewed periodically, and the results are presented for the wards current at the time of the census, The outputs from the last three censuses were thus based on different ward structures and it is not possible to track change at ward level over time directly from available census outputs. Estimates on a single ward geography could be made for each census using best-fit approximations, but this would require additional work and the interpretation of any observed trends would need to take cognisance of factors such as changes in the questionnaire wording, differences in the levels of non-response to the religion question, different population bases and different treatments of non-response in each census.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what the extent of the level of interaction is between safefood and the Foods Standards Agency; and what assessment he has made of the merits of reviewing the relationship between the two bodies to promote effectiveness and cost efficiency.

<p><a name="st_157"><a name="51115w41.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Woodward: </b> 
 Section 34 of the Food Standards Act 1999, which established the Food Standards Agency (FSA), states that the FSA must take account of, and consult with, the Food Safety Promotion Board (FSPB)&#151;also known as safefood&#151;in carrying out its activities.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51115w41.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_107">There has been significant contact between the FSA Board, particularly through the Northern Ireland member on that body, and the FSPB. In the current 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>15 Nov 2005 : Column 1198W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
year, the Northern Ireland member has met with the chair of the FSPB Advisory Board, and addressed a formal meeting of the FSPB governing body. The FSPB chief executive has also made a presentation on relationships between his organisation and the FSA at a meeting of the Nl Food Advisory Committee, which is chaired by the FSA&#039;s Northern Ireland Board member.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51115w41.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_108">At official level, a concordat has been established between the FSA and FSPB to guide working relations. Two formal meetings of senior management teams from both organisations have taken place, with the next meeting planned for March 2006,
</p>


<p>
<a name="51115w41.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_109">Practical examples of both organisations working together in the past year include: the Director of FSA Nl Chairs an All Island Nutrition Forum&#151;the Secretariat is provided by the FSPB; representation from FSA Nl on the FSPB&#039;s Consumer Focused Review; a jointly resourced stand at the Balmoral Show; jointly co-ordinated and sponsored National Food Safety Week initiatives in Northern Ireland; a jointly organised and resourced seminar in Dublin, on the subject of salt consumption. Both organisations continue to explore how they jointly carry out their work in an effective and efficient way, and this scope for review is enshrined in the UK legislation and in the concordat between the FSA and FSPB. The relationship between both bodies continues to develop and this can only further enhance the effectiveness of their joint work and ensure cost efficiencies for the taxpayer. A good example of this are plans in 2007 for FSA to carry out a major UK-wide survey on food consumption, the National Diet and Nutrition Survey, which will for the first time include a sample for Northern Ireland. The costs of the sample for Northern Ireland are high, and could not be met out of the current FSA NI budget. The FSPB has agreed to make a significant financial contribution to facilitate the survey.
