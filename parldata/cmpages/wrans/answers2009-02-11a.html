 Parental employment is the single biggest determinant of family income and children in out-of-work families are at a high risk of poverty. Work, therefore, continues to be the most sustainable route out of poverty. Our reforms of the welfare system have focused on helping people move into work, and increased employment has played an important role in reducing the number of children in relative poverty by 600,000 since 1998-99.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_298"><a name="90211w0003.htm_para1"><a name="09021182000254">In particular, we have reduced the number of children in workless households by around 445,000 since 1997. The proportion of children in workless households currently stands at 15.5 per cent., down by 3.3 percentage points since 1997. We have increased the Great Britain lone parent employment rate which now stands at 56.3 per cent. The lone parent employment rate has increased by 11.6 percentage points since 1997 and this translates into an extra 320,000 lone parents in employment.</p>

As such, the 2007 regulations have very limited application to the fire and rescue service and no review is considered to be needed. In 2006, the Department for Communities and Local Government published guidance for the fire and rescue service on the practical application of the Work at Height Regulations 2005 to fire and rescue service activities.

 The Carbon Emissions Reduction Target (CERT) is the Government's principal policy on insulating homes in Great Britain. Under CERT the major energy suppliers have an obligation to promote household carbon saving measures such as insulation. The most important measures for hard-to-treat homes are solid wall insulation and central heating. Suppliers installed around 80,000 heating measures and around 40,000 solid wall measures under the previous obligation period to March 2008, mostly in partnership with social landlords. We recognise that the high up-front cost of solid wall insulation makes it difficult for suppliers to justify this investment. Under CERT we have therefore introduced specific incentives to help improve the financial viability of these measures, with a particular focus on solid-walled homes which are not on the gas grid.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_327"><a name="90211w0005.htm_para6"><a name="09021182000507">We also continue to assess innovative products, including solid wall insulation, for inclusion in the Warm Front scheme&#151;the Government's main fuel poverty programme in England (fuel poverty is a devolved matter). There will be a focus on improving the energy efficiency of hard-to-treat properties in the forthcoming Community Energy Saving Programme, the proposals for which will be consulted on shortly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_328"><a name="90211w0005.htm_para7"><a name="09021182000508">In addition to insulation, through CERT we also promote other energy efficiency measures, such as low energy lamps and high efficiency appliances. We also recognise the value of providing information and advice on energy use and the best steps to make a home more energy efficient. We already provide an on-line carbon calculator, and will shortly be consulting on new provisions to encourage the deployment of real-time energy displays and home energy efficiency advice under CERT.</p>

The UK is a member of the Contact Group on Piracy off the Coast of Somalia which met for the first time in New York on 14 January 2009, and we will host the Working Group tasked to encourage greater international co-ordination and co-operation.

We continue our efforts to address these, and are encouraging the European Commission and other partners to increase targeted support for governance/economic development in Somalia, in particular in coastal areas. In 2007-08, the UK provided over &#163;25 million of humanitarian and development assistance to Somalia. For 2008-09, this was increased to &#163;30 million.</p>

Since Operation Atalanta established the Maritime Security Centre for the Horn of Africa in December 2008 no vessel registered with it has been successfully pirated.</p>

 The UK has not participated in the EU Programme for Deprived Persons (Food for the Needy Scheme) since 1998. The UK Government decided collectively to cease their participation in the scheme because of the generally low levels of intervention stocks and because there was a lack of interest in the scheme, primarily due to the bureaucratic procedures that apply in order to reduce the risk of fraud. In short, the Government concluded that the Scheme did not represent good value for money.</p>

 No specific estimates of the effects of bovine Tuberculosis (bTB) on income and employment in the farming sector have been made.

This work includes looking at income and employment. The final report will be published on the DEFRA website once peer review is complete.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_419"><a name="90211w0014.htm_para1"><a name="09021189000876">The Government are committed to addressing the housing, employment and social needs of rural communities in ways that are sustainable and compatible with the protection of the countryside. Our advice to local planning authorities about development in rural areas is set out in Planning Policy Guidance Note 2, &#147;Green Belts&#148; (PPG2), Planning Policy Statement 3, &#147;Housing&#148; (PPS3) and Planning Policy Statement 7, &#147;Sustainable Development in Rural Areas&#148; (PPS7). For example, a key principle of PPS7 is that new building development in the open countryside away from existing settlements, or outside areas allocated for development in the local plan, should be strictly controlled.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_420"><a name="90211w0014.htm_para2"><a name="09021189000877">We set up the Affordable Rural Housing Commission in summer 2005 to look into the availability of affordable housing in rural areas. Following publication of the Commission&#146;s report in May 2006, we have responded positively to the majority of their (over 100) recommendations where they were directed at Communities and Local Government. Many of the recommendations are embodied in Planning Policy Statement 3, &#147;Housing&#148; (PPS3).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_421"><a name="90211w0014.htm_para3"><a name="09021189000878">Published in November 2006, PPS3 highlights the need to provide market and affordable housing in all areas, including rural areas. The delivery of housing in rural areas should respect the key principles underpinning PPS3 of providing high quality housing that contributes to the creation and maintenance of sustainable rural communities in market towns and villages. New housing, particularly in the examples of very small villages and hamlets, would need to be carefully considered and managed so as not to have adverse impacts on those areas which would actually undermine sustainable development objectives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_422"><a name="90211w0014.htm_para4"><a name="09021189000879">We also invited the hon. Member for Truro and St. Austell (Matthew Taylor) to carry out an independent review of economics and affordable housing provision in the countryside. His report, Living Working Countryside, came out in July 2008, and its recommendations are being given thorough consideration: we will publish our response shortly.</p>

<i> [holding answer 2 February 2009]:</i> The shift patterns of police officers is an operational matter, and as such is for the chief constable to determine. However, the Government published a review of the Licensing Act 2003 in March 2008 which revealed a mixed picture in terms of its impact. The change in opening hours has not led to the widespread problems some people feared. Overall, crime and alcohol consumption are down, but there has been a small increase in alcohol-related violence in the early hours of the morning and some communities have seen a rise in disorder. Our main conclusion is that people are using the freedoms, but people are not sufficiently using the considerable powers granted by the Act to tackle problems, and that there is a need to rebalance action towards enforcement and crack down on irresponsible behaviour.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_461"><a name="90211w0019.htm_para0"><a name="090211100001458">Additionally, we have introduced legislation for a new, mandatory code of practice. This will contain some compulsory national conditions, banning the most irresponsible practices and promotions which encourage people to drink excessively, or promote a binge-drinking culture. This will not affect the majority of businesses, small or large, who behave responsibly&#151;but will target those that do not.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_462"><a name="90211w0019.htm_para1"><a name="090211100001459">Further, the Government are funding a &#163;4.5 million enforcement campaign, in addition to existing resources from the police, local authorities and others, focused on 40-50 priority areas and led by ACPO Commander Simon O&#146;Brien. There is additional funding for the 20 priority PCT areas, and a &#163;10 million investment in national awareness campaigns.</p>

 The Government have been clarifying the performance management framework for the police for some time, to help the police focus more effectively on the issues that concern the public. The top down numerical target which concerned frontline officers the most&#151;to increase the total number of offences brought to justice from the 2004 Public Service Agreements (PSAs)&#151;ceased to have effect at the end of 2007-08. The Policing Green Paper made further significant changes as part of its broader proposals for reforming the relationship between the police service, the public and the Home Office. In particular, the Government committed to a single top down target for police forces&#151;on improving public confidence.</p>

Centrally set 10-year race employment targets relating to the recruitment, retention and progression of black and minority ethnic police officers and staff come to an end on 31 March 2009, when a final report against a centrally set progression target will also be made.</p>

2. Because of rounding, figures may not add up to totals shown.<br>
3. <i> Caveats:</i><br>
The figures do not equate to the number of individual nationals who were granted permits because they include those applications approved to extend or amend an existing permit or where the individual has moved to another job with a different employer. Not all those who were granted a permit took up the job and some may have been refused entry clearance or further leave to remain.<br>

 The Department has not made an assessment of the effects of energy prices on local authority costs. However, a recent report by the Audit Commission &#147;Crunch Time? The Impact of the Economic Downturn on Local Government Finances.&#148; identified expenditure on gas, electricity, fuel and food as areas which have seen the highest level of inflation in council expenditure. However, it also found that this made up less than 2 per cent. of total local authority spending and that inflation was now reducing, easing some of the in-year pressures. It reported that fuel prices are now lower than they were in April 2008. The Government expect the significant fall in the price of crude oil to feed into the cost of other goods and to impact on energy bills in due course.</p>

 In exercising their planning functions local planning authorities are required to have regard to the Government's overarching planning policy on parking which is set out in Planning Policy Guidance note 13: &#145;Transport&#146; (2001), one of the key objectives of which is to reduce the need to travel, especially by car. PPG13 is clear that local authority policies in preparing their development plans should set maximum levels of parking for broad classes of development, including residential and non-residential development, and that there should be no minimum standards for development, other than parking for disabled people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_490"><a name="90211w0022.htm_para5"><a name="090211100002157">In relation to residential development, Planning Policy Guidance note 3: &#145;Housing&#146; (2000) advised that car parking standards that resulted in development with more than 1.5 off-street car parking spaces across a local authority area on average were unlikely to reflect the Government's emphasis on securing sustainable residential environments. This advice has subsequently being replaced by Planning Policy Statement 3: &#145;Housing&#146; (2006), which gives local planning authorities the flexibility, consistent with the objectives of PPG13, to set their own residential parking policies taking account of the expected levels of car ownership, the importance of promoting good design and the need to use land efficiently.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_491"><a name="90211w0022.htm_para6"><a name="090211100002158">In terms of non-residential development, PPG13 sets out national maximum car parking standards. Again, within the context of reducing the need to travel by car required by PPG13, draft PPS4: &#145;Planning for Sustainable Economic Development&#146; (2007) proposes to devolve responsibility for setting non-residential car parking standards to local authorities so that they can reflect local circumstances. We are currently working to finalise the policy.</p>

Friend the Secretary of State for Health (Alan Johnson) made a further written statement on 21 April 2008 marking the end of the deep clean initiative for 2007-08. The same statement confirmed that SHAs had made available all the funding promised for the programme, a total of &#163;62.5 million. The spend for Yorkshire and Humber SHA was &#163;5 million.</p>

They generally fall into two key areas: (i) changes to the scope of the data collected (for example, over time an increased number of treatment function codes (TFCs) have been collected), and (ii) greater disaggregation over time (for example, separately collecting non-consultant-led activity from 2006-07). The changes over time mean that it is difficult to make comparisons between years without fully understanding the underlying changes. The figures presented are based on the full scope of outpatient attendance costs collected in Reference Costs in each year, and are therefore the most accurate reflection of the average cost per outpatient attendance in each year, based on the data collected.</p>

Depending on circumstances, they may refer the issue to the pharmacist inspector. It is one of CSCI's referral criteria to contact a pharmacist inspector and this may result in inspection of the care home and a resulting report with requirements and recommendations. If the overdose is a result of an incorrect prescription from the general practitioner, the pharmacist inspector will liaise via the local intelligence network through the national health service accountable officer at the relevant primary care trust, who will deal with the issue.</p>

 The increase in the VAT cash accounting scheme threshold in 2007 was estimated to cost the Exchequer around &#163;120 million in 2007-08, as published in table A1.1 of the Financial Statement and Budget Report 2007. This represents the amount of VAT receipts delayed from 2007-08 into 2008-09 as a result of increased membership of the scheme. The effect on individual businesses depends on their turnover and how quickly they make and receive payments in the course of their business activities.

 The child poverty pilots announced in Budget 2008 will help lift children out of poverty and, importantly, will guide the Government as they work to eradicate child poverty. The pilots will run until April 2011. They will enable local authorities, and their partners, to use resources in the way that makes sense in their locality, test out new ideas and create an evidence base to inform the strategy to develop a sustainable solution to eradicating child poverty by 2020. Evaluation is an essential part of this process and we will ensure that all key findings are published and disseminated, including lessons learnt from the pilots as they progress.</p>

These will include: attending and taking part in top quality theatre and dance performances; attending national and local exhibitions, museums and heritage sites; learning a musical instrument and singing in ensembles; producing creative writing and artwork; and making films. 10 pathfinders are trialling ways of delivering a structured cultural offer.

 Personal, Social, Health and Economic (PSHE) education provides children and young people with the knowledge and skills they need to make informed choices in a range of contexts related to health and safety. Children learn about basic and emergency first aid, as well as where and how to obtain health information, how to recognise and follow health and safety procedures and ways of reducing risk and minimising harm in risky situations.</p>

At the same time we launched an independent review of how this might be achieved in the most effective and practicable way. Sir Alasdair Macdonald, the head teacher of Morpeth school in Tower Hamlets, is conducting the review and will report in April 2009. Proposals for the statutory implementation of PSHE education will be the subject of a full public consultation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_606"><a name="90211w0032.htm_para1"><a name="090211100003592">Advocacy gives voice to disempowered and vulnerable women. Scaling-up expands health services and the availability of neglected high impact interventions, safe abortion and contraception. We also invest in increasing girls&#146; education, improving women&#146;s rights and increasing research capacity in developing countries.</p>

The UK will provide &#163;47 million in life-saving support this year and is one of the leading donors in the cholera response and the UN food programme.
