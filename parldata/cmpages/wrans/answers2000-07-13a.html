<a name="00713w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 Gas plays, and will continue to play, an important part in meeting the UK's energy needs. In 1999, gas accounted for 33.2 per cent. of UK primary energy requirements; and, from within that total, gas generation accounted for 38.5 per cent. of electricity supplied. A working paper produced by my Department suggests that the contribution of gas to primary energy demand in the year 2020 will be of the order of 47.5-49.2 per cent., and its share of fuel used for electricity generation to be in the range 57-64 per cent..

 The projections within "Energy Projections for the UK: Working Paper", issued by my Department in March, include assumptions on the timing of closure of Magnox stations. The projected levels of carbon dioxide release in the Kyoto target period are unaffected by the recent announcements.

 The creative and communications industries contributed an estimated &#163;25 billion to the economy in 1995.

Early indications, drawing on National Statistics, are that the corresponding estimate for the most recently available data 1997 is &#163;33 billion, accounting for approaching 5 per cent. of Gross Domestic Product. In addition the telecommunications services industry contributed 1.9 per cent. to GDP.

 The Handling Agreement for settling claims for respiratory disease were formally signed in September last year. To date we have received around 108,000 claims. So far over 52,000 spirometry tests, the first part of the medical tests, have been carried out. A further 12,000 appointments have been made at 34 centres nationwide. Together this represents over 90 per cent. of the total live claims received. Over 9,000 claimants have received full and final offers based on their spirometry result; of these 2,600 have been accepted. The remainder will progress to the full MAP.

 In 1999, Thailand was the UK's 39th largest export market with exports of &#163;468 million. Exports for the first four-months of 2000 have shown an increase of 59 per cent. over the same period of 1999. Top export products are electrical machinery, power generation equipment, industrial machinery and leather goods.

 A stable economic climate is vital to stimulate development. The DTI aims to promote enterprise and innovation and is particularly keen to support successful, sustainable business start-ups. It has set up the Small Business Service (SBS) specifically to champion and service the needs of small business and act as a strong voice on their behalf within Government. The Chief Executive of the SBS, David Irwin, has 20 years experience in the North-east of helping people to start up and grow their businesses. Small businesses make up nearly 99 per cent. of all businesses in the UK and employ more than half the total workforce. The North-east has fewer than its fair share of new start-ups. This fact is recognised by the Regional Development Agency, One NorthEast, who have published their Regional Economic Strategy. One of the key objectives is to address this problem and the new European objective 2 Single Programming Document will be an important vehicle to drive this forward.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00713w04.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Alan Johnson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 12 July 2000]:</i> A compliance cost assessment was published by the Department of Trade and Industry in 1994, when the legislation was made to require loose goods to be sold in metric weights after 31 December 1999. The main cost for traders was identified as the conversion or replacement of imperial weighing machines. The average cost of conversion was estimated to be &#163;100 per machine. The starting price for replacement was estimated to be &#163;450 per machine. It was further estimated that 80 per cent. of machines were capable of conversion.

 <i>[holding answer 12 July 2000]:</i> The Department of Trade and Industry is not responsible for enforcing the use by traders of prescribed units of measurement for the sale of goods. Enforcement is undertaken by the local authorities, as part of their wider responsibility for trading standards. Each authority decides how many staff it will employ on trading standards work, and the allocation of staff time (and therefore of staff costs) between the different areas of enforcement.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00713w04.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Alan Johnson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 12 July 2000]:</i> Weights and measures legislation includes powers for local authority inspectors of weights and measures to seize and detain equipment in circumstances where they believe the equipment is liable to be forfeited.

<P>
<a name="00713w05.html_wqn0"><B> Mrs. Ellman: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what steps he has taken to set up regional resource centres for urban development as recommended in the Rogers report, "Towards an Urban Renaissance".  [129599]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00713w05.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 The Government agree with the Task Force about the importance of improving urban development skills.
<P>

<a name="00713w05.html_para0">At the national level we have commissioned a feasibility study of a recommendation made by the Social Exclusion Unit's Policy Action Team 16 (Learning Lessons), for the creation of a National Centre for Neighbourhood Renewal. This would provide the training, knowledge and skills needed to support neighbourhood renewal activity and would help to achieve many of the same ends as the Task Force's proposed Regional Resource Centres. Consultation meetings are taking place later this month on the results of the feasibility study.
<P>

<a name="00713w05.html_para1">At the regional level there is also a great deal happening on the ground to improve urban development skills particularly in response to the Continuing Professional Development initiative. Academic institutions across the country are now getting together with regeneration practitioners and professional institutions in putting together relevant good practice guidance and training packages for everyone from existing professionals to community volunteers.
<P>

<a name="00713w05.html_para2">The Government are also working closely with the professional institutions and local government to improve training in urban design skills and are considering, with the Local Government Association, the way resources can be deployed more effectively in the pursuit of excellence in this area. A skills seminar is being held by the Minister for Housing and Planning on 13 July to take this forward.

 As the then Minister for Transport announced on 11 March 1999, the South-east and East of England Regional Air Services (SERAS) study has started from the position that nothing is ruled in and nothing is ruled out.

<P>

<a name="00713w05.html_para3">We are currently in the early stages of assessing a wide range of options, both at existing airports and possible new sites. We will proceed through successive sifts to narrow down options to a final shortlist, on which there will be a full public consultation before Ministers come to decisions.
<P>

<a name="00713w05.html_para4">It is expected that the study will be completed by spring or summer 2001, to be followed by public consultation.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00713w05.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 The South-east and East of England Regional Air Services study (SERAS) is expected to be completed by spring or summer 2001, to be followed by public consultation. The results will feed into an Air Transport White Paper, which is intended to provide a framework for the future development of aviation and airports in the United Kingdom.
<P>

<a name="00713w05.html_para5">Once the White Paper is published, regional planning guidance and local development plans will need to be reviewed to take account of policies that emerge from the White Paper.
<P>

<a name="00713w05.html_para6">In the meantime, before the SERAS study has been completed and the White Paper published, planning applications for development in the Gatwick Airport area will be subject to normal provisions of the planning system and will be determined against existing national, regional and local policies.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00713w05.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 There were 15 changes in the method of determining Standard Spending Assessments (SSAs) for the 1998-99 Local Government Finance Settlement; and 20 changes for the 1999-2000 Local Government Finance Settlement.
<P>

<a name="00713w05.html_para7">The July 1998 Local Government White Paper announced a 3-year review of Revenue Grant Distribution. It said that the Government did not expect to make fresh changes to the method of calculation of SSAs except where there are changes in the functions of councils, or the funding of particular services.
<P>

<a name="00713w05.html_para8">In 2000-01 there were therefore only limited adjustments to SSAs to accommodate the establishment of the Greater London Authority and related changes, most notably those arising from the alterations to the boundary of the Metropolitan Police District and the Essex, Hertfordshire and Surrey police areas.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will make a statement on the effectiveness of the Government Office for Yorkshire and the Humber in assisting regeneration projects in the region.  [128642]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00713w05.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 12 July 2000]:</i> The Government Office for Yorkshire and the Humber (GOYH) continues to contribute effectively to maximising competitiveness and prosperity in the region, and supporting integrated policies for an inclusive society. In particular it has worked closely with Yorkshire Forward (the Regional Development Agency) to support it in its first full year of operation.
<P>

<a name="00713w05.html_para10">During the past year GOYH has managed and developed the wide range of Government programmes and initiatives that contribute to the regeneration of the region. Examples include:
<P>

<a name="00713w05.html_para11">New Deal for Communities (NDC): Bradford and Hull have each received &#163;50 million and &#163;55 million respectively over 10 years under the first round of NDC and Doncaster and Sheffield have been invited to submit bids for schemes.
<P>

<a name="00713w05.html_para12">Housing Investment Programme: &#163;207 million was allocated to local authorities for 2000-01, 46 per cent. more than the previous year.
<P>

<a name="00713w05.html_para13">Regional Selective Assistance (RSA): RSA to the value of over &#163;15 million was offered to businesses. This is expected to lead to capital investment of &#163;207 million and the creation/safeguarding of over 6,200 jobs.
<P>

<a name="00713w05.html_para14">European Funding: GOYH has worked hard with regional partners to ensure that all available resources under the last round of European funds were committed 



<P>
<P><I>13 Jul 2000 : Column: 626W</I><P>
by the closing date of 31 December 1999. Over &#163;560 million of funding has been committed to support a wide range of projects that maximise the benefits to the region. GOYH continues to work closely with partners to ensure that the new European programmes for 2000-06 are ready to start in 2000.
<P>

<a name="00713w05.html_para15">Local Transport: Last year the region's local authorities received a total allocation of &#163;109 million for their provisional local transport plans (LTPs). GOYH has continued to support the local authorities with the preparation of their full LTPs, which will cover the five years to 2005-06.
<P>

<a name="00713w05.html_para16">Working with Local Government: GOYH has continued to support the modernisation of local government and has contributed to the assessment process for Beacon council and Invest to Save applications from local authorities.
<P>

<a name="00713w05.html_para17">In looking to the future, the Government Office will continue to work closely with Yorkshire Forward and other partners to deliver the shared vision of "A world class, prosperous region".

<P>
<P>
<a name="00713w06.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 The Government recognise that transport provision is particularly important to people in rural areas because jobs and services are more widely dispersed than in urban areas. In the 10-Year Plan for transport, we are developing a package of measures to improve transport provision in rural areas and we shall be developing our ideas further in the forthcoming Rural White Paper.

 The Deputy Prime Minister gave Instructions and Guidance to the Franchising Director on 29 September 1999 about rail franchise replacement asking him to promote the use of bicycles by seeking the provision of reasonable facilities on board new rolling stock and at stations. The replacement franchise agreements will contain provisions relating to both the carriage of bicycles on trains and the provision of storage facilities for bicycles at railway stations.

The part of the peninsula directly associated with the Millennium Dome covers land north of the Jubilee line and North Greenwich Transport Interchange. English Partnerships' expenditure for this area amounts to &#163;15.53 million. The sales proceeds returning to the Department will be determined in the light of the Dome Legacy Competition.

 General provisions exist within all the private finance contracts for payments to be made by the contractor in relation to termination on contractor default. The contract for the Croydon Tramlink includes an incentive share agreement whereby Transport for London will share in any refinancing benefits. Transport for London would also receive a share of any excess revenues obtained by the concessionaire. A refinancing of the Channel Tunnel Rail Link (CTRL) would benefit the Government by reducing the requirement for operating subsidy.

<P>
<a name="00713w08.html_spnew0"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The current industrial dispute involving Rail, Maritime and Transport Union (RMT) members of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary commenced in February this year following their rejection of the 1999 pay offer, which has subsequently been implemented by administrative action. The issue at the centre of the dispute is a demand by the RMT for additional Earned Voyage Leave. While nothing further can be done for 1999, RMT members have been guaranteed improvements to leave in addition to pay both for the current year and in years to come. It is disappointing therefore that they are continuing the action.
<P>

<a name="00713w08.html_para0">RFA vessels that are directly involved in front-line operations or on humanitarian relief tasks have been exempted from the individual action by the RMT. Changes are being made to other vessels' movements and deployments when necessary to minimise the effect of such action. RMT members are however now taking continuous action. This will mean that ships in port will be prevented from sailing, as happened with Sir Geraint on 11 July. In these circumstances, my Department has no alternative other than to apply appropriate sanctions.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security (1) what plans he has to require local authorities to spend a greater proportion of their budgets on Housing Benefit exceptional hardship payments; and if he will make a statement;  [130241]
<P>
<UL>(2) what plans he has to prevent local authorities from retaining money unspent from their Housing Benefit exceptional hardship payment budgets; and if he will make a statement;  [130242]

<P>
<P>
<a name="00713w09.html_spnew1"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 Using provisions in the Child Support, Pensions and Social Security Bill, we propose, from April 2001, to replace the current system of exceptional hardship and exceptional circumstances payments with a new scheme of purely discretionary payments to meet housing costs, which are not part of the Housing Benefit or Council Tax Benefit schemes.
<P>

<a name="00713w09.html_para2">Under these provisions, local authorities will be provided with a sum of money from central Government towards this expenditure, and we propose that they will be required to return any of the money that is not spent. Since local authorities will not be able to keep anything they do not spend, this should encourage them to use the money for the purpose intended.
<P>

<a name="00713w09.html_para3">Although claimants will not be able to appeal the decisions made by local authorities on these discretionary payments, they will have an internal right of review. Local authorities will be able to revisit decisions and take account of representations made.
<P>

<a name="00713w09.html_para4">Once these provisions are in place, we will be involving the Local Authority Associations in discussions on how we can ensure that the right criteria for payment are set and claimants made aware of their entitlement.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security, pursuant to his answer of 10 March 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 843W, on housing benefit, (1) what assessment he has made of the impact of the introduction of the housing benefit verification framework on delays in paying housing benefit; and if he will make a statement;  [130068]

 The verification framework sets out what local authorities should be doing to safeguard the gateway into benefit.
<P>

<a name="00713w09.html_para5">We recognise that implementing the framework may create some short term administrative delays in those local authorities which have not previously operated an adequate verification or checking system.
<P>

<a name="00713w09.html_para6">The Department has commissioned in-depth research to provide more information on authorities' experiences of setting-up and operating the framework. This will include information on the impact on the time taken to determine claims.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security what assessment he has made of the difficulties that claimants may have accessing Housing Benefit offices during their opening hours in order to comply with the requirements of the Housing Benefit Verification Framework; and if he will make a statement.  [130065]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00713w09.html_spnew3"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 The administration of Housing Benefit is the statutory responsibility of local authorities. The provision of adequate access to services is a matter for individual local authorities.
<P>

<a name="00713w09.html_para7">The Verification Framework does not require that clients must attend a benefit office in order to verify their entitlement to benefit. The Framework is flexible enough to allow each authority to provide the services most appropriate to its own area and clientele. These can include dealing with evidence gathering by post or by visiting, as well as by clients calling at an office. It is open to councils to provide alternative venues for clients who wish to produce documents in person. For example, some councils have trained staff in neighbourhood offices and libraries to collect and verify evidence on behalf of their benefit colleagues.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security, pursuant to his answer of 4 July 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 155W, what estimate he has made of the <i>(a)</i> cost, <i>(b)</i> technical difficulties and <i>(c)</i> improvement in accuracy of increasing the sample size of the area benefit reviews.  [130175]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00713w09.html_spnew4"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 The estimated cost of the current Housing Benefit review programme is &#163;1.5 million for 1999-2000. This represents set up costs of the project and costs associated with staff recruitment. The project is expected to cost &#163;2.1 million per year thereafter at current prices.




<P>
<P><I>13 Jul 2000 : Column: 640W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="00713w09.html_para8">Technical difficulties are being overcome by incorporating Housing Benefit into the Benefits Agency's Area Benefit Review (ABR) programme. The ABRs are a rolling programme of benefit reviews, which provide estimates of losses due to claimant fraud and error. This procedure is well established and will use the technical expertise the agency has acquired over a number of years.
<P>

<a name="00713w09.html_para9">We plan to sample 5,010 additional cases each year to estimate the level of fraud and error in standard Housing Benefit. This gives us a level of accuracy around the central estimate of between &#177;10 and 20 per cent. of the central estimate. For example if incorrect expenditure was estimated to be 10 per cent. of total expenditure we would expect the actual value to between 8 and 12 per cent. Increasing the sample size produces diminishing improvements in the accuracy of the estimates. For example, doubling the sample size to 10,000 cases would produce an estimated 25 per cent. improvement in the accuracy of the estimates, i.e. the level of accuracy would then be 7.5-15 per cent.

(4) Includes Disabled Persons Tax Credit as per table C12 of the Financial Statement and Budget Report March 2000.<P>

<P>

(5) As per tables A 13 and A 2.1 of the Financial Statement and Budget Report March 2000.<P>

<P>

(6) Children are dependants under 18 years of age. The increase in 2000-01 and later years is a reflection of the &#163;4.35 per week increase in child personal allowance from October 2000 and the fact that from April 2000 the allowance for a child under 11 has been equalised with that for an 11-16 year old child.<P>

<P>

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. Expenditure is consistent with the Departmental Report 2000.<P>

2. Real terms expenditure is calculated using revised GDP deflators issued 29 June 2000.<P>

3. The relationship between earnings and benefit expenditure is complex and the information requested is not readily available.<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="00713w10.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Mandelson: </B> 
 The Northern Ireland Office and its agencies do not have approved lists of manufacturers for either cars or commercial vehicles. Vehicles are sourced using either UK national framework agreements or by open competitive tender. Procurement (i.e. purchasing or leasing) for the NIO is normally undertaken using the open procedure. The procurement practice for such contracts is governed by national and international regulations, in particular EC Directives. These Directives mean that government must conduct public purchasing according to three basic principles--openness and transparency of award procedures, genuine competition in contract award, and no unlawful discrimination.
<P>

<a name="00713w10.html_para0">In certain circumstances (e.g. security) the restricted procedure is used. Where this procedure is used companies may apply to be included on a restricted list of approved suppliers. Their inclusion on such lists is subject to their meeting the required criteria.

 Consultation documents were issued by my Department on 17 April to seek views on proposals to introduce a requirement for the tagging or tattooing of all sheep and goats in England before they leave their holding of birth. The consultation period ended on 12 June.
<P>

<a name="00713w11.html_para1">We have taken account of the comments given and we now intend to introduce new Sheep and Goat identification legislation in England in early September. Given the need to ensure that the industry has enough time to order and be supplied with the appropriate tags, we have decided that the tagging and tattooing requirements of the new legislation will not take effect until 1 January 2001. We will be writing to all sheep and goat keepers with full details of the new rules shortly.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what was the outcome of this year's annual meeting of the International Whaling Commission.  [131061]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00713w11.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The International Whaling Commission's 52nd annual meeting was held in Adelaide from 3 to 6 July. I attended the meeting, together with officials from the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the Department of the Environment, Transport and Regions and representatives of environmental organisations.
<P>

<a name="00713w11.html_para2">Australia and New Zealand put forward a proposal to create a South Pacific Whale Sanctuary. This would have complemented the existing Southern Ocean Sanctuary by protecting the breeding areas and migration routes of whales that feed in the Southern ocean. It was endorsed by the South Pacific Forum, which represents all the range states affected by the proposed sanctuary. The UK was one of the co-sponsors of the proposal, and I spoke strongly in favour of it. But although it was supported by the majority of those voting, it unfortunately did not 



<P>
<P><I>13 Jul 2000 : Column: 647W</I><P>
receive the three-quarters of votes cast necessary for adoption. Both the Australian and New Zealand Governments indicated that they would be submitting the proposal next year; the UK will again be supporting it.
<P>

<a name="00713w11.html_para3">The UK took the lead in proposing a resolution condemning Japan's whaling under special permit (so-called 'scientific' whaling) and urging Japan not to proceed with its plans for a new programme in the North Pacific; this would involve, among other things, taking for the first time sperm and bryde's, as well as minke, whales. In introducing the resolution, I made it clear that the UK Government regarded this as a serious development and one that we would continue to raise both bilaterally and in other fora. The resolution was adopted by a large majority, as was a similar resolution on Japanese whaling under special permit in the Southern Ocean Sanctuary.
<P>

<a name="00713w11.html_para4">A resolution was adopted by consensus establishing a programme of further work on the Revised Management Scheme (RMS), which is being developed to regulate all aspects of any future commercial whaling. This followed a two day working group on the RMS which immediately preceded the IWC meeting itself. The resolution makes it clear that it does not affect, or in any way commit Governments to lift, the moratorium on commercial whaling. In agreeing to form part of the consensus we emphasised that the resolution did not commit us to accepting anything that we had not already agreed to, and that it did not preclude the inclusion of other elements in the RMS.
<P>

<a name="00713w11.html_para5">At the meeting I reaffirmed the UK's opposition to whaling. There was only a limited discussion of the Irish proposals for a package of measures on whaling; we made it clear that the UK's position on these remains unchanged. I am pleased to say that efforts by Japan to secure a quota of 50 minke whales, despite the moratorium on commercial whaling, was again defeated by a substantial majority. We also strongly criticised Norway's continued whaling activities.
<P>

<a name="00713w11.html_para6">I made clear the UK's continuing concern about the cruelty involved in whaling, and drew attention, in particular, to the need to improve the regulation and humaneness of hunts for small cetaceans such as dolphins and porpoises. Earlier in the meeting the UK made use of a video of a dolphin drive hunt in Japan which graphically illustrated the need for such improvements. Although it is primarily for the Government of the country concerned to regulate the killing of small cetaceans in its waters, I believe that the IWC has a useful role to play in helping to raise awareness of this issue and in improving standards.
<P>

<a name="00713w11.html_para7">A number of other issues were considered. In particular, resolutions were adopted supporting the IWC's research programme on the effects of environmental change and pollution on cetaceans; drawing attention to the need to improve the protection of North Atlantic right whales, one of the most critically endangered species of whales, from mortalities caused by ship strikes and entanglement in fishing nets; drawing attention to the need for improved measures to conserve freshwater cetaceans (river dolphins); and calling on Canada to reconsider takes of bowhead whales from highly endangered stocks by indigenous peoples.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs if he will make a statement about the introduction of a United Nations embargo on the import of rough diamonds from Sierra Leone.  [130797]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00713w12.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 The United Nations Security Council adopted resolution 1306(2000) on 5 July which prohibits the direct or indirect import of all rough diamonds from Sierra Leone to the territory of member states. The resolution also decides that rough diamonds controlled by the Government of Sierra Leone through a Certificate of Origin regime shall be exempt from the measures when the UN Sanctions Committee on Sierra Leone has reported to the Council that an effective regime is fully in operation.
<P>

<a name="00713w12.html_para1">Britain played a leading role in promoting resolution 1306 in the UN Security Council. Diamonds are at the heart of the tragedy in Sierra Leone and this resolution sends a powerful signal about the need to end the trade in conflict diamonds from Sierra Leone.

<a name="00713w12.html_para3">The embargo is implemented in the UK by means of an amendment to the Open General Import Licence. Orders in Council under the United Nations Act 1946 will be made to implement the restrictions in the Crown Dependencies and Overseas Territories.

 I visited the Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations on 22 June in response to their kind invitation to be the keynote speaker at their annual conference on New Deal. During what proved to be a very successful conference I congratulated the Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations and its member organisations for the significant contribution they had made to the successful delivery of New Deal in Scotland. I outlined the various measures that were being, or would be, taken further to improve the help New Deal can give to particularly disadvantaged young people and those who are long term unemployed. The SCVO video on the Voluntary Sector Option in Scotland was launched and an award presented to the 4000th young person to enter the option in Scotland. I looked forward to a continuation of the partnership working between SCVO, its members, the Employment Service and other New Deal partners that has been a special feature of the delivery of the option in Scotland.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment how many employers in Paisley, South, or the nearest available geographical unit, have agreed to take on one or more subsidised employees from the New Deal for 18 to 24-year-olds in each month since January 1998; and how many employers have

agreed to take their first subsidised employee from the New Deal scheme for 18 to 24-year-olds in each month since January 1998.  [128737]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00713w13.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 The information is not available in the form requested but we do have aggregate information for the Johnstone and Paisley jobcentre catchment areas. Since April 1998, when the New Deal for young people was introduced nationally, a total of 237 employers have signed New Deal agreements and many of these have taken on one or more subsidised employees. Many employers signing agreements will also have taken on young people into unsubsidised jobs and in the Paisley, South constituency as a whole, over 400 young people have found jobs under the New Deal. This is a significant contribution to our manifesto commitment to help 250,000 young people into jobs through the New Deal.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00713w13.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Alexander: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what recent research he has carried out into the reasons for those in the New Deal scheme leaving the scheme prematurely.  [128736]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00713w13.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 The purpose of New Deal is to move people swiftly into jobs and the design of New Deal enables young people to leave from all stages of the process to take jobs or for other reasons. Those that return to Jobseeker's allowance within three months go back on to New Deal at the point they left. However, young people do leave the process without telling us where they are going. They are under no obligation to do so but we are naturally concerned to know more about their circumstances. As a result we commissioned a study in 1999 which told us that 57 per cent. of leavers went into jobs and 8 per cent. into training. A second survey of leavers to unknown destinations from all three stages of the New Deal for Young People is currently under way.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00713w13.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 There is no neat fit between New Deal Units of Delivery and parliamentary constituencies. It is for this reason that quarterly New Deal statistics for each parliamentary constituency have been produced and placed in the Libraries alongside those on a Unit of Delivery basis. A list of Units of Delivery and those parliamentary constituencies that fall, all or for the most part, within their boundaries is contained in the table, copies of which have been placed in the Libraries.

 The Connexions Service will offer at least the same level of careers information, advice and guidance for 13 to 19-year-olds as is currently provided by the Careers Service. It will be a universal service with a focus on removing any barriers to learning faced by young people.

 Impartiality is a fundamental element of the Government's approach to guidance. The Connexions Service will offer at least the same level of impartial careers information, advice and guidance for 13-19 year olds as is currently provided by careers services. Local managers from the Connexions Service will agree with schools how school based personal advisers will be deployed and how the impartiality of guidance will be ensured.

<a name="00713w13.html_para6">However, impartiality is and will continue to be a key principle underpinning publicly funded information, advice and guidance services.

A key priority for that money is to raise the quality of information, advice and guidance provision through the development of national quality standards, underpinned by the principle of impartiality, against which providers of information, advice or guidance to adults are required to be accredited by March 2002.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, pursuant to his answer of 7 July 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 356W, regarding lords lieutenant, if he will make a statement on the selection procedure which applies to the appointment of <i>(a)</i> lords lieutenant and <i>(b)</i> deputy lieutenants.

 Lords Lieutenants are appointed by The Queen on the advice of the Prime Minister. In England, the Prime Minister's Secretary for Appointments carries out the consultation process within the county on behalf of the Prime Minister. Nominations of candidates for Lords Lieutenant can, when a vacancy occurs, be made to the Secretary for Appointments, the relevant Clerk to the Lieutenancy and the outgoing Lord Lieutenant.
<P>

<a name="00713w15.html_para2">The appointment of Deputy Lieutenants is a matter for the Lord Lieutenant, subject to the non-disapprobation of The Queen.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00713w15.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The Feira Presidency report makes no proposals as regards uniforms or codes of practice for police officers from European Union member states deployed on international civilian policing operations.

<P>
<a name="00713w15.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Bercow: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he intends to increase police numbers in order to provide the manpower indicated in Section C of the Feira Presidency conclusions.  [129923]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00713w15.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The Presidency Report to the Feira European Council on "Strengthening the Common European Security and Defence Policy" looks at establishing concrete targets for civilian police capabilities as part of a wider initiative on international non-military crisis management operations. The United Kingdom will be working with European Union partners to achieve the target agreed at Feira. The Presidency Report does not impose any national quotas which would oblige us to increase the number of United Kingdom officers who will be available for peace keeping missions abroad. We will continue to contribute to such operations on a voluntary basis.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make a statement on the conditions under which police officers from other EU states would operate in the UK, as proposed in the Feira Presidency conclusions.  [129812]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00713w15.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The Feira Presidency Report contains recommendations and proposals which will enable the European Union to contribute more effectively to international peace and security by enhancing its contribution to crisis management operations led by international and regional organisations. There is no suggestion that officers from European Union states should operate as part of such a mission in the United Kingdom or any other European Union state or that the circumstances in the European Union are such that they would be required in such a capacity.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many cases of missing children from children's homes have been investigated by the police since 1970; how many had led to the missing children being traced; and how many are currently under investigation.  [129768]<P>

<a name="00713w16.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 There is no evidence of such information having been recorded or held centrally. The information could be obtained only at a disproportionate cost. However, we have accepted the recommendations of the Waterhouse Report which identified the need for the police and care homes to create a record of missing children. We will take forward the recommendations through an inter-agency review of best practice in conducting complex abuse investigations. A Review Group is being established to take forward this work,

<a name="00713w16.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 In the 12 months ended 31 March 2000, 9,342 officers from the Metropolitan Police attended courses at the Peel Centre, Hendon.
<P>

<a name="00713w16.html_para0">The courses attended included probationer training, detective courses, driver and traffic training, dog training, firearms, computer and management courses.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make a statement on progress in reducing the incidence of domestic violence in England.  [129937]<P>

<P>
<a name="00713w16.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The Government have made available from the Crime Reduction Programme &#163;7 million for projects addressing domestic violence and rape and sexual assault by known perpetrators. I was pleased to announce the successful bids on 10 July. Of these, 25, costing a total of &#163;5.3 million, deal with aspects of domestic violence. We expect this major commitment to lead to more women reporting these offences and in the longer term to a significant fall in the actual number of offences being committed.
<P>

<a name="00713w16.html_para1">This initiative complements a range of Government measures to ensure that the problem of domestic violence is tackled effectively, including in the last four months new multi-agency guidance, a new resources manual for Health Service professionals and a new Home Office Circular to

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what recent evidence he has collated on the correlation between the level of crime and <i>(a)</i> police numbers and <i>(b)</i> police funding.  [129496]<P>

<P>
<a name="00713w16.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 In response to the intervention of the right hon. Member for Southwark, North and Bermondsey (Mr. Hughes) in the debate on the Crime Reduction Strategy on 29 November 1999, <i>Official Report,</i> columns 21-38, officials in my Research, Development and Statistics Directorate assembled information on changes in police numbers and recorded crime rates between (i) 1996-97 and 1998-99; and (ii) 1993-94 and 1998-99. The analysis is set out in Tables 1 and 2. Table 1 shows that 12 of the 21 top performing forces had falls in police numbers over the last two years, whereas in the other group of 22 forces, 14 had falls. At the individual force level, however, there seems little obvious statistical link between performance and police numbers. Table 2 shows that, over five years, there is little difference in the number of forces with falls in numbers in the top 21 forces and the bottom 22. Again, though, there is a very mixed picture overall, with the statistical relationship between police numbers and changes in crime over this period weak.
<P>

<a name="00713w16.html_para2">Other analysis by the Research, Development and Statistics Directorate around the same time also looked at the correlation at police force level between the changes in numbers of crimes, police numbers and police funding. The results are in Table 1. They show no association that carries much statistical weight when comparing forces. The strongest association is between increasing budgets leading to increasing officers.

<P>
<a name="00713w17.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Straw </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 12 July 2000]:</i> The estimate is based on information contained in Home Office Statistical Bulletin 14-95 which reports an analysis of the criminal histories of a large sample of offenders born in 1953, 1958, 1963, 1968 and 1973. The data confirm that 26 per cent. of men born in 1968 had a conviction for a standard list offence by the age of 24, 33 per cent. of those born in 1963 had a conviction for such an offence by the age of 28 while the comparative figures for those born in 1958 were 31 per cent. with a conviction by the age of 25.

<P>
<a name="00713w17.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 The decision as to when the statistics on recorded crime are to be published is taken by the Director of Research, Development and Statistics at the Home Office and is announced well in advance, as was the date of 18 July for the publication of the crime statistics from March 1999-March 2000. Ministers are informed but not consulted about such dates. This follows the new arrangement to protect the integrity of national statistics which I established in 1997.
<P>

<a name="00713w17.html_para6">In the light of the fact that my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer is now planning, Parliamentary time allowing, to make a statement on public spending, on the afternoon of 18 July, the Director of Research, Development and Statistics, Professor Paul Wiles, has decided that the statistics will be published on 18 July as was originally announced, but at 00:01 hours rather than 11:00. An embargoed press briefing will be provided on 17 July so that the statistics can be reported on the morning of 18 July. At the same time as embargoed press copies are made available, they will also be sent to the Opposition. To ensure that Parliament is properly informed, copies of the crime statistics will be placed on the Home Office website and in the Library at 00:01 hours on 18 July.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health how many and what percentage of GPs in each health authority area in England are due to retire by 2005.  [129611]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00713w17.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 Although there is no fixed retirement age for general practitioners they are removed from the health authority medical list on reaching 70 years of age if providing general medical services as a principal. Similarly doctors employed by personal medical services pilots or under the salaried doctor scheme cannot work past the age of 70. Numbers of GPs who will reach the age of 70 years by 2005 are available in the table. However these do not take account of doctors who may retire before age 70 by choice or for medical or other reasons, nor is any allowance made for those GPs who may exercise the option to retire and so claim their pension and gratuity but who may return to the health authority medical list 28 days later and continue working until they fully retire. In addition there is no retirement age for doctors who return to work as assistants or locums.

 We have received a number of representations, mainly from parents, expressing concern over the clinical evidence for using Ritalin. I am pleased that given this concern the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) is appraising the drug as part of its 2000 work programme. It will issue authoritative advice, which should ensure that professionals treating children and adolescents with emotional and behavioural disorders have an evidence-based approach to using Ritalin. NICE is scheduled to report its findings in October.

In addition a survey of the use of the Direction on Choice to which the circular refers was carried out in 1998 and this was followed up by a series of regional seminars in the summer of 1999 to disseminate the lessons learnt. We are also developing a national learning disability strategy to be launched later this year which will aim to eliminate inconsistencies in service delivery.

 <i>[holding answer 1 March 2000]:</i> The long established convention that Ministers generally are not given access to papers of a previous administration that would reveal former Ministers' opinions means that I do not have the information to answer this question. However I have already asked that all possible information on this topic be released directly to the BSE inquiry.
