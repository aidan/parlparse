However, when the remaining 256 councils provided estimates of the scale of the problem in their areas, this added a further estimated 807 rough sleepers-taking the national total to 1,247 rough sleepers on any given night, of which 317 were in London.</p>

 The UK remains deeply concerned by both Iran's and North Korea's nuclear programmes. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea's (DPRK) network of proliferation activities, including to countries such as Iran, are a threat to regional and international security. The UN Panel of Experts to the 1718 Sanctions Committee published a midterm report in November 2010, which indicated that Iran and the DPRK were co-operating in the development of ballistic missiles.</p>

There are large communities of Burkinabe and Malian nationals living in Cote d'Ivoire.

 Biomass has a greater range of uses than just energy production.

<i> [holding answer 16 December 2010]: </i>The overriding factor in deciding between removing either the Tornado GR4 or Harrier was the ability to support operations in Afghanistan. A fleet of 50 Tornado and 50 Harrier aircraft would have been unable to maintain continuous support to operations in Afghanistan at current levels and maintain the ability to support concurrent operations. In addition, withdrawal of an aircraft type delivers greater savings than partial reductions, due to the fixed costs associated with supporting an aircraft platform; therefore running two smaller fleets would not have been cost-effective.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_267"><a name="101220w0002.htm_para46"><a name="1012212000145">When the 15 Harrier GR9 aircraft returned from their deployment to Afghanistan, the funding to support their urgent operational requirements ceased and as such this equipment was removed from the aircraft. If Harrier had been required to redeploy to Afghanistan, these capabilities would need to have been re-activated, either with new funding streams or replacements where they had been superseded and could have taken up to 18 months.</p>

<i> [holding answer 16 December 2010]:</i> The Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR) was core departmental business incorporated into the routine work of Ministers and staff. No overnight accommodation costs were incurred by Ministers solely as part of the SDSR process. A significant number of civilian staff were engaged at various stages, and it is not possible to identify what element of detached duty costs incurred by civilian staff during the period of the SDSR was required specifically as part of the review process.</p>

 My ministerial colleagues and I, and officials from the Ministry of Defence (MOD), engaged a variety of academic organisations, non-governmental organisations (NGOs), trade unions, and industry representatives during the Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR).

 Aviation security search measures apply equally to all (passengers, airport staff and aircrew including pilots) regardless of gender, race, age and occupation, with only a very limited number of exemptions, for example in respect of heads of state. The more people we exempt from search, the greater the risk this creates.</p>

 The spending review confirmed approval for a package of works totalling £69 million to allow increased line speeds on the Midland Main Line by 2013. The work will enable an improvement of at least eight minutes in the journey time between London and Sheffield. At the south end of the route the Thameslink programme will increase capacity and improve accessibility to, from and through London. The first stage is planned to be delivered by 2012.</p>

 There are no sections of M5, M6, M1, M3 or M25 which are subject to lower statutory speed limits because they do not meet current visibility requirements or have sub-geometric features. There are, however, two locations on the M5 between junctions 1 and 4 where advisory speed limits of 50 mph are in place. One is on an elevated section between junctions 1 and 2 (Oldbury) and the other is at junction 4 (Lydiate Ash); both are due to the locations having a tight radius curve.</p>

 The matter raised is the responsibility of the independent regulator, the Office of Communications (Ofcom), which is accountable to Parliament rather than Ministers. According to Ofcom, the competition issues relating to the merger between T-Mobile and Orange that resulted in the formation of Everything Everywhere were looked at by the European Commission, involving Ofcom in the process.

The Commission also focused on the impact that the merger would have on the network sharing agreement held between T-Mobile and Hutchison 3G.

HEFCE uses two different groupings of areas to define disadvantage which are based on the historic levels of participation or qualification in higher education by the local population: one based on the participation rates of young (19 and under) people in HE (which is used by HEFCE when looking at young full-time entrants); and one based on the proportion of adults in the area who hold HE qualifications (which is used by HEFCE when looking at part-time and mature full-time entrants). Because this table includes applicants and accepted applicants of all ages disadvantage is defined by the HE qualified adults measure.<br>

 Remanufacturing is an important feature of the move to a low carbon economy. Any process which reduces costs, waste and carbon emissions, while meeting demand and serving the economy, is to be welcomed.</p>

It is without doubt that there will be a growing global demand for these goods over the course of this century, so the challenge for Governments is to find a way to meet this demand whilst also ensuring carbon emissions are reduced to acceptable levels.</p>

 UK Trade and Investment (UKTI) are the Government's lead trade and investment promotion organisation and is present in 96 markets around the world.

 Legislation relating to children and young people is reviewed as appropriate in the context of relevant policy development. We do not however believe there is a need to review the specific provisions in the Children Act 1989 with regard to the taking of children into care against their parents' wishes. The law is clear that children should live with their parents wherever possible. However, action must be taken if a child is suffering, or is likely to suffer, significant harm. Where a child is taken into care on a care order the court is required to treat the welfare of the child as its paramount consideration.</p>

These young people do play an absolutely vital role both for their families and society as a whole and they deserve our recognition and support. The Department for Education with the Department of Health is absolutely committed to supporting local services including many voluntary organisations which have been set up to support these young people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_433"><a name="101220w0005.htm_para29"><a name="10122114000258">However in some cases these young people need protection from excessive or inappropriate caring that puts their education and/or health at risk. I attended the Young Carers Festival last summer as I have done for a number of years and have heard directly about their concerns. They told me that services supporting their parents or other family members all too often do not consider their views or identify and respond to their support needs. Even though these might be critical to the care they are providing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_434"><a name="101220w0005.htm_para30"><a name="10122114000259">The Government recently published 'Recognised, valued and supported: next steps for the Carers Strategy'. They recognise that there are a number of 'hidden' young carers and encourage front-line services including schools, GPs, mental health and substance misuse to put in place systems to identify and respond to young carers needs. They also encourage local authorities to consider adopting the 'Working together to support young carers' published jointly by the Association of Directors of Adult and Children's Services which is unambiguous in stating that no care package should rely on a young person taking on inappropriate caring roles.</p>

 We have considered relevant research published since the Budget announcement. We have also taken note of the views and concerns of stakeholders in relation to the implementation of the 2011 changes to Local Housing Allowance rates. As a consequence we are bringing forward the timing of the reduction of rates to the 30 percentile from October 2011 to April 2011. This avoids people being affected twice, first by the cap from April and then again after October. We are giving existing customers more time to adjust to any reduction in entitlement by giving them up to nine months transitional protection from the anniversary date of the claim. In addition we are providing a further £50 million over the spending review period towards the provision of housing advice and other practical support to help customers during the transition period.</p>

 It was necessary for the Government to put support for mortgage interest on a more sustainable footing, and to better reflect mortgage costs, which is why we set the standard interest rate at a level equal to the Bank of England's published monthly average mortgage rate from 1 October. The rate is currently 3.63%. The previous rate of 6.08% was too generous and resulted in the vast majority of people getting more than their eligible mortgage interest liability, which was unfair to taxpayers. The plans of the previous Government would have meant that the standard interest rate would have reverted to a formula-the Bank of England Base Rate plus 1.58%-which, at present, would produce a rate of 2.08% from January 2011.</p>

Furthermore, the relationship between arrears and continued home ownership is a complex one dependant on more than the level of support for mortgage interest payable.

 Since the termination of the contract with the prime supplier, Raytheon Systems Limited, the e-Borders programme has been securing the services and systems that are currently in operation. Alongside this, a strategy to procure services to replace those that were due to be delivered under the original e-Borders contract has been developed. The programme is currently examining options for contracting with new suppliers and expects to be able to set out agreed next steps in the new year. All options for future services include a rigorous assessment of value for money.</p>

 The Home Office does not set budgets for spend on conferences. However, as with all activities of this nature, we are working to reduce the amount we spend and overall will be reducing our administration budget by one third by the end of the Spending Review period. Where conferences do take place the Home Office constantly seeks to ensure that any conferences that it organises are both necessary, and provide good value for money for the taxpayer.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if she will make it her policy that staff of the UK Border Agency should register the occasions when they use <i> (a)</i> first class rail and <i> (b)</i> air travel at fares other than the cheapest available in an official capacity in the last financial year; and what hotel accommodation was used in an official capacity by each member of staff of the UK Border Agency in the last financial year.

 The Home Office commenced a new travel booking contract in December 2008 and since early 2009 all first class rail travel can be identified. Air travel at fares other than the cheapest available can also be logged. Aggregated spend information on first class rail travel is provided to directorates to enable them to manage the cost of travel. All those contractually entitled to first class travel are expected, given the Department's commitments to reducing costs, to consider carefully whether first class travel is justified in the light of the specific business need for the journey and the example it sets.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_541"><a name="101220w0006.htm_para60"><a name="10122114001062">The need for travel at all is considered against using more cost-effective options like teleconferencing or videoconferencing, which are increasingly available throughout the agency. Managers have been asked to ensure that any claim for first-class travel is balanced with a clear business justification. There are times when travelling in a higher- fare seat is justifiable; for example on long-haul flights, especially where managers have engagements on arrival at their destination. Similarly, when travelling by rail, if seating is unavailable in economy carriages then travelling first class might be appropriate.</p>

This involves some estimation. The figures do not include the cost of prisoners held in police or court cells under Operation Safeguard, nor expenditure met by other Government Departments (e.g. Health and Education). The prisoner escort service costs are included. Expenditure recharged to the Youth Justice Board in respect of young people is included.</p>
