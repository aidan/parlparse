 <i>[holding answer 20 May 2002]:</i> The Sex Discrimination Act (Gender Reassignment) Regulations 1999 amended the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 in the fields of employment and vocational training to give protection against discrimination to people intending to undergo, undergoing, or who have undergone gender reassignment. The regulations help individuals who undergo reassignment to either sex. The Equal Opportunities Commission's powers were extended by the regulations so it can help people experiencing discrimination on these grounds. The commission is taking this forward effectively, and about two thirds of the requests it receives relate to employment or vocational training. A few individuals have taken cases to employment tribunals under the normal process for sex discrimination claims.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20617w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 10 June 2002]:</i> The Common Position of the Council of the European Union concerning the temporary reception by member states of the European Union of certain Palestinians provides that acceptance in a member state does not imply a right for the persons concerned to move freely within the territories of the member states and that the validity of the national permit shall be limited to the territory of the member state concerned.
<P>

<a name="20617w01.html_para5">Any Palestinian received in another member state who sought to travel to the UK would normally require a visa for that purpose which, if applied for, would be considered in the normal way.

 The Seville European Council is the opportunity for the EU to finalise its preparations for the World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD).

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what Jubilee celebrations took place at the high commission in Harare; what the costs were; and which Zimbabwean nationals were invited to the functions hosted by the high commissioner and his officials during the Jubilee celebrations.  [61865]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20617w02.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 To mark the Jubilee, the high commissioner hosted a reception at his residence on the afternoon of Friday 31 May. A few bills have still to be presented, but the cost of the event to date is &#163;6,953.88. 781 guests and their partners were invited. We do not have a record of the nationality of the guests, but the high commission estimates that about half were Zimbabwean nationals. No Zimbabwean on the EU travel ban list was invited.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what guidelines exist with regard to officials from the high commission in Harare visiting farms which have been seized or are under threat of seizure; and how many farms have been visited since January.  [61863]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20617w02.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 There are no guidelines on British high commission staff visiting farms. Since January, high commission officials have visited around half a dozen farms to which they were invited, in order to see the situation at first hand. As a result of the attention focused on British Government policy and activity during the presidential election campaign, and the overall level of political violence, high commission staff remained in Harare in the period 20 February to 20 March, unless given specific permission by the high commissioner to travel internally. This curtailed visits to rural areas. The high commission is also aware that in current circumstances some farmers do not think it helpful to have a British diplomat visit their farm since this would expose them to further harassment by the authorities.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20617w02.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 The people of Gibraltar enjoy the benefits of free movement of persons, services and capital by virtue of the provisions of Community law relating to these matters, as far as they apply to Gibraltar. I refer the right hon. Member to the answer I gave him on 10 June 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, column 821W.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20617w02.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 We remain concerned about the various telecommunications problems that Gibraltar is experiencing. We are concerned that the new telephone numbers offered by Spain at the 26 July Brussels Process Ministerial meeting are still not in use. We have raised this with the Spanish; and invited experts from the Government of Gibraltar to a meeting, with Spain and us, to seek a way forward. But we have always said that more numbers alone will not solve the longer term problems. 



<P>
<P><I>17 Jun 2002 : Column 7W</I><P>
Our objective remains Spanish recognition of Gibraltar's international dialling code, which we believe is the only viable long-term solution.

<a name="20617w02.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 Yes. In accordance with the terms of the Brussels Communique, November 1984, the talks under the Brussels Process are aimed at overcoming all the differences between the UK and Spain over Gibraltar and at promoting co-operation on a mutually beneficial basis on economic, cultural, touristic, aviation, military and environment matters. These talks are continuing.

 Yes. It has been the Government's policy to seek recognition by Spain of Gibraltar ID cards. This was achieved as part of the agreement concluded with Spain in April 2000.
<P>

<a name="20617w02.html_para2">Gibraltar ID cards, as reformatted, are therefore now accepted by the Spanish Government.

[62170]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20617w02.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. MacShane: </B> 
 We have provided the World Service with an extra &#163;2.85 million for the enhancement of regional language services after 11 September 2001. This is additional to an uplift of &#163;64 million in funding for the World Service for the present Spending Review period. The uplift over the baseline in this FY alone is &#163;24 million. We maintain constant contact with the World Service over a range of issues, including funding.

 The Government have not made an integrated study of the economic and social impact of EU enlargement on the United Kingdom. However, independent economic studies by the European Round Table of Industrialists and the Centre for Economic Policy Reform show that EU enlargement could increase UK GDP by &#163;1.75 million and create 300,000 jobs among the EU-15. I have placed copies of these reports in the House of Commons Library.

 Between 1989 and 1997, planned public funding fell by 36 per cent. from just under &#163;7,600 to just over &#163;4,800 per full time equivalent student.
<P>

<a name="20617w03.html_para7">The Dearing report concluded that higher education institutions could not absorb further reductions of over 6 per cent. in the funding per student, which were in the plans of the previous Government.
<P>

<a name="20617w03.html_para8">Following the last spending review, the Government's spending plans for higher education have reversed the decline in funding over the last decade. Publicly planned funding for higher education announced in November 2000, did reflect a 0.4 per cent. decrease in funding per full time equivalent student in real terms in 2000&#150;01, compared to the previous year. But for 2001&#150;02, the unit of funding in real terms was planned to increase by 0.7 per cent. compared to 2000&#150;01.
<P>

<a name="20617w03.html_para9">In addition to the funding for teaching and research the higher education sector received an additional &#163;166 million in 1999&#150;2000 and &#163;242.5 million in 2000&#150;01 for capital and to help widen access to higher education.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what assessment she has made of the validity of the use of the number of children receiving free school meals as an indicator of need in garrison towns.  [56048]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20617w04.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Stephen Twigg: </B> 
 None, specifically in connection with garrison towns. Within the data collected by the Department annually from schools, the proportion of pupils known to be eligible for free school meals is an established indicator of socio-economic disadvantage. It has been used by the Department as one measure for grouping schools to allow comparisons of the performance of similar schools in the autumn package of pupil performance. This package is provided to assist them in the process of target setting and school improvement.
<P>

<a name="20617w04.html_para0">The Department is now engaged in a programme of establishing measures of pupil progress from one Key Stage to the next, and it is proposed that this year's secondary schools performance tables will contain two indicators of 'value added' based on such information.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20617w04.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 10 June 2002]:</i> We have no plans to include British Sign Language in the national curriculum. Schools that wish to do so can offer British Sign Language lessons to their pupils as part of the wider school curriculum. Teaching additional subjects, such as sign language will usually be built around the skills and strengths of the teaching staff and the learning needs of their pupils.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills when the chairs of the sector skills councils will be announced; when all the members of the sector skills councils will be confirmed; and what arrangements have been made for the staff of national training organisations during the transitions to sector skills councils.  [60772]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20617w04.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 There is no set timetable for the introduction of the new sector skills network. Sector skills councils (SSCs) will be introduced only in sectors where employers want one and the SSC standard is met. One requirement is for the SSC to have a senior level board and chair, representative of the sector. As SSCs are licensed information about them, including their board, will be published by the SSDA.




<P>

<P>

<a name="20617w04.html_para1">The ending of Government recognition of national training organisations (NTOs) and the licensing of sector skills councils (SSCs) are separate issues. Organisations that were formerly recognised as NTOs are independent bodies. The continued funding, operation and staffing of former NTOs is a decision for the board of each organisation.

 The information requested is not available. Government funding of higher education institutions in England through the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) takes account of the cost to universities and colleges of administering tuition fees. The forecast income that institutions receive from student contributions to fees is abated by 5 per cent. for collection of fees and any default. For 2001&#150;02, that amounts to an estimated &#163;18.2 million. The latest survey of the non-payment of fee contributions, published by Universities UK in November 2001, found that the amount unpaid at July 2001 across the UK was well within the 5 per cent. set aside for administration and default.

 PILOT, the joint Government/industry forum, has an extensive action programme to improve the industry's competitiveness. It is pursuing a number of visionary targets for 2010 and last year set the interim production and investment targets for 2005. I expect PILOT to continue to monitor progress against these targets. The fiscal regime is one of many influences affecting the success of the industry meeting them. Further discussions on the vision targets will take place at future PILOT meetings.

 The effectiveness of the Telecommunications (Data Protection and Privacy) Regulations in controlling unsolicited direct marketing faxes may be monitored by, among other things, looking at levels of registrations with, and complaints to, the Fax Preference Service (FPS); up to date figures on these are available from the Direct Marketing Association, which was appointed to run the Telephone and Fax Preference Services under the

<a name="20617w07.html_para2">Latest available figures are for 2000. The numbers of used tyres disposed of each year and their weight is estimated based on data supplied by tyre manufacturers and importers on replacement tyre sales, statistics from Customs and Excise on import and export trade in used tyre casings and information from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders on the numbers of end-of-life vehicles.
<P>

<a name="20617w07.html_para3">The method of compiling the statistics was refined in 1998 to improve their accuracy. Accordingly, figures from 1998 forward are not directly comparable with earlier years.

<a name="20617w07.html_para4">The numbers of tyres landfilled over the period 1996&#150;99 remained consistent at around 30 per cent. of all tyres disposed of. With the closure of the single largest facility for handling used tyres in 2000, around 37 per cent. of tyres were landfilled that year.
<P>

<a name="20617w07.html_para5">It is difficult to gather accurate information on the illegal disposal of tyres, with incidences widely dispersed geographically and affecting a variety of local authorities, businesses and individuals. Research undertaken by the Environment Agency indicates that most local authorities experience low levels of fly-tipping, but the cumulative effect can lead to significant total numbers. The Agency has estimated that tyre fly-tipping is collectively costing local authorities around &#163;2 million per annum. There is also substantial local fly-tipping of tyres on agricultural land. Not all tyre fly-tipping is immediately obvious, with significant numbers of tyre retailers experiencing fly-tipping on their forecourts overnight, and subsequently picking up the costs for ensuring responsible disposal and recovery.
<P>

<a name="20617w07.html_para6">There are occasional large-scale deposits, which in extreme cases can amount to several tens of thousands of tyres. There are generally only one or two incidents of this magnitude each year. A recent survey by the Environment Agency estimated that there are around 21 million tyres in long-term storage. Not all of these will have been illegally deposited.

<a name="20617w07.html_spnew2"><B> Nigel Griffiths: </B> 
 Business Link Operators have not offered loans to businesses that suffered losses as a result of foot and mouth disease. However, some elements of the Rural Business Recovery Fund were used to assist businesses with interest relief on existing loans. The Small Firms Loan Guarantee Scheme (operated by high street banks) was extended to bring in scope businesses affected by foot and mouth disease.

 In 1998 my Department HQ entered into a Private Finance Initiative partnership with a consortium led by ICL (now Fujitsu) in conjunction with CMG, known as UNITAS. This arrangement included the transfer of ownership of the vast majority of our computer assets to UNITAS and part of the contractual arrangements in place are that the responsibility for replacing equipment and its disposal when this is necessary lies with them. Part of our normal monthly service charge paid for the provision of our computers includes an element to meet any costs incurred by UNITAS in carrying out this disposal service.
<P>

<a name="20617w07.html_para8">Where equipment becomes surplus to requirement UNITAS always tries to re-cycle it and, accordingly, the number of PCs disposed of by UNITAS in the last three years has been negligible. Their environmental policy also dictates that any disposals are done in an environmentally friendly manner and appropriate security measures are applied to ensure hard discs are always erased before disposal. Where disposal is necessary UNITAS use a company known as STARS.

60 per cent. to 70 per cent. if we are to avoid dangerous climate change. This will require a major transformation in the way we generate and use energy&#151;essentially a move away from the substantial use of fossil fuels emitting greenhouse gases into the atmosphere to a low carbon economy.

 As I said in answer to my hon.

However, national contingents within the ISAF have been involved in a number of humanitarian projects. United Kingdom service personnel, in conjunction with the Department for International Development, have contributed to the rebuilding of Kabul' s education system through helping with repairs to its schools. The ISAF has also on occasion responded to critical emergencies to help save lives. There has been no expansion in ISAF's mission as defined in the authorising United Nations Security Council Resolutions.

 British military operations in Afghanistan have involved both warfighting and security assistance tasks. The task force based around 45 Commando Royal Marines has performed valuable work in denying remaining al-Qaeda and Taliban elements opportunities to regroup and commit terrorist attacks, especially around the time of the vital Loya Jirga process. British forces in the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) have also played a valuable role in helping the Afghan Interim Administration maintain security in Kabul.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20617w09.html_spnew9"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The Defence Housing Executive (DHE) is constantly looking for ways to further improve its repairs service. Current response requirements for unplanned maintenance are: within 24 hours for emergencies, within five working days for urgent repairs and within two months for routine repairs. DHE achieved 99 per cent. of routine repairs within the required timescale against a target of 95 per cent. On urgent repairs, 87 per cent. were achieved on time against a target of 90 per cent. Against a target of 95 per cent. for emergency repairs, the achievement was 93 per cent.
<P>

<a name="20617w09.html_para6">The DHE is trialling a call centre in the north-east which allows the occupants of service families' housing to notify their requirement for response repairs directly. An appointment is then made with the occupant for the contractor to call and effect the repair. The contractor is incentivised to meet response repair targets and to reach a higher level of customer satisfaction. Failure to achieve the targets set by DHE will mean that fees will be withheld. The results of the trial will be used to inform the planned move to a prime contract for housing maintenance and works services, which is in line with a wider Government initiative.

 For those service leavers eligible to receive standard career transition services, the Ministry of Defence is currently working on introducing a Tri Service Resettlement Manual, to align resettlement procedures, policy and structures across the three services, and on replacing the current system for funding resettlement training to allow service leavers greater flexibility for such training. However, for one category of service leaver not eligible to receive standard career transition services, those being compulsorily discharged, the MOD has under consideration a change to the current rules to allow them to receive some specialist advice about finding jobs and accommodation, and accessing further support should the initial advice fail. A six-month trial to assess the feasibility of this initiative is under way.

<P>

<a name="20617w10.html_para1">The Strategic Defence Review (SDR) included a commitment to establish JFH, building on the success of Royal Navy and RAF Harrier aircraft operations in joint carrier air groups. This was a radical initiative to form a truly joint, flexible and deployable force optimised for the demands of the new strategic environment. JFH currently operates two aircraft types&#151;Sea Harrier FA2, an air defence aircraft flown by RN personnel, and Harrier GR7, a ground attack/reconnaissance aircraft flown by RAF personnel. The plan has been for both the Sea Harrier FA2 and Harrier GR7 to be replaced by a common aircraft type. This is currently designated the FJCA with an In-Service Date of 2012.
<P>

<a name="20617w10.html_para2">Work has been taking place on a migration plan to take forward JFH into the era of the FJCA and the future aircraft carrier. We have concluded that JFH should migrate to an all Harrier GR force, maximising investment in one aircraft type. It is planned to upgrade the GR7 to GR9 standard to ensure a credible expeditionary offensive capability until the aircraft leaves service. To achieve this, aircraft systems will be enhanced to ensure their longevity and give the Harrier the capability to operate with smart weapons.
<P>

<a name="20617w10.html_para3">Given the Harrier GR9' s ability in future to employ smart weapons world-wide by day and night from land and sea and the increased emphasis on carrier based offensive air-power in the SDR and confirmed by the emerging conclusions of our post-11 September work, the Sea Harrier FA2 will be withdrawn earlier than planned, by 2006.

<a name="20617w10.html_para4">As a consequence of its earlier withdrawal from service, the planned relocation of Sea Harrier FA2 aircraft from RNAS Yeovilton to RAF Cottesmore and RAF Wittering in 2003 will not now proceed. However, the relocation of RN personnel will go ahead but slightly later than currently planned, over the period 2004 to 2006. By 1 April 2007, JFH will have migrated to an all Harrier GR9 force by roughly equal numbers of RN and RAF personnel. These proposals will be subject to consultation with the trade unions in the normal way.

 The Rural Payments Agency is responsible for carrying out compliance inspections of countryside stewardship agreements in accordance with EU requirements.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20617w13.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Rural Development Regulation requires member states to undertake on-the-spot compliance checks on at least 5 per cent. of agreements each year. Between 1996 and 2000, just over 5 per cent. of agreements were subject to such checks by MAFF staff each year. The Rural Payments Agency assumed responsibility for these checks in April 2001, after the Regional Service Centres of MAFF were disbanded. Since then, no compliance checks have been undertaken on Countryside Stewardship agreements. The foot and mouth epidemic prevented Agency staff undertaking any checks during the majority of the last calendar year and the early part of 2002. Arrangements for resuming checks on Countryside Stewardship agreements are well advanced.

 Risk selection of on-the-spot compliance checks is laid down in the Rural Development regulation, which requires member states to take account of the following factors:

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the amount of aid involved;
<P>
<BR>

<a name="20617w13.html_para0">Data on risk factors are accumulated for each agreement and fed into a selection programme, which identifies the requisite number of agreements to be inspected for each year's compliance monitoring round.

 <i>[holding answer 16 May 2002]:</i> Local authorities and the Environment Agency may prosecute for fly tipping offences. Between 1996 and 2001, the agency recorded prosecutions for general waste offences on a financial year basis. The data do not distinguish fly tipping offences from other waste offences. From 1 April 1999, the agency recorded whether an incident involves the unlawful deposit of waste and whether prosecutions led to convictions or acquittals. This information is given in the tables. No central register is kept of local authorities' prosecutions.

 DFID's aim is the elimination of poverty. The framework for our action is set out in the 1997 and 2000 White Papers and the recent International Development Act. The UN Millennium Development Goals are the main yardsticks against which we continue to measure progress towards this aim.
<P>

<a name="20617w16.html_para0">At the country level we believe progress towards development goals is principally the responsibility of African Governments, in partnership with the donor community. The international community is working with developing countries, including in Sub-Saharan Africa, to promote country-led and participatory poverty reduction strategy processes. These processes are intended to develop coherent national policies, agree priorities, and help to develop an institutional framework in which Governments can be held to account by their own citizens and stakeholders. The role of donors is to provide financial and technical support to enhance Governments' capacity to develop and implement these strategies.

 My Department is working with the international community and African Governments both to assess the number of people in sub-Saharan Africa who are hungry and to build capacity to assess vulnerability. FAO estimates from 1997 indicate that around 187 million people in sub-Saharan Africa do not have enough food. Excluding the on-going conflict in Angola, the immediate emerging crisis is in southern Africa where around 13 million people in six countries are estimated to be unlikely to grow or buy enough food by next March. My Department has recently published a strategy paper "Eliminating Hunger". This sets out our strategy to meet the millennium development goal for hunger and is relevant to the current problems in Africa. Humanitarian relief is only one part of our response, as the principal cause of hunger and starvation in Africa is poverty and the failure of institutions and Governments to provide for the poor and

As well as making our national response, we are working with the relevant UN and regional organisations to ensure that policies are in place to allow commercial and aid imports to flow freely; and we are urging the Zimbabwe authorities through the UN to adopt measures to strengthen the national response in that country.

<P>

<a name="20617w16.html_para4">In Lesotho DFID will be providing &#163;1.5 million to the WFP emergency programme and another additional &#163;1.0 million to support the longer-term rehabilitation of agriculture in the three worst affected districts. Mozambique has a surplus of maize in the north, although logistics and traditional trading patterns will result in most of this surplus being exported to adjacent countries mainly Malawi. Several donors are already funding food relief where it is needed in the south. DFID is assessing the needs, but it is likely that we can add more value in Mozambique by assisting with the management of food aid or by focusing on agricultural inputs to improve food security for the next harvest. At the moment we are not engaged in food aid in Zambia.

The programme focuses on developing the capacity within each country and across the region to mount an effective response to the epidemic. The initiative complements an EU funded programme also channelled through the SADC HSCU which is to benefit all member states.

We are working with the Ministry of Health to provide a broader health sector response to HIV/AIDs (&#163;1.85 million). Jointly with other donors, we are currently providing additional support (&#163;25 million) to the health sector and this funds a significant proportion of Mozambique's essential medicines requirements.
<P>

<a name="20617w16.html_para12">In Zambia the main support to date has been through the health and education sectors, however, DFID is currently preparing a programme that will provide an additional &#163;20 million to support the national strategic framework.

 Agreement was reached at a meeting in Johannesburg on 6&#150;7 June on a series of short-term measures to improve availability of food in Zimbabwe, Malawi, Zambia, Mozambique, Lesotho and Swaziland in the period to the next harvest, including commercial food imports, food aid, winter cropping and inputs for the next main planting season.
<P>

<a name="20617w17.html_para0">The meeting also dealt with the particular problems of Zimbabwe, which accounts for over half of the region's food aid needs. Donors wish to continue supporting the people of Zimbabwe who have been so badly let down by the policies of the ruling party. They are prepared to continue funding food distribution through non- governmental channels, but it is clear that this can only provide part of the solution and that Government must take steps to allow greater participation in the import effort and make the necessary adjustments in economic policy for this to be effective.

 The road haulage industry is responsible for recruiting, retaining and training the workforce it needs, including LGV drivers.
<P>

<a name="20617w20.html_para0">The Government has discussed on many occasions the challenges the industry is facing through the Road Haulage Forum, and set up over a year ago a separate training sub-group which includes representatives of the Freight Transport Association, the Road Haulage Association, and the Transport and General Workers Union. The sub-group, which is chaired by Edward Roderick, Chief Executive of Christian Salvesen, met most recently on 24 May.

<a name="20617w20.html_para1">Through the main Forum the training sub-group has access to funds from the Road Haulage Modernisation Fund. We have already committed an initial &#163;5 million to a package of measures including an expansion of the Young Drivers Scheme, a demonstration project under Modern Apprenticeships and a feasibility study on transferable training loans. The measures are aimed at helping the industry recruit more young people and protecting employer investment in training.

 C2C, the current franchise operator, has introduced new rolling stock and is considering measures to increase the numbers of passengers travelling. The Strategic Rail Authority has commissioned work on a Capacity Utilisation Policy, which is intended ultimately to cover all rail routes. The objective of this work is to ensure that track capacity is used most effectively so that the optimum number of train paths is made available on each route, enabling the greatest number of trains to run.

<a name="20617w20.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Working out a satisfactory solution to the problems of Canvey Island is a matter for the local authorities in partnerships with the community, business, transport operators and others, as part of the Thames Gateway proposals. The Department is not in a position to promote schemes in areas where local authorities must take the lead. Therefore, at this stage, the Secretary of State has no plans to hold any discussions on the provision of a third access to Canvey Island.

 A total of 307 responses were received to the discussion paper on the blue badge scheme which was issued in December 2001. The Disabled Persons Transport Committee (DPTAC) were asked to look at those responses and they submitted their recommendations to Ministers at the beginning of May. We are currently considering their report and would plan to publish it when we announce a decision on the future shape of the Scheme during this summer. We will then be looking at the mechanics of implementation and consulting again on firm proposals.

<a name="20617w20.html_para2">General practitioners have never had the power to issue blue badges. They may be consulted as part of the assessment process but the final decision on eligibility is made by the issuing authority against the criteria listed in The Disabled Persons (Badges for Motor Vehicles) (England) Regulations 2000 [SI 2000/682]. The role of GPs in this procedure is being considered as part of the current review of the Scheme and I would not want to pre-empt our full consideration of DPTAC's report at this stage.

 The Chief Inspector of Marine Accidents carefully examined the copies of the logbooks kept by the shore loading terminal and noted that reference was made to 'steam line problems'. The grounds on which he made his assessment was that while the entries would have been made based on information provided by the ship, the overwhelming evidence from every other source indicates that the problems on board were confined to feedwater pipework and not the steam system. This was freely admitted but did not constitute the vessel being declared unseaworthy.
<P>

 The Comptroller and Auditor General has recommended, in his report "Dealing with pollution from ships", that the Merchant Shipping legislation be revised to ensure that pollution incidents may be prosecuted under the UK's oil pollution regulations, wherever incidents occur within the UK Pollution Control Zone. This recommendation relates to the Merchant Shipping (Prevention of Oil Pollution) Regulations 1996, SI 1996/2154.
<P>

<a name="20617w21.html_para4">As the report explains, the 1996 Regulations are concerned with areas seaward from the baseline from which the United Kingdom's territorial sea is measured. Illegal discharges of oil in the internal waters landward of that baseline (including estuaries) can be prosecuted under section 131 of the Merchant Shipping Act 1995. Defences are available under both the 1996 Regulations and the 1995 Act. However those under the 1995 Act are different in some key details from those provided under the 1996 Regulations. In the light of the concerns raised by the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Department will consider the alignment of the defences under both the Regulation and the Act. This may involve subsequent amendment of the Merchant Shipping Act 1995 as the defences in the 1996 Regulations derive from an International Convention.

<P>

 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="20617w22.html_para2">The former Department for Transport, Local Government and the Regions was responsible for major programmes of capital investment in transport, housing and urban renewal, and implementing strategic policy objectives, many of which have long-term horizons&#151;the transport 10-year plan, the programme for modernising local government, the urban renewal agenda.
<P>

<a name="20617w22.html_para3">Many of these programmes will impact on the hon. Member's constituency. For example: Wycombe district council received a Housing Capital Guideline allocation of &#163;1,455,000 for 2002&#150;03 plus an additional Basic Credit Approval of &#163;100,000 based on performance. Wycombe district council received a Disabled Facilities Grant allocation of &#163;228,000. The Secretary of State approved spending on the Cash Incentive Scheme of &#163;154,162 for 2001&#150;02 and &#163;134,417 for 2002&#150;03.
<P>

<a name="20617w22.html_para4">The hon. Member's constituency would also have benefited from a part of the local single capital pot allocation to Buckinghamshire county council for 2001&#150;02, which totalled &#163;15.171 million. It is for the county council to decide how best to use these funds and what proportion should be used within the hon. Member's consistency.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20617w23.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Nicholas Brown: </B> 
 The Department for Work and Pensions was formed in June 2001 from the former Department of Social Security and parts of the Department for Education and Employment. We are currently undertaking a fundamental overhaul of the welfare system, transforming it from a passive organisation paying out benefits to an active system that fights poverty, creates opportunity and helps people become self-sufficient and independent. This is making a significant contribution to the Government's overall objectives of eradicating child poverty in 20 years, and halving it within 10; promoting work as the best form of welfare for people of working age while protecting the position of those in greatest need and combating poverty and promoting security and independence in retirement for today's and future pensioners.
<P>

<a name="20617w23.html_para2">Child benefit is now worth &#163;15.74 a week for the eldest child and &#163;10.55 a week for other children; nationally about 7 million families receive child benefit, and in Wycombe 12,220 families benefit.
<P>

<a name="20617w23.html_para3">The number of people in work is at record levels of 28.4 million. Nearly three quarters of working age people are in employment and in Wycombe the proportion in employment currently stands at 80.5 per cent. Unemployment is around its lowest level since the mid 1970s. Our New Deals have helped lone parents, the young unemployed, the long-term unemployed, disabled people, the over 50s and partners of the unemployed to move from benefit into work. Nationally well over 600,000 people have been helped into work by the New Deals and in Wycombe over 550 have been helped into work.
<P>

<a name="20617w23.html_para4">Through Jobcentre Plus we are delivering a single, integrated service to people of working age claiming benefits, with a clear focus on work. In addition to the 56 integrated Jobcentre Plus offices which are already open, we intend to introduce around 225 more integrated offices by April next year including offices in the Wycombe constituency.
<P>

<a name="20617w23.html_para5">Older people are disproportionately affected by fuel poverty. This winter (2001&#150;02) we have made available a winter fuel payment of &#163;200 for each eligible household to help with their heaviest fuel bill. We estimate that around 17,000 older people in Wycombe have received a payment this winter.
<P>

<a name="20617w23.html_para6">We want all pensioners to have a decent and secure income in retirement and to share fairly in the rising prosperity of the country. Our first priority has been to help the poorest pensioners.




<P>
<P><I>17 Jun 2002 : Column 85W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="20617w23.html_para7">From April 2002 we will be spending an extra &#163;6 billion a year in real terms on pensioners as a result of our policies. This includes &#163;2.5 billion more on the poorest third of pensioners.
<P>

<a name="20617w23.html_para8">2,000 pensioner families in Wycombe are receiving the minimum income guarantee which helps our poorest pensioners. Some 14,700 pensioners in Wycombe will benefit from this year's increases in the basic state pension of &#163;3 a week for single pensioners and &#163;4.80 for couples. Those over 75, of whom we estimate there are about 6,000 in Wycombe, may qualify for free TV licences.
<P>

<a name="20617w23.html_para9">Other reforms include the new pension credit in 2003 designed to ensure that pensioners benefit from their savings and the introduction of the state second pension from this April. Both of these initiatives will help provide greater security for tomorrow's pensioners. We have also announced that from October 2003 benefits currently reduced after a hospital stay of six weeks will not be reduced until 13 weeks. This will benefit both pensioners and people of working age.

Unemployment in the Isle of Wight has fallen by 2.5 per cent. over the last year while the number of long-term unemployed, has been cut by over a quarter. Our New Deals have helped lone parents, the young unemployment, the long-term unemployed, disabled people, the over-50s and partners of the unemployed to move from benefit into work. Nationally well over 600,000 people have been helped into work by the New Deals and in the Isle of Wight over 1,900 have been helped into work.

We have also announced that from October 2003 benefits currently reduced after a hospital stay of six weeks will not be reduced until 13 weeks. This will benefit both pensioners and people of working age.

 <i>[holding answer 6 February 2002]:</i> As a basis for future financial projections, the Government Actuary has assumed that in 2001&#150;02 there were 13.3 million people contracted out of the additional state pension, rising to 13.7 million people in 2004&#150;05. However, many factors can effect the actual level of contracting out and this assumption will be reviewed and updated as necessary as further data become available.
<P>

<a name="20617w25.html_para4">Projections of national insurance contribution income and benefit expenditure require assumptions of the future level of contracting out from the state second pension. The assumed level of contracting out is estimated by considering data on the level of contracting out through different routes in past years and potential influences on the numbers contracting out in future years, such as the introduction of stakeholder pensions. As with any projections, the assumptions used should not be regarded as precise forecasts of future experience. The potential for change in the projections resulting from variability in the future level of contracting out is considered through sensitivity analysis where appropriate, rather than the use of confidence intervals.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20617w28.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The Government recognise that plastic card fraud has been a large and rapidly growing problem in the United Kingdom (UK) since the mid-1990s, with losses having increased from &#163;165 million in 1992 to &#163;411.4 million <sup>1</sup>  in 2001. The steep rise has been caused by high levels of organised card crime alongside increases in the number and usage of payment cards.
<P>

<a name="20617w28.html_para0">Significant work is under way to combat plastic card crime. The Home Office has held discussions with the finance and retail sectors and the police to establish and promote best practice in protecting cards. A major initiative which has emerged is the planned introduction of microchips into payment cards to help authentication. This is to be combined with the introduction of PIN codes in place of signatures. The banking industry foresees that by 2005 the technology will have eliminated up to 80 per cent. of plastic card fraud in the UK.
<P>

<a name="20617w28.html_para1">The Government are pleased that the banks and retailers are committed to introducing new technology that is so vital in fighting plastic card fraud. The UK has been leading the world in creating a global standard for chip and design that guarantees very high levels of security whenever consumers use their cards. It is vital that we use this technology to combat fraudsters who find it all too easy to forge genuine cardholders' signatures.
<P>

<a name="20617w28.html_para2">The Home Office is also supporting a two-year pilot of a unique policing unit, the Dedicated Cheque and Plastic Crime Unit. The unit, based in London, is working closely with the banking industry to reduce organised card and cheque fraud across England and Wales. It is estimated that savings of up to &#163;16 million per year may be achieved in each year of operation.

 Cycling inconsiderately or irresponsibly on the pavement is an offence under section 72 of the Highways Act 1835.
<P>

<a name="20617w28.html_para3">Enforcement of the legislation is an operational matter for individual chief officers of police. They are best placed to assess the nature and cause of specific local problems, to determine how most effectively to address them and to decide the best allocation of resources between different priorities. Short intensive enforcement campaigns are occasionally conducted to deal with persistent cycling offenders.

Studies, such as the MORI Youth Survey published by the Youth Justice Board, provide a useful picture of the association between frequent drinking, drugs misuse and offending behaviour among young people. The 2002 MORI Youth Survey, published in May, while showing that a large proportion of young people have tried alcohol, shows clearly that those who admit to committing a criminal offence are likely to drink more regularly than those who do not. The survey similarly shows that young people who have committed a criminal offence within the previous 12 months are significantly more likely to have taken illegal drugs than those who have not offended.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20617w30.html_spnew5"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 It is not our policy to grant routinely exceptional leave to remain to victims of trafficking for sexual exploitation. Each case is considered in the light of its own individual circumstances, including any compassionate factors which may be put forward. The fact that someone has been brought here against their will might be one such factor, but we will take into account all other relevant issues, including the age, health and length of stay of the applicant.
<P>

<a name="20617w30.html_para7">The White Paper "Secure Borders, Safe Haven" outlined proposals for supporting victims of exploitation. Where such people are willing to assist the authorities in bringing traffickers to justice, special arrangements may be made for their protection. The Government intends to develop "best practice" to distinguish victims in genuine need and to provide them with appropriate help and support, whether they are allowed to remain here or are returned to their own countries.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20617w30.html_spnew7"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 The Immigration Service deploys a range of new detection technology to combat clandestine entry through the channel tunnel and other routes. Carbon dioxide and heartbeat detectors are in operation in Dover and Coquelles and two x-ray scanners deployed there by Her Majesty's Customs and Excise for the purpose of detecting contraband have regularly found clandestine entrants during their searches. These two scanners are shortly to be supplemented by two gamma ray detectors purchased by the Immigration Service and all four scanners will be manned by joint Customs/Immigration Service teams.
<P>

<a name="20617w30.html_para9">In addition, the Immigration Service is about to begin the next phase of its procurement programme and is looking to deploy additional detection devices in the United Kingdom and some continental ports. Searches are already conducted in some of those ports by ferry and port operators and the Immigration service is currently considering how best to assist them in their efforts, possibly by lending additional detection equipment.
<P>

<a name="20617w30.html_para10">The recent resurgence of clandestine entry via the SNCF rail freight site at Frethun requires additional security measures to be taken to secure the site. Following discussions, SNCF have undertaken to introduce measures to improve security as a matter of urgency.
<P>

<a name="20617w30.html_para11">In the forthcoming Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Bill the Government are seeking to amend the Civil Penalty provisions of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 to bring about a more flexible, but enforceable penalty regime. The object of the Civil Penalty is to persuade those responsible for vehicles and other transport to secure and check them properly to prevent the carriage of clandestine entrants. The Civil Penalty provisions apply equally to rail freight and freight shuttle wagons operating through the tunnel and since its introduction in clandestine entry on the Eurotunnel freight shuttle service has reduced dramatically.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20617w31.html_spnew4"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 With respect to questions <i>(a)</i> and (b), (i) and (ii), and A, B and C, the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority (CICA) advises that it does not have a classification on its casework database corresponding to these specific types of case. To answer those questions accurately would accordingly require the individual examination of every case where the victim was a young child at the time of injury. That could be done only at disproportionate cost.
<P>

<a name="20617w31.html_para9">It can take a considerable time to complete the assessment of compensation payable in individual cases that involve severe or complex injuries. However, once eligibility has been established in principle, CICA may make interim awards, for example in respect of the care needs of a severely injured child.
<P>

<a name="20617w31.html_para10">CICA obtains and meets the cost of all the reports it considers necessary to inform a fair and accurate assessment of an application. No applicant is required to provide reports. However, some do provide reports in support of their view of the award that they should receive. Where the Authority considers reports or other information submitted by an applicant to be inaccurate, inadequate, or out of date, it may propose that supplementary information be provided at the applicant's expense.
<P>

<a name="20617w31.html_para11">Generally, CICA does not reimburse the cost of care or other reports, commissioned by applicants or their representatives. However, CICA will make interim awards of compensation so that an applicant has the funds to pay for any specialist report that he or she may wish to obtain. The Authority is not routinely told the cost of care reports commissioned by third parties. And the records held by CICA of the cost of reports that it has paid for do not differentiate between care reports and others. Consequently CICA has no centrally held data from which to derive the average cost of a care report.
<P>

<a name="20617w31.html_para12">Where it appears that the combination of the tariff award and the assessment of special expenses is highly likely to exceed the Scheme limit of &#163;500,000 per case, CICA will usually concentrate on the main heads of claim to shorten the process involved in reaching the determination. However, where the victim is a severely injured young child the process of assessment may be complicated by considerations such as life expectancy and difficulty in reaching a firm long-term prognosis.
<P>

<a name="20617w31.html_para13">In such cases the local authority's assessment of care needs and details of what it will provide free of charge are an essential part of the corresponding assessment of costs under the Tariff Scheme. This is because local authorities tend to provide services to children without charge, and paragraph 35(d) of the Scheme specifies that the reasonable costs of care services may be provided for in an award of compensation only where they are not available free of charge from the national health service, local authorities or any other agency.

The test of success will be whether the measures being put in place will make a real difference to the quality of life of individuals and communities up and down the country.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what the mandate of the Committee on the system for comparison of fingerprints for the effective application of the Dublin Convention (Eurodac) is; how many times it has met over the last 12 months; what the UK representation on it is; what the annual cost of its work is to public funds; if he will list the items currently under its consideration; if he will take steps to increase its accountability and transparency to Parliament; and if he will make a statement.

 The Committee established by Article 23 of the EURODAC Regulation assists the Commission in accordance with Articles 5 and 7 of the Council Decision laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission (199/468/EC).
<P>

<a name="20617w32.html_para4">Article 22 of the EURODAC Regulation specifies that the EURODAC Central Unit may be charged with carrying out statistical tasks on the basis of data processed at the Central Unit, other than those already specified in Article 3(3) of the Regulation. In these circumstances the additional statistical measures are to be adopted in accordance with the procedure of the Committee. All the important implementing powers were reserved to the Council, such as agreement on the EURODAC Implementing Rules, which were adopted by Council on 28 February 2002.
<P>

<a name="20617w32.html_para5">The EURODAC system is not yet operational. There are no immediate plans for the Committee to meet, but if it does the United Kingdom will be represented by a Home Office official and an official from the United Kingdom Permanent Representation in Brussels. The work of the Committee is funded by the European Community budget and travel costs to attend Committee meetings are met by the European Commission. The Home Office pays a subsistence allowance to cover attendance at a Committee meeting.
<P>

<a name="20617w32.html_para6">The Commission is required to prepare annual reports on the implementation work of the Committee, which are submitted to the Council and European Parliament. The reports are also published on the EUROPA internet website. I do not see a need for further measures to increase the Committee's accountability and transparency.

[59268]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20617w32.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The police have the power to take fingerprints and non-intimate DNA samples, with or without consent, from people in police custody who are charged with, informed they will be reported for, or convicted of a recordable offence. In these cases individuals are informed as part of the custody process that their DNA and fingerprints will be subject to speculative database searches and may be retained indefinitely.
<P>

<a name="20617w32.html_para8">DNA samples given voluntarily for the purposes of elimination are only retained if the volunteer has given written consent. In such cases, the volunteer signs a statement giving their consent. The statement also informs them that consent cannot later be withdrawn. Fingerprints taken for elimination purposes may also be retained if the volunteer has given written consent. Under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (as amended) retained fingerprints and DNA samples can only be used for the purposes related to the prevention or detection of crime, the investigation of an offence or the conduct of a prosecution.

 We announced funding approval for a project in the Arthurs Hill area of Newcastle under the second round of the Reducing Burglary Initiative in May 2000. The project, between the Northumbria police and Newcastle city council, received a grant of &#163;137,000 to cover the costs of a range of interventions, including Close Circuit Television (CCTV) schemes and other target hardening measures. Out of the grant, a total of &#163;133,493 has been claimed. The project has been highly successful, having achieved a 20 per cent. reduction in burglaries in the Arthurs Hill area and a 50 per cent. reduction in Richardson Road.

<a name="20617w33.html_para4">The Government is committed to reversing the recent decline in the number of special constables. As we outlined in the White Paper, the current police reform process is an opportunity to achieve a stronger, increasingly professional special constabulary. Measures to achieve this include: a new headline role focusing on intelligence led patrolling and crime reduction initiatives; a new national foundation training package for special constables; joint Home Office/Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) good practice guidance covering recruitment, management and deployment of specials; new conditions of service and conduct regulations.
<P>

<a name="20617w33.html_para5">In January 2002 we ran a press campaign targeting specials as part of the national recruitment campaign for the regular police service. And as my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary (Mr. Blunkett) recently announced at the Confederation of British Industry, we will also be working with employers to encourage them to support employees who are specials.

The Department for Transport, Local Government and the Regions has also issued funding agreements to Northumberland county council, the North East Assembly's accountable body, in respect of 2001&#150;02 and 2002&#150;03 and 2003&#150;04 combined.

<a name="20617w36.html_para6">Prior to 31 March 2000 disposals were at local management discretion. A national scheme was established whereby charities in each region were invited to request replaced equipment and collect it at their own expense. Unusable equipment was discarded. Security and environmental factors were taken into consideration at all times. The cost incurred in disposal was minimal and related mainly to the time of the departmental staff involved.
<P>

<a name="20617w36.html_para7">On 31 March 2000 ownership of HMCE desktop and laptop computers passed to ICL (now Fujitsu Services) under a PFI contract. The contracted service charge covers replacement and disposal costs as well as provision of the day to day services. Fujitsu Services operate a Second Time Around Replacement (STAR) system, whereby renovated equipment is deployed as far as economically possible to reduce costs. During 1999, the Inland Revenue replaced all its PCs, laptops, servers and printers under a major programme known as Infrastructure 2000 (i2K). The aims of the programme were to introduce a common, market-centred infrastructure platform and to meet Year 2000 security requirements. Some 60,000 terminals were installed during this period (the largest NT installation in Europe at the time). Under i2K, a large percentage of the Department's existing IT kit was upgraded, refurbished and redeveloped as part of the deals negotiated with equipment suppliers. Because of this and the massive scale of the i2K programme (cost over &#163;200 million), specific costs on disposal of individual items for the financial year 1999&#150;2000 would be available only at disproportionate cost.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what level of penalty is charged against those failing to submit returns to the Inland Revenue; how many businesses have received these penalties against them over the past three years; and what the total amount received by the Exchequer as a result of these fines was.  [61312]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20617w37.html_spnew4"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 The Inland Revenue charges late filing penalties for Self Assessment (SA), Corporation Tax Self Assessment (CTSA) and Pay As You Earn (PAYE) tax. SA taxpayers failing to submit returns by the filing date are charged a &#163;100 penalty and a second &#163;100 penalty if they have not filed six months after the due date. The Inland Revenue can also seek penalties of between &#163;10 and &#163;60 a day at the discretion of the Tax Commissioners on SA taxpayers who persist in not filing a return. Employers and contractors failing to submit a PAYE return are charged a penalty of &#163;100 per month the return is later for each 50 employees or subcontractors. Companies that are late in filing their CTSA returns are charged &#163;100 if they file less than three months after the filing date, &#163;200 if they are between three and 18 months late (if the company files late on three consecutive occasions, these penalties increase to &#163;500 and &#163;1,000 respectively), 10 per cent. of their unpaid tax if they are 18 months to two years late and 20 per cent. of their unpaid tax if they are more than two years late in filing.
<P>

<a name="20617w37.html_para1">Businesses may be liable to submit a return as employers, or under the SA or CTSA regulations. But these regulations also include non-business taxpayers such as employees taxed at the higher rate who are within SA. The Inland Revenue does not distinguish between penalties charged on businesses and other types of taxpayers, so the figures that follow are for all penalties within SA, CTSA and PAYE.

<P>

<a name="20617w37.html_para5">The issue of a penalty notice lets the customer know that a penalty has been incurred. The nil penalty notice gives the customer who knows the return is late (and has no tax liability) confirmation that the penalty is capped at nil. As the penalty may not remain at nil (if, for example, the customer amends the return or tax becomes payable following an inquiry) it is important that the customer is aware that a penalty has been incurred.

 None. An individual's employment status for tax and national insurance purposes depends on the terms and conditions under which that person is engaged. Where the Inland Revenue discovers that someone is working on terms which should mean they are employed but are being treated incorrectly by their employer as self-employed then the employer may have to meet extra tax and national insurance liabilities for past years, interest and penalties.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health, pursuant to the answer to the hon. Member for Warrington, North (Helen Jones), of 24 May 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, column 691W, on chiropody, how many of the 6,500 proposed extra professionals will be chiropodists.  [61941]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20617w40.html_spnew5"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 As at 30 September 2001 there were 3,400 more qualified therapists and other professional staff than at 30 September 1999. Of these, 190 (6 per cent.) are chiropodists. We would expect this proportion of chiropodists to be broadly similar in 2004.

<a name="20617w40.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The National Health Service Pensions Agency operates internal controls to ensure the correct pension benefits are being paid, including periodic checks on entitlement to ongoing pension payments. As reported in the resource accounts for the NHS pension scheme the agency also takes part in the national fraud initiative co-ordinated by the Audit Commission, to ensure pension payments were still being made to the individual originally entitled to the pension.
<P>

<a name="20617w40.html_para2">Once overpayments have been identified, the agency has a special team who pursue recovery in accordance with the guidance in Government Accounting. Where necessary, cases are referred to solicitors for recovery, or, in cases involving fraud, to counter fraud specialists in the Department or the police.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health how many <i>(a)</i> agency staff, <i>(b)</i> positions unfilled for (i) one month and (ii) three months and <i>(c)</i> staff in children in care settings there were in each quarter of each of the last three years.  [61368]<P>

<P>
<a name="20617w40.html_spnew10"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 We do not collect information on the numbers of agency staff who work in child care settings. Information about the number of child care positions unfilled is not collected on a regular basis. Ad hoc surveys have been undertaken in the past which have determined the vacancy rates in child care posts in social services departments or in the private sector. The last survey undertaken in this area was for 'Community Homes for Children Looked After' run by local authorities in England and Wales, and it was undertaken in 1999. This survey stated that in England the overall full-time and part-time vacancy rates were both 10.3 per cent.
<P>

<a name="20617w40.html_para4">However, local authority social services departments in England complete an annual return giving information about the staff they employ as at 30 September. The data from this return gives the number of whole time equivalent staff employed in child and family services as follows:

1. Three month vacancies are vacancies as at 31 March 2001 which trusts are actively trying to fill, which had lasted for three months or more (whole time equivalents).<P>

2. Three month vacancy rates are three month vacancies expressed as a percentage of three month vacancies plus staff in post from the September 2000 medical and dental work force census (whole time equivalent).<P>

3. Vacancy and staff in post numbers are rounded to the nearest 10, 0 being between 0&#150;5.<P>

4. Percentages are rounded to one decimal place.<P>

5. Due to rounding calculating the vacancy rates using the above data may not equal the actual vacancy rates.<P>

<P>

<a name="20617w41.html_para3">In the case of Ravenscroft Nursing Home, I understand that the current provider is already registered with the NCSC and that a Mr. and Mrs. O'Carroll are applying for registration with the NCSC in order to take over the care home. I understand that there has been some delay in processing the application due to a number of factors. Partly because the original application was submitted on out-of-date registration forms and had to be resubmitted, and, regrettably, because the NCSC mislaid the revised application in the 11,000 received at that time. However, the documentation has now been received and is satisfactory. Mr. and Mrs. O'Carroll's interview with the NCSC has been arranged for 17 June and, once Criminal Records Bureau checks have been received, a final decision will be made about registration.

<a name="20617w41.html_spnew6"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 The procedures for adopting a child from Macedonia are broadly the same as for adopting a child from any overseas country. Before any person may adopt a child they must first be assessed by an approved adoption agency as being suitable to adopt. As part of the approval process a home study report is prepared and presented to an adoption panel for approval. Following this, the report is then endorsed by the agency's decision maker and forwarded to the Department where a certificate of eligibility to adopt is prepared in line with the Adoption of Children from Overseas Regulations 2001.
<P>

<a name="20617w41.html_para5">In the case of an application to adopt a Macedonian child, the completed home study and the certificate of eligibility to adopt are sent to the Ministry of Labour and Social Policy in Macedonia. The Ministry of Labour and Social Policy will then seek to identify a suitable child for the applicants. If a match is made, the applicants may then make arrangements to travel overseas and adopt the child. The applicants will then apply for entry clearance, in the normal way, to enable them to bring the child into the UK for the purposes of adoption.
<P>

<a name="20617w41.html_para6">On their return to the UK the applicants must notify their local social services department of their intention to adopt with 14 days. As Macedonia is not included on the list of countries whose adoption orders are recognised in the UK, an application will need to be made to a UK court to re-adopt the child.

<P>
<a name="20617w41.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The report 'Securing our Future Health: Taking a Long-Term View' (the Wanless report) does not make any recommendations on increasing the number of students entering medical or nurse training. The Government and higher education institutions are midway through the process of delivering the increased numbers of students entering medical and nursing training that were announced in 1998 and the NHS Plan. By 2004 the number of students entering nurse training will be 5,500 a year more than in 1999 and by 2005 the number of students entering medical school will be almost 2,150 a year more than in 1997.

 Detailed confidential discussions were held with five major pharmaceutical companies who were known to have vaccine manufacturing capability either in the UK or in Europe. The companies approached were Acambis, Aventis Pasteur, Glaxo Smith Kline, RIVM and PowderJect. Our requirements for vaccine strain, timing and delivery and the need to meet current vaccine manufacturing guidelines were made clear to each of the companies and confirmed in writing. Each of the companies was then given time to submit their responses.

 The information requested is not available as specific budgets of health authorities and primary care trusts for continence services are not determined centrally. They receive unified allocations to cover the costs of hospital and community health services, discretionary funding for general practice staff, premises and computers and primary care prescribing.
<P>

<a name="20617w43.html_para2">The level of funding made available for continence provision is therefore a local decision. It is for health authorities in partnership with primary care groups/trusts and other local stakeholders to determine how best to use their funds to meet national and local priorities for improving health, tackling health inequalities and modernising services
<P>

<a name="20617w43.html_para3">The details of a transfer of resources from local authorities to cover nursing care/continence from 2003&#150;04 will be the subject of a separate consultation over the summer.

<a name="20617w43.html_para5">The &#163;6 million figure was arrived at on the basis that approximately two thirds of the population receiving nursing care in care homes (over 40,000) are incontinent and this figure represents an average cost to the national health service of providing continence services to them.

<a name="20617w43.html_para6">&#163;6 million of the &#163;100 million allocated to national health service funded nursing care from 1 October 2001 was for the continence needs of self-funders who had previously had to pay nursing homes for continence services. &#163;12 million will be available to the NHS for this year's 2002&#150;03 full year costs for this group.

<a name="20617w43.html_spnew7"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 The National Care Standards Commission (NCSC) took over responsibility for the regulation of all care homes in England on 1 April 2002, including care homes not previously required to register. The NCSC is responsible for regulating care homes in accordance with national minimum standards to ensure consistency and improve the quality of life and level of protection for the most vulnerable people in society.
<P>

<a name="20617w43.html_para7">The NCSC is currently dealing with a heavy load of applications under the new arrangements and there is some delay in dealing with some applications. The NCSC is taking steps to deal with this and expects the average time for processing applications to reduce as the number of applications comes down to more normal levels.
<P>

<a name="20617w43.html_para8">The NCSC's staffing establishment is 2,352 of which 1,874 staff are currently in post. As this is the NCSC's first year of operation, we have no historical data as yet on actual running costs of the NCSC. However, the NCSC is planning its work for 2002&#150;03 on the basis of a budget of &#163;131 million revenue and &#163;1.5 million capital. The NCSC's programme of inspections was not expected to get fully under way before June 2002 due to factors such as completing office accommodation moves and information technology set-ups, transferring staff, finalising inspector training and giving due notice to providers of the inspections. Nevertheless, from the information currently available, 66 inspections were carried out in April and 612 in May. 2,034 inspections are planned for June.
<P>

<a name="20617w43.html_para9">Application forms for registration are usually sent out by first class post. Information is not available on the times taken to send out packs containing application forms. Requests for packs are responded to within two working days where possible, although some delays have occurred due to a higher than planned volume of demand requiring forms to be reprinted. Information is currently not available on the times taken to inspect nursing and residential homes which have applied for registration, but this will become available later this year.
<P>

<a name="20617w43.html_para10">Details of registration procedures and application forms for nursing and residential care homes are available on the NCSC's website www.carestandards.org.uk
<P>

<a name="20617w43.html_para11">Regulatory fees for care homes increased on 1 April this year. This is the first increase in fees since 1 May 1998. The increase reflects the effects of inflation on the value of fees but also our longer-term aim of moving to full cost recovery. Despite this increase, care homes currently only pay 31 per cent. of the actual cost of registration and inspection. We recognise that fees are not the only extra cost of the new regulatory system to care homes. We are increasing total resources available for social services by an average of six per cent. a year in real terms over the next three years (2003&#150;04 to 2005&#150;06). These increases follow average annual real 



<P>
<P><I>17 Jun 2002 : Column 167W</I><P>
terms increases of more than three per cent. between 1996&#150;97 and 2002&#150;03 including a 3.6 per cent. real terms increase this year (2002&#150;03). These substantial increases in resources, in particular over the next three years, will enable local authorities to deliver the improvements to social services to which the Government are committed. It also means that local authorities have the resources they need to purchase services at realistic prices.
<P>

<a name="20617w43.html_para12">Under the previous regulatory system, care homes were inspected by around 250 local authorities and health authorities each applying its own, sometimes contradictory, local conditions for registration. This system had been criticised over several years for lacking independence, consistency and coherence. The NCSC will, by contrast, inspect care homes using national standards. Due to the large number of different standards set under the previous regulatory system, I cannot say in detail how national standards may differ from them. This will vary from area to area. However, national standards were widely consulted on and the finalised standards were set at a level already being met or exceeded by many providers and which others should be able to meet over time.

 I refer the hon. Member to the reply which I gave him on 16 May 2002, <i>Official Report,</i> column 871W. The projections published by the Personal Social Service Research Unit also include projections of long-stay beds in hospital. Projections of general and acute beds are contained in "Delivering the NHS Plan", copies of which are available in the Library.

<a name="20617w44.html_para0">In planning expenditure on long-term care, we need to take into account a number of other factors beyond the numbers of beds. People generally prefer to be supported in their own homes and so we are developing services which promote greater independence. As announced in the Budget, we are increasing the resources for personal social services by six per cent. in real terms in each of the next three years. This will ensure that councils have the resources that they need to purchase good quality services for the people that they serve. The organisation and

<sup>(68)</sup> WTE data have been estimated using the results from the 1992&#150;93GMP Workload Survey. Full-time = 1.00 wte; three quarter time = 0.69 wte, job share = 0.65 wte, half time = 0.60 wte.<P>

<P>

<sup>(69)</sup> There were 286 LIZ Assistants in the 1996 census, we do not have sufficient details to calculate wte data below a national level. The national total for 1996 has been estimated based onavailable headcount data and a such will not equal the sum of components. Because of this, London data for 1996 and subsequent calculations based on 1996 London data needs to be treated with caution.<P>

The national total for 1996 has been estimated based onavailable headcount data and a such will not equal the sum of components. Because of this, London data for 1996 and subsequent calculations based on 1996 London data needs to be treated with caution.<P>
