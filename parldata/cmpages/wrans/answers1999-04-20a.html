<P>
<a name="90420w01.htm_wqn0"><B> Mr. Sanders: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what assessment she has made of the speed of the disaster relief response to events in Kosovo; and if she will make a statement.  [80786]<P>

<P>
<a name="90420w01.htm_spnew0"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 The international response to the massive refugee outflows was regrettably slow to start with. But the international community has mobilised substantial humanitarian assistance for the refugees in a remarkably short time. The UK has been at the forefront of efforts to speed up the relief operations, notably by providing logistical and other practical support (through airlifts, cargo handling equipment, transport assets, and logistics experts) to overcome practical constraints in assistance delivery.

<P>
<a name="90420w01.htm_wqn1"><B> Mr. Sanders: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for International Development if she will make it her policy to set up in partnership with NGOs a permanent disaster relief contact point.  [80785]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90420w01.htm_spnew1"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 We have an established and effective contact point for disaster and emergency relief in the Department for International Development's Conflict and Humanitarian Affairs Department. We are also working in close partnership with NGOs concerned with humanitarian assistance, and arrangements for regular contact are in place. I do not believe it would be useful to merge government and NGO response to disasters. My department is able to move very rapidly in the early stages, NGO response takes longer but is highly valued and creates aid outlets for public contributions. Both have important roles to play.

To ask the Prime Minister for which areas of gross receipts of EU moneys it was decided that the United Kingdom total would diminish as a consequence of the Berlin summit; by how much; and if he will make a statement.  [81224]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90420w01.htm_spmin0"><B>The Prime Minister:</B> 
 The Berlin European Council decided the ceilings on spending across the EU on each major policy category. It did not decide how much was to be spent in each state: that is largely a matter for the Commission's management of the budget. While the Council did make decisions about the rules for allocating the structural and cohesion funds, the Commission has yet to announce the allocations from the Funds for each Member State. These figures will not be available until the regulations are finally approved in May.

<a name="90420w01.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 To date the Victims Liaison Unit has been allocated the &#163;5 million announced by the Prime Minister in his statement of 12 May 1998. The Unit has been consulting widely with the victims community with a view to identifying needs and prioritising how this money can best be allocated. In the meantime, I have announced a number of significant funding initiatives to the value of &#163;2,196,170, to support victims and a Newsletter outlining progress has been placed in the House of Commons Library.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90420w01.htm_wqn7"><B> Mr. Mitchell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions, pursuant to the answer to the hon. Member for North Cornwall (Mr. Tyler) of 10 February 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>285</i>, on research into the production of genetically modified grasses for grazing, what procedures would need to be adopted under what legislation for the production of such crops for <i>(a)</i> research, including legal grazing by animals and <i>(b)</i> sale for grazing; and what powers he has to prohibit such activity.  [72181]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90420w01.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
<i> [holding answer 22 February 1999]: </i>All research releases of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) are governed by the Genetically Modified Organisms (Deliberate Release) Regulations 1992 (amended in 1995 and 1997) which give effect to Part VI of the Environment Protection Act 1990 and implement the EC Directive 90/220/EEC on the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms.
<P>

<a name="90420w01.htm_para1">Anyone intending to produce or grow genetically modified grasses for research purposes requires a consent from the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions. This includes the requirement to carry out a detailed environmental risk assessment.
<P>

<a name="90420w01.htm_para2">For grazing to be permitted on grasses grown for research purposes, the consent would have explicitly to include this permission. This would be allowed only where the applicant could show that such activities would involve negligible risk.
<P>

<a name="90420w01.htm_para3">The sale of genetically modified grasses is governed by EC Directive 90/220 on the deliberate release of GMOs. No GMO may be sold without a consent issued under this Directive. A notifier may apply through any EC Member State, which then invites comments from all other Member States before an agreement is reached at Community level. The marketing consent is then valid across the EC.
<P>

<a name="90420w01.htm_para4">The Secretary of State may prohibit or restrict the release of the GMO where information comes to light indicating risk to human health or the environment. Where this involves the sale of a GMO product, the provisional restriction must be cleared by the European Community in order to have permanent effect.

<a name="90420w01.htm_wqn8"><B> Mr. Stunell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what measures 



<P>
<P><I>20 Apr 1999 : Column: 474</I><P>
he plans to take to raise public awareness of maximum national speed limits for various classes of road vehicles; and if he will make a statement.  [79691]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90420w01.htm_spnew6"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 Details of the national speed limits are contained in the Highway Code. The theory test for learner drivers of all classes of vehicles contains appropriate questions about different speed limits. Although we have no immediate plans to publicise vehicle speed limits more widely, we will look at the issue of vehicle speed limit signing as part of the wider review of speed management policy which is currently under way.

<a name="90420w01.htm_sbhd9"><H4><center>Crosby Driving Test Centre</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="90420w01.htm_wqn9"><B> Mrs. Curtis-Thomas: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what information was provided to staff at Crosby Driving Test Centre, prior to its closure, concerning the future of the test centre and its staff.  [80722]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90420w01.htm_spnew7"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 Staff at the Crosby centre were kept informed about its future in the months prior to March 1998 by their line management, and relocations to neighbouring test centres in the event of Crosby closing were discussed. On 10 March 1998, the Driving Standards Agency's Northern Area Deputy Manager wrote to staff at the Crosby test centre. The note confirmed oral briefings the staff had already received from their local Supervising Examiner and provided an update about the imminent expiry of the lease on the centre at the end of March.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90420w01.htm_wqn10"><B> Mr. Brake: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what plans he has to establish a public interest company or trust for the London Underground.  [81117]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90420w01.htm_spnew8"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 Our plan is to implement a public-private partnership for London Underground. This will require changes to the structure of London Underground as a company, so that it becomes an operations business, responsible for operating train services and stations. It will remain in the public sector and will transfer in due course to the Greater London Authority and Transport for London, restoring local democratic accountability for its performance. We have no plans to establish a trust.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90420w01.htm_wqn11"><B> Mr. Brake: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if the financial advice given to his Department and London Transport indicated that a public private partnership for London Underground represented best value.  [81116]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90420w01.htm_spnew9"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The financial advice which informed our decision to pursue a public-private partnership for London Underground suggested that this route was likely to offer best value. The reasons for the Government's choice of the option currently being taken forward by London Underground were set out in a paper, "London Underground Public-Private Partnership: Facts and Analysis", which was deposited in the Library on 20 March 1998.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions, pursuant to his answer of 25 February 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>404</i>, on London Transport, what is the asset value of buildings held by London Transport.  [81115]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90420w02.htm_spnew0"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 As at 31 March 1998, the total net value for the London Transport Group, net of depreciation and disposals and based on (1) infrastructure and other property and (2) assets in the course of construction, is &#163;6,133.1 million.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90420w02.htm_wqn1"><B> Dr. Cable: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what consultations he has had with water companies and the Water Regulator about extending the scope of water metering to include homes which have undergone extensions and conversions since 1990.  [80904]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90420w02.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Meale: </B> 
 Under the Water Industry Act 1991, water undertakers may fix charges by reference to such matters, and may adopt such methods and principles for the calculation and imposition of the charges, as appear to them to be appropriate. They therefore have considerable scope to extend metering to customers, including to those whose properties have been extended or converted since 1990.
<P>

<a name="90420w02.htm_para0">However, clause 7 of the Water Industry Bill, currently before Parliament, would introduce a new right for households to remain on an unmeasured charge in their present homes, save where they are meeting certain conditions. My right hon. Friend the Minister for the Environment indicated during the Second Reading of the Bill, 7 December 1998, <i>Official Report,</i> column 46, that we envisaged the right to remain on an unmeasured charge would not apply where premises are used for commercial purposes, where there is a garden sprinkler or swimming pool use, where they have a power shower consuming more than 20 litres per minute or where there is use of a water-softening unit that requires backwashing.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90420w02.htm_wqn2"><B> Mr. Harvey: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what representations he has had from each regional development agency concerning the budgets given to them by his Department; what his response has been; if he will list the regional development agencies with which his Department is in dispute over the budget allocation; what mechanisms he plans to introduce to enable regional development agencies to negotiate for their budgets in the future; what impact disputes between the regional development agencies and his Department on the budget allocation are having on the day-to-day running of the agencies; and if he will make a statement.  [80795]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90420w02.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Meale: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend the Minister for the Regions, Regeneration and Planning has received a letter from the Chairman of the South West of England Regional Development Agency about funding for staff engaged on projects to regenerate the Royal William Yard, Plymouth and Temple Quay, Bristol. Discussions 



<P>
<P><I>20 Apr 1999 : Column: 476</I><P>
are taking place between officials of the Department and officers of the Agency and my right hon. Friend will reply to the Chairman as soon as these are complete.
<P>

<a name="90420w02.htm_para1">There have also been contacts between officials in the Department and officers in other regional development agencies about their budgets. These discussions have been constructive and do not amount to our being "in dispute" with the agencies.
<P>

<a name="90420w02.htm_para2">For future years, the agencies will bid for resources as part of an annual corporate planning round.

<a name="90420w02.htm_wqn3"><B> Mr. Sanders: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what plans he has to cap the prices charged by water companies which raise their charges by unjustifiable amounts; and if he will make a statement.  [80787]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90420w02.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Meale: </B> 
 Water companies in England and Wales are subject to economic regulation by the Director General of Water Services. The Director General sets annual price limits and oversees the operation of the tariff basket, to which overall price limits apply.

<a name="90420w02.htm_sbhd4"><H4><center>Council Tax</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="90420w02.htm_wqn4"><B> Mr. Sanders: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will list the <i>(a)</i> expected and <i>(b)</i> actual receipts from council tax for each year since the council tax was introduced.  [80789]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90420w02.htm_spnew4"><B> Ms Armstrong: </B> 
 The information requested is in the table.
<P>

<a name="90420w02.htm_para3">Expected receipts are the total amount that councils billed for, net of reliefs and council tax benefits, in respect of each financial year and do not, therefore, make an allowance for non-collection.
<P>

<a name="90420w02.htm_para4">The actual receipts are the amounts received in each financial year against that year's council tax bills. Five authorities in 1994-95 were unable to provide this figure, so a figure of their total council tax receipts minus receipts for arrears has been used. The same applies to one authority in 1995-96.

 The Department continues to contract the Institute of Zoology to post-mortem small cetaceans that strand around the shores of England and Wales.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90420w02.htm_spnew9"><B> Mr. Meale: </B> 
 We have taken a number of actions to help people suffering from fuel poverty, including pensioner households.
<P>

<a name="90420w02.htm_para5">We have reduced the level of VAT on fuel, so that people can more easily afford to keep warm. We have also reduced the VAT on energy saving materials installed through Government grant schemes, so that they can more easily insulate their homes. We are now exploring with the European Commission the possibility of a wider reduction in VAT on energy saving materials.
<P>

<a name="90420w02.htm_para6">We have released substantial additional funds to help improve our housing stock; in total some &#163;5 billion is being made available over the lifetime of this Parliament for investment in housing. Most of the additional resources are going to local authorities and will be spent according to the needs and priorities identified in their housing strategy. We estimate that around one third of the money is likely to lead directly or indirectly to improvements in energy efficiency.




<P>
<P><I>20 Apr 1999 : Column: 478</I><P>

<P>

<a name="90420w02.htm_para7">We have also allocated an additional &#163;150 million specifically to tackling fuel poverty through domestic energy efficiency improvements.

 The new Approved Document for Part M of the Building Regulations makes no reference to the topography of the site, as this will change with excavation and earth moving. A steeply sloping plot is defined as a plot gradient of more than 1 in 15. Plot gradient is defined as the gradient measured between the finished floor level of the dwelling and the point of access, which is the point at which a person visiting a dwelling would normally alight from a vehicle prior to approaching the dwelling. This point may be within or outside the plot. The guidance in the Approved Document anticipates that in most circumstances it should be possible to provide a level or ramped approach and a stepped approach would be the exception, used only when unavoidable.

 The public should look principally to goods and services providers for advice about the likely effect of the date change on supply. The Government and Action 2000 are encouraging organisations to communicate with their customers. For instance, the British Bankers Association, APACS and the Building Societies Association have published (on 5 March) "Your Money and the Millennium", reassuring customers that cash machines will work and that there will be ample supplies of bank notes, so that customers do not need to hoard them.
<P>

<a name="90420w03.htm_para3">There is a role for the Government in bringing together basic information so that the public can have an overall picture of the likely impact of the Bug on their daily lives. In October 1998, Action 2000 published "Homecheck": this provided practical advice about the impact of the Bug on domestic appliances and PCs. The Government will build on this with the issue of further information, beginning in the late Spring, supported by limited TV and press advertising. This will cost around &#163;5 million. The information will also be available from the Action 2000 Actionline and on its website.

<a name="90420w04.htm_para0">When it comes to other forms of body piercing, the question of what is a valid consent is governed by common law.

 There are positive signs of improvement in many of the business areas of the Immigration and Nationality Directorate.

Travel Documents will be issued only to people who have valid leave to remain in the United Kingdom. It is, therefore, not possible to issue documents where an application for leave remains outstanding, although passports will be returned to applicants where they need to travel. Compensation will be paid only in cases of maladministration where the costs are reasonable and have been actually and necessarily incurred; each case will be treated on its merits.

<P>
<a name="90420w06.htm_spnew4"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 The procedures to be followed when undertaking environmental appraisals are set out in Government guidance on "Policy Appraisal and the Environment" (Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions, 1998). These guidelines make clear that a policy should be subject to a full environmental appraisal when it is likely to have a significant effect on the environment, and that the level of resources devoted to each appraisal should be proportionate to the policy or programme.
<P>

<a name="90420w06.htm_para5">This guidance applies equally to the Budget measures, and it is the approach used when evaluating the numerous options which are considered in preparation for the Budget.

 Customs and Excise use a variety of ways to inform business of changes to the VAT rules. In all cases, changes are notified by VAT Notes, which are sent to all VAT registered businesses. Changes which stem from the Budget are announced in Customs and Excise Budget Notices, available from local VAT offices on Budget Day, after the Chancellor has sat down. Other changes are notified to businesses by Business Briefs, also available from local VAT offices and issued to subscribers. All these publications are also available on the Internet.

 <i>[holding answer 12 March 1999]:</i> The set-up time from approval of note design to the issue of the note is dependent on the specification, the complexity and the required launch volumes. The duration of the origination and plate-making process, and the set-up and proof printing for the Bank of England and other Central Banks in general, is between four and five months. However, if the banknote contains features that require additional equipment, then the lead time of that equipment must be included. Specialist equipment lead times can be up to one year.

 <i>[holding answer 13 April 1999]:</i> HM Treasury receives a large volume of both official, unofficial and working texts during the course of negotiations on EU legislation. In order to facilitate the work of the European Scrutiny Committee, Explanatory Memorandums are often submitted on the basis of unofficial texts if an official text, formally circulated to Member States from the Council Secretariat, has not yet been received. HM Treasury keep the Committee informed of substantive progress in negotiations by supplementary Memoranda or Ministerial letter, sometimes accompanied by a draft text if appropriate. It would involve disproportionate cost to provide a definitive list of the unofficial draft documents made available to the Committee since 1 May 1997.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will list the figures used in preparing Chart 2.4 of the Red Book on the basis of <i>(a)</i> per cent. of GDP and <i>(b)</i> cash terms; and if he will estimate the effect of the same assumptions on the public sector net cash requirement over the same periods.  [80866]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90420w08.htm_spnew3"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 Figures used in Chart 2.4 as a per cent. of GDP can be found in Table 2.6 of the Red Book and are reproduced from 1990-91 onwards in the following table. Figures for the cautious case can be calculated by applying the ready reckoners set out in Table 3.1 of 'Fiscal policy: public finances and the cycle', published on 9 March alongside the Red Book. Figures can be converted to cash terms using money GDP figures from Table 2.1 of 'Economic Trends', published by the Office for National Statistics, and Table B4 of the Red Book.
<P>

<a name="90420w08.htm_para0">The cyclical behaviour of the public sector net cash requirement matches (with opposite sign) that of the current budget. Figures for the cyclically adjusted public sector net cash requirement can thus be calculated by applying the difference between the actual and cyclically adjusted surplus on current budget to the public sector net cash requirement (set out in Tables B26 and B27 of the Red Book). Figures for the cautious case and in cash terms can be calculated by use of the methods set out.

 A successful single currency will act as a complement to the Single Market. It will reduce transaction costs and exchange rate uncertainty on trade within the euro zone. It will make prices more transparent, boosting competition and providing new opportunities for companies to trade and invest.

 Following the transfer of powers, the National Assembly will be responsible for overseeing the administration of concessionary fares schemes operated by local authorities under the provisions of Part V of the Transport Act 1985. The nature of the schemes is at present a matter for local authority discretion, although the Government are committed to the introduction of legislation to set a minimum standard for pensioners travelling on buses. In the meantime, the Welsh Office has worked closely with local authorities and I have ensured that all authorities in Wales are in a position to operate schemes for pensioners which at least meet a minimum standard of a &#163;5 bus pass entitling the holder to travel at half-fare. We are now working with local authorities and bus operators to prepare the way for the Welsh Assembly to support the introduction of free bus travel for pensioners over the next two to three years.

 At present it is for local authorities to make financial provision for their concessionary fares schemes from the resources available to them.

The method of funding the additional costs will be a matter for the National Assembly to determine.

<a name="90420w10.htm_para6">It is difficult to say what the actual impact on the targeted sectors will be, as much will depend on how long any retaliatory measures remain in place, what steps were taken to bring forward orders from the US, and the ability of affected companies to find alternative customers for their goods. Some limited damage will have been caused to sectors which were on but have now been removed from the retaliatory list, due to the uncertainty caused in recent months. However, we believe that the Government's prompt response in offering a bond and duty guarantee scheme for the cashmere knitwear industry pre-empted the serious risk of severe and lasting damage being done to that industry.

Friend the Member for Leeds, Central (Mr. Fatchett), the No-Fly Zones were established in response to a situation of overwhelming humanitarian necessity. Coalition aircraft patrol the No-Fly Zones in support of SCR 688 which called on Iraq to end the repression of its civilian population. The humanitarian objective is therefore to limit this repression as far as possible. This remains a vital task. as the latest report from the UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights makes clear, the Iraqi security services continue to persecute opponents of the regime on the ground. Without our continued presence in the No-Fly Zones, they would be free to do so from the air as well. With past atrocities committed by Iraqi forces in mind, including the chemical weapons attack on the Kurds in Halabjah, we are not prepared to countenance that.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (1) what assessment he has made of the safety of the antibiotic-resistant gene in Novartis's genetically modified maize;  [80794]
<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="90420w13.htm_spnew8"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The conclusions of the Advisory Committee on Novel Food and Processes (ACNFP) concerning this GM maize are recorded in the Committee's 1996 annual report which is available in the House of Commons Library. The ACNFP was satisfied that processed food ingredients derived from the maize were as safe as their conventional counterparts but expressed reservations about the use of the unprocessed maize as an animal feedingstuff because of what it considered to be a small, but finite, chance that this could lead to a transfer of antibiotic resistance.
<P>

<a name="90420w13.htm_para5">Subsequent to the ACNFP's consideration of this matter, this maize was assessed by three EC Scientific Committees, the Scientific Committee for Foods, the Scientific Committee for Plants and the Scientific Committee on Animal Nutrition, who took into account the ACNFP's views. Whilst agreeing with the ACNFP's assessment that there was a finite risk of the transfer of antibiotic resistance to cattle fed on the raw maize, all three EC Committees felt that this was too small to warrant recommending a ban on its use for animal feed. EC approval was therefore granted. The Department has however commissioned some research work at the University of Leeds to look further into the issue of the potential for the transference of antibiotic resistance from GM crops. Should any scientific evidence emerge 



<P>
<P><I>20 Apr 1999 : Column: 516</I><P>
from this which in the opinion of the ACNFP shows the risk to be greater than originally thought, the Government will consider taking action under the safeguard clause in the EC Deliberate Release Directive (90/220) to restrict the use of the raw maize in animal feed and press for an urgent reappraisal of the situation by the EC Scientific Committees and the Council.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90420w13.htm_spnew9"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 All veterinary medicines and pesticides, including those containing synthetic pyrethroids, must satisfy statutory criteria including safety. The safety assessment includes safety to the environment. Pollution incidents should not occur if safety warnings on labels are heeded. The period of recovery after a pollution incident is a matter for the environment agencies but is likely to vary according to the conditions in the river or stream concerned.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90420w13.htm_wqn10"><B> Mr. William Ross: </B>

[80874]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90420w13.htm_spnew10"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 No veterinary medicine is authorised unless it satisfies statutory criteria of safety, quality and efficacy. Safety includes safety to the environment. As part of the process of approval, the applicant company is required to submit data to the Veterinary Medicines Directorate where they are carefully assessed by specialists qualified in various scientific disciplines including ecotoxicology. No studies are carried out by the Ministry.
<P>

<a name="90420w13.htm_para6">All pesticides are similarly subject to strict statutory control. In considering the approval or review of a pesticide, an assessment is made (on the basis of data 



<P>
<P><I>20 Apr 1999 : Column: 517</I><P>
supplied by the applicant) of the risk to people, wildlife and to the wider environment. Only if this assessment shows that there is no unacceptable risk will approval be granted or allowed to continue following a review. The Ministry has carried out no studies of the kind specified into the environmental effects of synthetic pyrethroid pesticides. However, synthetic pyrethroid pesticides have been used in other MAFF funded research.

<P>
<a name="90420w14.htm_spnew6"><B> Mr. Rooker </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 19 April 1999]:</i> In certain circumstances Article 36 of the Treaty allows the maintenance of restrictions on the free movement of goods where these can be justified for the protection of the health and life of humans or animals or on grounds of public morality or policy. However, it is clear from Rulings by the European Court of Justice that we cannot use Article 36 of the Treaty to impose higher UK standards on imports where EU law has been harmonised as it has been in the field of farm animal welfare. Nor is it relevant to the UK ban on the use of Meat and Bone Meal (MBM) in animal feed as this ban is not in place because there is a known health risk to humans or animals in feeding MBM to pigs or poultry. The jurisprudence of the European Court of Justice also precludes reliance on the grounds of public morality or policy in the circumstances with which the hon. Member is concerned.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security what assessment he has made of the compatibility of his plan to limit charges for stakeholder pensions with the need for those purchasing such pensions to be given proper advice.  [81114]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90420w15.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 We recognise that proper information and advice for those who need it will be an important part of the decision-making process for individuals considering a stakeholder pension scheme.
<P>

<a name="90420w15.htm_para0">Details of the minimum standards for stakeholder pensions are subject to further consultation. The standards will include a limit on the level of charges, and in setting that limit we shall consider carefully what allowance should be made for the costs of information and advice.

<a name="90420w15.htm_wqn1"><B> Mr. Webb: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security what assessment he has made of the implications of the growing use of tracker pension funds for the economy; and what account he has taken of such an assessment in designing his stakeholder pension scheme.  [81113]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90420w15.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 No such assessment has been made. We expect that stakeholder pension schemes will, like other pension schemes, have the option of investing in tracker funds.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90420w15.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 The best available measure of the scale of Identity Fraud is provided by the Department's measurement regime (Benefit Reviews). The second 



<P>
<P><I>20 Apr 1999 : Column: 521</I><P>
Income Support review recorded the level of ID fraud at between 1 per cent. and 9 per cent. of the stock of fraud. This translates to between &#163;17.5 million and &#163;154 million.
<P>

<a name="90420w15.htm_para1">Initial characteristics of an Identity Fraudster were identified and further research was proposed to refine these characteristics further. This is a valuable line of inquiry since if the characteristics of an Identity Fraudster can be established, then we can enhance our ability to prevent, detect and target resources at identity fraud.
<P>

<a name="90420w15.htm_para2">The Identity Fraud Management Unit has now been incorporated within the Benefits Agency Security and Investigation Service (BASIS), the organised and serious fraud investigation service, who have extensive intelligence and experience in dealing with Identity related benefit crime.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90420w15.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 The Benefits Agency Security and Investigation Service (BASIS) uses an intelligence database to record all operational intelligence relating to investigations.

 The number of pensioner benefit units that will benefit from the Minimum Income Guarantee for pensioners in 1999-2000 is estimated to be 1.47 million. A pensioner benefit unit represents a single person aged 60 or over, or a couple where one or both members is aged 60 or over.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what measures the Government are undertaking to promote lifelong learning and develop the skills base of older workers as a means of improving the levels of employment among the over 50s.  [80946]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90420w15.htm_spnew8"><B> Mr. Mudie: </B> 
 The Government believe that lifelong learning contributes to national competitiveness, personal prosperity and to the development of a fair and harmonious society. The aim is to develop a "learning society" in which everyone regularly updates their skills and knowledge throughout life. Action to improve learning opportunities for the over 50s is an important part of our approach to "Better Government For Older People".
<P>

<a name="90420w15.htm_para3">Measures to promote lifelong learning and develop the skills base of older workers include: extending student loans to those aged 54, opportunities through the &#163;15 million Adult and Community Learning Fund; access to Learning Direct and Career Development Loans; and opportunities through work based learning for adults, the New Deals and Employment Zones. In addition, the New Deal for the over 50s who are out of work for six months or more and are on income replacement benefits, and their dependent partners, announced in the budget, includes plans for a learning support of up to &#163;750 for each person.

 Schools have an important role to play in helping to equip young people with the skills and knowledge they will require now and in later life. They are required to provide a curriculum which promotes the spiritual, moral, social, cultural, physical and mental development of pupils and to prepare pupils for the opportunities, responsibilities and experiences of adult life. Schools take these legal responsibilities concerning the curriculum very seriously. Many schools choose to meet them through programmes of personal, social and health education which can encompass a broad range of topics, including the dangers of gambling.

 The Medicines Control Agency cannot accept that a herbal medicine is definitively safe unless this has been proven through the licensing process. The MCA is bound to ensure, in accordance with the law, the withdrawal of all unlicensed herbal medicines which are not exempt from licensing. In the past 12 months, except for the two occasions when immediate removal on safety grounds has been effected, compliance with the law has been achieved without the need for the MCA to enforce immediate removal of a herbal medicine from the market.

 The main criteria specified for the design of the Modernising Government logo were that it should remain fresh over the period of a change management programme lasting a number of years; be capable of application to a wide range of material such as literature, computer screens and stationery; be capable of complementing other logos and publication designs; and be upbeat, bold and distinctive.

To ask the Minister of State, Lord Chancellor's Department if he will list which areas of expenditure in his Department in the non-criminal legal aid budget will be funded first when the criminal legal aid budget has been met; and if he will make a statement about how these areas have been determined. [R] [81120]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90420w18.htm_spnew10"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 It is an oversimplification to suggest that help through the Community Legal Service will be provided only after claims for criminal work. The Lord Chancellor has said that there will not be an overall budget for legal aid or a cash limit. In order to make the expenditure in each area transparent, the Lord Chancellor has made a commitment to inform Parliament immediately of any transfer of resources (other than a <i>de minimis</i> one) between the Criminal Defence Service and the Community Legal Service. The Lord Chancellor will direct national priorities for public funding taking account of the findings of need and the Government's intention to give priority to tackling social and economic exclusion. The White Paper "Modernising Justice" indicated that likely areas of priority would be social welfare cases; other cases of fundamental importance to the people affected (such as child protection, and protecting people from violence); and cases involving a wider public interest. The Access to Justice Bill places a duty on the Legal Services Commission to assess the need for legal services throughout the country and to

inform the Lord Chancellor of its findings, these findings will be used to direct resources so that identified priority areas receive funding.

<a name="90420w18.htm_wqn11"><B> Mr. Garnier: </B> 
To ask the Minister of State, Lord Chancellor's Department what assumptions he has made about factors affecting the need for criminal legal aid with particular reference to <i>(a)</i> demographic trends, <i>(b)</i> economic trends, <i>(c)</i> social trends and <i>(d)</i> policy changes in arriving at the estimated expenditure on criminal legal aid for 1999-2000 and 2000-01; and if he will make a statement. [R] [81118]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90420w18.htm_spnew11"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 No explicit assumptions are made about demographic, economic or social trends. However, forecasts do take account of inflationary pressures and planned policy change effects. The assumptions underpinning the likely impact of policy change effects take account of price, volume and behavioural changes.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90420w18.htm_wqn12"><B> Mr. Garnier: </B> 
To ask the Minister of State, Lord Chancellor's Department if he has set a level of funding for <i>(a)</i> civil legal aid and <i>(b)</i> advice and assistance below which he does not consider it viable to reduce them for (1) 1999-2000 and (2) 2000-01; and if he will make a statement. [R] [81119]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90420w18.htm_spnew12"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 No minimum levels of funding for civil legal aid and advice and assistance have been set. Neither I nor the Lord Chancellor believe that any Minister in a responsible Government would be willing to guarantee that a given level of spending on a particular function would be maintained, whatever financial pressures might fall unexpectedly on his or her Department.
<P>

<a name="90420w18.htm_para2">We are, however, determined that the Community Legal Service, which will encompass civil legal aid and advice and assistance, will be properly funded. The available resources will be committed to the Community Legal Service through the system of contracting, and will be allocated to meet priority need. In order to provide contractors with reassurance that funding will not be suddenly cut or contracts terminated, the Lord Chancellor has asked the Legal Aid Board to extend from six to twelve months the notice that will need to be given to vary or terminate a contract, except in cases of misbehaviour or breach.

To ask the Minister of State, Lord Chancellor's Department what plans he has to permit solicitors to practise as limited liability companies; and if he will make a statement. [R] [81097]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90420w18.htm_spnew13"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 Individual solicitors are already permitted to practise as limited liability companies although very few do. Limited Liability Partnerships are not at present permitted under English law. A Bill is currently being prepared by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry to introduce Limited Liability Partnerships into Great Britain. It will be for the Law Society to decide whether solicitors will be able to take advantage of this new way of structuring their businesses.
