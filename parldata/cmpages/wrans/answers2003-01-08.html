<a name="30108w02.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 I have received a number of representations in recent months concerning NATS' systems or equipment but these are primarily matters for NATS as the service provider. I understand there were computer failures at West Drayton on 27 March 2002 and 10 April and on 17 May at Swanwick and there have been other, well-publicised, minor problems such as print size on the computer screens at Swanwick. The problems which led to the computer failures have been identified and addressed. New software, which provided revised colours and fonts on the radar displays in response to staff concerns, was successfully introduced into Swanwick on 6 November.

[87742]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30108w02.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Postcode area data are not used widely across the Department and its agencies. The contractors who carry out the Department's National Travel Survey use the 'small user' Postcode Address File as its sampling frame, although final data are only published at Government Office Region or combined county level. The Survey of Privately Owned Vans, begun in October 2002, also uses postcode areas as the basis for collecting data. The sample size is too small to enable publication at postcode level but it is planned to publish regional results.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30108w02.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The Department accepted and has implemented the recommendations of the 1994 SACTRA report XTrunk Roads and the Generation of Traffic". As a result, road schemes are designed and appraised having regard to all sources of traffic, including generated traffic. It is no longer standard practice to make separate estimates excluding generated traffic. Thus, it is not possible to provide the information requested.

 Under the Cabinet Office rules on the acceptance of outside appointments by Crown servants (Xthe Business Appointment Rules"), all Ministry of Defence non-industrial civilians and officers in the Armed Forces are required, within two years of leaving the Department, to apply for permission before taking up employment with an organisation connected with their official duties. Some of these applications are speculative and not all lead to external appointments being taken up. The rules require only senior officials whose applications are approved by the Prime Minister to confirm to their former department that they have taken up a new appointment on leaving the MOD. Details of such appointments are published by the Cabinet Office in the annual reports of the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments, copies of which are available in the Library of the House.

<P>
<a name="30108w05.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Damian Green: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills when <i>(a)</i> Ministers and <i>(b)</i> officials from his Department last met representatives from (i) the Welsh Assembly and (ii) the Scottish Parliament.  [89335]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30108w05.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Stephen Twigg: </B> 
 Ministers in this Department are in regular contact with representatives from the Welsh Assembly and the Scottish Parliament, most recently on 31 October 2002 and 18 December 2002 respectively.
<P>

<a name="30108w05.html_para0">Officials in the Department work regularly with the Devolved Administrations on matters of mutual interest. Information about the frequency of meetings is not held centrally.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30108w05.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Brady: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills (1) what recent discussions he has had with local education authorities about the future of grammar schools;  [87851]
<P>
<UL>(2) what recent representations he has received from local education authorities seeking an end to academic selection.  [87852]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30108w05.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Miliband </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 17 December 2002]:</i> My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has not held any specific discussions with local education authorities, nor has he had any representations from them, about the future of grammar schools or ending academic selection. However, he has recently had a meeting with representatives of Kent LEA about how school standards in general can be raised.
<P>

<a name="30108w05.html_para1">Legislation does not allow for LEAs to propose that grammar schools stop being selective; that is a matter for the schools themselves, or local parents, through the ballot system.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30108w05.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Brady: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills (1) what estimate he has made of the percentage of children in maintained schools learning a foreign language at Key Stage 2; and what he expects the percentage to be in <i>(a)</i> September 2003, <i>(b)</i> September 2004 and <i>(c)</i> September 2005;  [89328]
<P>
<UL>(2) by what date he expects that every primary school should have a language co-ordinator.  [89332]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30108w05.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Stephen Twigg: </B> 
 While the Department does not hold precise information about the numbers of children learning a modern foreign language at Key Stage 2, we are aware from a recent survey conducted by Warwick University that approximately 20 per cent. of primary schools currently offer some form of language teaching. We plan to carry out research this year to verify that percentage, and Ofsted will take account of language learning programmes in the primary schools they inspect. This will allow us to estimate the percentage of children who will be learning a foreign language at Key Stage 2 for the years cited and beyond.
<P>

<a name="30108w05.html_para2">We expect that, by the end of the decade ,every pupil at Key Stage 2 will be offered the opportunity to study at least one foreign language. To support this offer, we are concentrating on building capacity and supporting best practice, enabling schools to introduce early language learning at a pace which is right for them.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills if he will list the overseas visits on departmental business undertaken by Ministers in his Department during the last 12 months.  [89323]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30108w05.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Stephen Twigg: </B> 
 In the last 12 months, Ministers in this Department have travelled on departmental business to Belgium, France, Slovakia, Italy, Australia and the United States.
<P>

<a name="30108w05.html_para3">All trips undertaken by Ministers comply with the requirements of the Ministerial Code.

<a name="30108w05.html_sbhd4"><H4><center>School Funding</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="30108w05.html_wqn4"><B> Michael Fabricant: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what the SSA average grant per pupil in <i>(a)</i> primary schools and <i>(b)</i> secondary schools will be in each LEA in England and Wales in <i>(i)</i> 2003&#150;04 and (ii) subsequent years for which figures are available.  [88325]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30108w05.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 The average primary and secondary formula spending share per pupil for LEAs in England are set out in the tables for 2003&#150;04: figures for future years will become available at the time of the Local Government Finance Settlement for each year. These figures are not comparable with primary and secondary SSA per pupil for 2002&#150;03 and previous years. The new system of funding for LEAs consists of a basic entitlement which is the same for all pupils, plus a top up for all deprived pupils, which is the same for all deprived pupils, and a further top up for those LEAs in areas with additional costs for recruitment and retention of staff. Where the average formula spending share per pupil is higher, that reflects a higher number of deprived pupils, and higher area costs. The system in Wales is different and is the responsibility of the Welsh Assembly.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what the most recent figures are for air quality in Lancashire.  [88651]<P>

<P>
<a name="30108w06.html_spnew0"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 Defra currently operates two automated, continuous air quality monitoring sites in Lancashire: one in Preston, the other in Blackpool. These sites measure carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen, ozone, particulate matter (PM10 ), and sulphur dioxide. Current and historic air quality information from these sites is available at Defra's air quality archive, www.airquality.co.uk. The information is updated hourly.
<P>

<a name="30108w06.html_para0">In 2002 all automated measurements of carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen and sulphur dioxide were in the 'low' category of air pollution. 'High' levels of PM10 occurred at Preston on one day in 2002, where levels peaked at 80 micrograms per cubic metre. 'Moderate' levels of PM10 were recorded at Preston on three days in 2002. 'Moderate' levels of PM10 were measured at Blackpool on one day in 2002, peaking at 51 micrograms per cubic metre. 'Moderate' levels of ozone were measured in Preston on 47 separate days in 2002, peaking at 67 parts per billion. In Blackpool, 'moderate' levels of ozone were measured on 62 separate days in 2002, peaking at 78 parts per billion. Data for 2002 are provisional. Definitions of 'low', 'moderate' and 'high' pollution levels are provided at Defra's air quality archive.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs pursuant to her answer of 11 December 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, column 311W, on bird registration, what the significant increase in enforcement action was that caused the increase in costs of running her Department's bird registration scheme between 2000&#150;01 and 2001&#150;02; how 



<P>
<P><I>8 Jan 2003 : Column 234W</I><P>
many police forces were involved; and how many <i>(a)</i> pending court cases and <i>(b)</i> convictions have resulted from this action.  [89282]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30108w06.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The increase in enforcement costs from 2000&#150;01 to 2001&#150;02 was due partly to increased pay and overhead costs and partly to the recruitment of a number of new inspectors to widen the spread of expertise available to the Department.
<P>

<a name="30108w06.html_para1">Increased enforcement does not necessarily result in a higher number of court cases as the chief aim of the wildlife inspectors is to deter crime. The number of pending court cases and convictions and the number of police forces involved in taking them forward in 2000&#150;01 and 2001&#150;02 were as follows:

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs pursuant to her answer of 11 December 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, column 312W, on bird registration, what evidence she collated that de-registration of bird species currently listed on schedule 4 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 will not lead to an increase in illegal taking from the wild; and what assessment her Department has made of the cost implications for <i>(a)</i> enforcement and <i>(b)</i> conservation agencies of de-registration.

 The Government's first Marine Stewardship Report, XSafeguarding our Seas", was published in May 2002.

<a name="30108w06.html_spnew11"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 The latest refurbishment in Nobel House was for areas of the sixth and eighth floors. This was undertaken for MAFF in 1997. As only parts of floors were refurbished it was concluded that it would not be appropriate to seek a Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Method (BREEAM) assessment. In the summer of 2002 Xfit out" work was undertaken to allow Defra to occupy the top four floors of 9 Millbank, which is next door to Nobel House. Again, it was concluded that it would not be appropriate to seek a BREEAM assessment because Defra are not responsible for the building fabric and the building services; these remain the responsibility of the major occupier, Ofgem. Defra does seek BREEAM assessments for the major new or refurbishment schemes for which we are responsible.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30108w07.html_spnew6"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 The Government's decision to introduce the climate change levy as a 'downstream' energy tax took account of the conclusions of Lord Marshall in his 1998 report 'Economic Instruments and the Business Use of Energy'. Lord Marshall concluded that a downstream tax on supplies of energy to the non-domestic sector would be necessary to avoid any tax impacting on domestic energy users. While under such a scheme it is difficult to determine the carbon content of electricity supplies other than as a broad average, it does encourage all non-domestic energy users to improve energy efficiency and thereby reduce carbon emissions. The climate change levy is also consistent with the Government's policy of maintaining a level playing field between different energy sources.

 The aim of industrial nickel cadmium battery collection schemes including Bat-Re-Back in the UK and the Collect Nicad schemes in other EU states is to create a closed loop process which will see the collected batteries sent to a recycling facility where the cadmium is extracted for use in the manufacture of new batteries and the nickel is recycled and sold to the steel industry. The batteries collected from Bat-Re-Back are sent to the SNAM recycling facility in France. Although consumer nickel cadmium batteries are not widely collected in the UK they can be subject to the same recycling process.

 In order to recruit and retain people with the necessary skills at all levels, the construction industry needs to address the underlying issues which prevent it being seen as a career of first choice. Rethinking Construction and the Construction Best Practice Programme, which DTI supports, are working to tackle these issues. DTI is also working with the Strategic Forum for Construction which intends to develop and implement strategies to enable the industry to recruit and retain the 300,000 qualified people that CITB estimate are required by the end of 2006, and result in a 50 per cent. increase in suitable applications to build environment, higher and further education courses by 2007.
<P>

<a name="30108w08.html_para6">The DTI also works closely with the Construction Industry Training Board (CITB&#151;the statutory industry training board) and other industry bodies to ensure that workers in construction receive the training they need. For example, DTI gives support to XNational Construction Week", a major national event showcasing career opportunities for the industry; the XMaking Connections" initiative, which aims to attract and retain higher quality graduates in greater numbers; and a Xlanguage skills audit" to assess the perceived need for language skills in construction, where the first language of significant numbers of workers is not English.

 There are no legal restrictions on the times of year when fireworks can be sold. However, the voluntary sales agreement, introduced in 1976, limits the sales of fireworks to three weeks before November 5, and for a few days afterwards. This plays a role in containing the period when fireworks are available for sale, and hence, limiting misuse. To make the voluntary sales period mandatory would require primary legislation.

 UK generation capacity currently exceeds peak demand by more than 20 per cent. Nuclear currently makes up around 15 per cent. of UK capacity. Reflecting overall excess capacity wholesale electricity prices are low and some capacity has been mothballed. The impact on capacity margins of a cessation of electricity from nuclear power stations will therefore depend on the timescale over which nuclear output were to decline. Mothballed plant could return to operation. In the longer term new plant would be built.

 <i>[holding answer 19 December 2002]</i>: It is vitally important that there are no barriers to Scotland's renewable electricity output being brought to centres of demand further south. Following a report, which was published by my Department in February, into the possibility of building a subsea cable to take electricity generated in Scotland down the west coast to link up with the onshore grid system further south, my Department set up the Transmission Issues Working Group to consider the implications for the grid infrastructure of significant increases in renewable energy generating capacity throughout Great Britain.
<P>

<a name="30108w10.html_para0">The Working Group considered the costs of reinforcing both marine links and the grid onshore to bring electricity generated in Scotland to markets in the south and the transmission system operators in both Scotland and England are currently in discussions with their regulator, Ofgem, on the regulatory framework for making this happen. The report of the Transmission Issues Working Group will be published early next year.

 The latest UN Secretary General's report on children and armed conflict covers a range of issues, including child soldiers, on which we are actively engaged. My Department finds the report a useful source of information and guidance. The emphasis on the Xera of application" is particularly to be welcomed and supported.
<P>

<a name="30108w11.html_para0">While the report provides some cause for optimism, for instance the coming into force of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, there is much more to be done to reduce the impact of armed conflict on children, their families and communities. The best way to achieve this is by the prevention, reduction and resolution of armed conflicts. My Department has intensified its work with other Government Departments to this end. While the Secretary General's report, pursuant to UN Security Council Resolution 1379, identifies various countries where the direct use of children in conflict continues, it is to be welcomed that the report also focuses on those aspects of children and armed conflict that tend to receive less attention, such as the impact of land-mines and the sexual exploitation of girls.

 Armed conflict often seriously affects the development of children including by the infliction of serious damage to their physical and mental health. Children are damaged through land-mines, direct targeting of their homes and schools, sexual violence including rape and being forced to take part in direct hostilities. The best way to protect children from the impact of armed conflict is to prevent, reduce and resolve conflict. My Department has intensified its work with other Government Departments to this end. DFID also provides humanitarian assistance to children displaced by conflict or who have lost their families. We support efforts by the International Committee of the Red Cross and Red Crescent to try to ensure compliance with international humanitarian law. DFID also supports the work of UNICEF, UNHCR and other humanitarian agencies of the United Nations, as well as humanitarian NGOs. Many of these provide direct assistance to children who have been subjected to acts of physical and mental violence and their families and communities. This assistance can take the form of the provision of a safe place to live, health care, education, psycho-social assistance and food aid. For instance my Department has a global commitment to UNHCR of #14 million per year. This is in addition to targeted contributions in response to specific regional situations. 



<P>
<P><I>8 Jan 2003 : Column 254W</I><P>
Our work with UNICEF, UNHCR and humanitarian non-governmental organisations is also concerned with increasing their capacity to respond appropriately to children who have been treated so egregiously in armed conflict situations.
<P>

<a name="30108w11.html_para3">Women and girls are targeted for sexual abuse and exploitation in situations of armed conflict, often as a deliberate strategy to terrorise them and their families. This issue was highlighted during the recent open debate on women peace and security at the UN Security Council in October when the UK had the Chair. The UK has also been instrumental in encouraging the implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 1325 on this issue, which emphasised the use of sexual violence against women and girls. DFID is supporting the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM) in its multi-year programme to identify the causes and impact of sexual violence against women and girls in conflict situations. It also supports the UN Department of Peace-Keeping Operations and non-governmental organisations to highlight gender issues, including sexual violence, associated with conflict.

 We are keen to see asylum seekers and recognised refugees take an active interest in the welfare of their own communities and the local community by undertaking voluntary activity while they are in the UK. All asylum seekers, whether or not they are the principal applicant, may take part in voluntary activity at any point during their time in the UK. Others whose conditions of entry or stay prohibit employment paid or unpaid may not undertake voluntary work while their applications are being considered and we have no plans to change this.

It is for the chief constable to decide how best to deploy available resources according to operational priorities and objectives. Accordingly, the decision to close a police station or restrict opening hours is an operational matter for the chief constable and not one in which it would be appropriate for the Home Office or Ministers to become involved.

 Cycling inconsiderately or irresponsibly on public footpaths is a criminal offence. The Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis informs me that the Metropolitan police view the offence seriously, particularly where it is likely to result in danger being caused. Any Metropolitan police officer who is called to or witnesses such an offence will take whatever action is appropriate in the circumstances. The offence can be dealt with by way of a fixed penalty of #30. To help the police with enforcement we have made it possible for community support officers (CSOs) appointed under the Police Reform Act 2002 to issue these penalties. We have provided the Metropolitan police with additional funding for the recruitment of 500 CSOs.

 The Government work very closely with their European counterparts in tackling football disorder through active participation in Council of the European Union (ED) and Council of Europe fora. In the last 12 months this has resulted in a number of European-wide initiatives, including an updated XEuropean Handbook on International Police Co-operation in connection with Football Matches" and the setting-up in each EU member and candidate state of a XNational Football Police Information Point" for exchanging football-related intelligence and other information. The United Kingdom is also playing a leading role in a Council of Europe working group on the role of football in delivering social policy and in a recently established European 'think tank' on tackling football related violence. There are regular bilateral meetings with European colleagues.

 The White Paper XSecure Borders, Safe Haven: Integration With Diversity Within Modern Britain"&#151;published in February 2002&#151;sets out our general proposals for assisting the victims of trafficking for sexual exploitation. Briefly, where trafficked people are willing to come forward to the authorities, we shall where necessary make special arrangements for their protection including the provision of safe accommodation and health checks. We will consider, in the light of individual circumstances, whether it would be appropriate to allow them to remain here. Where they are to return home, we will assist them to do so, providing them with initial counselling, ensuring that they have suitable accommodation to return to, and providing help to enable them to reintegrate into their own community and find employment.
<P>

<a name="30108w12.html_para7">We propose to commission non-governmental organisations to provide a range of support services, including access to legal advice, for women who are victims of trafficking for sexual exploitation, when trafficking shortly becomes an offence, as anticipated, on commencement of the relevant provision of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002.

<P>
<a name="30108w13.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. McCartney: </B> 
 The Government want all pensioners to have a decent and secure income in retirement and to share fairly in the rising prosperity of the country. The Government's first priority has been to help the poorest pensioners.
<P>

<a name="30108w13.html_para3">From April 2002, the Government are spending an extra #6 billion a year in real terms on pensioners as a result of policies introduced since 1997. This includes #2&#189; billion more on the poorest third of pensioners. This is three times more than a link between the basic state pension and average earnings since 1998 would have given them.
<P>

<a name="30108w13.html_para4">We have introduced a range of initiatives designed to encourage pensioners to take up their entitlements. For the minimum income guarantee (MIG) we have undertaken a national advertising campaign, which resulted in almost 140,000 successful claims, with an average gain of #20 per week. We have also reduced the MIG claim form from 40 to 10 pages, introduced a MIG specific leaflet, and we are identifying potential beneficiaries through key events, such as claiming state pension.
<P>

<a name="30108w13.html_para5">A key priority, for both Government and the Pension Service is the successful take up of the new pension credit, which will enhance and replace the MIG. It has been specifically designed to be easy for pensioners to claim and to be less intrusive. The weekly means test will be abolished for the over 65s and be replaced by a statement of their circumstances every five years. Capital rules will be relaxed and the upper capital limit abolished.
<P>

<a name="30108w13.html_para6">Our take-up plan for pension credit is extensive and makes use of a range of channels. We will transfer existing MIG recipients to pension credit, ready for payments to be made from October 2003; write to all pensioners not already receiving MIG by June 2004 to alert them to possible pension credit entitlement, supported by a national publicity campaign; work with local partners to help support the communications to pensioners, and tailor marketing and communications activity accordingly.
<P>

<a name="30108w13.html_para7">The Government have introduced other initiatives to help pensioners. These include winter fuel payments (WFPs), which will continue to be paid to qualifying households at #200 a year throughout this Parliament. In addition, we have introduced free TV licences for the over 75s, worth #104 a year. The WFPs and TV licences are non income-related and are tax free.
<P>

<a name="30108w13.html_para8">All of the above demonstrate the importance that we attach to encouraging pensioners to take-up their entitlements, which in turn helps the poorest pensioners.

<P>

<a name="30108w13.html_para11">We remain gravely concerned at reports of mass killings and serious violations of human rights in Cote d'Ivoire. We welcome the UN Secretary-General's decision to request the High Commissioner for Human Rights to seek further information about these violations.
<P>

<a name="30108w13.html_para12">We have also been concerned at all breaches of the 17 October 2002 ceasefire agreement. We are pleased that President Gbagbo has agreed to submit a crisis resolution plan to all Ivorian players and to ECOWAS leaders, and to consult them on it. We also welcome the fresh commitments made by him and by the leaders of the MPCI rebel group, during the 3&#150;4 January visit of the French Foreign Minister, to respect the ceasefire. France has now offered to host a conference from 15 January involving all Ivorian political forces. We urge all parties to engage seriously in the search for an inclusive political solution to the crisis.

There are some safeguards in place to protect people from all religious backgrounds, and there are dedicated ministries for Christian as well as Hindu, Muslim and Buddhist affairs. However, our High Commission continues to monitor the situation and raises the rights of religious minorities, and other human rights issues, with the Sri Lankan authorities.

<a name="30108w15.html_spmin1"><B>The Prime Minister:</B> 
 The Government have made significant improvements across a range of environmental policy areas. The UK now has the cleanest rivers, beaches, air and drinking water since the industrial revolution. Greenhouse gas emissions were 13 per cent. below 1990 levels in 2000, with policies to improve energy efficiency taking 350,000 households out of fuel poverty since 1997, with a further 200,000 expected by 2004.
<P>

<a name="30108w15.html_para3">In addition we have delivered improvements to sites of special scientific interest (SSSIs), increases in the green belt, and increased the proportion of new housing built on brownfield land. The Government's Strategy for Sustainable Food and Farming, published in December 2002, set out further proposals for redirecting agricultural support to environmental goals.
<P>

<a name="30108w15.html_para4">Full assessment of the effectiveness of the delivery of environmental policy can be found in Defra's first annual report, at http://www.defra.gov.uk/corporate/deprep/2002/index.htm. This report provides an overview of the Department's objectives, and assesses progress against key targets. Responsibility for two of Defra's Public Service Agreement targets (PSAs) is shared with other Government Departments: with DTI for the target relating to greenhouse gases; and with DfT for the target relating to local air quality, reflecting the need for joint efforts to achieve the desired outcomes.

 XProvision of Acute General Hospital Services" was published in July 1998 by a joint working party of the British Medical Association, the Royal College of Physicians of London and the Royal College of Surgeons of England. It suggested that the ideal unit for a fully comprehensive medicine and surgery is a hospital or integrated group of hospitals serving a population of 450,000 to 500,000. The effective size to provide most of the acute services for medicine and surgery was recommended to be one serving a population of 250,000 to 300,000.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what the Government's target is for occupancy levels in <i>(a)</i> general and <i>(b)</i> acute NHS beds; and what the levels were in 1997.  [87533]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30108w17.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The Department has not issued any specific guidance on bed occupancy. As part of routine capacity planning each national health service trust needs to establish the levels of occupancy required for different specialties and types of care depending on their own particular circumstances. Appropriate levels of occupancy will depend on a number of factors including specialty, the balance between emergency and planned admissions and the size of the hospital.
<P>

<a name="30108w17.html_para0">In 1996&#150;97 the bed occupancy level for general and acute NHS beds was 80.7 per cent. Over the last two years, the number of beds have increased, reversing a 40 year decline.

 Figures are collected on a quarterly basis on the number of patients whose operations are cancelled by the hospital for non-clinical reasons on the day of surgery and at the last minute, that is on the day patients are due to arrive or after arrival in hospital or on the day of their operation. This information is available in the Library and on the Department of Health website at: www.doh.gov.uk/hospitalactivity/data requests/cancelled operations.htm

<P>
<P>
<a name="30108w17.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Lammy  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 7 January 2003]:</i> The provision of vision screening programmes is a matter for local primary care trusts to consider in accordance with professional advice. This includes vision screening for children with hearing impairments and ensuring access to specialist eye examinations. The national screening committee recommends that all infants and children with a hearing loss should have an expert eye examination as a matter of routine. A national service framework for children, which will set standards aimed at raising the quality of the health and social care services that children receive, is currently under development. Information is not collected centrally on the amount of public funding allocated to raising awareness of vision screening and eligibility for free sight tests&#151;which includes all children under the age of 16 and those aged under 19 in fulltime education.

The research on which it is based excluded all private episodes of care on the grounds that the need for national health service resources was being modelled. The research also takes account of supply factors such as private hospitals.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. In many health authorities there are factors which distort the expenditure per head. These include:<P>

the health authority acting in a lead capacity to commission healthcare or fund training on behalf of other health bodies; and<P>

asset revaluations in NHS Trusts being funded through health authorities.<P>

For these reasons expenditure per head cannot be compared reliably between health authorities.<P>

2. Allocations per weighted head of population provide a much more reliable measure to identify differences between funding of health authorities.<P>





3. Expenditure is taken from audited health authority and primary care trust summarisation forms which are prepared on a resource basis and therefore differ from cash allocations in the year. The expenditure is the total expenditure by the health authority and by the primary care trusts within the health authority and region area. The majority of General Dental Services expenditure is not included in the health authority or primary care trust summarisation forms and is separately accounted for by the Dental Practice Board. An element of pharmaceutical services expenditure is accounted for by the Prescription Pricing Authority and not by health authorities.<P>

4. Health authorities and primary care trusts should account for their expenditure on a gross basis. This results in an element of double counting in 2000&#150;01 and 2001&#150;02 where one body acts as the main commissioner and is then reimbursed by other bodies. This element cannot be identified in 2000&#150;01 but has been removed in 2001&#150;02 following the submission of the relevant information.<P>

<P>
<a name="30108w20.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Lammy: </B> 
 We have no plans to introduce compulsory magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans during post mortems. The Department has commissioned a scoping study to look at the current level of research knowledge about minimally invasive post-mortem techniques, including MRI scanning. From this it is clear that at present there is limited research evidence as to the effectiveness of these minimally invasive techniques.

<a name="30108w20.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 XDelivering the NHS Plan" confirmed our commitment to substantial increases in health service capacity. Our aim is, however, not simply to rely on expanding hospital capacity but to use the extra investment provided by the April 2002 budget to modernise the way services are provided to bring services closer to patients, expand the choices available to patients and make better use of the skills and capacity of the primary care work force.
<P>

<a name="30108w20.html_para1">The Department is therefore taking forward a programme to deliver a wider range of services in primary and community settings, using general practitioners and nurses with specialist skills, working from improved and modernised premises. This is expected to deliver for example, millions more out-patient appointments taking place in the community rather than in hospital.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30108w20.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 Primary care trusts are national health service bodies established by the Secretary of State. They are performance managed by strategic health authorities and through them are accountable to the Secretary of State.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what arrangements exist to vaccinate people in remote areas in the event of a smallpox threat.  [87247]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30108w20.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 Responsibility for putting in place appropriate local arrangements for vaccinations against smallpox will rest with the regional directors of public health (RDsPH). The Department of Health has recently published its draft guidance for dealing with smallpox and invited comment and discussion on the plans for dealing with any smallpox outbreak. RDsPH were involved in the drafting of the guidance. In this guidance, it is intended to establish 12 regional smallpox response groups across the United Kingdom, consisting of infectious disease physicians, paediatricians, public health physicians, microbiologists/virologists, acute care and communicable disease control nurses and occupational health staff who will be able to set up specialist care and vaccination centres for the regions in the event of a smallpox emergency.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what arrangements have been made to distribute smallpox vaccine.  [87248]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30108w20.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The strategic stock of smallpox vaccine is held centrally and arrangements have been put in place whereby the vaccine can be delivered to anywhere in the mainland United Kingdom within 24 hours of a request 



<P>
<P><I>8 Jan 2003 : Column 286W</I><P>
for vaccine, 365 days of the year. As smallpox has been eradicated, this is only likely to be in response to a bioterrorist incident, whereupon the Chief Medical Officer or nominated Deputy would authorise the release of vaccine.
<P>

<a name="30108w20.html_para2">As part of plans for dealing with any smallpox incident, it is intended to establish 12 regional smallpox response groups across the UK. The staff in these groups, consisting of infectious disease physicians, paediatricians, public health physicians, microbiologists/virologists, acute care and communicable disease control nurses and occupational health staff will be able to set up vaccination centres for the regions in the event of a smallpox emergency.

<a name="30108w20.html_wqn7"><B> Dr. Gibson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health what plans he has to vaccinate the whole UK population against smallpox.  [87407]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30108w20.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 There are no plans to vaccinate the whole population as a contingency measure against the threat of a bioterrorist incident involving smallpox. Mass vaccination of the population could be justifiable if there was a smallpox attack or outbreak but it would not be acceptable to expose people to the risk of vaccination in the absence of any possible exposure to the smallpox virus.
<P>

<a name="30108w20.html_para3">Smallpox vaccine has a much higher rate of serious complications than vaccines that are in regular use today. Certain groups are at even higher risk, such as those with weak immune systems or with severe eczema.
<P>

<a name="30108w20.html_para4">We have already announced that a small number of key frontline national health service staff and a small number of military personnel who would provide the first response in the event of a confirmed, suspected or threatened release of smallpox will be vaccinated shortly. We are discussing with other Government Departments how to identify key workers in the emergency services and agreeing circumstances and timing under which they might be vaccinated.
<P>

<a name="30108w20.html_para5">Our contingency plans for dealing with smallpox are detailed in the draft guidelines on smallpox available on http://www.doh.gov.uk/epcu/cbr/biol/smallpoxplan.htm

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what recent precautions have been taken by the NHS for dealing with a mass casualty terrorist incident.  [88394]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30108w20.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The planning for the response to a mass casualty incident involves the scaling up of the normal response to a major incident. Following the September 11 2001 terrorist attack on the United States, specific guidance was issued to the national health service on the public health response to the deliberate release of chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear incidents, mass decontamination and mass casualties.
<P>

<a name="30108w20.html_para6">The Department has made available, through the emergency planning section of its website, www.doh.gov.uk/epcu a comprehensive package of guidance for clinicians on dealing with the consequences
