It should be noted that sports clubs do not just pay the fee of &#163;16 now for a registration certificate allowing them to supply alcohol. Those that obtain permanent extensions for their bars, must pay an additional &#163;25 for their special hours certificate. To obtain such a certificate, the club must first obtain a &quot;certificate of suitability&quot; from its local authority. This is essentially the same as a public entertainment licence and costs vary between local authority areas from &#163;50 to &#163;500 annually. Those clubs without permanent extensions of hours but which open their bars later for special occasions like Christmas and other holiday dances and functions, weddings, anniversaries or during periods like World Cups abroad, must pay for each permission to extend their hours. These are &quot;occasional permissions&quot; and &quot;special orders of exemption&quot;. Each costs the club &#163;10 and many clubs will have as many as 12 per year. All of this and the bureaucracy involved is swept away by the 2003 Act. Under the new licensing regime, the fee of between &#163;100-&#163;635 will cover all the activities and hours involved, and the majority of sports clubs will pay no more than &#163;100, and &#163;70 annually thereafter.

 The BBC, as television licensing authority, is responsible for interpreting the licensing regulations and determining the licensing requirements for specific equipment.

Mobile or portable devices are not exempt from the licensing requirements, but a television licence for a person&#039;s home address covers the use, anywhere else in the United Kingdom, by the licensee or any person normally living with them at the licensed address, of a portable television receiver powered solely by its own internal batteries.

<br>&nbsp;<br><i>11 Jul 2005 : Column 645W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
recommends, among other things, that auditory bird scarers sound only four times in any one hour, and that they are placed as far away as is practicable from nearby hospitals, homes or schools in order to avoid causing a nuisance.

<p>
<a name="50711w05.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_15">Should a local authority receive a complaint of noise from an auditory bird scarer, they have a duty to take reasonable steps, where practicable, to investigate the complaint under section 79 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990. If satisfied that the noise amounts to a statutory nuisance, or that a statutory nuisance is likely to occur or recur, the local authority must serve a notice requiring the noise to be abated or restricted. Failure to comply with an abatement notice can result in a fine of up to &#163;20,000 upon summary conviction.

<a name="stpa_24">Research is being carried out to obtain a greater understanding of these interactions. The Central Science Laboratory is conducting a replicated experimental assessment of the ecological consequences of badger removal within the Randomised Badger Culling Trial. The research includes estimating the abundance of hedgehog populations in selected regions of south-west England. Unpublished data from this research suggests that hedgehogs were less likely to be present in areas where badger sett density was high. Additionally, hedgehog numbers tended to increase when badgers were removed, suggesting that a relationship exists between badger density and hedgehog populations. It is hoped further analyses will reveal more on the nature of what is likely to be a complex relationship.

 On 28 June 2005, my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary placed in the Library a paper containing the latest estimates of benefits of the Identity Cards Scheme which shows that the benefits outweigh the costs once the scheme is fully operational. The cost of equipping premises will depend on the nature of the use of the Identity Cards Scheme and the type of identity check(s) necessary to deliver the business benefits. In some cases, benefits could be realised without the use of card readers and the cost of installing any readers needs to be considered alongside future plans to refresh or upgrade IT systems. As the design of the scheme matures, during and after the procurement exercise, so will our understanding of where the scheme will be of most benefit, which will allow us to prepare estimates of costs and benefits.

 The Forestry Commission has embarked on a programme to restore 15,000 hectares of ancient semi-natural woodland on the public forest estate by 2020 and this will include planting and regenerating native tree species.

I understand that Lancashire county council are preparing new proposals as part of the local transport plan process. It would be inappropriate to comment further until the Department has received the authority&#039;s proposals and considered the scheme in accordance with our major scheme guidance.

* Fewer than 5 deaths<br>

<sup>(22)</sup> For the years 1995&#150;2000 the cause of death was defined using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9). The codes selected to define alcohol-related deaths are listed below:<br>

291&#151;Alcoholic psychoses<br>

303&#151;Alcohol dependence syndrome<br>

305.0&#151;Non-dependent abuse of alcohol<br>

425.5&#151;Alcoholic cardiomyopathy<br>

571&#151;Chronic liver disease and cirrhosis<br>

E860&#151;Accidental poisoning by alcohol<br>

For the years 2001&#150;04 the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) was used. To maintain comparability with earlier years the following codes were selected:<br>

F10&#151;Mental and behavioural disorders due to use of alcohol<br>

142.6&#151;Alcoholic cardiomyopathy<br>

K70&#151;Alcoholic liver disease<br>

K73&#151;Chronic hepatitis, not elsewhere classified<br>

K74&#151;Fibrosis and cirrhosis of liver<br>

X45&#151;Accidental poisoning by and exposure to alcohol<br>

The selection of codes to define alcohol-related deaths is described in:<br>

Baker A and Rooney C (2003). Recent trends in alcohol-related mortality, and the impact of ICD-10 on the monitoring of these deaths in England and Wales. Health Statistics Quarterly 17, pp 5&#150;14.<br>

<sup>(23)</sup> Cause of death was defined using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes 292, 304, 305.2&#150;305.9, E850-E858, E950.0-E950.5, E962.0 and E980.0-E980.5for 1994 to 2000, and the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes F11-F16, F18-F19, X40-X44, X60-X64, X85 and Y10-YJ4 from 2001 onwards.<br>

<sup>(24)</sup> Drugs mentioned on the death certificate of a death where the underlying cause was drug poisoning.<br>

<sup>(25)</sup> Deaths of usual residents of:<br>

(i)&#151;Southend-on-Sea unitary authority<br>

(ii)&#151;County of Essex<br>

Data for the county of Essex does not include deaths to residents of the unitary authorities of Southend-on-Sea or Thurrock.<br>

<sup>(26)</sup> Data are for deaths registered in each calendar year for alcohol-related deaths and for deaths occurring in each calendar year for deaths related to drug poisoning.<br>

<p><a name="st_167"><a name="50711w18.html_spnew3"><b> John Healey: </b> 
 The Government believes that Article 45 of the new procurement directive is very helpful in the fight against fraud and corruption by requiring, for the first time under the EU procurement rules, contracting authorities to exclude suppliers convicted of such offences. At present, such exclusions are voluntary. The article only enables member states to derogate from this requirement for &quot;overriding requirements in the general interest&quot;, which is designed to cover exceptional circumstances of national emergency, for example related to the protection of life and security. Our proposed guidance on this article will cover these matters and will provide additional advice to authorities on when the derogation should be invoked. This guidance will be informed by the current consultation exercise on the regulations to implement the new directive.

The counts relate to England and Wales only. There are a number of wards which are split by parliamentary constituency i.e. they fall within two or more parliamentary constituencies. The ward electorate and population counts are repeated for each parliamentary constituency which they fall within, and are indicated by an asterisk * alongside their ward name, electorate and population figures for the whole ward are shown. Some wards will therefore be double counted. Split ward electorate and population counts by parliamentary constituency are not available.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_49">Electoral Wards</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_50">The electorate counts are not necessarily consistent with the statutory electoral register return RPF 29, due to the need for population estimation purposes to use and convert historic electorate counts on different ward geographies to a consistent ward geography i.e. the Census Area Statistics (CAS) ward geography (CAS wards were used for 2001 Census outputs).</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_51">The electorate counts therefore do not necessarily relate to wards which were in existence in February 2001, and some wards which were in existence in February 2001 may have had subsequent boundary changes.</p>

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_52">Population Estimates</p>

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_53">The ward population estimates for persons aged 18 and over relate to mid-2001 i.e. 30 June 2001 and are for CAS wards.

</ul>
<p>
</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_55">The parliamentary electorate excludes European Union citizens and includes overseas electors. The former will be included in the population estimates and the latter excluded. Comparable ward counts of local government electors are not readily available.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_56">There is inevitably some double counting of the registered electorate as electoral registration officers vary in how quickly they remove people from the registers after they have moved away from an area or after they have died. In addition, people can register in more than one place.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_57">There is a relatively small number of wards (44) where the electorate counts are more than 10 per cent. greater than the population estimate, the majority of such cases are likely to be attributable to a limitation in the methodology used to convert electorate counts from a non-CAS ward geography onto a CAS ward geography. There may however also be valid reasons why the electorate count may exceed the estimated population, as described above.</p>

<p><a name="st_216"><a name="50711w22.html_spnew4"><b> Malcolm Wicks </b> 
<i>[holding answer 4 July 2005]:</i> Following the judgments against British Coal in both the vibration white finger and respiratory disease litigations, the High Court ordered the DTI to set up schemes, in agreement with miners&#039; solicitors, to assess compensation for both types of claim. Claims had by then been registered through the Claimants Solicitors Group (the CSG), some of which were sponsored by the main mining unions, the NUM and NACODS. The UDM had also registered a large number of claims directly on behalf of their members, through their dedicated claims handling company, Vendside Ltd. The CSG and the UDM were unable to work together or enter into single arrangements for historical reasons. Ministers agreed the DTI would negotiate the strategy with the UDM and Vendside in which the terms for compensation are the same as for the agreement with the CSG.

Notes:<br>

1. A finished admission episode is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. Please note that admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>

2. The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 14 (seven prior to 2002&#150;03) diagnosis fields in the hospital episode statistics (HES) data set and provides the main reason why the patient was in hospital.<br>

3. Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (ie the data are ungrossed).<br>

Notes:<br>

1. The sum of reports for traditional and atypical anti-psychotics do not equal the number of reports for all anti-psychotics because, although each report refers to one patient, some reports have more than one suspected anti-psychotic drug as the patient is taking several drugs.<br>

2. It is important to note that a report of an adverse drug reaction does not necessarily mean that it was caused by the drug. Many factors have to be taken into account in assessing causal relationships, including the possibility that the timing of the suspected reaction may be coincidental with the patient taking the drug, the possible contribution of concomitant medication and the underlying disease.<br>

<p><a name="st_19"><a name="50711w26.html_spnew8"><b> Mr. Byrne </b> 
<i>[holding answer 9 June 2005]:</i> The responsibility for diversity awareness training, which includes disability equality, lies with each national health service employer. We recommended in &quot;Improving Working Lives Practice Plus&quot; that NHS employers provide employees with diversity awareness training. All NHS employers are expected to conform to &quot;Improving Working Lives&quot; human resources practice by March 2006. General practitioner practices and foundation trusts, however, are not covered by these requirements. Compliance data is not held centrally.

 Following the report from the Chief Medical Officer&#039;s expert group reviewing the potential of developments in stem cell research and cell nuclear replacement to benefit human health <sup>1</sup> , the Human Fertilisation and Embryology (Research Purposes) Regulations 2001 were introduced. They extended the purposes for which the Human Fertilisation Embryology Agency (HFEA) may grant licenses for research involving embryos to include increasing knowledge about the development of embryos, or about serious disease, and enabling any such knowledge to be applied in developing treatments for serious disease.

<a name="stpa_25">The HFEA may only grant licences for research projects if it appears that the activity is necessary or desirable for one or more of the research purposes listed in the Act, as extended by regulations, and the use of human embryos is necessary for the purposes of the research. Licence applications for research projects involving embryos for the purposes of developing methods of therapy for mitochondrial disease and therapy for diseased or damaged tissues or organs are considered in accordance with this procedure. The question of whether something is a serious disease is in the first instance for an HFEA licensing committee, and ultimately for the courts to decide.

<a name="stpa_26">The Government announced on 21 January 2004 their intention to undertake a review of the provisions of the HFEA to ensure that it remains effective in the 21st century. This will include a full public consultation exercise in 2005.

 There are no centrally laid down penalties for the misuse of patient records, as ensuring that records are managed to appropriate standards is a responsibility of each individual national health service organisation. However, departmental guidance, set out in &quot;Confidentiality: NHS Code of Practice&quot;, published in November 2003, makes it clear that misuse of patient information should be treated as a serious disciplinary matter, possibly resulting in legal proceedings.

A wide range of factors can affect the speed of progress of a new hospital build, but experience from other similarly sized schemes indicated that it will take about 48 months to complete the hospital from when the initial approval in principle to proceed is given.

<br>

Notes:<br>

1. Expenditure is taken from audited health authority summarisation forms and primary care trust (PCT) summarisation schedules, which are prepared on a resource basis and therefore differ from cash allocations in the year. The figures have not been adjusted for inflation.<br>

2. Allocations per weighted head of population provide a much more reliable measure to identify differences between funding of HAs and PCTs.<br>

3. Figures for 1997&#150;98 to 2001&#150;02 have been prepared using gross expenditure figures. Figures for 2002&#150;03 and 2003&#150;04 have been adjusted to eliminate expenditure which would be double counted where an authority acts as a lead in commissioning healthcare or other services.<br>

4. In many HAs, there are factors which distort the expenditure. These include:<br>

the HA acting in a lead capacity to commission healthcare or fund training on behalf of other health bodies; and<br>

asset revaluations in national health service trusts being funded through HAs or PCTs.<br>

5. The majority of general dental services expenditure is separately accounted for by the Dental Practice Board. An element of pharmaceutical services expenditure is accounted for by the Prescription Pricing Authority. Total expenditure on these items by the Dental Practice Board and the Prescription Pricing Authority cannot be allocated to individual health bodies. Therefore, the total expenditure in the answer by HA does not capture all NHS expenditure within the area.<br>

6. For these reasons expenditure cannot be compared reliably between health authorities or between different years.<br>

Notes:<br>

There are several reasons why comparisons between allocations rounds cannot be made. For example:<br>

1. 1999&#150;2000 was the first year that unified allocations were made to HAs to cover hospital and community health services (HCHS), prescribing and general medical services cash limited;<br>

2. 2003&#150;04 was the first year revenue allocations were made direct to PCTs for three years. Prior to 2003&#150;04, revenue allocations were made to HAs oh an annual basis. Prior to 2003&#150;04, the table has assumed the same allocation per head across the strategic health authority area;<br>

3. 2006&#150;07 is the first year that primary medical services were incorporated into revenue allocations.<br>

<i>[holding answers 7 July 2005]:</i> The NHS Cancer Plan sets out our strategy to reduce waiting times for cancer patients. There are two targets for prostate cancer to be achieved from December 2005; of a maximum 31 day wait from diagnosis of prostate cancer to start of treatment and 62 days from urgent referral for suspected prostate cancer to first treatment.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50711w33.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_52">A national cancer waits project was set up in December 2004 and has held two national conferences on achievement of the 2005 waiting times targets. An expert reference group, chaired by the national cancer director, consisting of representatives from special health authorities, primary care trusts, senior clinicians and national health service managers meets regularly to advise the project and discuss NHS implementation of the targets. The prostate advisory group, which includes membership from prostate charities, also discussed prostate cancer waits at its last meeting.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50711w33.html_para7">
<a name="stpa_53">If a patient tells a clinician that they need time to reflect before deciding on treatment, then clinicians are allowed to suspend the time patients need to consider their treatment options. This means that when monitoring the time taken to achieve the targets, this time does not count as part of the 31 and 62 day waiting times. This ensures that patients have enough time to 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>11 Jul 2005 : Column 747W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
make the right decision about their favoured treatment option. Decisions on the best treatment for each individual cancer patient must remain a clinical decision made by a multi disciplinary team. The targets ensure that agreed treatment is delivered quickly.

However, if there is no other part of the country that is safe from persecution or it would be unduly harsh to expect a claimant to relocate to a safe part of the country, then their fear of persecution in relation to the country as a whole would be well-founded.

In particular leading members of non-Arab ethnic Darfuri tribes, those classed as &#039;intellectuals&#039; or who are prominent human rights activists from non-Arab ethnic groups. We do not however consider that each and every Sudanese national from Darfur who applies for asylum is in need of international protection. In a recent country guidance appeal determination (AE (Sudan) CG [2005] UKAIT 00101, promulgated 3 May 2005), the independent tribunal considered the most recent situation reports by a range of key sources including UNHCR, Amnesty International and Global IDP Project and ruled that ordinary non-Arab ethnic Darfuris may relocate internally to the capital Khartoum where they are safe from persecution. In accordance with these tribunal findings, we consider that, depending on the individual circumstances of the case, internal relocation for ordinary non-Arab ethnic Darfuris is a safe and viable option. In such cases, Khartoum is the most practical location in terms of safety and viability and we specifically advise that this profile of Darfuri is safe from persecution in the capital.

 While the Home Secretary decides whether an applicant qualifies for compensation in respect of a miscarriage of justice, the assessment of the amount of compensation is undertaken by an Assessor appointed by him under the Criminal Justice Act 1988 (currently Lord Brennan QC). The amount of an award is wholly a matter for the Assessor, and the Home Secretary has no power to influence or vary his determination.

lodging&quot;. The compensation process involves two separate and distinct concepts of loss: pecuniary and non-pecuniary loss. The pecuniary element, the quantifiable financial loss, is intended to put the applicant back into the financial position they would have been in but for their wrongful conviction, but not to a position better than that. Any deduction for saved living expenses is made by the Assessor in respect of the costs an applicant would have been required to pay out of their net income, for example rent or mortgage payments. The deduction is restricted to the pecuniary loss element only, and is not intended to cover optional or enhanced expenditure, such as luxuries and leisure activities. A minimal monthly expenditure is therefore deducted.

<a name="50711w41.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_81">The non-pecuniary loss award, however, is in recognition of, for example, loss of reputation, loss of liberty, hardship, mental suffering, injury to feelings, and inconvenience. It is an award in recognition of the miscarriage of justice itself.

 The national probation service has a statutory duty to work with victims of sexual or violent offences where the offender receives a custodial sentence of 12 months or more.

<a name="qnpa_17">Many victims of serious crime will have concerns about an offender approaching them or their home once released from prison. The victim contact scheme provides an opportunity for victims to request that

conditions be attached to an offender&#039;s licence on conditional release. These conditions may specify, for example, that the offender is not allowed to have any contact with the victim and may establish exclusion zones into which the offender is not allowed, such as the areas around the victim&#039;s house or place of work. Victims who have concerns about the risk posed to them by an offender on either temporary or conditional release can discuss their concerns with the VLO who can use this information in reports to the prison governor or Parole Board.

<a name="qnpa_18">When an offender is released on licence, he/she will be subject to supervision by the probation service. During the period of the licence, the VLO will maintain contact with a victim and the victim&#039;s family. If victims have concerns about the offender breaching conditions not to contact them or entering an exclusion zone, they should inform the VLO who will in turn notify the offender&#039;s supervising officer. If the concerns are substantiated, the offender will either be warned about his/her behaviour, or recalled to custody if it is thought he/she presents an unacceptable risk of harm to the public and there is evidence he/she has breached the licence conditions.

<a name="50711w45.html_para0">
<a name="qnpa_21">The Secretary of State issued a screening direction on 11 May 2005. In the opinion of the Secretary of State, taking into account the selection criteria in schedule 3 to the 1999 regulations, the proposal is likely to have significant effects on the environment by virtue of factors such as its nature and location. The development proposed, namely, change of use of buildings to a mix of classes B1, B2, B8, and sui generis uses falls within the description at paragraph (10)<i>(a)</i> of schedule 2 to the 1999 regulations. The reason for this conclusion is the proposal is for an industrial estate development on a site in excess of 0.5 hectares. Since the proposal exceeds the threshold in column 2 of the table in schedule 2 to the 1999 regulations and is located in a sensitive area, the Secretary of State considers the application to be a &#039;Schedule 2 application&#039; within the meaning of the 1999 regulations.

<a name="qnpa_22">However, the Secretary of State&#039;s opinion on the likelihood of the development having significant environmental effects is reached only for the purposes of the screening direction. Since a further planning application is expected in respect of this site, it is possible that the site will come before the First Secretary of State in the future either as the subject of a call-in or on appeal, therefore any comments regarding the merits of any proposal for the site could prejudice the First Secretary of State&#039;s position.

 National planning guidance set out in PPG17 (Planning for Open Space, Sport and Recreation) makes clear that open spaces that are needed by their communities should be protected and not developed for other uses. PPG17 indicates that planning authorities should undertake assessments of their communities&#039; open space needs and only consider granting permission for development where open spaces are surplus to all requirements. PPG3 (Housing) complements this protection through the priority it gives to building new houses on previously developed land.

The figures are derived from the &quot;Survey of English Housing&quot;, which is an annual survey of around 20,000 households. While the survey is large enough to provide reasonable estimates of the number of private renters by region, it cannot be used to provide estimates at local authority level.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what waste management options have been placed before councils by the Government.  [11128]</p>




<p><a name="st_246"><a name="50711w53.html_spnew0"><b> Angela E. Smith: </b> 
 The Department of the Environment has recently published guidance on waste management options for municipal and non-municipal waste in Northern Ireland. The report on Best Practicable Environmental Option for Waste Management follows extensive stakeholder engagement involving District Councils and other stakeholders as part of the Waste Management Strategy review.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50711w53.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_132">A broad range of options were considered comprising different combinations of technologies to divert waste from landfill including recycling, composting, anaerobic digestion, mechanical biological treatment, thermal treatment and advanced thermal treatment (pyrolysis and gasification). These options were assessed against key decision criteria of feasibility, environmental impact, cost and social impact.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50711w53.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_133">The findings provide a framework for assessing the preferred combination of different technologies to meet targets on landfill diversion at 2020, in order to support progress on planning, procurement and funding for a new waste management infrastructure for Northern Ireland. The framework is intended to guide District Councils in the development of their Waste Management Plans and infrastructure procurement, while not constraining local choices to meet challenging Landfill Directive targets.

 The Better Regulation Task Force in its report, &quot;Better Routes to Redress&quot; recommended that research should be carried out into the potential impact and effectiveness of contingency fees.

 There are no blanket restrictions on people who are overweight from applying to adopt a child. The adoption agency has a duty to children needing adoptive families to satisfy itself that the prospective adopter has a reasonable expectation of continuing to enjoy good health, and that they have sufficient health and vigour to meet the many varied demands of a child throughout his childhood and into adulthood.

<a name="stpa_142">A person&#039;s weight could be a contributory factor to the state of his health, either now or in the future, and if so this will be brought out in his medical report produced by his GP. If there is any medical condition which might affect the prospective adopter&#039;s capacity to care for a child, this is taken very seriously and explored thoroughly to obtain as much information as possible to enable a decision to be made on his suitability to adopt a child. If an adoption agency decides that it does not propose to approve the prospective adopter, the reasons must be sound and defensible. The prospective adopter has the right to challenge that qualifying determination by either making representations to the adoption agency or applying to the independent review panel to review his case.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills if she will introduce an additional apprenticeship facility for young people who cannot meet the learning requirement of the full apprenticeship but who want to work and engage in flexible learning.  [10433]</p>




<p><a name="st_272"><a name="50711w55.html_spnew7"><b> Phil Hope: </b> 
 The content of each apprenticeship framework is designed by the business led Sector Skills Councils in the context of a blueprint agreed between the Department and key stakeholders. Achievement of the full framework is intended to be the minimum requirement for qualified status at either Level 2 or Level 3 within a particular industry. The basic elements of the framework,&#151;NVQ, technical certificate, key skills and any other qualifications designated by the sector&#151;form that minimum requirement and are intended to provide as much flexibility as possible while maintaining quality and standards across industries. 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>11 Jul 2005 : Column 832W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
However, for some young people initial assessment will indicate they may not be able to complete all elements of the framework. A number of other programmes may be suitable for young people in this position. In particular for 16 to 18-year-olds we are piloting a programme to encourage young people in jobs without training to take up learning opportunities. The programme will start in April 2006. For those over 19 and without either basic skills or a first Level 2 qualification we are putting in place the National Employer Training programme to deliver high quality flexible qualifications in the workplace.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what assessment she has made of the drop-out rate for apprenticeships; and what causes she has identified.  [10434]</p>




<p><a name="st_273"><a name="50711w55.html_spnew8"><b> Phil Hope: </b> 
 The Learning and Skills Council measures the number and proportion of young people who complete all the elements of their apprenticeship framework. The completion rate in academic year 2002/03 was 27 per cent., so far in 2004/05 the rate is 35.7 per cent. To further improve completion we have adopted a Performance Indicator for 2007/08 to increase the number of completions by 75 per cent. from 43,000 to 75,000. To achieve this, the Department and the LSC will continue to research and address the reasons for non-completion, which will vary from sector to sector and from employer to employer. Overall, the main reasons that have been identified are: poor quality learning provision; inappropriate or inflexible frameworks, or elements of frameworks; and inadequate initial assessment of apprentices&#039; capabilities. We also have anecdotal evidence of young people not completing due to promotion at work. While this might be seen as a &#039;good&#039; reason, we are keen that young people and their employers understand the value of completing the full framework, both to productivity and future employability. The LSC will continue with its programme to root out poor provision by withdrawing contracts where necessary. According to the Adult Learning Inspectorate in 2001&#150;02 the level of inadequate provision was 60 per cent. In 2003&#150;04 that had fallen to 34 per cent.

<a name="50711w55.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_146">The content of apprenticeship frameworks are set by Sector Skills Councils within a blueprint set by the Department and other key stakeholders. This offers as much flexibility to sectors as possible while maintaining overall standards across industries. Effective initial assessment remains crucial to ensuring that young people have a realistic chance of completing their programme. Providers are judged on the systems they have in place to do this. We will also be focusing our future marketing activity on ensuring that apprenticeships and their value are better understood.

 DfES funding for university teaching and research in England is in the form of a block grant, and universities have flexibility to allocate it as they wish between Departments and programmes. We do not monitor which programmes receive funding. The research councils are the other major Government funders of academic research: they do not have any formal co-funding programmes with Israeli funding agencies, but have awarded some funding for projects, including funding to enable collaborations between UK and Israeli researchers.
