<p><a name="50407w01.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Touhig: </b> 
 My right hon. Friend and I have regular discussions with Assembly Ministers on matters affecting Wales. Under the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 transport providers must take reasonable steps to remove physical barriers, to make their services accessible. As part of the Assembly&#039;s longer distance bus and coach strategy&#039; a number of long-distance routes now operate accessible buses, as do many local services: buses with poor accessibility are to be phased out by 2017, and rail vehicles by 2020.

<p><a name="50407w01.html_wqn2"><b> Llew Smith: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what assessment he has made of the implications for his Department of the study, &quot;Millennium Ecosystem Assessment&quot;, published by the United Nations and the World Bank on 30 March; what plans he has to liaise with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs on the impact of the report on the implementation of climate change and sustainable development strategies; and if he will make a statement.  [224695]</p>








<p><a name="50407w01.html_spnew2"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 The Department for International Development (DFID) welcomes the launch of &quot;Millennium Ecosystem Assessment&quot; (MA). The report provides a useful and comprehensive overview of recent trends in ecosystem function. The detailed findings of the MA will further strengthen the evidence base for addressing the linkages between poverty and environment. This includes specific consideration of the role of ecosystems in supporting the livelihoods of the poor and the implications of changes in ecosystem function for achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).




<br>&nbsp;<br><i>7 Apr 2005 : Column 1564W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50407w01.html_para0">
DFID officials have reviewed the main findings of the MA Synthesis Report. They welcome the MA&#039;s detailed overview of the status of ecosystems and the consideration of change under different scenarios. DFID&#039;s interests primarily relate to policies and actions that respond to environmental challenges while bringing financial and livelihood benefits to the poor. The MA responses of particular interest to DFID include those on: strengthening the integration of environmental considerations in development co-operation; developing markets and economic based incentives for more sustainable ecosystem use; and the research and application of appropriate technologies. This will support development and improvement of tools to better integrate environmental considerations into development co-operation. DFID is already active in many of these areas, for example in taking forward our commitments to support developing countries to integrate environmental considerations into Poverty Reduction Strategies; and work on payment for ecosystem services.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50407w01.html_para1">
DFID will encourage the agencies involved in commissioning the report, including the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) and the Secretariats of the Conventions (in particular the Convention on Biological Diversity and the Framework Convention on Climate Change), to use the MA&#039;s analyses and results to inform their policy and implementation work.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50407w01.html_para2">
DFID maintains strong working relationships with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, especially in the areas of climate change, biodiversity and sustainable development. DFID officials will continue to work closely with DEFRA on these issues, taking account of the relevant findings of the MA.

<a name="50407w01.html_sbhd3"><h3 align=center>Aid Suspension</h3>





<p><a name="50407w01.html_wqn3"><b> Dr. Tonge: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development in relation to which countries the UK has suspended aid in the past four years; and what the reasons were in each case.  [224693]</p>








<p><a name="50407w01.html_spnew3"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 The only instance since 2001&#150;02 where the UK has suspended its bilateral aid programme is in Zimbabwe. DFID, in line with most other donors, suspended traditional development assistance programmes in late 2001 because of the poor policies of the Government and their unwillingness to engage constructively with the international community on crucial issues of political and economic governance. Our assistance has been confined to humanitarian assistance and support for civil society and United Nations programmes to tackle HIV and AIDS.

 The Global Tuberculosis Control Report was launched on 23 March by the Director General of the World Health Organisation at a press briefing in London co-hosted by DFID. The Report for 2005 says that global Tuberculosis (TB) prevalence has declined by more than 20 per cent. since 1990 and that incidence is now falling or stable in five of the six regions of the world. The exception is Africa, where TB is one of the most common illnesses among people with AIDS. TB incidence has tripled since 1990 in countries with high HIV prevalence and are still rising across the continent at a rate of 3&#150;4 per cent. annually.

The Heritage Lottery Fund agreed new guidance on timber procurement in January 2005. Under this guidance, all timber used on HLF-funded projects must be obtained from verifiable legal sources.

The guidance has been developed with the assistance of the UK Government&#039;s &#039;Central Point of Expertise on Timber&#039; (CPET). Although there is no ban on companies trading with Burma, the Government does not encourage trade and investment with that country; neither does it give financial support to promote trade missions there.

<p><a name="50407w08.html_spnew4"><b> Margaret Hodge: </b> 
 Local education authorities receive funding for all pupils on the school roll in their area through the Education Formula Spending Share. The formula also takes account of the number of pupils with English as an additional language. In 2004&#150;05 the Ethnic Minority Achievement Grant, a matched funded grant which is part of the Standards Fund, has provided a total of &#163;162 million of ring-fenced funding to schools, aimed at raising the attainment of under-achieving minority ethnic pupils and those whose first language is other than English. For 2005&#150;06, this total will be &#163;168.6 million.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50407w08.html_para2">
In addition, in 2003 my Department conducted the &quot;Aiming High: Raising the Achievement of Minority Ethnic Pupils&quot; consultation. This has been followed by a wide range of initiatives aimed at addressing the specific needs of certain groups of pupils, including those whose first language is other than English. Part of this initiative is the Primary National Strategy English as an Additional Language (EAL) Pilot which involves the provision of EAL consultants in 21 local education authority areas, each working with 10 schools. The role 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>7 Apr 2005 : Column 1591W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
of these consultants is to develop an intensive professional development programme for mainstream school staff. This will enable the development of improved skills and confidence among mainstream teachers and allow for the production of teaching and learning materials and the dissemination of good practice.

<p>
<a name="50407w08.html_para3">
My Department has also worked with the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA) and Ofsted to promote a common national approach to assessment of the acquisition of English language fluency based on the National Curriculum in English levels. This approach states that particular care needs to be taken to assess the needs of newly arrived pupils and the importance of using pupils&#039; first languages as part of the assessment process. Finally, my Department provided funding to the QCA to develop guidance to help teachers respond to the needs of newly arrived pupils. This guidance &quot;Pathways to Learning for New Arrivals&quot; was launched in December 2004 and provides all school staff with access to information on all aspects of integrating newly arrived pupils, including good practice case studies, to ensure that these pupils get full access to the National Curriculum. This guidance can be found on the QCA website&#151;www.qca.org.uk

 An individuals total life expectancy is defined as their current age plus their life expectancy from the current age.

As part of the demographic assumptions associated with the periodic valuations of the Teachers&#039; Pension Scheme, the Government Actuary takes into account the life expectancy of teachers following their retirement. In the latest valuation report at 31 March 2001 the assumed life expectancy of teachers in normal health at age 60 was 26 years for men and 29 years for women. At age 65, assumed life expectancy would be about five years less than at age 60.

The Government have already made clear that the revaluation should not lead to a change in the overall council tax yield and consequently most council tax payers are unlikely to face an increase (or decrease) in their council tax bill as a result of revaluation. There will be a transitional relief scheme to help taxpayers whose properties move to a higher band.

In my evidence to the Trade and Industry Committee on 23 February 2005 I referred to the seven such companies based on factually incorrect briefing. I wrote to the Committee chair to correct the evidence on 11 March 2005. Of these transactions, nine relate to insurance provided by ECGD. It is ECGD&#039;s policy not to disclose details of insurance it provides, or the fact of having provided insurance, where it considers the disclosure of such information might increase the likelihood of default by the bodies whose payment obligations ECGD is insuring. This is because, the commercial interests of ECGD and the U.K economy would be prejudiced by a default. Pursuant to that policy the nine insurance cases referred to have not been publicised.

<i>[holding answer 7 December 2004]</i>: No detailed assessment has been made of the applicability of the Charter of Fundamental Rights to the provision of services of general interest. The Charter would only be applicable to member state action if the member state were implementing union law. The proposed constitutional treaty makes plain that the Charter does not extend the field of application of union law, create new powers or tasks for the union or modify existing powers or tasks.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what steps she is planning to take to stop companies publishing ex-directory telephone numbers on the internet.  [224900]</p>








<p><a name="50407w18.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Mike O&#039;Brien: </b> 
 Ex-directory customers&#039; numbers are not given out to third parties by BT, nor are they printed in phone books. However, being ex-directory does not mean a customer will never see their telephone number on a website. For example, telemarketing companies use databases to contact people. These are generally compiled by customers unwittingly completing coupons for special offers, magazine and catalogue tear off slips and other promotional questionnaires and flyers but forgetting to fill in the non-disclosure box (if available).

</p>


<p>
<a name="50407w18.html_para2">
If it was proved that a telecoms company made public an ex-directory telephone number, the telecoms company would be in breach of the Data Protection Act and the Information Commissioner&#039;s Office (ICO) would take appropriate action.

The rod was provided on loan to CA Parsons Ltd in Newcastle. This company was involved with construction consortia involved in the building of nuclear power stations. Because of the destruction of advice and delivery notes under the 30 year rule and the loss of the Parsons files it is impossible to establish if the rod was ever returned to Springfields by Parsons.

<p><a name="50407w25.html_spnew1"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 The Government are committed to further reform of the Common Agricultural Policy but does not intend to press for a ceiling on individual payments since this could actually slow the process of reform. Only cutting CAP payments to the EU&#039;s largest farms would penalise those which would tend to be better able to compete in a less subsidy dependent market. The measure could, therefore, have the counter-intuitive effect of disproportionately supporting those EU farm businesses most likely to resist further reform. A ceiling on CAP payments would also penalise the UK in relation to most other EU member states, as UK farms tend to be larger than the EU average.

<p><a name="50407w26.html_spnew1"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 Dairy premium and the additional payment were introduced by the EU as direct payments to dairy farmers. In 2004 milk producers qualified for the dairy premium based upon the quota available on their holdings as at 31 March 2004. The UK was granted the sum of 53.4 million Euros to be distributed to producers on the basis of objective criteria and in such a way as to ensure equal treatment between producers. The UK decided to pay the additional payment as a top up to the dairy premium.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50407w26.html_para1">
In 2004 producers were required to apply for dairy premium and additional payment by completing an integrated administration and control system application form. Claims for England, Northern Ireland and Wales were processed by the Rural Payments Agency.

For 2005, producers will claim dairy premium and additional payment through their single payment scheme claim form. Eligibility will be similar to 2004. Producers will not be receiving separate payments this year as both elements will be included in the single payment.

 No payment will be distributed to non-dairy farmers in England as dairy premium and the additional payment are only paid to milk producers who held quota that was available on the holding at the end of the quota year.

However, the Department has facilitated discussions between key stakeholders with a view to the rationalisation of assurance schemes in line with the recommendations of the Policy Commission on the future of farming and food. As a result of those discussions the six main sectoral assurance schemes in England have either merged or entered into binding agreements with Assured Food Standards, the private organisation that was set up to administer the Red Tractor logo. This has provided scope for further rationalisation of assurance standards and inspections.

The Department is also committed to further improving farm regulation and in November 2005 we will publish a Strategy for the Regulation of Agriculture.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what steps her Department is taking to combat fly-tipping.  [224977]</p>








<p><a name="50407w28.html_spnew1"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 The Department is taking forward a wide ranging strategy for combating fly-tipping, in close liaison with the Environment Agency and local authorities. Some new powers for these enforcement agencies were included in the Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003. Many more provisions have been included in the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Bill which has now completed its passage through Parliament. These include raising the penalties for the main offence of illegal waste disposal; new powers to stop, search and instantly seize vehicles that are being used for fly-tipping; additional sentencing powers for the courts including a power to award forfeiture of vehicles used to commit an offence; and powers for the enforcing authorities to issue fixed penalty notices for some offences. We will work closely with the enforcement authorities on implementation of all the measures in the Bill.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50407w28.html_para1">
100 per cent. of local authorities are now registered on the Flycapture database, which for the first time is producing national data on the nature and scale of fly-tipping across the country. We are funding the Environment Agency through the Flycapture Enforcement project to provide training for local authority enforcement officers and lawyers on how to enhance their skills. Through the BREW programme, we are providing additional funding for the agency to assist businesses in complying with the legal requirements on the disposal of waste. The Department has also just let a research project that will look in depth at the reasons why people fly-tip and will develop good practice guidance for local authorities on further measures they can take to help reduce the problem.

<p><a name="50407w28.html_spnew3"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 The Government are working to ensure that labour provider businesses have robust business systems in place in advance of the introduction of licensing later this year. Regulation of the industry is intended to end exploitation and drive out illegal activity. In parallel to developing the licensing system, we are working to help legitimate labour providers to be successful and robust businesses. To facilitate this process we are working closely with the Ethical Trading Initiative Temporary Labour Working Group to promote the Code of Practice which the group launched in November 2004. Labour providers are being invited to arrange for their businesses to be audited against the code. Those that do will be offered a pre audit business consultancy session to assess their business and offer advice on problem areas. This process has the full backing of the supermarkets, the Association of Labour Providers, the Transport and General Workers Union and the National Farmers Union. To help reduce the cost to labour providers, the Government will be meeting a proportion of the cost of the consultancy advice and audit activities on a first come first served basis. The Chairman of the Gangmasters Licensing Authority has also indicated, that the cost of a licence audit will be reduced where a labour provider has previously been audited against the Temporary Labour Working Group Code by an auditor meeting the competencies set by the Gangmasters Licensing Authority.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50407w28.html_para2">
In the longer term the Gangmasters Licensing Authority will be responsible for developing regulations setting out the conditions labour providers will be required to comply with under the new gangmaster licensing arrangements. Regulations establishing the Gangmasters Licensing Authority are in place and the authority started work on 1 April. The authority will be consulting on licence conditions over the next few weeks and hopes to have regulations in place establishing the detailed licensing arrangements by the autumn. It is anticipated that the authority will develop best practice guidance for labour providers alongside the regulations.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what action her Department is taking in connection with the failure of the US Administration to notify the UK before March of the import into the UK since 2001 of GM maize containing an antibiotic resistant marker of a type that the EU had been advised to phase out; and what steps her Department is taking to prevent a recurrence of such an event with reference to <i>(a)</i> regulatory controls in the US and <i>(b)</i> the implementation of controls in the EU.  [224888]</p>









<p><a name="50407w28.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 This relates to the incident in the USA where some batches of Syngenta&#039;s GM maize seed intended to be Bt11 actually contained an unapproved GM maize event known as Bt10. We were informed of 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>7 Apr 2005 : Column 1664W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
this incident on 22 March and issued a press release on 23 March. Our understanding is that between 2001&#150;04 approximately 15,000 hectares of Bt10 was grown in the USA and most of the resulting grain was used in the USA. Only 18 per cent. of US corn is exported and the levels of maize exported from the US to the EU are very small indeed. The European Commission has been informed that an estimated 1,000 tonnes of Bt10 food and feed products may have entered the European Union (as distinct from the UK) since 2001. We have no evidence at this stage of any import of Bt10 into the UK.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50407w28.html_para3">
We are unaware of the original source of the figure of 170,000 tonnes which you quote. There is no evidence that 170,000 tonnes of Bt10 maize has been imported into the UK; and indeed this figure is an order of magnitude higher than the total annual maize imports into the UK from the US, which are in a range of 4,000 to 14,000 tonnes annually.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50407w28.html_para4">
Following Syngenta&#039;s disclosure on 22 March, Defra and the Food Standards Agency have been working with the European Commission and the US authorities to gain information on whether or not any contaminated maize has been imported into the UK. We continue to monitor the situation closely.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50407w28.html_para5">
We have written to maize importers to remind them of the need to check imports of maize and other crops for the presence of GMOs which have not been authorised in the European Union. It is for EU and UK importers to satisfy themselves that imported maize grain and derived products are approved for use and if material is GM that it is appropriately labelled. Our GM Inspectorate and local authority inspectors oversee this process.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50407w28.html_para6">
We understand that the US authorities consider that Bt10 does not present any concerns for human or animal health. Bt10 maize does contain an antibiotic resistance marker gene (which is not present in Bt11). Although the antibiotic resistance marker is in the process of being phased out, the European Food Safety Authority has concluded that this antibiotic resistance marker gene would have minimal, if any, impact on human health if present in GM plants.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50407w28.html_para7">
I should stress that we take incidents of this kind seriously. We do monitor the supply chain records of GM imports and take immediate action if evidence or information indicates the presence of any unauthorized GM product. Our priority is to protect the consumer and environment and ensure there is informed consumer choice.

To help local authorities achieve their own targets Defra&#039;s Waste Minimisation Fund was set up in 2002. As a result of successful bids for money from this fund by Kirklees metropolitan council a total of almost &#163;1.2 million was used for projects which have seen extra green wheeled bins being provided to 140,000 households across Kirklees, including Huddersfield itself. This, together with a waste reduction and reuse awareness raising campaign, also funded by Defra, has

<i>River Water Quality</i> has improved along the Kirklees rivers, including the Rivers Colne and Holme in Huddersfield over recent years. While 75 per cent. of the rivers&#039; lengths within the Kirklees area were already considered to be of fair or better chemical quality in 1997, by 2003 this had risen to 95 per cent. The improvements in the biological quality of the rivers has been even more rapid with the percentage of river length of fair quality or better rising from 4.0 per cent. in 1995 to 75 per cent. in 2003. These improvements reflect Defra&#039;s policy to improve river water quality, which is one of the headline indicators of sustainable development and to raise compliance with the EC water framework directive.

 Under section 91 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990, an individual can complain to a magistrates court if aggrieved by the defacement, by litter or refuse, of land that a local authority has a duty to keep clear under section 89 of that Act. If the magistrates are satisfied that the land in question is defaced, they can issue a litter abatement order requiring the local authority to clear the land of litter and refuse within a time specified in the order. It is an offence to fail to comply with a litter abatement order.

All applications received for UPS 2 progression have now been paid but there remains a possibility that a relatively small number of teachers have still to make an application. It is therefore not possible to provide a final total cost of teachers progressing to point 2 of the Upper Pay Scale but it is expected to be in the region of &#163;21 million to &#163;22 million.

Landfill is the only disposal option currently available in Northern Ireland.

 Cheque payments are designed for the small number of people who we cannot pay directly into an account.

We need to strike a balance between a customer&#039;s right to access their benefit or pension and the need to prevent the cheque being cashed by an unauthorised person without the customer&#039;s knowledge.

<i>Letter from David Anderson to Mr. Paul Holmes, dated 7 April 2005:</i>

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your questions concerning Jobcentre Plus contracts with employment and training providers and the decision to review the 2005 timetable. This is something which falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">Our normal practice, wherever possible, is to commence discussions with providers three months before a contract is due to end. We do not cancel contracts during their lifespan except in extreme circumstances, such as a provider becoming insolvent or committing a serious breach of its contractual obligations.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">The need to review the timetable for letting new Jobcentre Plus Contracts was identified in December 2004. That review was prompted by the Department&#039;s recently published 5 year strategy which places an increased priority on helping those who are out of work because of sickness or disability and lone parents. With fewer people unemployed and a greater emphasis on providing support to disabled people through the New Deal for Disabled People and the Pathways to Work pilots, we needed to review our contracting strategy to ensure the provision we procure focuses support on those who need the most help.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">In the light of that review, the decision was taken to cease current procurement competitions. However, we were not in a position to finalise our strategy for letting new contracts until shortly before 25 February 2005, when Jobcentre Plus Field Directors and others had been informed of the changes to our timetable and the criteria for extending current contracts i.e. satisfactory performance, a clear business need or a mandatory requirement for the provision had been established.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">To deliver the DWP and Jobcentre Plus efficiency challenges and modernisation agendas it is vital that we obtain best value for money. We have now identified what provision needs to be in place to support our business objectives, and are now in the process of developing a timetable for the implementation of an overall contracting strategy designed to achieve better value for money in terms of process and required outcomes.</p>
</ul>

<p><a name="50407w45.html_spnew1"><b> Miss Melanie Johnson </b> 
<i>[holding answer 4 April 2005]:</i> The major risk identified from the use of consumer products containing tea tree oil comes from the sensitising potential of concentrated (greater than 2 per cent.) solutions, particularly if the product has been exposed to oxygen, sunlight or higher temperatures. However, the European Scientific Committee on consumer products has advised that the data available are currently insufficient to assess the potential risk of a range of toxic effects.

The Committee requested that a complete package of data be provided in order for them to give an opinion on the potential risks. The conclusions will then be used to amend the cosmetics directive in order to make any restrictions on the use of tea tree oil in cosmetic products legally enforceable. In the meantime, industry has advised that tea tree oil should only be used in cosmetic products at concentrations at or below 1 per cent., and should be formulated and packaged in a way to minimise degradation.

 The general time limit for claiming injury benefits under the Armed Forces Compensation Scheme is five years from the date on which the injury occurs or, in the case of an illness, five years from the date the claimant first sought medical advice in relation to that illness. The time limit does not apply in certain circumstances to conditions that have late onset&#151;for example a cancer which is caused by an occupational exposure occurring more than five years before the onset of the disease. Hearing loss due to a service cause&#151;for example a blast injury&#151;has onset in close time proximity to the cause and so does not fall within the late onset provision.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what measures his Department has in place to encourage the retention of scientists <i>(a)</i> within Dstl and <i>(b)</i> engaged in research in other parts of the Department.  [219028]</p>








<p><a name="50407w49.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 We recognise the value of scientific staff to the Department and have in place a number of measures to retain their expertise and experience. The Ministry of Defence (MOD) has strong head of profession leadership through the Defence Engineering and Science Group (DESG). The group supports technical staff by coordinating training, development, career progression and Chartership. In general, the Department is on a par with the best of major employers of specialists in terms of retention rates.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50407w49.html_para0">
The Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl), with a turnover of &#163;340 million, is the biggest employer of research scientists in the MOD. Dstl provides considerable training and development opportunities&#151;technical training programmes are offered to develop and refresh technical knowledge and there is a Chartership Scheme accredited to eight professional institutions which is open to all staff.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50407w49.html_para1">
Dstl staff are also allowed time off to undertake further study such as MSc or PhD qualifications with relevant tuition fees paid. There are links with five universities for research purposes and staff are encouraged to spend time in other laboratories to ensure that knowledge remains current. Secondments are available to other areas of the Department and Government, UK industry and international laboratories. There is an internal symposium held annually to encourage networking and debate on topical research areas. There is a Scheme for Technical Education and Professional Support to encourage networking, conferences and events for junior staff and a Fellowship Scheme which gives recognition to senior staff who are acknowledged as national or international experts in their field.

<p>
<a name="50407w49.html_para2">
Similar benefits are available for scientists engaged in research in other parts of the Department, including the Hydrographic Office, the Meteorological Office and central MOD.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what is the ratio of DSTL research spending, excluding spending contracted out to third parties, to DSTL spending on other activities in the last period for which figures are available.  [219030]</p>








<p><a name="50407w49.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 The figures for the first 11 months of the financial year 2004&#150;05 for the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory indicate that the ratio of the amount spent on scientific activities, including research but excluding that contracted out to third parties, to the amount spent on other activities was 4.2 to 1. The term &quot;other activities&quot; has been interpreted as costs of non-scientific functional support.


</p>







<p><a name="50407w49.html_wqn3"><b> Mr. Gerald Howarth: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Defence through what methods DSTL scientists acquire hands-on research expertise in the <i>(a)</i> science and technology projects and <i>(b)</i> equipment procurement areas of the technical projects upon which they are required to advise.  [219031]</p>








<p><a name="50407w49.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 The Defence Science and Technology Laboratory, Dstl, has a range of approaches to ensure that its scientists and engineers acquire and retain the knowledge and expertise required to discharge its roles within the Ministry of Defence (MOD). Hands-on practical research expertise is only one element, and Dstl is tasked to undertake part of the MOD&#039;s Research Building Block itself in a range of systems areas and a sub-set of sensitive defence technologies. In addition, Dstl undertakes the knowledge integration role for the Research customers which requires it to work closely with the other organisations in industry and academia engaged in hands-on research.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50407w49.html_para3">
Dstl encourages its staff to undertake research based MSc and PhD activities as well as having a commitment to their continuous professional development through membership of the appropriate professional institutes. To strengthen engagement in underlying technical areas where Dstl has limited hands-on work of its own, it has set up Co-operative Research Centres with academia to facilitate the exchange of staff and resources between Dstl and partner Universities. This allows Dstl staff to work within the partner University alongside external researchers who are engaged in MOD funded work, for example through the Joint Grant Scheme. Dstl has also entered into arrangements with industry to encourage staff secondment and established opportunities for staff interchange with other national and international laboratories.




<br>&nbsp;<br><i>7 Apr 2005 : Column 1735W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50407w49.html_para4">
Dstl staff are also involved in oversight of the MOD Defence Technology Centres which are formal collaborative arrangements between industry and academic experts in particular technologies.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50407w49.html_para5">
These kinds of arrangement enable Dstl scientists to develop and extend their knowledge networks and improve the quality and context of its advice.

 The average salary of a research scientist working at the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory is currently &#163;32,933.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what percentage of the Government&#039;s science and technology projects and equipment procurement spending in each of the last five years occurred without advice from <i>(a)</i> DSTL and <i>(b)</i> other technical sources.  [219033]</p>









<p><a name="50407w49.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 All significant spending on Ministry of Defence science and technology projects and equipment procurement spending involves advice from a variety of appropriate technical sources, which include Dstl, QinetiQ, industry and academia. Such advice is synthesised by MOD technical experts.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50407w49.html_para6">

 To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what technical sources the Department used for impartial advice on the Government&#039;s <i>(a)</i> science and technology projects and <i>(b)</i> equipment procurement spending in addition to Dstl in each of the last five years.  [219034]</p>









<p><a name="50407w49.html_spnew6"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 The Ministry of Defence (MOD) has its own staff within the Department in addition to Dstl to provide advice on both science and technology projects and equipment procurement. These resources have been available since before the formation of Dstl. MOD does use QinetiQ, industry and academia where appropriate and when impartiality can be assured. In these cases, the majority of final synthesis of technical advice is performed by MOD&#039;s own resources.

 Civilian security staff in Northern Ireland, in common with most MOD civilian staff, are paid in accordance with pay scales for staff at their appropriate levels, rather than be paid a single rate for the job. Consequently, staff at the same level may receive different salaries dependent upon where they are on the pay scale. Following the negotiation and introduction of a multi-year pay deal in 2002, some civilian security staff were overtaken by others joining the Department later. The trades unions raised this with the Department and pay parity has since been restored for those affected.

<p>
<a name="50407w54.html_para0">
Although the British Forces Germany Health Service (BFG HS) is not funded for the provision of full IVF and equivalent treatment, it does fund the investigation of infertility and the provision of drug treatments following IVF. This takes place in our primary care facilities or our regional contracted German hospitals. It will also fund correction of any anatomical abnormality that may be causing infertility. In addition Artificial Insemination by Husband (AIH) is available at one of our contracted German hospitals.

If a patient has embarked on investigation or treatment in the UK on a NHS programme and is then posted to Germany, they receive full administrative support, including the provision of transport by air trooper.

For patients wishing to return to the UK to begin treatment for IVF, the BFG HS makes use of the excellent facilities offered by a charity based service which is provided at Hammersmith Hospital in London at no cost to the patient or the MOD. In these cases BFG HS authorises transport by air trooper. In other instances where personnel wish to be posted back to the UK and this is supported by their posting authority, they can be referred to their local Primary Care Trust (PCT) in the UK for the duration of the treatment.

<p><a name="50407w58.html_spnew6"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 Swan Hunter&#039;s design for the LSD(A) vessels was based upon the modification of the Enforcer Class concept design by the Dutch Royal Schelde shipyard, which was itself based upon the proven HNLMS Rotterdam. The company&#039;s successful bid for the design and construction of the first two ships was to adapt this existing concept design to meet the Statement of Requirement specified in the MOD&#039;s Invitation To Tender. The company subsequently encountered difficulties in adapting the design to the UK specification as the concept itself and the modifications needed were shown not to be as mature as they had previously believed. This underestimation of the degree of design work needed resulted in additional work that had not been costed in the company&#039;s bid. In September 2003 when the full scale of the additional work became clear the company announced that it would be unable to complete the contract without an adjustment to the original price. The &#163;84 million contract amendment agreed in December 2004 reflected the additional cost to the company needed to complete the programme and was awarded only after full consideration of the options, from which the MOD assessed that the contract amendment offered the optimum value for money solution in the delivery of the LSD(A) capability. In addition to the &#163;84 million needed to address the Swan Hunter design difficulty, &#163;3 million has been added since the start of the contract to address design changes as a consequence of Naval and statutory safety requirements

 When I visited Guatemala in January 2004 I stressed the importance of human rights issues with the new Vice President and other members of the government. We and our EU partners continue to encourage the Guatemalan government to implement in full the 1996 Peace Accords. Our Embassy follows the human rights situation closely and enjoys close relations with human rights organisations in Guatemala. We are presently supporting projects that are seeking to bring to justice the perpetrators of human rights abuses as well as promoting reconciliation.

<a name="50407w60.html_para5">
Although Guatemala&#039;s civil war ended in 1996, serious questions about respect for human rights in Guatemala remain. However, we have noted the positive efforts President Berger has made since his inauguration on 14 January 2004 to tackle human rights problems in Guatemala. His first public act was to declare his commitment to the 1996 Guatemalan Peace Accords and on 25 February 2004 he announced the establishment of a new national commission to oversee their implementation. These include undertakings to compensate the surviving family members of massacres that took place during the conflict. President Berger has also appointed a respected human rights campaigner, Frank la Rue, to his Cabinet as the Head of the Presidential Commission on Human Rights.

<p><a name="50407w62.html_spnew8"><b> Caroline Flint: </b> 
 The Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) is a statutory and non-executive non-departmental public body, established by the Misuse of Drugs Act (MDA) 1971.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50407w62.html_para3">
Members of the ACMD, of whom there should be not less than 20, are appointed by the Secretary of State for a term of three years and in accordance with the guidance issued by the Office of the Commissioner for Public Appointments. Nominations come from a wide range of sources including relevant professional bodies, Public Appointments Unit of the Cabinet Office and self-nomination. Under the terms of the MDA 1971 the ACMD is required to include representatives of the practices of medicine, dentistry, veterinary medicine and pharmacy, the pharmaceutical industry, and chemistry (other than pharmaceutical chemistry); and members who have a wide and relevant experience of social problems connected with the misuse of drugs.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50407w62.html_para4">
Professor Sir Michael Rawlins was first appointed to the chair of the ACMD in October 1998 for a period of four years. His tenure was extended to a second term, which is due to expire in December 2005. Sir Michael is an effective and respected chairman. He is a Professor of Clinical Pharmacology at the University of Newcastle and chair of the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE).

I am content that the range of professions, and levels of expertise on the ACMD is suitable.
</p>

<a name="50407w62.html_para7">
Where the ACMD requires additional information, or would value further opinions, it has the authority to, and frequently does, invite expert witnesses to present to its meetings, and contribute to its understanding of an issue. If it feels that such input would be valuable in the longer term, it may co-opt additional members to its sub-committees or working groups.

We have no intention to make provision for independent testing of the validity of the review process of the ACMD because we believe in the integrity of the council and its individual members, and are confident that the advice we receive from them is of the highest quality.

 The Government&#039;s Response to the Home Affairs Committee&#039;s Report published in April 2003 indicated that the Senior Investigations Handbook already included guidance that the Senior Investigating Officer in any individual case should always record, as a matter of routine, justification for using the dip sampling or investigation method for making initial approaches to former residents of care homes. This serves as a guide and is not mandatory therefore neither the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) nor Her Majesty&#039;s Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) would make a routine assessment as to compliance therein.

A list of &quot;A&quot; points adopted at the Council has been placed in the Library (Document 6588/05).
</p>


<p>
<a name="50407w71.html_para2">
The proposal for a council framework decision on combating racism and xenophobia was discussed. I intervened to say that there was no need for the decision specifically to include reference to racist symbols, as their use to incite racially motivated hatred and violence was already covered in the draft Framework Decision. The matter has been referred back to the Working Group, to be discussed again at the April JHA Council.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50407w71.html_para3">
On the proposal for a Council framework decision on the European Evidence Warrant for obtaining objects, documents and data for use in proceedings in criminal matters, the presidency sought agreement to the broad principles to be followed under the EEW in relation to dual criminality. In particular it was proposed that they should be similar to those pertaining to previous mutual recognition measures. This would include using a list of offences to which dual criminality would not apply based on the list in the European Evidence Warrant; excluding the idea of a &quot;sunset clause&quot;, which would eventually have abolished dual criminality for all requests; and included a seriousness threshold of three years for offences. Cathy Jamieson noted the UK&#039;s support for the presidency approach and its opposition to an additional proposal to define more clearly some of the offences on the list, stating that this was inconsistent with the principle of mutual recognition and that it would create obstacles to co-operation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50407w71.html_para4">
Over lunch I discussed with other Ministers of the Interior the appointment of a Director for Europol. I intervened to say that the UK&#039;s position had always been that the best candidate should be selected through a fair and transparent selection process. We therefore supported the recommendation of the Europol Management Board that the German candidate, Herr Ratzel was the best candidate. The Council agreed to his selection and I noted that, for this and similar posts, it was essential that the best candidate was selected on merit, rather than nationality and that selection of individuals and sites of agencies should be considered

There was a policy debate on the follow up to the Commission reports on the member states&#039; transposition of instruments adopted on the basis of title VI of the TEU.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50407w71.html_para6">
The presidency also agreed to take forward consideration of the reports on the European Arrest Warrant and Joint Investigation Teams by the end of June in light of the discussion.

The Presidency asked member states to agree that CEPOL be given community financing and should apply ED staff regulations. The UK was able to support this approach as the firststage in establishing CEPOL and the presidency confirmed that the Working Group take work forward on that basis.

Impairment tests are conducted in accordance with a Code of Practice issued on 20 December 2004. They involve a trained officer observing a suspect in the performance of specified tasks and making other observations about his physical state. They are based on the voluntary field impairment tests and drug recognition techniques that have been in use for some time and are of proven effectiveness in indicating whether a person might be under the influence of a drug.

Tests for the presence of drugs have to be carried out by means of a device of a type approved by the Secretary of State.
