<p><a name="qn_1"><a name="50704w01.html_wqn1"><b> Norman Baker: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs for what reasons the landfill site at Beddingham has been refused a licence to operate by the Environment Agency.  [8607]</p>








<p><a name="st_1"><a name="50704w01.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Bradshaw  </b> 
<i>[holding answer 30 June 2005 ]:</i> In order to avoid confusion, I should explain that the Environment Agency has refused to issue a Pollution Prevention and Control (PPC) permit for the site in question, rather than a licence. Under the Landfill (England and Wales) Regulations 2002 all landfill sites operating under the terms of a waste management licence are required to apply for a PPC permit which places more stringent requirements on the operator, in line with the EU Landfill Directive.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50704w01.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_1">The Environment Agency has refused the application for a Pollution Prevention and Control permit for Beddingham landfill site, as submitted, on two grounds. Firstly, leachate from the landfill currently poses an unacceptable risk to groundwater surrounding the site. The application as submitted does not adequately address this issue. Secondly, improvements to the site&#039;s liner system (intended to control the escape of leachate and gas from the site) are required. This has not been adequately addressed in the application either. It should however be noted that the site poses no significant risk to human health.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50704w01.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_2">Under the regulations, the operator has six months to appeal the refusal or make a fresh application. Under the regulations, the site may continue to receive waste in the meantime. In the event that the operator decides to appeal the decision or makes a fresh application, the site can also continue to receive waste while these matters are dealt with. Negotiations between the operator and the Environment Agency are ongoing to resolve the reasons for refusal. It is likely that these negotiations will conclude with a new application for a PPC permit for this site.

<p><a name="qn_2"><a name="50704w01.html_wqn2"><b> Tim Loughton: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what estimate she has made of the increased costs to beekeepers resulting from adoption of the EC directive 2004/28 regarding the supply of veterinary products and inspections; and what discussions she has had with British beekeepers on this matter.  [8349]</p>








<p><a name="st_2"><a name="50704w01.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Bradshaw  </b> 
<i>[holding answer 30 June 2005]:</i> Directive 2004/28/EC amends directive 2001/82/EC, which sets out requirements for the authorisation and control of veterinary medicines. It was published by the European Commission on 30 April 2004 following a major review of EU medicines legislation. Member states are required to implement its provisions by 30 October 2005.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50704w01.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_3">During negotiations in Brussels, a requirement to restrict the distribution of veterinary medicinal products for food producing animals, including honeybees, to prescription supply was presented with the intention of strengthening the control of these medicines and related consumer safeguards. While there are valid reasons for restricting some veterinary medicines to prescription supply, we do not consider this appropriate for all medicines for use in food-producing animals. Neither the commission nor the majority of member states supported the UK view and the requirement was consequently taken forward in the amending directive. We are aware that this provision has the potential to increase the costs to beekeepers of obtaining medicines by incurring additional veterinary charges.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50704w01.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_4">However, the UK successfully negotiated the inclusion of a provision that allows medicines that meet certain criteria, to be agreed subsequently, to be exempt from the prescription requirement. This provision also allows the current distribution arrangements to remain until a list of exemption criteria is agreed, or until January 2007 if no list has been agreed by then. This exemption list is to be proposed by the commission andvoted on by the member states. Officials at the Veterinary Medicines Directorate (VMD) are well aware of the concerns expressed by beekeepers and continue to argue strongly for medicines authorised for use in bees to be included on this list. The commission has not yet proposed a list and it may be some time before the outcome is known.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50704w01.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_5">In addition to pressing for bee medicines to be exempted from the prescription requirement, we have proposed new distribution categories for the UK that include tiered categories of prescription only medicines (ROMs). If adopted, these will comply with the directive&#039;s provisions while allowing veterinary medicines for food-producing animals that are currently available without prescription to continue to be supplied by pharmacists or registered merchants without the need to involve a veterinary surgeon.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50704w01.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_6">VMD officials are working closely with beekeeper representatives and are making arrangements for the beekeepers to speak to a meeting of EU medicines regulators under the UK presidency.

<p><a name="st_5"><a name="50704w01.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Bradshaw  </b> 
<i>[holding answer 27 June 2005]:</i> The placement of materials in the maritime area (which includes geological structures under the seabed) is regulated internationally by the London Convention and the 1996 protocol to the Convention, and by the OSPAR Convention for the protection of the marine environment of the north-east Atlantic. The 1996 protocol to the London Convention is not yet in force, but has been ratified by the United Kingdom and we would expect to abide by its provisions.

<a name="stpa_7">The question of the compatibility of carbon dioxide placement in geological structures, including depleted or partly depleted oil and gas fields, has been discussed in both conventions.




<br>&nbsp;<br><i>4 Jul 2005 : Column 4W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50704w01.html_para8">
Under both conventions, there is no bar on the use of carbon dioxide for operational purposes. This implies that carbon sequestration in association with enhanced oil recovery would be permitted.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50704w01.html_para9">
<a name="stpa_8">The contracting parties to the OSPAR convention agreed a position statement on carbon sequestration in 2004. This established that in other certain circumstances carbon sequestration is compatible with the convention. The position is set out in full in Annex 12 to the summary record of the 2004 meeting of the OSPAR Commission. A copy will be placed in the Library of the House, and it is also available on the OSPAR web site, www.ospar.org.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50704w01.html_para10">
<a name="stpa_9">The United Kingdom raised the issue of the carbon sequestration during the 2004 consultative meeting of the parties to the London Convention. The legal position has not yet been established. It was agreed to set up an inter-sessional correspondence group to consider the legal issues raised under both the convention and the 1996 protocol. The UK is coordinating the work of this group. The issue will be discussed again at the 2005 consultative meeting in October, when results of the inter-sessional work will be considered.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50704w01.html_para11">

 The Environment Agency&#039;s assessment is that Canvey Island is protected by sea defences to a standard which is among the highest in the country.

By the year 2030, on the assumption of no further improvements to the current defences, it is estimated that protection would be slightly reduced to a level effective against events with a probability equal to 0.1 per cent. in any one year.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what steps are being taken to discourage the dropping of litter on streets; what penalties apply to the offence; and if she will make a statement.  [8113]</p>








<p><a name="st_13"><a name="50704w02.html_spnew7"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 It is an offence under section 87 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 to thrown down, drop or otherwise deposit any litter in any place in the area of a principal litter authority which is open to the air. A person found guilty of the offence may be fined up to &#163;2,500 in a magistrates court. Section 88 of the 1990 Act also enables local authorities to issue fixed penalties for the offence as an alternative to prosecution. The level of fixed penalties in England is currently set at &#163;50.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50704w02.html_para8">
<a name="stpa_19">Government have recently introduced new legislation to discourage the dropping of litter through the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act 2005. Until 7 June this year, it was only an offence to drop litter on land to which the public have access. This has now been extended to cover all types of land, including private land and land covered by water, sending out a clear message that the dropping of litter anywhere is unacceptable.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50704w02.html_para9">
<a name="stpa_20">The Act also contains changes to the fixed penalty notice regime which will be brought into force in April next year. It will enable local authorities to authorise officers other than their own employees to issued fixed penalties for litter, and additionally, will extend this power to parish councils. This will help to discourage littering by widening the range of officers that are able to take immediate enforcement action.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50704w02.html_para10">
<a name="stpa_21">At the same time, local authorities will be given the freedom to set the level of fixed penalties themselves within a range set out by the Secretary of State in regulations, and to offer discounts for early payment. A standard default amount of &#163;75 will apply if the local authority chooses not to exercise this power. The Act will make it an offence for someone to fail to supply their name and address or to give a false name or address, when requested to do so by an authorised officer serving an FPN. This will deter people from dropping litter by increasing on-the-spot fines and giving enforcement officers more effective powers.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50704w02.html_para11">
<a name="stpa_22">The Government are seeking to discourage littering not only through improved legislation and enforcement, but also by educating people about the responsible disposal of litter and highlighting the link between irresponsible disposal, poor health, a degraded local environment, and levels of anti-social behaviour. It is for this reason that Defra provides grant-funding to the environmental charity ENCAMS to conduct public awareness campaigns on its behalf. These are targeted at specific groups to reduce types of littering that have been identified as particularly problematic or prevalent. For example, the focus this year is on youth littering and smoking-related litter.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will take further steps to encourage companies to reduce the amount of packaging goods are sold in.  [5857]</p>








<p><a name="st_17"><a name="50704w03.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 There are currently two sets of Regulations which cover packaging in the UK; both of which encourage producers to minimise packaging. The Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) Regulations 1997 (as amended) are intended to increase the recovery and recycling of packaging waste. The amount of packaging waste producers have to recover and recycle is determined, in part, by the amount of packaging they handle. Producers can therefore save money if they use less packaging. The Packaging 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>4 Jul 2005 : Column 10W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
(Essential Requirements) Regulations 2003 (as amended) place a number of requirements on all packaging placed on the market in the UK, including a requirement that packaging should be manufactured so that the packaging volume and weight are limited to the minimum adequate amount to maintain the necessary level of safety, hygiene and acceptance for the packed product and for the consumer.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50704w03.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_23">Both regulations have led to decreases in the amount of packaging used around products. However, more still needs to be done to reduce the amount of packaging thatis produced in the first place. The Government&#039;s Advisory Committee on Packaging is working with industry to find ways of encouraging businesses to further reduce the amount of packaging they use.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50704w03.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_24">Although legislation is one way of reducing packaging consumers also have a part to play. For example, if consumers made a point of choosing goods that are not heavily packaged, or bought &#039;loose food&#039; rather than pre-packaged, or used their own shopping bags or boxes, manufacturers would be more inclined to reduce the quantity of packaging on their products.

 The management of packaging waste is already addressed in the UK through the Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) Regulations 1997 (as amended). As an extension of the &#039;polluter pays principle&#039;, the Regulations oblige businesses in the packaging chain, which have an annual turnover of more than &#163;2 million and which handle more than 50 tonnes of packaging a year, to recover and recycle a specified amount of packaging waste each year which is determined, in part, by the amount of packaging they handle. These Regulations are intended to drive minimisation of packaging and packaging waste, encourage reuse of packaging and increase the recovery and recycling of packaging waste. They have succeeded so far in raising the recycling rate for packaging waste from around 27 per cent. in 1997 to 49.5 per cent. in 2004.

<p><a name="st_21"><a name="50704w04.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 The Environment Agency and its predecessor organisations have performed a biannual qualitative fisheries survey on the tidal River Thames since 1992. However, the dynamic nature of estuaries, with highly mobile and widely dispersed fish populations means that no quantitative data is available to estimate fish numbers using currently available methodologies. This is the case throughout Europe for estuarine fish populations. Recent EC FAIR (June 2000) research <sup>1</sup>  identified our current fisheries monitoring programme as &#039;Best Practice&#039;. The primary objective of this survey programme is to provide a consistent data set to detect trends and new species in the Thames.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what assessment she has made of the impact of the Licensing Act 2003 and related regulations requiring a single individual to take legal responsibility for all licensed events at a particular village hall during a 12-month period; and what representations she has received concerning this issue.  [3962]</p>








<p><a name="st_73"><a name="50704w09.html_spnew11"><b> James Purnell: </b> 
 Concern has been expressed to DCMS by village halls as to the duties of an individual who is specified on a premises licence as the designated premises supervisor (DPS). The role of a DPS only applies when a premises licence authorises the supply of alcohol. It is not relevant in respect of other licensable activities such as regulated entertainment. While the DPS has certain responsibilities under the 2003 Act, it is important that this is kept in perspective. The main purpose of having a DPS is to provide a primary point of contact for authorities investigating problems, and to ensure that any necessary preventative measures are taken to promote the licensing objectives.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50704w09.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_62">For example, we have clarified that the DPS does not have to be physically present at the premises for sales of alcohol to take place there. In addition, regular users can take out their own premises licence with their own named DPS or other hirers could be asked to use temporary event notices and there would therefore be no need to have a DPS for those events.




<br>&nbsp;<br><i>4 Jul 2005 : Column 33W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>

<p>
<a name="50704w09.html_para7">
These arrangements are important in the interests of those living near village halls. It is vital that there is a proper balance between the needs of local residents and of those conducting licensable activities at such halls. We believe that the Act strikes the correct balance, but we continue to discuss with representatives of village halls the ways in which the burdens involved can be best managed.

 The Controller of Her Majesty&#039;s Stationery Office (HMSO) within the Cabinet Office is the Queen&#039;s printer of Acts of Parliamentary, and responsible for the publication of Acts of Parliament. HMSO has considered the publication of Acts prior to 1998, which is the earliest date when these were available electronically, but has decided not to do so as many have been heavily amended and to publish them in their original form would be misleading for many users.

Before any decision were taken to proceed with the building of new nuclear power stations there would need to be the fullest public consultation and the publication of a further White Paper setting out our proposals.

 The Air Travel Organisers&#039; Licence (ATOL) regulations use the same definition of package&quot; as the Package Travel Directive and the UK regulations which implement the Directive to define their coverage in respect of package travel organisers. Any tour operator which provides flight-based packages has no choice but to hold an ATOL or to be acting for a disclosed principal which holds an ATOL. If a tour operator were to legally operate outside of the ATOL scheme they would need to alter their products in such a way that they no longer constituted a package. Since the definition in the ATOL Regulations and the Directive is the same, it follows that if a product falls outside of one it will fall outside of the other and the UK would have no obligations under the Directive in respect of that business.

1.Figures are rounded to the nearest 5 and may not sum due to rounding.<br>

2.Figures are taken from the latest available data at 16 April 2005.<br>

3.Figures refer to payment accounts. Claimants with more than one account will be counted for each account and customers with combined payments will only be counted through the paying benefit (i.e. RP with PC). Figures relate only to accounts live and in payment on the specified date.<br>

4.Child benefit is now administered by the Inland Revenue and War Pensions are now administered by MOD. These benefits have therefore been excluded.<br>

<sup>(7)</sup>For the year 2000 the cause of death was defined using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9). The codes used by ONS to define alcohol-related deaths are listed below:<br>

291&#151;Alcoholic psychoses<br>

303&#151;Alcohol dependence syndrome<br>

305.0&#151;Non-dependent abuse of alcohol<br>

425.5&#151;Alcoholic cardiomyopathy<br>

E860&#151;Accidental poisoning by alcohol.<br>

For the years 2001&#150;2004 the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) was used. To maintain comparability with earlier years the following codes were used:<br>

F10&#151;Mental and behavioural disorders due to use of alcohol<br>

142.6&#151;Alcoholic cardiomyopathy<br>

K70&#151;Alcoholic liver disease<br>

K73&#151;Chronic hepatitis, not elsewhere classified<br>

K74&#151;Fibrosis and cirrhosis of liver<br>

X45&#151;Accidental poisoning by and exposure to alcohol.<br>

Deaths were selected using the original underlying cause.<br>

However, technology research in port and airport security dramatically increased post 9/11, and in the last 18 months we established that systems primarily built for this purpose were readily adaptable for identifying drug concealments. Working in partnership with manufacturers we have established a project aimed at purchasing new systems and providing testing opportunities, at border controls to inform further development and enhance workable solutions.

 There are no unfunded pension liabilities of the European Community Institutions. Like almost all member states, the European Union has a funded pension scheme for its civil servants. The pension scheme for civil servants of European Community Institutions is funded partly by the officials themselves, who contribute to one third of the scheme&#039;s financing, with the balance funded by member states through the annual European Community Budget. The Staff Regulation (Council Regulation 723/2004 amending the Staff Regulation) governs the funding of the pension scheme for civil servants of European Community Institutions. The Financial Regulation (Council Regulation 1605/2002) requires the Commission to keep accounting records. In the Commission&#039;s balance sheet, a provision is entered on the liabilities side in respect of the estimated amount of pension rights (the amount is based on an actuarial study); however this is balanced by an entry on the assets side to reflect the undertaking given by member states to the Communities to pay Community pensions.

 Antisocial behaviour orders (ASBOs) are commonly used to tackle general unruly behaviour such as verbal abuse, harassment, graffiti and noise nuisance. However, they have also been used to combat racial harassment, drunk and disorderly behaviour, vehicle crime and prostitution. The wide range of antisocial behaviour that can be tackled by ASBOs illustrates their flexibility.

If their application is refused, they have a right of appeal to the independent asylum and immigration tribunal. If an asylum and human rights claim is refused, and any appeal to the independent asylum and immigration tribunal is unsuccessful, that means that it would be safe for that particular individual to return to Zimbabwe.

<p><a name="st_356"><a name="50704w35.html_spnew5"><b> Andy Burnham: </b> 
 International and UK regulations relating to the safety and efficacy of medicines require the testing of botulinum toxin products at various stages of their processing, from harvesting through to marketing for use as a prescription-only medicine. The European Pharmacopoeia states that the potency of the toxin as a reconstituted product is determined by an LD50 assay in mice, the reference method, or by a method validated with respect to the LD50 assay. Unfortunately there is at present no accepted and validated alternative to the LD50 test for determining the potency of botulinum toxin at the production stage. The Home Office and all others, including the laboratories and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, concerned with conducting and regulating such testing are committed to moving to less severe testing procedures as soon as it becomes practicable to do so. The laboratories involved in ensuring that botulinum toxin products are safe for therapeutic use, the only use for which animal tests are licensed, are already gaining expertise in non-animal methods.

<p><a name="st_357"><a name="50704w35.html_spnew6"><b> Andy Burnham: </b> 
 The mouse LD50 test is used to determine potency, for example, of botulinum neurotoxins used for the medical treatment of patients with certain neurological and other conditions. We pay close attention to technical progress in the field of alternatives and are aware that refined and replacement tests for the LD50 have been developed. Once they have been validated and published in the European Pharmacopoeia as alternatives to the mouse LD50 test, we will stop licensing the mouse LD50 test for this purpose, except where there is specific scientific justification for its continued use.

<p><a name="qnpa_32">(4) for what reasons magic mushrooms have been categorised as a class A drug.  [6226]</p>








<p><a name="st_358"><a name="50704w35.html_spnew7"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 Psilocin, the active ingredient of magic mushrooms, is a class A drug under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971. It is a powerful hallucinogen, placed by the United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances 1971 in schedule 1, the highest level of control. Magic mushrooms are also already controlled as a class A drug under the 1971 Act if they have been prepared (e.g. dried) or are in the form of a product. Section 21 of the Drugs Act 2005 extends the existing classification to such mushrooms whatever form they are in. The Home Office discussed what is now section21 of the Drugs Act with the Department of Health, HM Revenue and Customs, the Crown Prosecution Service and the police. We maintain that it is already unlawful for magic mushrooms to be sold as a product. It has proved difficult to satisfy the courts on what constitutes a product, hence this clarification of the law. Section 21 is not a new control on a new substance and consequently it was not necessary to carry out or commission new research. The Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) was informed of the proposed change to the law on 6 December 2004. On 19 May 2005, the ACMD agreed the need for regulations to make an exception from the offence of possession in certain circumstances. The chair of the ACMD, Professor Sir Michael Rawlins, wrote to me on two June setting out the ACMD&#039;s support for the measures.

We want all schools to enable pupils, parents, families and the wider community to access a core range of services by 2010. The core offer will include schools providing wider community access to ICT, sports, arts and other facilities including adult learning. The prospectus gives some helpful pointers to schools as to how to start developing services, including the need to consult with the wider community to ensure they provide services that meet local needs and demand. Schools can play an important role in supporting their local communities, on key issues such as poverty, community cohesion and neighbourhood regeneration. The prospectus is available on our Teachernet website, together with further guidance, practical advice and case studies. We are adding to this material all the time as work develops.

 My Department uses the following value for money procedures when considering the use of consultants.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50704w40.html_para8">
<a name="stpa_282">Firstly, we undertake a process to establish the mostappropriate way of meeting a requirement. This includes a consideration of the options including using existing staff, fixed term appointments and secondees. Consultants will only be engaged when they can provide:

<p>
<a name="50704w40.html_para9">
<a name="stpa_283">Secondly, if a decision is made to engage a consultant a further process is undertaken to establish the most appropriate way of selection. This may be through <i>(a)</i> a competitive tender, <i>(b)</i> selecting from either the Department&#039;s, Office of Government Commerce&#039;s or another Government Department&#039;s framework agreement, or <i>(c)</i> by single tendering where certain qualifying conditions are met. The conditions for single tendering are where:

<p>
<a name="50704w40.html_para10">
<a name="stpa_284">In all cases proposals from consultants are systematically evaluated on a whole life cost basis with a view to obtaining best value for money using pre-prepared criteria.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50704w40.html_para11">
<a name="stpa_285">As mentioned earlier my Department maintains a list of consultancy framework providers that have been tendered through the Official Journal of the European Union and which meets most of the external consultancy needs of the Department.

<p><a name="st_399"><a name="50704w40.html_spnew4"><b> Maria Eagle: </b> 
 The evaluation of the education maintenance allowance (EMA) was one of the most extensive ever undertaken. It was piloted in 10 areas and 11 control areas and involved following two cohorts of young people over a four year period. The results showed that EMA increased participation in further education among eligible 16-year-olds in the pilot areas by 5.9 percentage points. This is equivalent to 3.8 percentage points across the whole cohort nationally. The impact was highest among groups with previously lowest participation rates, particularly young men, those with moderate or lower attainment at age 16 and those from lower socio-economic groups.

<a name="stpa_286">EMA was rolled out for 16-year-olds in all areas from September 2004 and will be fully rolled out for all 16 to 18-year-olds by 2006/07. The DfES and LSC are carefully monitoring progress and will be undertaking continuing work to assess the effectiveness of EMA. To date, EMA has been paid to a total of 296,000 young people, including 216,000 16-year-olds, which is over 99 per cent. of the numbers projected.

 On 24 March, the Secretary of State wrote to Sir Anthony Greener asking the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority to take forward work on a number of proposals in the 14&#150;19 Education and Skills White Paper. One of these was to consider scope for reducing the coursework burden across all GCSEs, including mathematics, with a view to ensuring that coursework adheres to principles for assessment set out in chapter 9 of the White Paper, summarised in the case of coursework in paragraph 8.12. She asked that the review address in particular: the need for a consistent approach to coursework in similar subjects; fairness; the cumulative burden of coursework; and that coursework should be used to test skills and attributes that cannot be tested by a terminal examination.

 The Department of Health published &#039;Children Missing from Care and Home&#151;a guide to good practice&#039; with its related Circular LAC (2002)17 in November 2002. These were issued under Section 7 of the Local Authority Social Services Act 1970, which means that local authorities are obliged to follow their requirements, unless there are exceptional circumstances. The good practice guide requires that protocols for the management of &#039;missing from care&#039; incidents are drawn up between the local authority and the police, that a senior manager is appointed to monitor these protocols and that there should be regular reports to council members with responsibility for corporate parenting&quot; on patterns of children going missing from care. The Guidance also suggests a similar model of protocols and a named manager for children missing from home.

In spring 2004, the DIS included questions about LA compliance with the Children Missing from Care and Home Guidance. The data on local authorities response to these questions indicated that 96 per cent. of local authorities had appointed a senior manager to monitor &#039;missing from care&#039; incidents and that 88 per cent. of local authorities had protocols in place with the police for managing missing from care incidents.

 Although the great majority of schools are safe and orderly places the Government take the issue of violence very seriously. We have made it clear that head teachers may permanently exclude pupils for violence even when this is a first offence. But it is even more important to help schools create an environment that reduces the risk of violence to an absolute minimum. To achieve that we have:

 Universities are bound by equality and diversity legislation and it is the responsibility of their governing bodies to ensure that non-discriminatory practices are followed. With regard to race relations specifically, governing bodies of universities have a positive duty have due regard to the need to eliminate racism and to promote equality. This duty applies to all functions exercised by governing bodies, including their regulatory function in respect of student unions. There is also the specific duty placed upon governing bodies to have in place a policy for promoting race equality and to monitor its effect. The CRE has prepared guidance for further and higher education institutions on their duties under the race relations legislation. Government&#039;s approach to pay is to enable local flexibility to meet local needs and to encourage a clear link between pay and individual performance. General FE colleges and sixth form colleges are autonomous institutions, and as such they negotiate their own pay and conditions of service with staff and their unions without Government involvement.

<sup>(77)</sup>The figures presented above include qualifications submitted to HESA by a reporting deadline; however this deadline has changed over the years. Details of reporting schedules are given in earlier Statistical First Releases. These changes are not thought to have affected the number of qualifications reported.<br>

<sup>(78)</sup>For 2000/01 and subsequent data collections, the figures exclude qualifications obtained by incoming visiting and exchange students. To enable comparison, there were approximately 500 first degree qualifications obtained by incoming visiting and exchange students not included in the figures presented for 2000/01. Also from 2000/01 dormant students are included in the above figures.<br>

<sup>(79)</sup>The 2003/04 figures above are provisional.<br>

<sup>(80)</sup>In 2002/03 the Joint Academic Subject Classification (JACS) replaced HESACODE as the basis for grouping by subject area. Although JACS and HESACODE look similar and are closely related, they are not by any means identical, and so are not directly comparable. It has accordingly been necessary for 2002/03 onwards to construct subject area definitions afresh in terms of JACS.<br>

The shift of numbers shown between 2001/02 and 2002/03 is largely attributable to the introduction of a new procedure of apportionment for dealing with students, notably those on combined/split programmes, rather than to the changes in the way subjects are classified. It can also be seen that improved reporting practice has led to further reduction in the numbers on combined programmes shown in 2003/04.<br>

In recent months we have seen an increase in car bombs and improvised explosive devices used by the insurgents. These high profile attacks deliberately aim to cause higher numbers of casualties.

South Africa duly acceded to the NPT in July 1991, and its consequent comprehensive safeguards agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) came into force in September 1991. The IAEA subsequently conducted a number of inspections to verify the completeness and correctness of South Africa&#039;s initial report of its inventory of nuclear material. In 1993 South Africa also asked the IAEA to conduct visits to confirm the abandoned status of its former nuclear weapon programme.

 The regulation of all medicines on the United Kingdom market is undertaken by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) on behalf of Health Ministers. The MHRA is an executive agency of the Department. Its primary aim is to protect public health through the control of medicines on the UK market. This is achieved through a licensing and inspection system, which assures medicines conform to agreed standards of quality, safety and efficacy, and further ensures that licensed medicines are manufactured, stored and distributed to maintain these standards.

<a name="stpa_375">In August 2004, two counterfeit products, purporting respectively to be Cialis, an erectile dysfunction treatment, and Reductil, an anti-obesity treatment, were discovered in the legitimate UK supply chain.

Therefore these two discoveries of counterfeit medicines in the small numbers that reached the legitimate UK supply chain, prior to recall, needs to be viewed in that context.

The number of boxes, including part-boxes, of counterfeit Reductil that were returned following the MHRA recall was 61. Each 10mg box of 28 Reductil capsules is valued at &#163;41.29 <sup>1</sup> .

<a name="50704w55.html_para14">
This includes regular liaison with all stakeholders including Her Majesty&#039;s Revenue and Customs (HMRC) and other law enforcement agencies on all manners of pharmaceutical crime.

<a name="stpa_380">Educating patients to identify counterfeit medicines is considered counter-productive in that it could lead to the undermining of public confidence in the UK medicines distribution chain and perfectly safe treatment regimes. Also, potential checks by the public are likely to prove futile as most counterfeit medicines cannot be detected by the untrained eye and even trained personnel often have to rely on forensic laboratory testing to confirm counterfeits.

Notes:<br>

Finished in-year admissions<br>

A finished in-year admission is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one health care provider, excluding admissions beginning before 1 April at the start of the data year. Please note that admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>

Diagnosis (Primary Diagnosis)<br>

The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 14 (7 prior to 2002&#150;03) diagnosis fields in the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data set and provides the main reason why the patient was in hospital.<br>

Main Operation<br>

The main operation is the first recorded operation in the HES data set and is usually the most resource intensive procedure performed during the episode. It is appropriate to use main operation when looking at admission details, eg. time waited, but the figures for all operations count of episodes&quot; give a more complete count of episodes with an operation.<br>

Ungrossed Data<br>

Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).<br>

Time Waited (days)<br>

Time waited statistics from Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) are not the same as the published waiting list statistics. HES provides counts and time waited for all patients admitted to hospital within a given period whereas the published waiting list statistics count those waiting for treatment on a specific date and how long they have been on the waiting list. Also, HES calculates the time waited as the difference between the admission and decision to admit dates. Unlike published waiting list statistics, this is not adjusted for self-deferrals or periods of medical/social suspension.<br>

Following the publication in February 2004 of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence&#039;s (NICE) clinical guideline on the assessment and treatment for people with fertility problems, we advised all primary care trusts to offer a minimum of one cycle of IVF by April 2005 to those who meet the clinical criteria, giving priority to couples with no children living with them, and to make progress to full implementation of the guideline in the longer term. The primary responsibility for the implementation of NICE guidelines rests with the NHS at local level and compliance with NICE guidance by NHS organisations will be considered by the Healthcare Commission during their review and performance assessment processes.

<p><a name="qn_545"><a name="50704w60.html_wqn1"><b> Annette Brooke: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Health what the forecast financial benefit to the NHS is of the contract with Patientline in the financial year ended March 2005.  [8561]</p>








<p><a name="st_543"><a name="50704w60.html_spnew1"><b> Jane Kennedy: </b> 
 The national health service does not benefit financially by entering into contracts with Patientline for the provision of television (TV) and telephone services at the patient&#039;s bedside. Patientline is responsible for the cost of installing and maintaining the systems. Patients are charged directly for the services used. The provision of bedside TVs and telephones gives patients more control over their environment whilst in hospital, including the ability to watch a personal TV and remain in direct contact with relatives and friends.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health how many <i>(a)</i> psychotherapist and <i>(b)</i> psychodynamic counsellors are available to prisoners; what steps are being taken to increase the number available to prisoners; and if she will make a statement.  [8101]</p>








<p><a name="st_544"><a name="50704w60.html_spnew2"><b> Ms Rosie Winterton: </b> 
 Information about the numbers of psychotherapists and psychodynamic counsellors available to prisoners is not collected centrally. Decisions about mental health services at individual prisons and the skill mixes necessary to deliver them are matters for the establishments concerned and their national health service partners. The commitment in the NHS plan (July 2000) that, by April 2004, some 300 additional staff would be employed on the delivery of such services has been met.

<p><a name="st_546"><a name="50704w60.html_spnew4"><b> Jane Kennedy: </b> 
 On 6 December 2004, a letter was sent to all health professionals in the United Kingdom from the Chairman of the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) announcing the results of the review of the safety of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) conducted by an expert working group of the CSM and providing prescribing advice for all SSRIs. A copy of the review is available in the Library.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50704w60.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_411">On the same day, the then National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE), now the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, published guidelines on the management of depression in primary care. These guidelines state that antidepressants are not recommended for the initial treatment of mild depression because the risk-benefit ratio is poor.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50704w60.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_412">The expert working group of the CSM carefully considered the available data on a possible link between SSRIs and suicidal behaviour from published and unpublished trials, spontaneous reporting data from health professionals and patients, evidence from key stakeholders and data from the general practice research database (GPRD).
</p>


<p>
<a name="50704w60.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_413">The expert working group concluded that from the available clinical trial data, a modest increase in the risk of suicidal thoughts and self-harm compared to placebo can not be ruled out. However, there is insufficient evidence to conclude that there is any marked difference between members of the class of SSRIs, or between SSRIs and other antidepressants, with respect to their influence on suicidal behaviour.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50704w60.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_414">Evidence from non-experimental studies based on the GPRD indicated that there is no increased risk of suicidal behaviour with SSRIs compared with tricyclic antidepressants. One of the GPRD studies was commissioned by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health if she will take steps to ensure that every <i>(a)</i> sexual health clinic and <i>(b)</i> accident and emergency department offers post-exposure prophylaxis to its users.  [7759]</p>








<p><a name="st_547"><a name="50704w60.html_spnew5"><b> Caroline Flint: </b> 
 Primary care trusts are responsible for providing sexual health services, which meet the needs of their local populations. To support them in this role, the Department has worked with leading professional bodies to produce the recommended standards for national health service HIV services (2003). These highlight the need to make post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) available to those who need it.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50704w60.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_415">The decision on whether to offer PEP for the purposes of preventing HIV transmission should be taken by clinicians in consultation with the patient, and will depend upon the particular circumstances. The British Association for Sexual Health and HIV, and the Government&#039;s expert advisory group on AIDS (EAGA) have both published guidance to help clinicians and EAGA keep the evidence on the effectiveness of PEP under review.

The Department has also funded the Terrence Higgins Trust to undertake a campaign to raise awareness of PEPamong those at risk of non-occupational HIV transmission. Following a successful evaluation, this campaign will be rolled-out across the country.
