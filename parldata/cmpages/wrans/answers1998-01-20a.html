<P>
<P>
<a name="80120w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Hancock: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions how much untreated sewage was disposed of on or in agricultural land in each year since 1991; and what assessment he has made of the impact of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 on these figures. [22865]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80120w01.html_spnew4"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 Sewage may be spread on agricultural land under the terms of a waste management licence issued by the Environment Agency under Part II of the Environmental Protection Act 1990. The objective of the licensing system is to ensure that waste is recovered or disposed of in ways which protect the environment and human health.
<P>

<a name="80120w01.html_para0">The Environment Agency does not maintain a central record that distinguishes the licensed spreading of sewage from the licensed spreading of other wastes. It is not possible, therefore, to make an assessment of the impact of the 1990 Act on the quantities of sewage which are spread. However, the Department and the Environment Agency have commissioned the Water Research Council and the Agricultural Development and Advisory Service (ADAS) to develop further the criteria that determine the circumstances in which the spreading of wastes is of benefit to agriculture. The research project is expected to be completed by the end of March 1998.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Parliamentary Under Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your recent question as to what guidelines exist for local authorities for the gritting of roads in the event of sub-zero temperatures.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Highways Agency are responsible for motorways and all-purpose trunk roads in England. For these roads, the Agency provides a winter maintenance service which assists the safe movement of traffic and keeps to a minimum delays and accidents caused by adverse weather conditions.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>An extensive network of sensors placed in the roads measure road temperatures, moisture and salt content, wind speeds and precipitation. These together with weather forecasting services assist Maintenance Agents to carry out preventative treatment before road conditions become hazardous. They do not use grit for this treatment but use rock salt or, in special cases, deicing chemicals.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Highways Agency's Maintenance Agents, including Local Authorities, undertake the operational maintenance of the winter maintenance service in accordance with guidelines set out in Volume 2 Part 3 of a document titled. The Trunk Road Maintenance

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>For the roads for which Local Authorities are responsible, they define their own treatments. Many use the guidelines of the County Surveyors Society or adapt them to their own circumstances and needs. Most Local Authorities also publish their own winter maintenance plans which define roads to be treated, together with treatment times and priorities.</FONT></UL>

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions how many written representations his Department has received from <i>(a)</i> organisations and <i>(b)</i> members of the public about the Polegate Bypass in the last three months. [22996]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80120w01.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 We have received a considerable number of representations about the Polegate Bypass. We are unable to give a breakdown covering the last three months; however, since the start of the Roads Review consultation exercise in July 1997, we have received 96 representations from organisations and businesses, and 2,689 from members of the public, of which 699 were letters; 1,768 were local press campaign coupons; and 222 were in the form of petitions.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what action he is taking to simplify the rules governing the purchase of freeholds by leaseholders; and what plans he has to introduce a new commonhold form of tenure. [23327]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80120w01.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Armstrong: </B> 
 We are committed to simplifying the rules governing the purchase of freeholds by leaseholders and we intend to bring forward a new package of reforms to assist leaseholders. We are currently considering the scope and practicability of possible new measures. We expect to make an announcement about our proposals and invite comments from interested parties in the Spring.
<P>

<a name="80120w01.html_para2">The introduction of Commonhold is a matter for the Lord Chancellor. However, I understand that his Department are currently considering the best way to handle the various proposals which have been made about commonhold schemes in the recent past.

<P>
<a name="80120w02.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Leslie: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions, pursuant to his answer of 16 June 1997, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>36</i>, what progress has been made by the Drinking Water Inspectorate in considering prosecution in the alleged cryptosporidium incident at Bingley in June 1993; and if he will make a statement. [23475]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80120w02.html_spnew0"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 The Drinking Water Inspectorate has completed its investigation of this incident involving an outbreak of cryptosporidiois. On 14 January 1998, it wrote to Yorkshire Water Services Limited informing the Company of its conclusions and recommendations arising from the incident. A copy of this letter has been sent to the health authority, local authority and the Yorkshire Customer Service Committee. I have arranged for a copy of the letter to be sent to the hon. Member and for copies to be placed in the library of the House.
<P>

<a name="80120w02.html_para0">The main conclusions of the Inspectorate were that:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(i) the epidemiological study carried out by the Bradford Health Authority provided strong grounds for suspecting that water unfit for human consumption was supplied;
<P>
<BR>
(ii) the Company would not have had a defence of due diligence due to deficiencies in the management of the catchment and the operation of Gilstead Water Treatment Works; and
<P>
<BR>
(iii) in view of the decision by the Judge in the prosecution of South West Water about an incident involving an outbreak of cryptosporidiosis in Torbay, not to admit as evidence the report of the epidemiological study, a prosecution cannot be mounted against the Company under Section 70 of the Water Industry Act 1991.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="80120w02.html_para1">The Inspectorate's investigations uncovered some serious deficiencies in the Company's operations. Although Gilstead Water Treatment Works has since been closed, the Inspectorate considers it vital that the 



<P>
<P><I>20 Jan 1998 : Column: 454</I><P>
Company demonstrates that it has improved its operational procedures and performance in order to protect public health and therefore it has asked for an urgent reply from the Company to its recommendations.
<P>

<a name="80120w02.html_para2">In the light of the judgment in the Torbay case and the Inspectorate's conclusions on this incident, I have asked the Inspectorate to advise on what steps, including changes to the legislation, can be taken to secure successful prosecution when it is believed that water unfit for human consumption has been supplied.

He is best placed to make such a decision on account of his knowledge of the ship and its area of operation, his experience and professional judgement, and in the exercise of his responsibilities. The importance of the master's discretion for safe navigation has been recognised in recent amendments to the SOLAS Convention, prompted by the ESTONIA disaster. These require that the master is not constrained by commercial pressures from shipowners and charters from taking decisions necessary for the safe navigation of his ship.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>New regulations require that all limitations on the operation of the ship are readily available to the master on board the ship.

The introduction of a new survey form in June 1995 changed the way in which staff are recorded so that where an employee is doing two or more jobs in an authority, each job is counted separately. As a result, figures for 1995 and later years are on a different basis from previous years.<P>

 To meet concerns raised by owners of classic car owners about supplies of leaded petrol from 1 January 2000, when the proposed EU ban comes into effect, the Government have negotiated a derogation to allow continued supply to a limit of 0.5 per cent. of total petrol sales to be distributed through "specialist interest groups". For widespread use of many older, non-classic, cars whose owners currently use leaded petrol, the British Standards Institution are consulting on a specification for unleaded petrol containing a non-toxic lead replacement additive.

<a name="80120w04.html_para0">The Circular also brings local planning authority's attention to new Regulations, the Town and Country Planning (Amendment) Regulations 1997(SI 1997/3006).

<P>
<P>
<a name="80120w07.html_spnew8"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 The higher rate of insurance premium tax, set at the same rate as the standard rate of VAT, has prevented the tax loss (and distortion of trade) previously suffered where suppliers of taxable goods and services switched margins into ancillary sales of VAT exempt insurance. To return to a single, low rate of insurance premium tax would re-open this tax loophole and there are therefore no plans to go down this path. However, the impact of this tax measure is being kept under review.

<P>
<a name="80120w07.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 Signature of the Memoranda of Understanding (MOU) on 22 December 1997 committed the UK and its collaborative partners to the Production Investment (PI), Production and Support phases of the Eurofighter programme. We estimate the cost to the UK of PI/Production and initial support will be approximately &#163;11.5 billion (at 1997 prices) which is some 72 per cent. of the total procurement cost. Contractual negotiations are currently being finalised with the aim of signing the relevant contracts in the coming weeks. Expenditure will occur during the period 1998 to 2014 when the last aircraft is scheduled to be delivered to the Royal Air Force. Aircraft will be ordered in three tranches and, with a few exceptions, the underlying funding principle is that each nation will pay for the work carried out in its own country. The extent of expenditure which will be subject

<P><I>20 Jan 1998 : Column: 473</I><P>
to exchange rate variation, therefore, will be relatively small. The Unit Production Cost of each aircraft is some &#163;40.2 million at 1997 prices.

 The Department obtains advice on the health implications of exposure to electromagnetic fields from the National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB) and other sources including its own funded research. The primary focus of concern has been on power lines and childhood cancer where the results have not shown a proven link. The NRPB's Advisory Group on Non-ionising Radiation conducted an extensive review of the subject in 1992 and concluded that there was no firm evidence of a carcinogenic hazard from exposure that might be associated with residence near major sources of

A supplementary report in 1994 was published by the NRPB to take into account the results of epidemiological studies from Scandinavia, France and Canada.

 No, and no such consideration has ever been given. There has been a great deal of misinformation circulating about matters relating to the new firearms legislation and its implementation. The operation of the Compensation Scheme has always been transparent, with the terms of the Scheme itself having been subject to Parliamentary scrutiny and regular and bona fide reports on payments progress issued to the public on request and to Parliament through answers to Parliamentary Questions and letters to MPs.

 It is for individual chief officers of police to assess the risks for their administrative and operational functions of the Year 2000 problem. They are currently assessing the scale of the problem and taking action where appropriate, with the help of the Police Information Technology Organisation. Police forces are also pursuing Year 2000 compliance with the other bodies responsible for systems whose failure might have policing implications. If, during their audit of information technology systems, a force establishes that there is a problem which cannot be, or is unlikely to be, resolved before the millennium it will be expected to establish contingency plans to ensure the continued delivery of policing services.

 No. The courts have ruled that investigating officers' reports, which are submitted to the Police Complaints Authority (PCA) and the appropriate disciplinary authority, are covered as a class by public interest immunity. The completed report will be sent to the Coroner for the purposes of the inquest and to the Crown Prosecution Service to consider whether there are grounds for criminal proceedings against any person. The PCA will also consider the report to decide whether any disciplinary action should be taken.

 <i>[holding answer 16 January 1998]:</i> New prisons must be located conveniently for the centres of population or regional catchment areas that they will be required to serve.

 <i>[holding answer 19 Janaury 1998]:</i> The provision of health care in prisons is governed by published standards. There is no national charter although some prisons have locally produced charters.
<P>

<a name="80120w19.html_para1">The Prison Service and the National Health Service (NHS) have established a joint working group to advise Ministers on the options for the future organisation of prison health care with a view to achieving standards and practices comparable to those in the NHS. The issue of a patient's charter for prisoners will be among the options the group will be considering.

 Victims are urged to report crimes to the police. In respect of crimes not reported by the victim, the decision on whether to commence, or consider commencing, an investigation into the alleged criminal offence is an operational matter for the chief officer in whose force area such a breach of the law is alleged to have been committed.

 In November 1945, the Director General of the Security Service ordered a review of the Service's records to identify which could be summarised or destroyed. He set down the following principles to guide officers in the review process:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"(a) There is a paramount necessity to restrict the records of the Service to matters which are now its proper concern. Superfluous information impedes work rather than assists it. The test is whether or not the matter recorded would have any value if brought forward at a later date and if considered in a different context.
<P>
<BR>
(b) In reviewing papers for destruction, due regard should also be given to the necessity for preserving information of historical interest, and also that which may be of value in a future emergency as showing how matters of policy and principle were decided. This applies also to methods of inquiry adopted in specific cases or classes of cases. The possible interest of Divisions and Sections not primarily concerned with a particular file must always be borne in mind".

<P>

<P>
<a name="80120w20.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 Statistics of recorded crime are based on rules for classification and counting which are standard for all police forces in England and Wales. A comprehensive set of counting rules is issued centrally and used by police forces to maintain the consistency of recording some of the more complex and potentially difficult offences, such as multiple, continuous and repeated offences.
<P>

<a name="80120w20.html_para0">Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) regularly look into recording practices during force inspections. The Home Office also has a police statistics liaison officer who regularly visits statistics officers in the forces to discuss current issues and to monitor current procedures.
<P>

<a name="80120w20.html_para1">Periodically, the Home Office rules and police recording practices are reviewed to ensure consistency and to determine whether updates are necessary. Recently, both HMIC and a joint Home Office/Association of Chief Police Officers working party have undertaken such reviews. Their recommendations are being adopted in a package of measures for implementation on 1 April 1998, which were announced by my right hon. Friend on 1 October 1997. More detail was given by the Home Office's Director of Research and Statistics on 14 October.
<P>

<a name="80120w20.html_para2">The main measures comprise the logical extension of the coverage of recorded crimes (or notifiable offences) to include all indictable and triable either way offences: the revision of the counting rules for certain offences; to move closer to the concept of one crime per victim; a move to financial year publication; and less emphasis in publications on the overall total of recorded crime in favour of individual offence groups.

 <i>[holding answer 19 January 1998]:</i> The management structure and retention of records have changed significantly over the past seven financial years and it is not possible to provide, without incurring disproportionate cost, the budget allocations prior to 1990-91. Table A details the allocations made to Lewes prison between 1990-91 and 1997-98.
<P>

<a name="80120w20.html_para4">The figures reflect the closure of wings for refurbishment in 1991-92 until the reopening of C and G wings in March 1997. The other critical factor affecting budget allocations is the increasing devolvement of cash allocations for operational requirements to local level from 1992-93 onwards. In view of this, it is difficult to draw comparisons between the different financial years.

 <i>[holding answer 19 January 1998]:</i> The budget allocation of 1998-99 has not yet been decided for Lewes. The Governor was given an indicative budget allocation of &#163;8,631,000 and &#163;8,470,000 for 1998-99 and 1999-2000 in June last year and has made plans to operate the prison within this cash limit. He has also bid for additional funds to preserve some regime services. The outcome of these bids will be known later this month.
<P>

<a name="80120w20.html_para8">The Operational Capacity for Lewes prison is 496 and the Governor has based his planning assumptions on a 98 per cent. occupancy, a daily average population of 486 prisoners.

<a name="80120w21.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Willis: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department (1) if he will repeal those sections of the Local Government Act 1992 which prevent the publication of internal discipline investigations by individual police forces; [23412]
<P>
<UL>(2) what plans he has to make public reports relating to investigations into the sexual harassment of women police officers at Harrogate Police Station in the early 1990s; [23362]
<P>
(3) what plans he has to introduce legislation to ensure that internal police disciplinary investigations are not automatically subject to public interest immunity; [23364]
<P>
(4) what plans he has to allow individual police authorities to decide whether to publish the finding of internal discipline investigations within individual police forces. [23363]
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80120w21.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 None of the information relating to internal police investigations is held by my right hon. Friend and its disclosure is therefore a matter not for him but for the police authority or the chief constable.
<P>

<a name="80120w21.html_para0">Public interest immunity arises only in the context of court proceedings. It does not arise as of right but requires there to be both a risk of harm if disclosure did take place and a balance between the risk of harm and the interests of justice. So far, the courts have accepted that the risk of harm in disclosing public investigation reports justifies their non-disclosure but the matter has to be considered in the context of each case.
<P>

<a name="80120w21.html_para1">The publication of information under the Local Government Act 1992 relates to information on standards of performance. The Local Government Act 1972 gives the public a right to certain information, including information about meetings held by the police authority. It is not a free standing right to inspect documents held by the authority. Where information does fall to be disclosed under the 1972 Act, there are exemptions which prevent disclosure about certain matters which includes information about particular employees/office holders.
<P>

<a name="80120w21.html_para2">The Government are considering extending the range of information available to the public. Their proposals were set out in the White Paper "Your Right to Know" which was issued for consultation on 11 December 1997.
