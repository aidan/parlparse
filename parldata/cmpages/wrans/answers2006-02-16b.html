 The Legislative and Regulatory Reform Bill will enable the reform of legislation&#151;including both public general Acts and local Acts&#151;by order. It will also enable reform of the common law by order but only where this is for the purpose of implementing a recommendation of one of the UK Law Commissions. The power to make such orders is subject to a number of conditions, including that the provision made by the order does not remove any necessary protection and does not prevent any person from continuing to exercise any right or freedom he might reasonably expect to continue exercising. Orders are also subject to procedural safeguards including public consultation and scrutiny and veto by parliamentary committees. The Government currently have no plans to reform the legislation which may affect the right of freemining, or to reform any rights of common which might exist in the Forest of Dean.

 Under section 5 of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 (the FoI Act), external organisations operating public services on behalf of local authorities can be brought within the FoI Act.

<p><a name="st_11"><a name="60216w02.html_spnew0"><b> Bridget Prentice: </b> 
 Part 2 of the Compensation Bill provides the legislative base for introducing statutory regulation of claims management services. The primary aim is to regulate the activities of commercial claims management companies in certain sectors, to tackle bad practices and improve consumer safeguards. Where trades unions provide claims management services within a regulated sector, for example personal injury, they would be subject to regulation unless explicitly exempted&#151;achieved by secondary legislation. The Government have indicated the intention to exempt trade unions, subject to the views of both Houses during the Bill&#039;s passage. We will take full account of concerns and other comments made in coming to a final decision on this issue.

<sup>(1)</sup> These figures have been rounded to the nearest 10,000.<br>

<sup>(2)</sup> Forecast.<br>





Notes:<br>

1. Other collection items&quot; include manuscripts, music scores, maps, newspapers, patents, sound recordings, theses and print and drawings.<br>

2. Figures include both revenue and capital expenditure on acquisitions. Acquisitions expenditure arising from donations for purchase of major items is excluded due to its distorting effect on the figures.<br>

3. In 1998&#150;99 budgetary pressures meant the library had to undertake a large programme of journal cancellations and stop buying books that were regarded of low-use or lesser research significance.<br>

4. In 1999&#150;2000 the library was able to allocate more resources to acquisitions due to increased funding.<br>

5. Expenditure on stamps was zero because the library acquires philatelic material by donation, bequest, transfer from other organisations or by loan.<br>

6. A breakdown of expenditure in 1996&#150;97 has not been provided because the information is only held in paper records which, if retrieved, would be unlikely to give the details requested. The total acquisitions expenditure for 1996&#150;97 (excepting donations, as explained in note 2) is &#163;13.7 million.<br>

 The home condition report in the home information pack should be not more than three months old when the home is first put on the market.

<a name="stpa_87">Under the set-aside system that was in place until 2004&#150;05, local authorities were required to set aside a proportion of their income to repay debt. So levels of housing debt (nationally) fell, leading to a fall in support required for support of that debt.

 CORE (Continuous Recording of lettings) is a system for monitoring the letting of social rented housing which has been in operation by housing associations for the last 15 years. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is currently in the process of extending CORE to include lettings by local authorities. Participation by local authorities is voluntary although it is hoped that all will do so. Of the 220 local authorities which own social housing stock 86 (39 per cent.) are already submitting CORE data and an additional 105 (48 per cent.) are planning to start by 1 April 2006. The remaining 29 (13 per cent.) have not yet committed to a start date.

 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister does not hold this information centrally, and could provide it only at disproportionate cost. Local authorities are not required to spend their major repairs allowance (MRA) in year.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what her assessment is of the most cost-effective way to mitigate the projected climate change set out in the document Avoiding Dangerous Climate Change, published by her Department on 30 January.  [50224]</p>




<p><a name="st_224"><a name="60216w22.html_spnew9"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 The most effective way to mitigate the effects of climate change described in Avoiding Dangerous Climate Change is by a response as broadly based as possible. This needs to involve adaptation as well as emissions reduction. Emissions reduction should address all anthropogenic greenhouse gases and all economic sectors, including reduction of emissions from deforestation, and there should be enhancement of the uptake and storage of carbon by forests and soils. It will be most cost effective if action to limit and reduce emissions extends to the greatest possible number of countries, consistent with the principle of common but differentiated responsibility set out in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol. The framework provided by the Convention and the Protocol will facilitate function of market mechanisms which promote cost effectiveness.

 There has been some confusion between seasonal flu, avian flu and pandemic flu. Avian influenza is a disease which mainly affects birds.

<sup>(27)</sup> Between January 2001 and September 2002 data are for GDS dentists only. From October 2002 onwards the data are for GDS and PDS dentists.<br>

Notes:<br>

1. Table 2 indicates monthly additions and deletions to registrations within Essex SHA. However it is not possible to say if they are new registrations.<br>

2. Some of the patients being added to the list will be patients regarded as old patients by dentists (or the patients) who are being re-registered after a gap of more than 15 months (GDS).<br>





3. A yearly breakdown for table 2 is not possible as this may include duplications in registrations added and registrations deleted. This data should only be used as a monthly snapshot.<br>

4. Most PDS schemes that have registrations have re-registration periods in excess of fifteen months, so the figures for PDS schemes are generally higher than they would have been for the same attendance pattern under GDS.<br>

 From April 2006, a new system of patient charges will be introduced, based on the recommendations of a working group comprising of representatives of the dental profession, consumer organisations and other stakeholders. It will be a simpler system with three charging bands for overall courses of treatment, as opposed to the current system of over 400 separate charges for individual items of treatment. The maximum charge for dental treatments will fall from &#163;384 to &#163;189.

<p>
<a name="60216w29.html_para15">
<a name="stpa_222">The cost to an individual patient for a given course of treatment will in some cases be more than now, and in other cases less. The overall level of charges raised will however, be the same proportion of dental expenditure as has historically been the case.

<p>
<a name="60216w29.html_para16">
<a name="stpa_223">The working group, on whose recommendations the system is based, expressed a concern that the current system, based on over 400 charges ranging up to &#163;384, may deter some people from seeking treatment because of confusion as to what that might have to pay. Part of their reason for recommending a simple, three-band system was to prevent this confusion in future.

 The national health service dental reforms being implemented from April 2006 are not designed to release financial savings.

 Local health communities are expected to review their existing practice in the treatment and management of various mental health problems against the guidelines published by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence.

As announced in the recent White Paper, &#039;Our health, our care, our say: a new direction for community services&#039;, the Government are committed to expand access to psychological therapies. To this end, two demonstration sites are being established for people of working age with mild to moderate mental health problems with the aim of helping them to remain in or return to work.

 Responsibility for prescribing rests with the clinician caring for the patient.

Local clinical audit and peer review provide an incentive for clinicians to study their patterns of care and improve prescribing standards.

Notes:<br>

1. Funding is the sum of net parliamentary funding and income from the Department. Funding from other Government Departments cannot be separately identified.<br>

2. Primary care trusts were not fully established until 2003&#150;04. In earlier years health authorities continued to receive funding and be responsible for the commissioning of health care services, with devolution to primary care trusts occurring at different rates, hence figures cannot be directly compared.<br>

3. Funding allocations to primary care trusts are based largely on weighted populations so direct comparisons are not necessarily appropriate.<br>

<p><a name="st_364"><a name="60216w36.html_spnew1"><b> Hazel Blears  </b> 
<i>[holding answer 9 February 2006]:</i> We have already provided guidance and support to local agencies helping them to target resources and powers to protect the public and ensure that antisocial behaviour is tackled, not tolerated. The Respect programme will now take this further so that local services are organised so that they respond swiftly and effectively to the problems that communities face today.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60216w36.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_271">People need to see and feel that a difference can be made. For example, along with the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister we are developing a single non-emergency number to provide the public direct access, via a new three digit number to community safety advice, information and action to tackle antisocial behaviour. We are also committed to ensuring that every area will be benefiting from neighbourhood policing by 2008. Local people will know who their police officers are and how to contact them and neighbourhood policing teams will tackle antisocial behaviour as a priority when local communities identify this as one of their key concerns.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60216w36.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_272">We also aim to improve accountability between service providers and the public by giving more power to local communities. The Police and Justice Bill, contains provisions for the Community Call for Action. This is a way for local communities to demand a response from agencies to persistent local community safety or antisocial behaviour problems, via an approach to their ward councillor.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make it his policy that cautions should not be used to deal with offences where reoffending is likely; and if he will make a statement.  [51733]</p>




<p><a name="st_381"><a name="60216w37.html_spnew8"><b> Hazel Blears: </b> 
 Guidance on the cautioning of adult offenders is contained in the Cautioning of Adult Offenders Circular 30/2005 issued by the Office for Criminal Justice Reform. Cautions are a non-statutory disposal. One of their main aims, as stated in the circular, is to reduce the likelihood of re-offending.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60216w37.html_para19">
<a name="stpa_294">The circular makes clear that a caution can be used for cases involving first-time, low level offences when to do so would meet the public interest. It is not possible to set out definitive rules on the circumstances in which cautions are appropriate, because their use involves the exercise of discretion by the police who have to take into account a number of considerations in each case. These 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>16 Feb 2006 : Column 2332W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
considerations include whether a caution is appropriate to the offence and the offender and whether it is likely to be effective in the circumstances.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60216w37.html_para20">
<a name="stpa_295">The circular advises that both national and any locally held records must be checked before a caution is given, to ensure that the suspect&#039;s criminal record is known and up-to-date and to avoid inappropriate use. If the suspect has previously received a caution, then a further caution should not normally be considered. However, if there has been a sufficient lapse of time to suggest that a previous caution has had a significant deterrent effect (two years or more), then a caution can be used. A caution can also still be administered if the subsequent offence is trivial or unrelated. If the suspect has previously, when aged 17 or under, received a reprimand or final warning, a period of two years should also be allowed to elapse before administering a caution.

<p><a name="st_394"><a name="60216w39.html_spnew3"><b> Fiona Mactaggart  </b> 
<i>[holding answer 9 February 2006]:</i> Information on reconviction rates for offenders entering drug residential rehabilitation places are not routinely available. Information on re-offending is published annually to help monitor the Home Office&#039;s progress against its PSA target to reduce re-offending by 5 per cent. by 2006. The most recent data were published in December in &#039;Adult re-offending: results from the 2002 cohort&#039;. Home Office Statistical Bulletin 25/05&#039;. This is available on the Home Office&#039;s website: http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/hosbpubs1.html. For offenders convicted of drug offences in the first quarter of 2002, the two year re-offending rate was 35.9 per cent. for those offenders convicted of drug import and supply offences and 53.8 per cent. for those convicted of drugs possession and small scale supply offences. Further analysis of this data shows that the two year re-offending rate for those convicted of drug offences and given DTTOs was 78.1 per cent. and for all other disposals it was 48.1 per cent. Re-offending rates should be used with caution as a number of different factors can influence them. Re-offending rates can be adjusted to take account of the changing characteristics of offenders and these adjusted rates are published annually on the Home Office&#039;s website. The latest predicted rates show a reduction in re-offending of 0.2 per cent. to 58.5 per cent. for all adults against the 2000 baseline.

<sup>(42)</sup> Data is collected by the Home Office on a quarterly basis.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what criteria are used for assessing the transfer of operation of prisons from the public to private sector.  [51558]</p>

<i>[holding answer 16 February 2006]:</i> The transfer of operational management of a prison from the public sector to the private sector, or vice versa, would normally occur under the terms of a market test. Under a market test of an existing establishment, an invitation to tender (ITT) is issued to potential bidders from all sectors, including the incumbent management.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60216w42.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_316">The ITT contains the criteria against which tenders will be evaluated. The criteria for the evaluation of compliant bids for past market tests of prison management have been financial and operational deliverability and the consequent demonstration of comparative value for money.

<a name="stpa_329">DFID leads the British Government&#039;s efforts to develop alternative livelihoods to opium production in Afghanistan. In financial year 2005&#150;06, we are spending over &#163;45 million for this purpose. This is an almost tenfold increase on the amount spent in 2003&#150;04. In financial year 2006&#150;07 spending is expected to continue at similar levels. A proportion of this funding will continue to be specifically targeted on improving agricultural opportunities for Afghan farmers. This includes research to help identify, test and implement new crops and technologies. Examples include improvements in health and husbandry for livestock, apricot drying, honey bee keeping, and the introduction of fruit tree nurseries and greenhouses for vegetable production. DFID has also jointly funded with United States Agency for International Development a $25 million nationwide programme to increase access to seeds and fertiliser for over 500,000 farmers for alternative crops.

<a name="60216w44.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_330">At the same time as developing agricultural opportunities, DFID is also promoting the development of non-farm alternative livelihoods by supporting national programmes of the Government of Afghanistan which are helping to increase access to credit and improve infrastructure for farmers to transport their produce to markets.

 DFID has not yet carried out an assessment of the effectiveness of the Counter-Narcotics Trust Fund (CNTF). It is too early to do so, as the CNTF was launched at the end of October 2005. The Government are putting together CNTF spending proposals for its 2006&#150;07 budget, which is expected to be passed in March 2006. There will be regular monitoring and reporting on the performance of the CNTF by UNDP and a Steering Committee of Government and donor representatives. DFID will undertake an annual review in early 2007 for its &#163;20 million three-year commitment.

<p><a name="st_453"><a name="60216w46.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Thomas: </b> 
 There is very little reliable data on progress towards achieving the millennium development goals (MDGs) in Yemen. Much of the data which comes from surveys is now very old and new more reliable data is not expected until late 2006 at the earliest. The data which does exist shows that Yemen is unlikely to meet most of the MDGs. Poverty has probably doubled during the 1990s and the population has increased by about 3 per cent. a year over the same period. Child malnutrition figures are particularly worrying. Progress in reducing infant and child mortality has been much slower than required to meet the target. Access to health services is very limited in many parts of the country. Two surveys on maternal deaths conducted in 1997 and 2003 show no improvement over this period (the risk of pregnancy-related death is one in 19 women). HIV/AIDS appears to be spreading. TB remains highly prevalent although incidence is falling. In the 1990s malaria became more widespread, with epidemics in 1996 and 1998. Yemen is confronting a severe environmental crisis with rapidly depleting water reserves that will leave the capital city, Sana&#039;a without water within a generation. Some progress has been made in increasing the proportion of the population with access to improved sanitation, but not at a rate rapid enough to meet the MDG target.

<a name="60216w46.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_364">There has been a rapid increase in enrolment in primary school, particularly enrolment of children in the designated age groups, but this has been from a very low base. If the current rate of progress is maintained, the goal of universal primary education by 2015 could be attained. The rapid expansion of primary, and to some degree secondary enrolment has particularly favoured girls, and if the rate of change continues, this goal could possibly be met by 2015. Other indicators of gender equality however, do not indicate progress.

<p><a name="st_460"><a name="60216w46.html_spnew8"><b> Mr. Thomas: </b> 
 The first case of polio in Yemen since 1996 occurred on 25 February 2005. As of 1 February 2006, 478 cases had been confirmed (source World Health Organisation (WHO)). The Government of Yemen completed a mass information campaign in April and eight nationwide immunisation campaigns have taken place since the outbreak last year. This strategy appears to be having results: the last new case was reported on 17 November 2005. Independent monitors now show that immunisation coverage overall is at 97.2 per cent. and the outbreak is coming under control.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60216w46.html_para9">
<a name="stpa_371">DFID provided &#163;250,000 to a UNICEF polio vaccination campaign in 2003&#150;04. We did not provide bilateral funding in response to the polio outbreak in February 2005 because of the need to focus our programme on relatively few areas in order to have impact, and because other donors were better positioned to assist. However, DFID provides funding multilaterally for polio eradication via the WHO-led Global Polio Eradication Initiative (PEI). DFID contributed &#163;34 million for the PEI in 2005&#150;06, which 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>16 Feb 2006 : Column 2378W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
helped close its funding gap for 2005 and ensured that all immunisation activities could go ahead in 2005. In addition DFID announced a further &#163;40 million for 2006 to 2008 to eradicate polio in 2006 and ensure the world stays polio free thereafter. The funds we provide for the PEI are not earmarked, allowing the PEI to allocate resources according to their assessment of priority needs. The PEI provided at &#163;7.6 million for polio eradication activities in Yemen in 2005.

 Corruption is a serious problem in Yemen. It holds back development and particularly harms the poor. The key to tackling corruption in Yemen is securing transparent and accountable public finances. DFID is helping the Government of Yemen develop its action plan for public financial management reform. This will include ways to improve control and accountability of public finances and develop a more transparent system for procuring goods and services with public funds. DFID has committed &#163;200,000 for the development of the plan and is considering funding its implementation together with other donors.

 The Government launched the Energy Review last November. As part of the Energy Review, in January the Government published a consultation document Our Energy Challenge: securing clean, affordable energy for the long term&quot;. The consultation has a broad scope and considers all aspects of the energy system including energy supply and demand. The Review is looking at what further measures might be needed to tackle climate change, and to ensure secure and affordable energy supplies in the UK beyond 2010.

 To date, this Government have committed some &#163;2.35 billion of investment in the post office network. This includes &#163;480 million for the Horizon IT project to automate the network, &#163;450 million to support the rural network for the three years 2003&#150;06 and, subject to state aid clearance, &#163;300 million to support the rural network for the 2 years 2006&#150;08, &#163;726 million to repay historic debt and &#163;210 million to fund the urban reinvention programme. Under Post Office Ltd.&#039;s urban reinvention programme, 2,475 sub post offices closed on a wholly voluntary basis thereby strengthening the viability of the remaining urban network while ensuring that at the end of the programme over 99 per cent. of the urban population nationally still lives within one mile of their nearest post office. Outside of the urban reinvention programme, 2,248 post offices closed between April 1997 and December 2005.

Peterborough city council and Network Rail are jointly developing a scheme for a major redevelopment of the station area but it is too soon to say whether it will include proposals for the Crescent Link.

<i>[holding answer 14 February 2006]:</i> The Department for Transport has considered the Crossrail scheme in conjunction with Cross London Rail Links Ltd. (CLRL), the company taking forward the development of Crossrail. CLRL has examined the scope for serving Ebbsfleet and Reading. Their work shows that, in order to serve Ebbsfleet, Crossrail services would need to share tracks with other rail services on the North Kent Line between Abbey Wood and Ebbsfleet. This would involve complex scheduling with an unacceptable risk of disruption to Crossrail&#039;s planned high-frequency service pattern. In the case of Reading, significant additional costs and risks would be involved, including line electrification and associated bridge raising. As a result, neither extension was included in the route put forward in the Crossrail hybrid Bill.

This conforms to the UN definition of a long-term migrant, the requirement for which is a stay of at least 12 months.

Notes:<br>

The figures for April 2003 to March 2004 and April 2004 to March 2005 in the table have been adjusted for data quality problems found. Previous figures have not been adjusted in this way as there is not enough information available to do so. The tables therefore are not all suitable for making reliable comparisons over time but give a reference of our best estimate of these overpayment figures 



in each year. Confidence intervals are not provided in these tables although are typically around +&#151;20 to 30 per cent. of the central estimates.<br>

Notes:<br>

1. The continuous measurement system for fraud and error in housing benefit began in 2001, so earlier comparable results are not available.<br>

2. Note that these figures are made up of reviews of around 85 per cent. of HB expenditure (used for measuring performance against the relevant PSA target to reduce fraud and error in HB) combined with more approximate estimates of error in the remaining 15 per cent. of expenditure. For further details on this, please see the relevant National Statistics reports.<br>

Notes:<br>

1. The sample for long-term benefits is a small one and excludes some types of cases. It provides reassurance that official error on these benefits is a very low proportion of expenditure, but the estimate is only a broad indicator.<br>

2. As a result of the wide margins of error, the changes over time are not statistically significant.<br>
