Parliament will not be able to consider the draft Guidance until the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments have completed their scrutiny of it and reported to the Houses.

 One North East (ONE) has secured the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;work programme of the former Northumberland Tourist Board through funding of &#163;2.3&nbsp;million and has committed an additional &#163;1&nbsp;million for tourism in line with its Corporate Plan.

Tourism development will also benefit from the Regional Image Strategy and Marketing budgets.

<p><a name="40510w04.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 Since September 2003, responsibility for the safety regulation of most aircraft and aircraft products lies with the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) except for various smaller or specialist aircraft such as microlights which remain the responsibility of national aviation authorities.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40510w04.html_para0">
The UK Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) recognises the potential safety benefits of ballistic parachutes in otherwise potentially catastrophic accident situations. The authority introduced an amendment to the UK Design Requirements for Microlights in 1999 allowing for the installation of ballistic parachutes in such aeroplanes. Approval was on the basis that this did not introduce any additional hazard during normal conditions of flight.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40510w04.html_para1">
EASA will include an assessment of an installed ballistic parachute system when investigating aircraft for the issue of a type Certificate. We understand that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has approved the installation and use of a ballistic parachute in the Cirus SR20 light aeroplane and that this aircraft is now the subject of an application for approval in Europe.

 To ask the Secretary of State for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Transport what percentage of the <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;crockery, <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;cutlery and <i>(c)</i>&nbsp;glassware procured by his Department over the last five years is of British manufacture.  [170812]</p>








<p><a name="40510w04.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport if he will make it his policy to source all sea bass used in catering outlets for which his Department is responsible from hand-line fishermen rather than pair trawlers.  [167535]</p>








<p><a name="40510w04.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 Defra supports the sourcing of sea bass from sustainable fisheries and handlining, as a relatively low impact method of fishing, can play a part in ensuring fisheries remain sustainable. However, the last report in 2003 by the International Council for the Exploration of the Seas on sea bass advised that the level of exploitation of the stock at that time was sustainable and did not recommend closure of the offshore pair trawl fishery. There are currently no restrictions at a UK or Community level on the method of fishing that can be used to target bass. In addition, to address the dolphin bycatch problem associated with the pair trawl fishery, Defra-funded trials of a separate grid device to reduce dolphin bycatch are currently taking place, with the co-operation of the fishing industry.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40510w04.html_para5">
In these circumstances, I do not believe that recommending a specific source of supply for bass could be justified at this stage.

We are currently conducting a public consultation on an amendment to the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 in order to ensure that the definition of &quot;wild bird&quot; correctly transposes the EC Wild Birds Directive (79/409/EEC) by protecting all species of birds occurring in the wild state in the European territory of the member states. A short consultation document was issued on the 17&nbsp;February and the consultation period concludes on 11&nbsp;May 2004.

market demand, and changes to the Date Based Export Scheme. Any losses to producers should be relatively short term and market prices for OTM cattle could, in the longer term, be expected to recover to levels close to the EU average. As the present OTMS compensation rate is below the EU market price for cull cows and demand for manufacturing beef is strong, UK farm prices for OTM cattle are expected to rise especially as exports open up leading to a positive effect on the incomes of dairy and suckler beef farmers.

<i>(b)</i>&nbsp;Under the single farm payment scheme, direct subsidies are being decoupled from production which will provide an opportunity for farmers to respond to market signals thereby producing products that consumers demand rather than producing those that they have historically produced, or which attract larger subsidies. Payments under the single payment scheme will initially be composed of an element based on farmers&#039; historic payment in the reference period and an element based on their farm area. Area payments will be fully implemented by 2012. There will be some redistribution of monies within the regions defined by the area payments from the more intensive to the more extensive types of farming, but the impact on individual holdings will also depend on how they respond to opportunities presented by CAP reform.

 Computer based systems relating to export health certification from the UK show that during 2003 export health certificates for 733 horses were issued to non-EU destinations and for 8,478 horses to ED destinations. These figures include horses in transit from non-EU countries to EU Member States and animals exported temporarily from the UK for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;competition purposes. The figures exclude the movement of certain horses to France and Ireland which under a Tripartite Agreement do not require export health certification.

 The admission and selection of students is a matter for individual institutions. Admissions should always be based on individual merit.

We know that both the new and existing medical schools are themselves doing excellent work to address some of the access and diversity issues that surround the application and selection process. One of the criteria for the establishment of new medical schools in recent years has been the need to demonstrate an active commitment to widening participation from a broad range of social and ethnic backgrounds to reflect the patterns of populations which are served by the NHS.

From September 2004, the scheme is being extended to give greater opportunities for talented children to receive the specialist training they need.

<p><a name="40510w12.html_spnew0"><b> Alan Johnson: </b> 
 Both my right hon. Friend and I have received a number of representations from universities about postgraduate education and research. These have included trends and participation in postgraduate programmes. Over the period 1996&#150;97 to 2002&#150;03 there has been a 16&nbsp;per cent. increase in the number of UK domiciled postgraduate students. The Government recognise the importance of encouraging more students into postgraduate and research study and have taken a number of initiatives to achieve this, including increases to stipends for PhD students and post-doctoral salaries.

 If their course has been &#039;specifically designated&#039; for student support by my Department, eligible students on courses of higher education at private institutions can apply for support for fees, loans for maintenance and, where appropriate, disabled students&#039; allowance. Generally, the fee rate for a specifically designated course at a private institution will be lower than the publicly funded rate and is not subject to means test. For 2004/05, the fee rate is &#163;1,075.

Institutions funded by the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) are able to franchise courses to private sector colleges, which would receive indirect funding. To be directly funded by HEFCE, a private sector college would need to be designated for funding by the Secretary of State under section 129 of the Further and Higher Education Act 1992. The Secretary of State, in reaching a decision on designation, will seek advice from HEFCE. In addition to considering what is affordable to fund, the criteria which the Council use in forming their advice can be found in HEFCE publication 01/05, &quot;Transfers Between the Further and Higher Education Sectors&quot;, which I have placed in the House of Commons Library.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills (1) if he will set a target date for the completion of outstanding repairs to school buildings;  [171237]

</p>

</p>



<p>(3) if he will make a statement on the Government&#039;s progress towards its target for substantial repairs to be made to 7,000 schools by this year.  [171240]</p>








<p><a name="40510w12.html_spnew7"><b> Mr. Miliband: </b> 
 Central government capital support for investment in school buildings in England has increased from under &#163;700&nbsp;million in 1996&#150;97 to &#163;4.5&nbsp;billion this year and will rise further to over &#163;5&nbsp;billion in 2005&#150;06. Most of this funding is allocated by formula to schools and local education authorities so that they can address their investment needs, which are prioritised locally in asset management plans. My department does not collect detailed information on local investment decisions, in view of the unacceptable bureaucratic burden this would impose. The targets mentioned by the hon. Member were realistic estimates based on the increased levels of capital funding available to schools and to authorities. However, we are confident that local education authorities and schools have the investment available for their schools to reach these targets.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40510w12.html_para2">
For instance, funding includes direct capital funding for every school. From 2002&#150;03 to 2004&#150;05, a typical secondary school has received over &#163;200,000 of its own capital, and a typical primary school over &#163;60,000, enabling them to improve their buildings in line with their priorities. Therefore, we believe that virtually every school in the country has now benefited from substantial repairs or improvements to its buildings, far in excess of the target of &#163;7,000.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40510w12.html_para3">
Further, funding also includes support for PFI projects. By September 2004, from signed PFI contracts, about 130 newly built or rebuilt schools are scheduled to be operating, plus a similar number of refurbished schools. There are a further 220 schools, new built and refurbished, which are also scheduled to benefit from these PFI contracts. Over 80 schools benefited from substantial investment from New Deal for Schools funding. In the voluntary aided sector, where we allocate funding directly to schools, there have been 90 new or rebuilt school projects in the last five to six years. In addition, authorities are investing in new and rebuilt schools to meet local population growth and the needs of 21st century teaching and learning.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40510w12.html_para4">
By 2004&#150;05, this government will have provided a total of &#163;24 billion for investment in school buildings in England, enabling schools and authorities to address the backlog of repairs that had built up as a result of years of under-funding and to begin to make schools suitable for the teaching and learning needs of the 21st century.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40510w12.html_para5">
Earlier this year, I announced the first wave of authorities to benefit from the Building Schools for the Future (BSF) programme, which aims to renew all secondary schools in England in 10&#150;15 years from 2005&#150;06, subject to future spending decisions. In addition to the BSF programme, we will continue to make substantial funding available for schools in the primary sector and those in the secondary sector not prioritised in BSF. School buildings will continue to be improved in line with local priorities, and support provided for the continuing cyclical, predictive and reactive maintenance needs which are a necessary part of the upkeep of all school buildings so that they do not again decay. In value for money terms, there may be occasions when it is preferable to wait for strategic 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>10 May 2004 : Column 44W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
renewal of a school rather than continue to patch and mend. This will be a local decision. Given this, I do not&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;intend to set a target date for completion of outstanding repairs.

 It is not possible to answer these questions in precisely the way they have been asked as data are not collected centrally on this basis and local authorities are generally free to determine the distribution of grant between the primary and secondary sectors as they see fit, although the data in Table 2.3 indicate an approximate 45:55 split between primary and secondary schools.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what measures his Department is taking to ensure that young people receive clear and accurate information in schools to enable them to make informed choices about their sexual health; and if he will make a statement.  [171171]</p>









<p><a name="40510w14.html_spnew0"><b> Margaret Hodge: </b> 
 Teaching about sexual health and safer sex are key elements of the Government&#039;s sexual health strategy and are covered by our Sex and Relationship Education (SRE) guidance, which was sent to all schools in July 2000. All maintained secondary schools have a statutory responsibility to teach SRE. Through SRE pupils learn about sexual health, contraception and the range of advice and support services which are available. Young people should be made aware of the risks of contracting sexually transmitted infections and know about prevention, diagnosis and treatment. In addition, we have made a new resource on &#039;Teaching and Learning about HIV&#039; available to all schools.

 Information on teacher vacancies is not available by constituency as it is collected at local education authority level. In January 2003, the latest information available, there were seven full-time teacher&nbsp;vacancies in Stockton-on-Tees local education authority.

Like other areas, since 1997 Stockton-on-Tees has benefited from the initiatives that the Government have put in place to recruit and retain teachers and to increase the number of staff supporting them in schools. Since 1997, the number of full-time equivalent regular teachers in maintained schools in the Stockton-on-Tees LEA area has risen by 110, from 1,650 to 1,760 in 2003. Over the same period, the number of full-time equivalent school support staff in the area has grown by 340 from 460 to 800 in 2003.

 The information is not held in the format requested. Within the context of the statutory National Curriculum, where Physical Education (PE) is compulsory for pupils aged five-16, it is for individual schools to use their budgets as they judge appropriate.

<a name="40510w14.html_para1">
The Government is investing more than &#163;1 billion in England to transform PE, school sport and club links. The funding will help deliver an ambitious Public Service Agreement target, shared with the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, to increase the percentage of five-16 year olds who spend a minimum of two hours each week on high quality PE and school sport within and beyond the curriculum to 75&nbsp;per cent. by 2006.

<p>
<a name="40510w14.html_para2">
The Department is providing &#163;751,475 to support the delivery of a School Sport Partnership in the Stockton-on-Tees area. The partnership includes five secondary and 25 primary schools and provides enhanced sports opportunities for all young people to ensure that their pupils spend a minimum of two hours a week on high quality PE and School Sport. A key objective for all School Sport Partnerships is to ensure that the improvements and enhanced opportunities that they deliver are sustainable and embedded within schools to ensure a lasting legacy. The New Opportunities Fund has provided schools in the Stockton-on-Tees LEA area with over &#163;2.4&nbsp;million specifically to enhance PE and school sport facilities.

In 2003&#150;04 DFID introduced a new method of assessing administration costs, which had previously been recorded on programme budgets. This included entertainment expenditure previously incurred by overseas offices. The provisional figure for 2003&#150;04 was &#163;246,000 and the projected figure for 2004&#150;05 is &#163;261,000. These changes have increased transparency and will enable DFID to manage administrative costs more effectively, but they mean that the 2003&#150;04 figures and 2004&#150;05 projections are not comparable with earlier years.

 Recorded crime figures, which are used to measure trends in crime, include statistics on drugs offences, such as possession, and on property crimes, such as burglary, but do not record whether the latter are related to an offender&#039;s drug habits. There are therefore no figures currently available for levels of drug-driven crime over the last five years.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40510w20.html_para2">
The Home Office sponsored New English and Welsh Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring (NEW-ADAM) survey, which involved interviewing and drug testing those arrested by the police, provides an insight into the proportion of crimes that are drug related. However, these figures are not nationally representative.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40510w20.html_para3">
Analysis of the data from the first eight sites in the survey, collected during 1999&#150;2000, showed that 65&nbsp;per cent. of arrestees tested positive for one or more illegal drug, with up to 29&nbsp;per cent. testing positive for opiates (including heroin) and/or cocaine (including crack). Those arrestees reporting no drug use in the year before this study reported an average of 46 acquisitive crimes compared to 432 among heroin and/or cocaine/crack users.

<a name="40510w20.html_para8">
The report shows a continued increase in the number of reports made to the IWF, to just under 20,000 in 2003. The report also highlights the fact that only 1&nbsp;per cent. of illegal content identified by IWF in 2003 was hosted in the UK: this represents a significant improvement from 18&nbsp;per cent. in 1997, and demonstrates the willingness of UK industry to work effectively to remove illegal content. These figures also demonstrate the continuing need for international co-operation to deal with illegal content on the internet: the report shows that the IWF themselves have active partnerships with hotlines and other agencies abroad, and support the UK police in their efforts to encourage such co-operation.

The involvement of such groups as mobile telecommunications providers, search engines and the finance industry in discussions with the IWF and others to reduce access to illegal content is further demonstration of the value of this approach.

Mr. Carter reported in January 2001. The main findings relevant to the question were that past market tests demonstrated beyond doubt the value of the competitive process in driving down costs and improving performance in public sector prisons, that PFI had proved successful in attracting capital investment and delivering high quality prisons and that competition should continue.

The service has recently expanded its work in this area into a new structure, the National Security Advice Centre (NSAC). As part of the expansion, the service launched its upgrade website (www.mi5.gov.uk) on 30&nbsp;April. This provides a substantial body of material offering practical advice on sensible security precautions for business organisations and anyone with responsibility for the safety of others.

 The DTI has discussed, and will continue to discuss as appropriate, disconnections matters with Ofgem.

Ofgem has now issued an industry consultation paper that sets out proposed revisions to, and clarification of, those arrangements. The arrangements governing the warrants process are set out in the Rights of Entry (Gas and Electricity Boards) Act 1954, as amended. If a supplier wishes to disconnect, it must give the customer two days&#039; notice of its intention to visit the premises. It has the right of entry to disconnect, but, if the customer is not at home or refuses entry, it may only exercise this right after it has obtained a warrant from a court. The court may require evidence of the debt, and of the supplier&#039;s efforts to recover that debt.

<p><a name="40510w26.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Timms: </b> 
 None. Complaints about dumping in the European Union relating to steel or any other product and its effects on the Community industry, including the UK, are assessed by the European Commission against the criteria laid down in the EC&#039;s Basic Anti-dumping Regulation. The European Commission determines whether dumping has occurred and the extent to which the industry has been injured. If it finds dumping and injury, it may recommend anti-dumping measures which usually take the form of additional duties. It is then up the Member States, including UK government officials, to support or oppose any Commission recommendation for anti-dumping measures.

 The Government&#039;s target for renewables is that, by 2010, 10&nbsp;per cent. of our electricity sales will come from renewable sourced electricity. The target is challenging as we are starting from a low base.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40510w26.html_para6">
The Government&#039;s main policy mechanism for achieving the target is the Renewables Obligation (and Renewables Obligation Scotland) Introduced in April 2002, it places an obligation on all licensed electricity suppliers to supply a specified and growing proportion of their sales from electricity generated from a range of eligible renewable sources.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40510w26.html_para7">
Through the Renewables Obligation (RO), we are looking to accelerate the development of renewables in a wide range of sources and technologies. In order to encourage a more vigorous and diverse renewable energy sector, the Government has allocated a total of &#163;350&nbsp;million over four years for capital grants and research grants to promote forms renewable energy that are further from becoming commercially competitive. This includes among other things grants of &#163;117&nbsp;million for offshore wind, &#163;66&nbsp;million for energy crops and

<p>
<a name="40510w26.html_para8">
The Government additionally has a target of achieving at least 10 gigawatts of good Quality combined heat power (CHP) capacity by 2010 and published its Strategy for CHP to 2010 on 26&nbsp;April of this year confirming its continued aim towards that target. CHP is a highly fuel-efficient energy technology which (puts to use waste heat produced as a by-product of the electricity generation process and) can make a significant contribution to the UK&#039;s sustainable energy goals.

 To ask the Deputy Prime Minister if he will make a statement on his assessment of how the change in the level of council funding for housing has&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;affected the residents of West Lancashire since 1997.  [171546]</p>








<p><a name="40510w29.html_spnew8"><b> Keith Hill: </b> 
 Since 1997 allocations of capital funding to local authorities for housing purposes have risen consistently by about 15&nbsp;per cent. per annum on average. This includes the Major Repairs Allowance we introduced in 2001&#150;02 specifically for the improvement of local authority stock alongside the Decent Homes standard which sets out minimum standards to be met by 2010. West Lancashire&#039;s allocations in the period 1997 to 2003&#150;04 have risen by over 300&nbsp;per cent. In addition to this welcome increase there has been support through the Community Housing Task Force and Government Office for the North West that has helped the local authority and its tenants to choose the best strategy for long term improvement.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40510w29.html_para4">
16 local authorities in the North West have transferred all their stock, and five local authorities have transferred part of their stock. This has unlocked &#163;1,739&nbsp;million in private finance, of which &#163;553&nbsp;million has gone to local authorities in capital receipts, with the remaining &#163;1,186&nbsp;million going directly into renovating and maintaining the transferred properties. Four local authorities have schemes on the programme that have not yet transferred, three of which have had positive ballot results. Ellesmere Port and Neston, Halton, Hyndburn, Macclesfield and West Lancashire have been granted places on the 2004 programme.

[171037]</p>








<p><a name="40510w35.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. MacShane  </b> 
<i>[holding answer 6&nbsp;May 2004]:</i> As my&nbsp;right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary made clear in his statement of 25&nbsp;February 2004, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 46&#150;49WS, on Weapons of Mass Destruction, recent experience has shown there is a need for more wide-ranging inspections of national nuclear industries. The&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;International Atomic Energy Agency&#039;s (IAEA) Additional Protocol provides the basis for carrying out such inspections. We seek universal adherence to the Additional Protocol and believe suppliers of nuclear technology should increasingly see this as a key commitment when they judge export licence applications. We are working with partners to enhance the effectiveness of the IAEA and strengthen its ability to ensure that nations comply with their safeguards agreements.

There is a strong argument that states which fail to comply with their safeguards obligations should forfeit the right to develop the nuclear fuel cycle, particularly the enrichment and reprocessing capabilities which are of such proliferation sensitivity. This would not deprive them of the possibility of constructing and running civil nuclear power stations but would prevent a seemingly civil programme masking a weapons programme.

To extend the legal base of interdiction operations we are opening negotiations with major commercial flag states to allow for the boarding of vessels which may be carrying cargoes which could be used in WMD programmes.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how many of those who served on the Arctic convoys during the Second World War received the Russian 40th Anniversary of Victory in the Great Patriotic War medal.  [170357]</p>








<p><a name="40510w35.html_spnew8"><b> Mr. Caplin: </b> 
 The Royal Navy Medal Office issued approximately 15,000 Russian 40th Anniversary of Victory in the Great Patriotic War medals during the early 1990s to eligible Royal Navy, Royal Marine, Army, Royal Air Force and Merchant Navy personnel. It would not be possible to provide a more precise figure without a manual trawl through the relevant service records at disproportionate cost. In addition the Russian Embassy in London issued medals directly to members of both the Russian Convoy Club and the North Russia Club, but the numbers involved are not known.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how many of those who served on the Arctic Convoys during the Second World War received the Atlantic Star.  [170358]</p>








<p><a name="40510w35.html_spnew9"><b> Mr. Caplin: </b> 
 There is no definitive Medal Roll which indicates how many people received the Atlantic Star. It would not, therefore, be possible to establish how many recipients of the Atlantic Star sailed in Arctic waters on the convoys to Russia without undertaking an individual check of all the wartime personnel records which could be done only at disproportionate cost.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what estimates he has made of the cost to the Department of awarding a medal for service on the Arctic convoys.  [171121]</p>








<p><a name="40510w35.html_spnew10"><b> Mr. Caplin: </b> 
 It is not possible to determine with any certainty how many people served in Arctic waters during the Second World War, but it is estimated that more than 95,000 Royal Navy personnel may have done so. The cost of issuing a new medal to Royal Navy veterans alone, including staff costs and the cost of the medal itself, would be at least &#163;14&nbsp;million if all those eligible or their next of kin applied.

Throughout 2002 the MOD&#039;s NSQEP Head of Profession actively participated in a cross-Government Department Nuclear and Radiological Skills study that provided an estimate of the adequacy of personnel to support the UK&#039;s nuclear and radiological sector. The report identified that while there is no immediate overall general cause for concern, there are a number of shortages in some disciplines. There are, however, concerns about the general age profile and the supply of suitably qualified and experienced personnel to replace those who retire over the next 15 years. One aspect of the Government response to the Nuclear and Radiological Skills study, in line with the Government Skills Strategy, was the development and licensing, in March 2004, of a Sector Skills Council for the UK&#039;s nuclear sector. The MOD&#039;s NSQEP Head of Profession co-ordinates Defence Nuclear skills interests at the Industry Nuclear Skills Group and engages closely with the Sector Skills Council.

 Safety reviews on nuclear submarines are conducted routinely at several levels in accordance with rigorous and well-rehearsed procedures. Prior to sailing, rigorous checks are undertaken to validate all aspects of a vessel&#039;s seaworthiness. Regular safety reviews, that comply fully with legal requirements, are also carried out on board to ensure the material state of the submarine is monitored and maintained.

6.&nbsp;The question has been interpreted and presented as those families in receipt of disability living allowance, who have children.

7.&nbsp;For the purpose of calculating whether a family is below 60&nbsp;per cent. of median income, any DLA received has been excluded from the household income.

Currently in Income Support, the main property occupied as the home is ignored unless any part of it could be reasonably sold off separately.

We have recently discovered that due to an oversight, this rule was not carried forward into Pension Credit legislation when the principal regulations were drafted.

Notes:<br>

1.&nbsp;Data is not available by Parliamentary Constituency. Battersea Parliamentary Constituency used to be part of South West Thames Social Fund District. This District was involved in a very complex set of interlocking boundary changes affecting most of Greater London and some neighbouring areas, which took place from April 2003 to January 2004. Changes affecting South West Thames Social Fund District happened in November 2003 and the district then became known as South West Thames interim district. Changes to this district occurred in January 2004, resulting in the formation of Lambeth, Southwark and Wandsworth Jobcentre Plus district. Battersea Parliamentary Constituency was part of South West Thames interim district and is now part of Lambeth, Southwark and Wandsworth Jobcentre Plus district. The three areas for which data is given above are thus different, so the data is not comparable.<br>

2.&nbsp;Sure Start maternity grants were introduced on 27&nbsp;March 2000. The very small number of cases for 1999&#150;2000 has been excluded for data protection reasons.<br>

3.&nbsp;Data is given for all applications and awards, irrespective of whether the application was made by the mother or her partner.<br>

We estimate that there are approximately 100,000 people in Great Britain paid via late payment runs (0.8&nbsp;per cent. of all payments). However, since late payment runs are mainly in respect of non-system cases whose claim had not been received by Qualifying Week, they are heavily skewed towards men aged 60.<br>

independent Customs and Excise prosecutions office; what practical issues he is discussing with the Attorney-General regarding the creation of an independent Customs and Excise prosecutions office; and if he will make a statement.  [171062]</p>








<p><a name="40510w42.html_spnew0"><b> John Healey: </b> 
 As indicated in the joint statements I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;made with the Attorney-General on 15&nbsp;July and 8&nbsp;December 2003, the Government have accepted the recommendations contained in Mr. Justice Butterfield&#039;s report in respect of Customs and Excise&#039;s investigative practices, and that offences investigated by Customs officers should be prosecuted by an independent prosecuting authority. These are being implemented.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40510w42.html_para0">
Legislation will be required to establish fully the independent prosecuting authority and we aim to introduce this in the course of this year.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40510w42.html_para1">
Prior to legislation being put in place, it is our aim to continue as far as possible the separation of the prosecution function from Customs and Excise begun following the Butler report of 14&nbsp;April 2000. Various options are currently being examined with several steps already agreed, including appointing a new director for the organisation and amending the Memorandum of Understanding agreed on 9&nbsp;January 2003&#151;in line with the Gower Hammond report of 5&nbsp;December 2000&#151;between myself, the Attorney-General and the Commissioners of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Customs and Excise. This Memorandum of Understanding concerns the conduct, resourcing and accountabilities for Customs and Excise prosecutions under the auspices of the Attorney-General as well as the arrangements for the prosecution of offences investigated by Customs officers. That Memorandum can be found at Appendix 9 of the Butterfield Report and makes it clear that since 1&nbsp;April 2002 those lawyers who prosecute criminal cases arising from Customs investigations are accountable to the Attorney-General for the conduct of those prosecutions rather than to Treasury Ministers or the Commissioners of Customs and Excise. The amendments envisaged include the role of the new director.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40510w42.html_para2">
Among the practical issues presently under discussion with the Attorney-General are the future relationship between the independent prosecuting authority, the new revenue department and the Serious and Organised Crime Agency (SOCA).

 The effects of the excise diversion frauds involving the London City Bond warehouse, and the validity of HM Customs and Excise&#039;s practices and procedures of disclosure, associated investigation techniques and case management in criminal cases, were fully considered in independent reviews by Mr. John Roques and Mr. Justice Butterfield, both of which are available in the Library of the House. Recommendations arising from those reviews are being implemented, as announced most recently in the Written Ministerial Statements of 15&nbsp;July and 8&nbsp;December 2003 by the Attorney-General and I.
</p>

24 London City Bond-related cases have been reviewed. There are no further cases to be reviewed. 48 convictions, in 8 cases, have to date been overturned on appeal, of which 5 appeals (totalling 35 convictions) had been heard before the Customs and Excise Prosecutions Office launched its wider review of cases following the decision in November 2002 to offer no evidence in London City Bond-related cases before Liverpool Crown Court.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40510w42.html_para4">
Customs has trawled all areas of the Department for any material of potential relevance. Where further disclosable material has been uncovered, it has been passed directly to the Metropolitan Police to assist their investigation into the circumstances of the collapse of the London City Bond cases, and to Mr. Justice Butterfield. That trawl, by Customs officials, brought to light the record relating to Mr. Alfred Allington at the end of June 2003; the documents were handed over to Mr. Justice Butterfield in mid July. The Customs and Excise Prosecutions Office informed the Attorney-General of the Alf Allington informant record issue on 20&nbsp;January 2004, as part of a general briefing about the review of London City Bond-related cases. A copy of that submission was sent to me on that date. It would not be proper to comment on the significance of this

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health what his policy is on matching the number of consultant vacancies to the number of qualified trainees.  [167061]</p>








<p><a name="40510w45.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 We are investing in future growth in the medical workforce by increasing both medical school places and specialist registrar training places. We have already exceeded the autumn 2005 England medical school intake target of 5,894, two years early. In autumn 2003, intake was 6,030 compared with 3,749 in autumn 1997 and as at 30&nbsp;September 2003, there were 14,619 specialist registrars working in the national health service, an increase of 2,709 since September 1997.

</p>


<p>
<a name="40510w45.html_para0">
A range of national recruitment initiatives is in place to support doctors looking for consultant vacancies most suited to them. A new website at: www.doh.gov.uk/consultantjobs hosts thousands of consultant vacancies in England for domestic specialist registrars as well as potential international consultant recruits. Similarly, the national roll-out of e-recruitment, an online recruitment service for the NHS, will allow doctors to search and apply for consultant vacancies on one website. This new&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;service at: www.nhs.uk/jobs will streamline and modernise the process of recruitment of all NHS staff. In addition, the new consultant entry scheme facilitates the placement of specialist registrars looking for fixed term placements to known consultant vacancies.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health what estimate he has made of the liability in the 2003&#150;04 accounts of NHS Trusts of the implementation of the new consultant&#039;s contract.  [168906]</p>








<p><a name="40510w45.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 Funding for the consultant contract, based on the methodology agreed with the British Medical Association during the negotiations, was allocated to primary care trusts in full in December 2002 as part of main allocations. For 2003&#150;04, additional funding worth 0.3&nbsp;per cent. of allocations was allocated to primary care trusts for the implementation of the new consultant contract. We have given clear guidance to the National Health Service about how to manage costs within the financial envelope and how to manage funding flows, but decisions on how to spend this funding are made locally.

<p><a name="40510w47.html_spnew0"><b> Dr. Ladyman: </b> 
 The modernising hearing aid services (MHAS) programme has resulted in the provision of digital hearing aids and the modernisation of services in two thirds of the audiology departments in England. By the end of March 2005, all audiology departments will&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have been through the programme. An extra &#163;26.4&nbsp;million capital and &#163;12&nbsp;million revenue is scheduled to be distributed to lead primary care trusts for the financial year beginning April 2005 as part of the general allocations.

 The Department is working in partnership with the Disability Rights Commission on a range of measures to support the National Health Service in improving access to information and services, communications and levels of awareness of disability issues.

<p><a name="40510w47.html_spnew5"><b> Dr. Ladyman: </b> 
 The Disability Discrimination Act 1995 requires service providers to make reasonable adjustments to the way they deliver their services so that disabled people can use them. In January 1999, the Department issued guidance to chief executives of National Health Service Trusts on providing good quality services meeting the needs of disabled people. This guidance contains a section explaining the needs of people who are deaf or who have a hearing impairment setting out a range of ways in which better communication can be supported. For example, the, guidance recommends that interpreters used for medical consultations should be appropriately qualified, that hospitals and health centres should maintain an up to date list of accredited sign language interpreters, and that letter headings, leaflets and information sheets should include text phone, fax and email numbers to facilitate responses from deaf people.

 The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) works in co-ordination with world-wide enforcement bodies to address this area of criminal activity. The MHRA is a member of the Permanent Forum on International Pharmaceutical Crime (PFIPC). This forum was set up by the United Kingdom in 1998 to promote good practice and develop intelligence links and networks. Internet crime is a frequent topic for discussion.

An initiative is currently in progress to identify a commercially available internet monitoring software package for use by the MHRA.

<p>
<a name="40510w47.html_para8">
In addition, the MHRA and the former Medicines Control Agency (MCA) has been involved with three initiatives involving the availability of medicines on the internet sponsored by other Government agencies and local authorities, such as the Office of Fair Trading, Inland Revenue and trading standards departments. These initiatives identified websites which appeared to be in breach of medicines legislation. The MHRA/MCA investigated the services offered by those websites and took appropriate action.

<p><a name="40510w47.html_spnew9"><b> Ms Rosie Winterton: </b> 
 There are no plans to amend medicines legislation relating to the internet. Legal controls on the retail sale or supply of medicines are set out in the Medicines Act 1968 and associated regulations.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40510w47.html_para9">
These controls apply without distinction to medicines sold or supplied through internet transactions. Although there are strict legal controls in legislation on the sale, supply and advertisement of medicinal products within the European Community, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) accepts that the sale of medicines over the internet poses unique challenges to national authorities.

<p>
<a name="40510w47.html_para10">
Along with counterparts in other member states and other enforcement bodies world-wide (including the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Food and Drugs Administration), the MHRA continues to monitor developments. However, by its very nature, the internet, with its broad reach, relative anonymity and the ease of creating new websites (plus removing old ones) means that ensuring effective compliance with legislative requirements requires a global commitment.

 &quot;Valuing People&#151;a New Strategy for Learning Disability for the 21st Century&quot; announced the creation of the learning disability development fund (LDDF) to provide central support for key aspects of the strategy. It was introduced in 2002&#150;03.

The revenue allocations were &#163;20.6&nbsp;million in 2002&#150;03, and &#163;21.1&nbsp;million in 2003&#150;04. The capital allocations for both years were &#163;20&nbsp;million.

<p>

The revenue element of the LDDF is formed from that element of the old long stay adjustment within general health allocations which is released as former long stay patients die.

The LDDF capital is additional investment which resulted from the 2002 spending review.

Good practice guidance was issued in July 2002 on two key elements of the strategy for improving the health of people with learning disabilities: health action plans and health facilitation. This was followed up with

a series of regional workshops. In the light of these the percentage &#039;Valuing People&#039; support team has been working with local learning disability partnership boards to help them implement health action plans and health facilitation in their areas.

&quot;Building on the Best&quot;, our response to the consultation on choice, responsiveness and equality in the national health service, published in December 2003, said that we will bring forward proposals during 2004 to offer disabled people the option of taking up an annual health check. We are considering how to take this forward in a way that will further support the health action planning process.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health (1) if he will, in the light of the recent Ombudsman&#039;s report on Mr. Curran, assess the criteria used by the Castle Point and Rochford Primary Care Trust to determine payment of the long-term health and care costs; and if he will make a statement on their consistency with the principle of free NHS care for those with serious health problems;  [171717]

<p><a name="40510w48.html_spnew2"><b> Dr. Ladyman: </b> 
 Recompense payments have been made, and will continue to be made, in cases where investigations have revealed that individuals were wrongly denied fully funded national health service continuing care. Eligibility for fully funded NHS continuing care is based on the individual&#039;s level of assessed health care needs, not on a condition specific basis. All strategic health authorities have recently reviewed their criteria and have provided the Department with evidence of the legal advice sought to ensure their criteria&#039;s compliance with the NHS&#039; legal responsibilities.

<p><a name="40510w49.html_wqn0"><b> Sandra Gidley: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Health pursuant to the answer of 29&nbsp;March 2004, <i>Official Report</i>, column 1217W, on maternity services (asylum seekers) what <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;maternity and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;antenatal services will be available to women who have had their application for asylum refused.  [171398]</p>








<p><a name="40510w49.html_spnew0"><b> Dr. Ladyman: </b> 
 Pregnant women whose application for asylum has been finally rejected will continue to be able to access National Health Service hospital antenatal and maternity services but they may be charged for any services provided, depending on how long they have been in the United Kingdom at the time their claim is turned down. In primary care settings, free treatment will be given only where, in the opinion of a health care professional, it is an emergency or is immediately necessary. In other circumstances, failed asylum seekers should be de-registered and should receive treatment (maternity medical services) only from General Practitioners practices on a private, paying basis.

<p><a name="40510w49.html_wqn1"><b> Bob Spink: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Health what assessment he has made of the meningitis risk to young people entering universities; and if he will make a statement.  [170818]</p>








<p><a name="40510w49.html_spnew1"><b> Miss Melanie Johnson: </b> 
 The risk of meningitis in young people entering higher education has reduced substantially since the introduction of the MenC vaccine. The number of cases of meningitis C per year in all age groups has declined by over 90&nbsp;per cent., since the vaccine was introduced.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40510w49.html_para0">
Meningitis B still presents a risk, as there is no vaccine available to protect against this disease. In order to raise awareness of the signs and symptoms of meningitis, the Department distributes the &#039;Look out for your mate&#039; leaflet which is targeted specifically at the student age group.

<p><a name="40510w49.html_spnew2"><b> Miss Melanie Johnson: </b> 
 United Kingdom students entering higher education should have received MenC vaccine as part of the vaccination campaign. We 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>10 May 2004 : Column 173W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
recommend that every effort should be made to ensure that all individuals are immunised even if they are older than the recommended age range, and that no opportunity should be missed.

<p><a name="40510w49.html_spnew3"><b> Ms Rosie Winterton: </b> 
 The information requested is not centrally available. The Department monitors the average daily number of open and staffed beds in National Health Service hospitals. Figures can be sub-divided into different ward classifications, such as &#039;neonates and children&#039; or into sectors such as &#039;mental illness&#039;. However, it is not possible to provide the information requested using these figures.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40510w49.html_para1">
The Department does not have a specific policy on the use of mental health beds being used for treating people for physical health conditions. The national service framework for mental health standard five envisages each mental health service user who is assessed as requiring a period of care away from their home to have timely access to an appropriate hospital bed or alternative bed or place. Strategic health authorities have a responsibility to ensure trusts&#039; compliance with this standard.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health (1) what plans he has to appeal to all teenagers not vaccinated against mumps to be immunised;  [167409]

</p>



<p>(2) what guidance has been produced by his Department on inoculation against mumps for people&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;who did not receive the MMR vaccine as children.  [167414]</p>








<p><a name="40510w49.html_spnew5"><b> Miss Melanie Johnson: </b> 
 All children need two doses of measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine to ensure that they are properly protected against measles, mumps and rubella.




<br>&nbsp;<br><i>10 May 2004 : Column 174W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="40510w49.html_para2">
We advise that children who have either had no or one dose of MMR should be offered a further dose. In our information resources, we already advise young people to check that all their immunisations, including MMR, are up to date at the time they have their teenage immunisations. We also advise healthcare professionals that entry to higher educational establishments provides a further opportunity to check the immunisation history.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health whether his Department has received a copy of the recent report from the Women&#039;s Environmental Network on the economic and environmental costs of the promotion, use and disposal as clinical waste of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;disposable nappies within the National Health Service.  [169044]</p>








<p><a name="40510w49.html_spnew6"><b> Dr. Ladyman: </b> 
 Officials at the Department have received and responded to the recent report from the Women&#039;s Environmental Network on the use of disposable nappies within the National Health Service.


</p>







<p><a name="40510w49.html_wqn7"><b> Tim Loughton: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will estimate <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;the average unit cost of disposal as clinical waste of disposable nappies within the National Health Service and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;the total cost to the NHS of the disposal of such nappies in the last year for which figures are available.  [169045]</p>








<p><a name="40510w49.html_spnew7"><b> Dr. Ladyman: </b> 
 National Health Service trusts establish their own policy on the disposal of nappies and will decide whether to treat them as domestic waste, and therefore send them to landfill sites or clinical waste and&nbsp;therefore incinerate them. The cost of clinical waste involving disposable nappies is not collected centrally.


</p>







<p><a name="40510w49.html_wqn8"><b> Tim Loughton: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Health whether officials of his Department have met officials of the Waste Implementation Programme of the Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs to discuss how best to identify and promote best practice in nappy use, promotion and disposal within the National Health Service.  [169046]</p>








<p><a name="40510w49.html_spnew8"><b> Dr. Ladyman: </b> 
 Officials at the Department have not met officials of the waste implementation programme at the Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs to discuss the use of nappies in the National Health Service.

 To ask the Secretary of State for&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Health whether the children&#039;s national service framework will make reference to the good practice in continence services guidelines.  [169051]</p>








<p><a name="40510w49.html_spnew10"><b> Dr. Ladyman: </b> 
 It is not intended that the children&#039;s national service framework will set standards for the treatment of specific conditions, but rather will outline what support should be available to children and their parents in managing a whole range of problems. In doing so it will emphasise the promotion of evidence-based clinical guidelines and provide examples of good practice.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will list those NHS trusts which do not yet use electronic patient records.  [167703]</p>








<p><a name="40510w52.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 Most hospitals now have existing patient administration systems and limited or stand alone clinical systems. By the end of 2005, all National Health Service trusts will have some integrated functionality through electronic records to support patient care as part of the NHS care records service. This will begin to be rolled out alongside the electronic appointment booking service from summer 2004, with phased implementation to provide richer functionality over time to 2010.
</p>






<a name="40510w52.html_sbhd1"><h3 align=center>Patients Passports</h3>





<p><a name="40510w52.html_wqn1"><b> Mr. Burstow: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Health pursuant to his statement of 22&nbsp;March 2004, <i>Official Report</i>, column 594, what the basis was for the statement that a policy of patients&#039; passports paying for operations in the private sector would divert &#163;2 billion of taxpayers&#039; money away from the national health service.  [164648]</p>








<p><a name="40510w52.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 The Government calculate that the deadweight cost to the Exchequer of subsidising those who already pay for operations and other care in the private sector would be &#163;2 billion per annum. The patient passport policy, whereby a voucher would cover 60&nbsp;per cent. of the national health service cost of an operation in the private sector would cost an estimated &#163;1 billion. This has been calculated using data on the number and distribution of private sector treatments, together with 2003 NHS reference costs to estimate the subsidy per procedure. A further &#163;1 billion would be required to fund tax relief on national insurance contributions and income tax for company and private schemes. This is based on projections for company and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;private schemes from the Inland Revenue and Association of British Insurers.




<br>&nbsp;<br><i>10 May 2004 : Column 190W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>

<p><a name="40510w52.html_wqn2"><b> Mr. Dhanda: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will introduce a monthly instalment scheme for the prescription prepayment certificate.  [167597]</p>








<p><a name="40510w52.html_spnew2"><b> Ms Rosie Winterton: </b> 
 The prescription prepayment certificate (PPC) scheme is designed to be simple so that it can be administered easily and with the minimum of cost. To introduce payment by instalments would inevitably increase the administrative costs involved. This could lead to higher PPC fees and so reduce the potential savings and make the certificates less attractive for those who continue to make use of them.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40510w52.html_para1">
However, we are, with the Prescription Pricing Authority, currently considering the implications of introducing such a scheme, including the practicalities of payment collection.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health pursuant to his answer of 27&nbsp;April 2004, <i>Official Report</i>, column 961W, on the Prison Health Service, what issues&nbsp;had been raised by local services concerning the existing local protocols for ambulance and paramedic access.  [171267]</p>








<p><a name="40510w52.html_spnew3"><b> Dr. Ladyman: </b> 
 Feedback from local services highlighted the scope to strengthen protocols for ambulance and paramedic access to prisons in three specific areas:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">ensuring that ambulances are called promptly to incidents within prisons when required, and that there are clear arrangements for doing so in emergencies without the need first to consult prison health care staff;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">distinguishing between access for an ambulance vehicle and access for a paramedic to attend the patient; and</p>
</ul>

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">taking account of the potential impact of new European Committee for Standardisation Regulation for Ambulance Vehicles (British Standard Specification EN 1789), given the need for a suitably risk assessed Prison Service escort to attend with the vehicle.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health how many <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;MRI scanners and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;PET scanners there are in England; and how many of these scanners have been bought (i) directly by the NHS and (ii)&nbsp;through alternative funding arrangements.  [167712]</p>








<p><a name="40510w52.html_spnew4"><b> Miss Melanie Johnson: </b> 
 There are approximately 221 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners and four positron emission tomography (PET) scanners installed in the National Health Service in England. In addition, there are approximately 75 MRI scanners and eight PET scanners installed in non-NHS institutions in England.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40510w52.html_para2">
Of the 221 NHS MRI scanners, it is estimated that just over 100 were purchased directly by the NHS. Approximately 60 were purchased through central capital programmes funded by the New Opportunities Fund (NOF) and the Department. Approximately 60 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>10 May 2004 : Column 191W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
were purchased through other arrangements, including lease arrangements, managed service contracts and charitable funding.

This information is not held centrally for PET scanners.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40510w52.html_para4">
By the end of 2004, central cancer capital funding will mean that there will be approximately 277 MRI scanners in the NHS in England. In addition, on 8&nbsp;April 2004, the Department launched a procurement from the private sector to provide an extra 80,000 mobile MRI scans per year for the NHS for five years.

<p><a name="40510w52.html_spnew5"><b> Miss Melanie Johnson: </b> 
 The Government are working to improve access to sexual health services and contraception advice for young people through both the &quot;Teenage Pregnancy Strategy and the National Strategy for Sexual Health and HIV.&quot;
</p>


<p>
<a name="40510w52.html_para5">
The first ever &quot;National Strategy for Sexual Health and HIV&quot; (2001) (which links closely to the Government&#039;s teenage pregnancy strategy) identifies young people as a priority group for action. The Department&#039;s &#039;Sex Lottery&#039; and the teenage pregnancy (RUthinking) media campaigns are raising awareness among young people of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and how to avoid them. We are also tackling the most common STI through our national chlamydia screening programme, which already covers a quarter (84) of primary care trusts in England. Further details on the Strategy and its implementation are available from the Department&#039;s website at www.dh.gov.uk/sexualhealthandhiv/.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40510w52.html_para6">
The teenage pregnancy strategy aims to tackle the high levels of teenage pregnancy. Increasing and improving access to contraception and sexual health advice services is also a very important part of this work.

The Department is monitoring on a quarterly basis the number of hospitals that have stroke services and the number of these that have introduced specialised stroke services. The NSF makes it clear that all specialised stroke services should be co-ordinated through an integrated team, although the exact make up of that team will bedetermined locally. This more detailed information is not collected centrally.

<p><a name="40510w52.html_spnew7"><b> Miss Melanie Johnson: </b> 
 The health implications of mobile phones and base stations were reviewed in a report issued in January 2004 by the National Radiological Protection Board&#039;s (NRPB) advisory group on non-ionising radiation (Documents of the NRPB, Vol 14, No. 2, 2003). The report, entitled, &quot;Health Effects from Radiofrequency Electromagnetic Fields&quot;, concluded that:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;The weight of evidence now available does not suggest that there are adverse health effects from exposures to RF (radiofrequency) fields below guideline levels, but the published research on RF exposures and health has limitations, and mobile phones have only been in widespread use for a relatively short time. The possibility therefore remains open that there could be health effects from exposure to RF fields below guideline levels; hence continued research is needed.&quot;</p>

More specifically, for base stations it concluded:

<p class="tabletext">&quot;Exposure levels from living near to mobile phone base stations are extremely low, and the overall evidence indicates that they are unlikely to pose a risk to health.&quot;</p>
</ul>

</p>


<p>
<a name="40510w52.html_para9">
The report is available on the NRPB website at www.nrpb.org. The advisory group will continue to review the scientific literature both national and international that is relevant to the issue of mobile telephony and health.

The mobile telecommunications and health research (MTHR) programme reports on progress at its open seminars. The majority of projects are due to be completed in time for the seminar expected in November 2005. A few remaining projects may take up to three years longer depending on their complexity. Descriptions of these projects can be found on the website at www.mthr.org.uk.

In addition, the World Health Organisation (WHO) electromagnetic fields project is expected to publish a health risk assessment of radiofrequency effects in 2007, which will be available on the WHO website at www.who.int/peh-emf.

There has been an increase of almost 8,000 nurses and midwives entering pre-registration training between 1996&#150;97 and 2002&#150;03, a 53 per cent, increase. Latest figures suggest a further increase of around 1,800 nurses and midwives entering pre-registration training in 2003&#150;04.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health whether the NHS is able to provide mercury-free whooping cough vaccine for babies in the UK.  [167768]</p>








<p><a name="40510w53.html_spnew5"><b> Miss Melanie Johnson: </b> 
 The United Kingdom uses a wholecell containing whooping cough vaccine (which contains thiomersal) because this vaccine offers the best protection against the disease. Whooping cough is a serious disease in young babies that can lead to death. The acellular whooping cough vaccine (which is thiomersal-free) does not provide the same high level of protection. The UK will move to thiomersal-free vaccines as soon as an equally effective alternative to the current vaccine becomes available.
