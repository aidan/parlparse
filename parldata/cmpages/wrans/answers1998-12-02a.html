Exercise (RAE). I welcome the recognition by the higher education funding bodies, in their planning for the next RAE to be held in 2001, of the importance of ensuring that the arrangements for making submissions do not deter research collaboration. The funding bodies are currently considering further how to facilitate the submission of collaborative research in the RAE in the light of recent consultation on this and other issues.

<a name="81202w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Mudie: </B> 
 DfEE commissioned a three-year evaluation of the effectiveness of Investors in People which was carried out by the Institute for Employment Studies at the University of Sussex. The following reports were published: "Evaluation of Investors in People in England and Wales" (1994); "Evaluation of Investors in People in England and Wales, 1994-1995" (1995); and "The Return on Investors" (1996). All are available in the House of Commons Library. A review of the Management Charter Initiative was carried out for DfEE by DTZ Pieda Consulting and published as DfEE Research Report 67 in July 1998. It is also available in the Commons Library. Management Standards and NVQs were included in a review of all NVQs and SVQs which took place from 1996 to 1998 and identified improvements needed for SMEs which will be fed back to the relevant lead bodies and awarding bodies.
<P>

<a name="81202w01.html_para2">DfEE has not commissioned any research specifically into the take-up of competence-based management qualifications in SMEs, although gaining of qualifications by owner-managers of SMEs was included in a report for the Department on small firms' training needs, practices and difficulties by Professor James Curran <i>et al</i>. This was published in 1996 in DfEE's Research Studies series and is available in the House of Commons Library.
<P>

<a name="81202w01.html_para3">MCI (on behalf of DfEE and DTI) commissioned a review of research by Durham University Business School into the role of management development in the growth of high growth SMEs which was published in 1997. SMEs were also included in two research studies published by DfEE: "The business benefits of competence-based management development" by J and R Winterton (Research Studies 16, 1996) and "Evaluation of the business benefits of management development" by DTZ Pieda Consulting (Research Report 66, 1998). Both reports are in the Library.

 <i>[holding answer 27 November 1998]:</i> Regional statistics on the concessionary television licence scheme do not distinguish between pensioners and other beneficiaries, or according to the criteria under which individuals qualify.

 <i>[holding answer 1 December 1998]:</i> The BBC has statutory responsibility for the administration and enforcement of the television licensing system. TV Licensing, which carries out the day to day administration and enforcement as agent for the Corporation, adopts all appropriate measures to minimise evasion throughout the United Kingdom. Standard enforcement procedures are complemented by targeting pre-determined areas for higher levels of enforcement activity. It is contrary to TV Licensing's policy to publish details of areas due to be targeted; to do so would give comfort to evaders in other parts of the country.

<P>

(3) Includes clearance of anti-personnel landmines and other unexploded ordnance.<P>

<P>

(4) DFID has not funded commercial mine clearance. There are no records of UK commercial demining activities currently available in Department of Trade and Industry.<P>

<P>

(5) Activities funded from Ministry of Defence (MOD) budget. Military initiative Mine Clearance since 1992 has taken place only in Bosnia, where it is a part of the wider military operation since November 1992. Activities have including training and supervision of mine clearance programmes (conducted by the Entity Armed Forces) as well as the provision of Mine Awareness training to over 15,000 school children. The MOD has also continued to monitor and maintain the minefields in the Falkland Islands. Again, this work is one part of the duties of those involved and it would not be possible to cost it.<P>

<P>

(6) MOD-funded applied research into military clearance technology has increase significantly over the past three years and is expected to remain high for the next five years at least. The department currently spends approximately &#163;3m per annum on research into counter-mine technologies. The MOD does not have a remit to fund research into purely humanitarian demining, as opposed to operation de-mining (which has differing requirements); however, it is only comparatively late in a programme that the specific utility of a technology is identified. A separate focal point of post-conflict mine clearance research has been established at the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency's (DERA) facilities at Chertsey in Surrey to complement the research being conducted in support of operational mine clearance.<P>

<P>

(7) Includes integrated mine awareness activities.<P>

<a name="81202w04.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Meale: </B> 
 The import and export of waste are governed by European Council Regulation (EEC) No. 259-93, the 'waste shipments' Regulation. PVC is included on the Regulation's Green list of wastes which do not require prior authorisation when traded for recovery, providing they are not contaminated with hazardous substances. There is no evidence that either clean, uncontaminated PVC waste or recovered PVC products are harmful to human health or the environment. There are therefore currently no plans to prohibit the import of such waste or products recovered from it.

 Railtrack allocates train paths in accordance with access rights which the operators hold and with the operators' bids for paths. Railtrack is also responsible for the national timetable. Railtrack will retain these responsibilities when the shadow Strategic Rail Authority is established next Spring. However, we envisage that the new organisation will assess at a strategic level network capacity, future demand and the balance between passenger and freight operations.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what action he is taking to help prevent the extinction of <i>(a)</i> the Tibetan antelope and <i>(b)</i> the gold snub-nosed monkey.  [61900]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81202w05.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Meale: </B> 
 The Tibetan Antelope (<i>Panthalops hodgsonii</i>) and the Golden Snub-nosed Monkey (<i>Pygathrix roxellana</i>) are listed on Appendix 1 of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) and Annex A of the EC Wildlife Trade Regulation which implements CITES within the European Union. International trade in these species is effectively banned. However, there is evidence that illegal trafficking in Tibetan Antelopes' wool (shahtoosh) is linked to smuggling in products from another Appendix 1, and critically endangered, species--the tiger. Last year the Metropolitan Police seized 138 shahtoosh shawls from a shop in Mayfair, the biggest seizure in the world so far. In October this year, my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister received further information about this illegal trade during his visit to China. Next year, as Chair of the CITES Standing Committee, the UK will lead a mission to tiger range states and consumer countries to assist all concerned in their efforts to crack down on illegal trade by strengthening enforcement, raising public awareness of the threats to these species and gathering further information useful in tackling international wildlife crime.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what plans he has to amend the United Kingdom Management Plan for Exports and Imports of Waste.  [62524]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81202w05.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The UK policies on exports and imports of waste are set out in the "United Kingdom Management Plan for Exports and Imports of waste", which was published on 16 May 1996. The Plan came into effect on 1 June 1996.
<P>

<a name="81202w05.html_para0">Under the Plan, imports of waste from European Community Member States, with the exception of Ireland and Portugal, for disposal by high temperature incineration are being progressively phased out under an annual quota. This arrangement is intended to allow Member States time to develop their own high temperature incineration facilities, and is consistent with the long-standing United Kingdom policy that developed countries should be self-sufficient in disposing of their own waste. The quota is due to expire on 31 May 1999.




<P>
<P><I>2 Dec 1998 : Column: 185</I><P>

<P>

<a name="81202w05.html_para1">The Government have received a request from the high temperature incineration industry to extend the quota by at least a year. After careful consideration of the industry's representations, the Government have decided not to extend the quota. Any such extension of the quota would undermine the UK policy on self-sufficiency in waste disposal by developed countries.
<P>

<a name="81202w05.html_para2">However, it has become apparent that the Plan requires clarification on one minor, but important, point. There is, at present, an apparent inconsistency over whether waste imported under the quota needs to be disposed of, or simply imported into the UK, by 31 May 1999. The Government intend to clarify the situation by confirming that the waste must arrive at the appropriate disposal facility by 31 May 1999. This carries no cost implications.
<P>

<a name="81202w05.html_para3">My Department has therefore today published, for consultation, details of the proposed change. Copies of the consultation paper have been placed in the Library of both Houses.

 No member country has proposed to NATO that it adopt a policy of No First Use of nuclear weapons. In conducting the Strategic Defence Review we concluded that such a policy would be incompatible with our and NATO's doctrine of deterrence, and that it would not further nuclear disarmament. We see no need to change NATO nuclear policy as expressed in the Alliance Strategic Concept.

 The Ministry of Defence funds research into defence against both chemical and biological warfare agents at the Chemical and Biological Defence Sector of the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency at Porton Down. The information sought is not readily available in the format requested, but in the current financial year, the total expenditure on chemical and biological defence research is estimated at &#163;33.6m. This research is focused solely towards providing UK armed forces with safe and effective protection against the effects of chemical and biological warfare agents.

 There has in the past been no Defence Diversification budget as such. Funding for my Department's research programme is provided for military purposes, although the resultant technologies can often have civil benefits. The modest costs arising from the creation of the Defence Diversification Agency at the end of this month will therefore be a departure from past practice, which we hope will enable the more widespread exploitation of our technology in the civil sector.

 As we announced on 16 November 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>326</i>, the estimated operating budget of the Defence Diversification Agency is expected to be some &#163;2 million a year. Accordingly, a sum of &#163;400,000 has been set aside to cover the costs of the Agency from its creation at the end of this month to the end of the current financial year.

<a name="81202w07.html_spnew0"><B> Kate Hoey: </B> 
 There are two ways in which a person may be brought back to face criminal charges. The United Kingdom's extradition arrangements with most European countries are governed by the European Convention on Extradition. Where a person living in a Convention country stands accused in the United Kingdom of an extraditable offence, there is provision for an extradition request to be made. If the request is granted, the person concerned will be surrendered to stand trial in this country.
<P>

<a name="81202w07.html_para0">Provision also exists for the voluntary repatriation to this country of convicted prisoners serving sentences in European Community countries. Such transfers take place in accordance with the provisions of the Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons, and the Repatriation of Prisoners Act 1984.

<P>
<P>
<a name="81202w07.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 Around &#163;11,850,000 has so far been paid to claimants under Option C of the compensation scheme for large-calibre handguns and the ex-gratia payment scheme for small-calibre pistols. No payments have yet been made under Option C of the separate statutory compensation scheme for small-calibre pistols. The final total of Option C payments will not be known until all claims have been examined, but we expect this to be contained within the overall compensation figure of around &#163;120 million previously announced.

 As we have made clear in the past, we have decided to implement Part V of the Police Act 1997 and to establish the necessary arrangements to issue the three forms of certificate provided for under the Act. The timetable for implementation will be influenced by the very large number of certificates likely to be required. We are therefore giving careful consideration to the phasing in of certificates with priority given to the protection of children.

<a name="81202w08.html_para2">I announced in July, following the Government's Comprehensive Spending Review, that spending overall on the police service in England and Wales would be increased by &#163;1.24 billion in the years 1999-2002. The increases will be 2.67 per cent. in 1999-2000, up to a further 2.8 per cent. in 2000-01, and up to an extra 4 per cent. in 2001-02. These sums represent a real terms' increase, albeit small, in police spending, as explained in my reply to the right hon.

The principal changes I propose are: <i>(a)</i> to reduce from 20 per cent. to 10 per cent. the share of funding allocated on the basis of forces' past establishments; and <i>(b)</i> to increase from 13.2 per cent. to 14.5 per cent. the proportion of funding allocated on the basis of forces' pensions commitments.
<P>

<a name="81202w08.html_para5">I am proposing that the Metropolitan Police should continue to receive additional funding in recognition of its distinct national and capital city functions. It has proved very difficult for the principal formula appropriately to take account of these special circumstances. I have proposed, therefore, that a special payment of grant will be made to the Metropolitan Police over and above that available through the principal formula. I have set the amount of this special payment at &#163;176 million.
<P>

<a name="81202w08.html_para6">In addition, I am proposing to make special payments of grant to the following police authorities in 1999-2000 in recognition of the additional costs which will be incurred in preparation for the proposed changes to the Metropolitan Police District boundaries:

<P>

<a name="81202w08.html_para7">Other police funding proposals within the local government finance system are being announced today by my right hon. Friends the Deputy Prime Minister and Secretary of State for Wales. These proposals, and mine, would increase Total Standard Spending on the police in England and Wales by 2.67 per cent. or around &#163;186 million over 1998-99.
<P>

<a name="81202w08.html_para8">The settlement also takes account of my commitment to improve police efficiency. I have set a target of 2 per cent. efficiency gains year on year for the police service from 1999-2000. By achieving these targets, police authorities can re-invest the savings to help meet front-line priorities.
<P>

<a name="81202w08.html_para9">Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and the Audit Commission have published extensive advice to chief officers and to police authorities on many ways in which the efficiency and effectiveness of the police service can be improved within available resources. A detailed circular on this from my Department has recently been issued which, among other subjects, gives guidance

on savings to be secured in the areas of training, estate management, procurement, sickness and early retirements on medical grounds.
<P>

<a name="81202w08.html_para10">Over the next three years, the Government will also be spending &#163;250 million on their targeted crime reduction programme, &#163;217 million on tackling drugs and &#163;85 million on the Youth Justice Board's development fund.
<P>

<a name="81202w08.html_para11">The Government have already announced their decision to abolish crude and universal capping of local authorities from April 1999. In previous years, the Government have announced capping limits on police authority spending at the time of provisional funding settlement. No such limits are being set for next year. Nevertheless, I expect police authorities in England and Wales to set budgets which are prudent and reasonable, and which do not impose an excessive increase in council tax next year. We shall be monitoring the position carefully.
<P>

<a name="81202w08.html_para12">The effect of my proposals for each police authority for 1999-2000 is set out in the table. It also shows the allocation approved by Parliament for 1998-99.

<P>
<P>
<a name="81202w09.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The police have a specific role under the confiscation legislation in conducting asset tracing investigations, and under the money laundering legislation in receiving reports of suspicious transactions from financial institutions and other sources. Suspicious transaction reports are normally made to the Economic Crime Unit at the National Criminal Intelligence Service, while every police force in England and Wales has a Financial Investigation Unit, responsible for identifying assets for confiscation and investigating suspected money laundering. Information on the cost of this activity to individual forces is not available and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost. However, the costs borne by the police and other relevant authorities in implementing confiscation powers will be one of the factors to be included in the study which the Government plan to initiate of the possibility of establishing a confiscation agency.

<a name="81202w09.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 Applications for entry clearance have been received from Ms Sally Becker of Operation Angel for a total of 91 individuals, a third of which are in respect of children needing medical treatment. They have been referred to the Home Office from the British Embassy in Tirana.
<P>

<a name="81202w09.html_para1">The applications fell to be considered under the Immigration Rules relating to persons seeking to enter the United Kingdom as visitors for private medical treatment or simply as visitors. Under these Rules, we have to be satisfied, among other requirements, that there is satisfactory evidence about the medical condition and its treatment, that the person will be able to maintain and accommodate himself or herself and any dependants without recourse to public funds and that the person intends to leave the United Kingdom at the end of the period of the treatment or visit. In the absence of satisfactory evidence from Operation Angel or any other source, we were certainly not satisfied that these requirements were met in the applications.
<P>

<a name="81202w09.html_para2">We considered whether there were grounds for treating the application son a discretionary basis outside the Immigration Rules, but concluded that it would not be appropriate to do so. In reaching this decision, we took account of the fact that Ms Becker had not taken Government advice and guidance on how to bring such an evacuation within the recognised official procedures: she had not demonstrated the option of local treatment through the international agencies and had not made a proper case on medical grounds. We were also aware that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for International Development has in place a humanitarian strategy for former Yugoslavia (including Kosovo) and Albania. Furthermore, in the absence of adequate guarantees of funding from Operation Angel, we had to take account of the likely cost to the taxpayer in the almost certain event of recourse to public funds which, for a group of this size, would be of the order of &#163;400,000 a year. We accordingly decided to refuse the applications. Ms Becker was notified of this decision by the British Embassy in Tirana on Friday 13 November.

 "Adoption--Achieving the Right Balance" was published on 28 August 1998 under Local Authority Circular (98)20 and addressed to members and directors of local authorities and directors of voluntary adoption societies. The guidance raised a number of important issues for improving the adoption service including better strategic planning, avoiding delay in placing children for adoption and the introduction of measures to avoid children drifting in the care system. This guidance was prepared as part of our initiative "quality protects"; within this context therefore, we will be working closely with local authorities for the improvement of services for children, including adoption. The Department will monitor progress carefully to ensure that effective measures for achieving improvements have been introduced.

<P>
<P>
<a name="81202w11.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 Bilateral adoption agreements are essentially formal arrangements to enable citizens of the United Kingdom to adopt children from countries overseas meeting the requirements of the United Kingdom and the particular country concerned. Agreements are proposed by the Department in regard to countries which have little experience of intercountry adoption, with the aim of ensuring that the Department submits applications only for prospective adopters approved by the proper authorities in the UK. Also, the UK responds to requests for an adoption agreement where a country makes it a condition absolute before UK citizens are permitted to apply to adopt children from that country.

<a name="81202w11.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Milburn: </B> 
 In its consideration of overseas adoption applications which are supported by a local authority or approved intercountry adoption agency, the Department, acting on advice of the Social Services Directorate, applies the same standards and criteria as are applied for domestic applications.

 Epilim and other anticonvulsant drugs, as for all marketed medicines, are assessed by the Department to determine their safety for use by pregnant women. Available relevant research is assessed at the time of granting a Marketing Authorisation for a product and continues to be evaluated on an ongoing basis by the Medicines Control Agency. Risks to the foetus are recognised for anticonvulsant therapies and information about whether and how to use medicines in pregnant patients can be found in the authorised product information for health professionals and patients. The risks of loss of epileptic control need to be weighed against the risks to the foetus of these treatments. General prescribing advice on the use of antiepileptic therapy in pregnancy can be found in the British National Formulary.

 The Department has been supporting, in part, the United Kingdom childhood cancer study, which is expected to report next year. This large study is designed to investigate childhood cancer in relation to various possible causes including exposure to electric and magnetic fields. The Department is also funding a complementary study co-ordinated by the childhood cancer research group, in Oxford, investigating cancer incidence near power lines. Other work being supported by the Department are at Bristol University, on the effect of electric fields on pollutant aerosols, and a laboratory study at Brunel University. The Department is also contributing to the World Health Organisation electromagnetic fields project.

Board (NRPB). The NRPB's advisory group on non- ionising radiation conducted an extensive review of the subject in 1992 and concluded that there was no firm evidence of a carcinogenic hazard from exposure that might be associated with residence near major sources of electricity supply. The Committee on Medical Aspects of Radiation in the Environment has endorsed the advisory group's report. Supplementary reports in 1993 and 1994 were published by the NRPB to take into account the results of new epidemiological studies from Scandinavia, France and Canada. Copies of the advisory group's report and the supplementary documents are available in the Library. A further comprehensive review by the advisory group is under way and will be published on completion of the UK childhood cancer study.

 The Medicines Control Agency will review its Guidance Leaflet (Medicines Act Leaflet 8: "A Guide to What is a Medicinal Product") to reflect any changes to medicines legislation which are approved by Parliament following the conclusion of its present consultation exercise on proposals to place the classification process for "borderline products" on a statutory basis.

 When notifying a manufacturer that it has determined a product is a medicine because it is presented for treating or preventing disease, the Medicines Control Agency requires compliance with the law by withdrawal of the product.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health by what criteria the Medicines Control Agency assesses whether a blend of herbs and vitamins is medicinal by <i>(a)</i> function and <i>(b)</i> presentation; and if a manufacturer whose products are so assessed is given a written statement of the reasons for that decision.  [61638]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81202w12.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 The Medicines Control Agency (MCA) assesses products against the definition of a medicinal product in European Commission and United Kingdom law. It also has regard to legal precedent and its own published guidance (Leaflet MAL 8: "A Guide to What is a Medicinal Product"). Broadly, the assessment of a product's functionality focuses on the pharmacological effect of its ingredient(s) on human physiology, while the assessment of a product's presentation considers a whole range of factors, including any claims made for the product in promotional material or on its labelling and packaging (whether explicit or implied), its name, the form, and the consumers targeted. The MCA also considers the opinion of the product's purpose an averagely well informed consumer would gain from its ingredient(s) and presentation. It is normal practice for the MCA to explain to the manufacturer the grounds for a classification decision.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health if the Medicines Control Agency consults independent scientific experts when considering whether a herb and vitamin blend is medicinal by function; and if the manufacturer of such a product is able to have access to expert advice obtained by the agency.  [61637]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81202w12.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 The Medicines Control Agency (MCA) generally relies on the objective and expert advice of its own medical and pharmaceutical assessors. However, there are occasions when taking advice from external experts is appropriate. The MCA informs manufacturers of the impact of expert advice when classifying their products.

 There are no comprehensive data on the number of people with asthma. Asthma is estimated to affect 4 per cent. of adults and between 4 and 6 per cent. of children sufficiently severely to require medical supervision. Information is not available centrally on the rates of asthma in West Sussex and Hillingdon health authorities, which cover Gatwick and Heathrow airports respectively.

 I propose to make &#163;359.0 million available from total standard spending in Wales to fund police services in 1999-2000. This sum comprises &#163;180.7 million in cash-limited police grant, to be paid by my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary, and &#163;178.3 million in standard spending assessments (SSA).

Quarantine would be retained for cats and dogs coming into the UK from other countries. The Government are sympathetic to these recommendations.
<P>

<a name="81202w15.html_para0">The Advisory Group recommended that further consideration be given to the risks arising from allowing cats and dogs from North America into Great Britain without undergoing quarantine. This study is underway.
<P>

<a name="81202w15.html_para1">The Government will propose a specific way forward on the matters covered by the Advisory Group's report after the public consultation on the Advisory Group's recommendations ends on 31 December 1998.

 There are currently five antimicrobial growth promoters permitted by EC legislation for use in poultry or chickens for fattening. They are bacitracin zinc, spiramycin, virginiamycin, flavophospholipol and avilamycin. The European Commission has proposed a ban on bacitracin zinc, spiramycin and virginiamycin with effect from 1 January 1999. The proposal is due to be considered in the Commission's Standing Committee on Animal Nutrition today.

<P>
<P>
<a name="81202w15.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Macdonald: </B> 
 Seed and planting stock of many indigenous tree species, including oak, have been imported into Britain from continental Europe for several centuries. Much of this material is well adapted to British conditions with the result that it can be very difficult to identify trees which are truly of native origin. Scientists are developing methods for identifying the origin of indigenous species. For example, analysis of the chemical constituents of native Scots pine has identified seven distinct areas of pine in Scotland.
<P>

<a name="81202w15.html_para3">Our advice to woodland owners reflects the importance of using suitable seed sources for planting trees in Britain, and particularly for regenerating and extending semi- natural woodlands. The UK Forestry Standard states that landowners should use suitable local provenances if they are available, and the Forestry Commission has published guidelines which emphasise the value of using natural regeneration or plants derived from local seed sources. The Commission is also drawing up a scheme to encourage foresters to grow planting stock from locally sourced indigenous species of trees and shrubs.

 Under the repairs grant system local authorities may give assistance at up to 90 per cent. of the cost of works to home owners replacing lead plumbing. It is for authorities to set their own budgets for repairs grants and decide the priority they give to lead pipe replacement. As regards council housing, it is for local authorities as landlords to determine their priorities for works to their own stock.

<P>
<a name="81202w16.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Macdonald: </B> 
 The exact information requested is not held centrally and could be collected only at disproportionate cost. However, the water authorities estimate that the total value of reliefs given on water and sewerage charges in 1997-98 in Scotland was some &#163;14 million.

<P>
<P>
<a name="81202w16.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Macdonald: </B> 
 The water authorities are responsible for developing appropriate charging arrangements. Each of the authorities has recently completed consulting its non-domestic customers about proposals to alter the basis of charges to reflect more closely the level of services actually used rather than using rateable values as a proxy for use. Following this exercise the water authorities concluded that there is overall support in favour of a change to the charging basis. Each is now discussing the

<P><I>2 Dec 1998 : Column: 222</I><P>
detailed implementation of changes for their area with Scottish Water and Sewerage Customers Council. Domestic properties are unaffected by this proposal.
<P>

<a name="81202w16.html_para0">Overall, the new arrangements will not alter the total income raised from the non-domestic sector, though its distribution amongst customers will be affected. The water authorities propose to phase in the changeover to ensure that individual chargepayers have sufficient time to adjust to the new arrangements.
<P>

<a name="81202w16.html_para1">Given that there will be no reduction in income to the water authorities and that the impact on chargepayers will be phased in, there is no case for giving financial assistance to the water authorities.

<P>
<P>
<a name="81202w17.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Macdonald: </B> 
 One of the targets which we set for the Scottish Environment Protection Agency was to improve the level of consent compliance for sewage and industrial discharges to 80 per cent. by 2001-02. A copy of the Agency's Annual Report 1997-98 has been placed in the Library of the Houses of Parliament. As mentioned in their report, the Agency achieved that level of compliance in 1997-98, four years ahead of target. The Agency are to be congratulated on this achievement. However, it is clear that a minority of SEPA's other targets were not met. This is certainly disappointing and we have asked the Agency how they intend to improve performance in these areas.

<P>
<P>
<a name="81202w17.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Macdonald: </B> 
 In November 1997, the Government issued a consultation paper entitled 'Economic Instruments for Water Pollution'. One of the options on which the consultation paper sought views was a possible tax or charge on pesticides.
<P>

<a name="81202w17.html_para0">Research is currently underway into whether a tax or charge on pesticides would be an effective way to reduce pollution. There is evidence to suggest that pesticides have harmful effects on wildlife, terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, and on human health. The Government are committed to minimising their use. The current research study is focusing on various design options for a tax or charge.
<P>

<a name="81202w17.html_para1">The Government will evaluate the findings of the research, and the results of other on-going work, in considering how best to proceed.
<P>

 My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary described the outcome of the Comprehensive Spending Review (CSR) in his speech during the foreign affairs debate on 27 November 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, column 443. In essence, the uplift in the FCO budget will allow a significant programme of reform to modernise FCO operations world-wide. The aim is to adapt the network of overseas posts in response to changing priorities and to deploy staff and resources so as best to meet future objectives. 200 more members of the Diplomatic Service will be appointed; and 375 more staff in total.
<P>

<a name="81202w17.html_para3">The distribution of staff will reflect foreign policy priorities, particularly in commercial work. A further eight new overseas posts have been approved; commercial representation in China, Japan, India and Sweden will be strengthened; five Posts will close where the resources could be better deployed elsewhere. Britain's representation in the Caspian region will increase by 50 per cent., and be augmented significantly in member states of the EU and in countries aspiring to join the EU and NATO.

<a name="81202w18.html_para4">We were very disturbed by the execution of Mr. Rawhani in July. The FCO Regional Director for the Middle East, summoned the Iranian Charge on 28 July to protest. I myself saw Barney Leith, Secretary-General for the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is in the UK on 5 August to express the Government's condolences about the execution of Mr. Rawhani and to discuss what more we could do to maintain international pressure on the Iranian Government to end the discrimination against the Baha'i community. Later that same day I tackled the Iranian Charge on Mr. Rawhani's execution. I also warned him that we would be strong in our condemnation if there were further executions. The EU also reacted, including by a formal demarche to the Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Tehran on 5 August. Some EU partners followed our example by summoning local Iranian diplomatic representatives to protest.
