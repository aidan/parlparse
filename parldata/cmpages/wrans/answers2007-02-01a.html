<a name="70201w0005.htm_brev0"><a name="07020145001634"><ul><p class="tabletext">1. In marshalling HSE&#146;s inspection resource, HSE seeks to target poor performers. The key criteria in establishing the frequency of inspections are the risks presented by particular duty holders, premises or industries and the ability and willingness of duty holders to manage those risks. Where the risk is low and duty holders&#146; ability high, visits are less frequent than where the risk is high and duty holders are failing to manage those risks. In targeting the inspection resource in this way, HSE believes it has the greatest impact on reducing work-related deaths, injuries and ill health.</p>
</ul><a name="70201w0005.htm_brev1"><a name="07020145001635"><ul><p class="tabletext">2. In 2003, HSE ceased to set targets for the number of inspection contacts. Such targets encouraged short visits to low risk places, whereas the Health and Safety Commission&#146;s strategy for workplace health and safety 2010 sought a sharper focus on injury and ill health priorities, and more substantial contacts with a carefully selected range of duty holders. Over the last five years or so, the actual time HSE inspectors have spent interacting with and encouraging duty holders has increased by 23 per cent.</p>
</ul><a name="70201w0005.htm_brev2"><a name="07020145001636"><ul><p class="tabletext">3. Important as inspection is, the frequency of inspections is not a particularly useful metric. The Health and Safety Commission&#146;s strategy fully recognises the importance of inspection, and the threat of enforcement, as a powerful motivator for improved standards. But to be most effective, they need to sit alongside other interventions, such as encouraging partnership working, communications, and so on.</p>

The risks are for the most part well known (including those associated with laboratory work with hazardous chemicals), well understood, well managed and there are well-established networks and institutions for their management. In line with the approach set out in the aforementioned paragraphs 1-3, HSE has therefore no general proactive inspection programme.</p>

A significant number of schools are known to have under-reported the situation. The Department has carried out checking exercises in each year to confirm the overall number of permanent exclusions. However, this only confirmed the number of exclusions in each local authority area and did not include information on the characteristics (such as SEN provision and ethnic group) of the excluded pupil. Figures provided in this response relating to permanent exclusions are as reported by schools and are known to be incomplete. The data are not sufficiently reliable or robust to provide detailed ethnic breakdowns by SEN provision.</p>

Under the scheme, the police can issue an 80 fixed penalty for a number of fireworks offences under the Explosives Act 1875 and Fireworks Act 2003. The offence of throwing fireworks in a thoroughfare (Explosives Act) came into force in August 2002: the offences of breach of the fireworks curfew, possession of category four fireworks, and possession by a person under 18 of an adult firework (Fireworks Act) were added to the PND Scheme on 11 October 2004. The following table shows the number of PNDs that were issued in the Leicestershire police force area for 2005 and for January to June 2006 (provisional); complete figures for 2006 will be available in the spring of 2007. We are unable to give the number of PNDs issued in Leicester during the above period, as data are not collected to that level of detail.</p>

It was found to lack specificity when compared with other techniques. The need for high magnetic fields and problems with commonly occurring metals also mitigated against its use. More recently, MRI has been looked at to examine liquid explosives. This system used the Earth&#146;s field and was consequently very slow in its operation. An analogous technique, quadrupole resonance analysis, has been developed for detecting explosives containing nitrogen and systems are available commercially.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_521"><a name="70201w0022.htm_para18"><a name="07020159001821">Additionally, magnetic resonance imaging is currently being considered as an alternative to using a polygraph, or, more probably, to use MRI scanning as an input to a polygraph to detect deception. Home Office scientists will be visiting King&#146;s College London shortly to discuss the possibility of using MRI in this role.</p>

 1. 2005 and 2006 percentages have been estimated using Office for National Statistics 2004 mid-year population estimates based on the 2001 Census as these are the latest available.<br>
 2. PDS schemes had varying registration periods. To ensure comparability with corresponding GDS data, PDS registrations were estimated using proxy registrations, namely the number of patients seen by PDS practices in the previous 15 months. PDS proxy registrations were not estimated for periods before September 2003, actual registrations were used before this date.<br>
 3. Data for 2003 and earlier do not include those PDS schemes that did not have any registrations, such as dental access centres, and are therefore not directly comparable with later data.<br>
 4. The data for the year ending March 2006 are the final data on registrations. Under the new arrangements for primary dental care services, the measure used as a proxy for access is no longer registrations but the numbers of patients seen within the most recent 24-month period.<br>
