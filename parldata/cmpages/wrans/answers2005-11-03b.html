</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0">Thank you for your letter of 29 July to the Prime Minister enclosing a postcard from your constituent about Tearfund&#039;s &quot;HIV/AIDS and Children&quot; campaign. I am responding as the Minister who leads on the issues raised.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1">It is a terrible human catastrophe and presents an unprecedented challenge to the developing world and to the eradication of poverty. The cost in terms of human life and economic burden on national governments, communities and families is enormous. Women and young people, including the rising number of orphans are particularly vulnerable.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_2">The Government is taking action. Last year we published &quot;Taking Action&#151;the UK&#039;s strategy for tackling HIV and AIDS in the developing world&quot;, and committed at least &#163;1.5 billion to tackling HIV and AIDS over the next three years. Of this, at least &#163;150 million will go into supporting orphans and children made vulnerable by HIV and AIDS. The UK was one of the first countries to endorse UNICEF&#039;s &quot;Strategic Framework for the Protection, Care and Support of Orphans and Children Made Vulnerable by HIV/AIDS&quot;.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_3">DFID is working directly with national governments to support the development and implementation of national programmes for the support and care of children affected. In Mozambique we have given funding to help the Government properly track its programmes for orphans and vulnerable children to ensure that aid reaches the children that need it most. In Kenya we are directly supporting community based organisations to help them deliver home based care services, including to children affected by AIDS.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_4">We are investigating the best ways to build systems that provide support to vulnerable children and their families, possibly in the form of monthly child or family allowances. This will simplify the tracking of funds from government budgets to the poorest families. The cash received through these transfers enables families and communities to make their own decisions about the best way to improve their livelihoods and care for their children. Another important area in which we are investing is the health of children living with HIV. For example we have supported trials of a cheap and widely available drug (co-trimoxazole) which have shown that it can halve the death rate for HIV infected children in Africa. We are also supporting a new research programme to assess how to provide antiretroviral treatment for children in resource-constrained settings</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_5">Monitoring development expenditure by category, as your campaign highlights, is an area where all of us, the international community, donor organisations and national governments can all do better. DFID has recently introduced a new system to enable us to better monitor our support for orphans and vulnerable children, Activities which will be recorded include special programmes for children made vulnerable by AIDS, cash transfers to vulnerable families, exemption from school fees and help with food.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_6">DFID also believes that monitoring and evaluation are crucial with regards to other financing instruments such as the Global Fund to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (GFATM).

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_7">We are delighted to be co-hosting with UNICEF, later this year, the Global Partnership Forum on children affected by AIDS. We anticipate that this Forum will examine how funding can better reach community based organisations. Bottlenecks that prevent funding getting to those most in need must be identified and unlocked We see this as a crucial part of the wider efforts at &quot;Making the Money Work&quot;&#151;a process being led by UNAIDS to ensure greater harmonisation and co-ordination alongside the additional resources now being made available to tackle HIV and AIDS The steps we are taking are a start, but there is much still for all of us to do.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department pursuant to the answer of 20 July 2005, <i>Official Report</i>, column 1781W, on domestic violence, on what frequency surveys are conducted to gauge the level of interpersonal violence suffered by <i>(a)</i> children and <i>(b)</i> adults over 60 years; and what steps are taken to ensure comparability between the results obtained in each such survey.  [18790]</p>




<p><a name="st_3"><a name="51103w05.html_spnew3"><b> Hazel Blears: </b> 
 The Home Office currently assesses violence against children aged under 16 through the Offending, Crime and Justice Survey part of which measures victimisation of children aged 10 to 15, including assaults with and without injury. The results on victimisation from the 2003 survey have been published (see findings 246) and data will also be available from further sweeps of the survey in 2004, 2005 and 2006.

<p>

<a name="stpa_2">The British Crime Survey (BCS) measures levels of violence against adults (ages 16 and over) living in private households, and as part of its core measures includes domestic violence. Risks of domestic violence are published annually by age group for men and women, including ages 45&#150;64, 65&#150;74 and 75 and over. 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>3 Nov 2005 : Column 1253W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
The British Crime Survey is conducted on a continuous basis, having used the same essential methodology since it began in 1982 to ensure comparability over time.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51103w05.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_3">However, it is recognised that the core BCS measure of domestic violence is likely to be an underestimate as some victims may be unwilling to report experience of domestic violence to an interviewer. The special self-completion module on interpersonal violence (which measures domestic violence, sexual assault and stalking) is not asked of respondents aged 60 and over. The issue of &quot;elder abuse&quot; in common with child abuse is better explored using dedicated surveys.

Training requirements for staff are subject to &quot;in house&quot; arrangements at the NSPCC and would not fall under the jurisdiction of the DfES.

Local authorities purchasing work from the NSPCC would also need to quality assure that work.

 Assigning police officers to foot/car/beat patrol and the duties they undertake is ultimately a matter for chief constables. My Department does work with the police service to reduce the bureaucratic burden and we are making good progress by, for example, cutting nearly 9,000 unnecessary forms; civilianising posts; rolling out the penalty notice for disorder scheme; and ensuring forces have the best scientific and technological support&#151;like video identity parades, electronic fingerprinting and the online Violent and Sex Offender&#039;s Register&#151;so that our police spend more time actually in communities, tackling crime and antisocial behaviour and reassuring the public. The Frontline Policing Measure shows that in 2004&#150;05 Thames Valley police officers spent an average of 69.3 per cent. of their time on frontline duties compared with the national average of 64.1 per cent.

Landowners and agricultural tenants have the discretion to exclude or restrict the new right for up to 28-days each year, for any reason. They may also apply for restrictions or closures where necessary for land management, safety or fire prevention purposes. In addition, we have established a national access management grant scheme to help local authorities, land managers and communities manage open access in their areas proactively.

The majority of the other provisions in Part II of the Act are aimed at better delivery of existing goals for the rights of way network under current legislation and place few new burdens on farmers.

<p><a name="st_132"><a name="51103w16.html_spnew5"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 DFID recognises that social transfers could have an important role to play in reducing chronic poverty in very poor countries. DFID has recently published a paper entitled: &quot;Social transfers and chronic poverty: emerging evidence and the challenge ahead.&quot; The paper describes how social transfers have helped tackle poverty in many better off developing countries and suggests that they may have a similar impact in very poor countries. It recognises that there are significant challenges to implementing social transfer programmes in countries with weak institutional capacity but suggests that these are not insurmountable.

<a name="stpa_109">DFID is working with a number of governments in very poor countries to develop a better understanding of the potential role that social transfers could play in tackling chronic poverty.

DFID has committed &#163;70 million over three years to support a safety net programme for five million chronically poor people in Ethiopia that

<a name="stpa_162">These changes represent a significant expansion of dental student intake targets from 576 to 837, and have enabled actual undergraduate dental numbers to increase by 170. The Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) and Department of Health are currently in the process of assessing bids to make permanent arrangements for the temporary allocations, and will make recommendations to the HEFCE Board in January. HEFCE and the Department for Health intend to inform institutions of the Board&#039;s decision early in the new year, and will be assessing the need for further expansion in dental places in the lead up to the next Comprehensive Spending Review.

 The Department for Education and Skills is working with The Department for Work and Pensions, The Department for Trade and Industry and Her Majesty&#039;s Treasury to develop a package of measures that are known collectively as new deal for skills. As announced in Budget 2004, new deal for skills is a package of measures to help people move from welfare into sustainable, productive work and help adults in employment progress from low to higher-skilled work. For those moving from welfare into work, new deal for skills comprises three main strands: Skills coaching, skills passports and the adult learning option and is jointly project managed by DfES and DWP. DfES has made available &#163;4 million in 2005&#150;06 for the development and trials of skills coaching and skills passports which are being delivered by the Learning and Skills Council to support DWP priority customers.

 The factors that influence the rate of teenage pregnancy are complex and it is difficult to be precise about the impact that a single factor&#151;such as the quality of sex and relationships education (SRE)&#151;has on individuals&#039; choices or rates of teenage pregnancy in particular locations.

<a name="51103w24.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_175">DfES further recommends that schools should teach about sex and relationships within the framework for Personal, Social and Health Education (PSHE), and in 2000 issued non-statutory guidance on SRE to help schools achieve this objective.

<i>[holding answer 31 October 2005]:</i> The Food Standards Agency (FSA) lobbied and argued strongly for a threshold of 30 months, as currently applies in the United Kingdom.

This report was passed to the European Commission as evidence that it would be disproportionate to require removal at 24 months and to other member states as part of the lobbying process.

Units of dental activity will make up the overall activity level required by an individual dental contractor in return for an agreed annual contract value, to be agreed between the dentist and the primary care trust.

<a name="stpa_199">The new system will differ from the current fee per item system, where dentists&#039; remuneration is based on each individual treatment&#151;a filling, a crown, etc. The evidence of PDS pilots, where remuneration is not based on fee per item, is that dentists provide fewer and simpler interventions within each course of treatment. This allows dentists to spend more time with patients, adopt a more preventive approach to patient care and better manage their work load.

 The Cabinet Office competence based recruitment system is designed to identify candidates with the most suitable skills and competences for the job. Candidates are asked, on their application form and at interview to give evidence of their ability to communicate effectively. Candidates are assessed on their ability to communicate effectively both verbally and in writing, and where necessary asked to provide evidence of their numeracy levels. There is also scope, within the selection system, for further testing of candidate&#039;s communication and numerical skills through verbal and numerical reasoning tests. Specifically, the Department has used the SHL VCC3 verbal evaluation test and the SHL NCC4 numerical evaluation test.

 The social fund plays an important part in helping people on the lowest incomes avoid the need to resort to high cost lenders. Significant improvements to the social fund budgeting loan scheme are being introduced in April 2006. These changes, which are being supported by an additional &#163;210 million (net) over the three years to 2008&#150;09, are intended to make loans more accessible and more affordable. The improvements include changes to the way in which existing budgeting loan debt affects an applicant&#039;s ability to take out a further loan, lower repayment rates, longer repayment periods and a major simplification of the way that the maximum loan amounts that can be offered to eligible applicants are calculated. The minimum amount an applicant can borrow as a

budgeting loan will increase from &#163;30 to &#163;100 and the maximum debt available as a combination of crisis and budgeting loans will increase from &#163;1,000 to &#163;1,500.

<p>
<a name="51103w33.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_237">It is important that people on low incomes are not penalised for saving. That is why the changes to the budgeting loan scheme will also include an increase in the capital limits. From April 2006 the amount an applicant can have in savings without it affecting their access to budgeting loans will be doubled to &#163;1,000 for working age applicants and &#163;2,000 for pensioners.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51103w33.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_238">The aim of future changes will be to ensure that the social fund is not merely a safety net in times of need but will also help people to become self-reliant and able to take control of their spending decisions. We want to ensure that reform will contribute to improving financial inclusion for those on the lowest income.

<a name="stpa_256">Prior to April 2004, each component (care and mobility) of disability living allowance was counted as a separate appeal. This practice changed from 1 April 2004, when a disability living allowance appeal was counted as one appeal, regardless of the number of components involved. The decrease in disability appeal outcomes for during 2004 reflects this change.

 At the time of the waste licensing tribunal in July 1984, Antrim borough council was the waste licensing authority for the Crosshill Quarry, Crumlin site.

 The Department of the Environment is not aware of the exact dates for the beginning and completion of the railway carriages&#039; relocation within Crosshill Quarry. The contractors intended to complete this work during November and December 2003. However, it is the Department&#039;s understanding that, once work had commenced, the weight of the waterlogged carriages necessitated cutting them into three sections to allow their movement and relocation. As a result, the work took longer than originally anticipated. Documentary and photographic evidence obtained by departmental staff during two site visits in February 2004 recorded the completion of the relocation work.

 The Department of the Environment is not currently undertaking an investigation into the dismantling of the railway carriages. The Department has carried out soil and water tests at and around the quarry and the results have shown that there is no cause for concern with regard to asbestos contamination of the surrounding area. The Health and Safety Executive for Northern Ireland has completed an investigation into the dismantling of railway carriages at Crosshill Quarry and no investigations are currently being undertaken.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland whether the Environment and Heritage Service was responsible for monitoring the dismantling of carriages at Crosshill Quarry, Crumlin; and what monitoring was carried out <i>(a)</i> before, <i>(b)</i> during and <i>(c)</i> after the railway carriages were dismantled.  [15262]</p>




<p><a name="st_309"><a name="51103w37.html_spnew4"><b> Angela E. Smith: </b> 
 The Environment and Heritage Service&#039;s water management unit visited the site, prior to and after the dismantling of the carriages. Water quality analysis has indicated that there is no cause for concern in relation to water pollution from the site. The asbestos levels detected in two of the five water samples collected in November 2004 were not of a level considered hazardous to humans to drink or to aquatic organisms. The Environment and Heritage Service&#039;s waste management and contaminated land unit did not monitor the site before 19 December 2003 as Antrim borough council was then the statutory waste licensing authority. The waste management and contaminated land unit monitored the site during February 2004 and has photographic evidence that the dismantling and reburial of the carriages had been completed. The unit also undertook detailed soil sampling of the quarry floor in February 2005 and found small quantities of white asbestos, for which remedial action was taken.
